[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, our 800th episode and he brought cake.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.700]   Renee and Alex are here too to celebrate.
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:16.500]   And while there's not a whole lot of Apple news, we will talk about teenagers who are getting bullied because of the green bubble.
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.600]   And why can't Apple make a message in a universal platform?
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.300]   South Korea finally will allow third-party payment systems on iOS.
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.900]   Is this a good idea?
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.700]   And the LA police officers who decided to play Pokemon instead of tracking down a robber.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.700]   It's all coming up next on our 800th episode.
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.700]   Let 'em eat cake.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.900]   [Music]

[00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple, which this time of year is usually the snooze from Apple.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.300]   ReneeRiches here, youtube.com/ReneeRiche.
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.300]   How do you do it as a YouTube star to keep that content flowing during these slow periods?
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.300]   Oh, I mean, somebody is always mad and somebody is always wrong.
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.300]   I mean, that's a beautiful thing.
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.300]   It's like the business publications, they have to keep their readers so they find anything they can and then...
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.300]   Yeah, they make it a...
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.300]   There's teenagers who are being bullied by iMessage.
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.300]   They're just pleased from Android executives.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.300]   It is just chock full of dramaturgals.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.300]   I actually do want to talk about that Wall Street Journal store because I like almost...
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.300]   If I had a newspaper, I would have thrown it down.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.300]   But we'll get to that in a second.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.300]   First, I have to say hello to Andy Inako.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.300]   Don't have to want to say hello to Andy Inako of WG, BH Boston, and Places East.
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.300]   Hello, everybody.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.300]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.300]   And congratulations. We are celebrating episode 800 of the Macbreak podcast.
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.300]   I did get us a cake.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.300]   Oh!
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.300]   With you.
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.300]   Blue icing. Did it say 800 on it?
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.300]   Yeah, it's on my Instagram.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.300]   I actually posted it to our Discord if you want to take a look at it.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.300]   Oh my God.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.300]   You've done more than we have.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.300]   I wasn't paying attention.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.300]   Well, also...
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.300]   Hey, I thought it was a special occasion.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.300]   And also, we've been under COVID protocols for two years.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.300]   So I haven't been to weddings or birthdays.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.300]   It's been a long time since I've had cake.
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.300]   There's been a cake deficit in your life.
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.300]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.300]   Oh, look at that. You really did.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.300]   You did go all out.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.300]   [laughter]
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.300]   And how is the cake?
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.300]   It is a beautiful golden yellow cake with thick, thick buttercream.
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.300]   I'm saving the roses for when I've given up all hope of life
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.300]   and don't matter getting like a sugar coma.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.300]   It's beautiful.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.300]   Beautiful.
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.300]   Wow.
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.300]   Is that your favorite cake bakery?
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.300]   It's a local market that has a really good bakery department.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.300]   And unfortunately, I did pay full dollar for this cake,
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.300]   but they do this really cruel thing where occasionally people will not pick up cakes
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.300]   and they will simply cut this enormous sheet cake in quarters and say,
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.300]   "Okay, here's one quarter of a huge sheet cake for $1.99."
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.300]   And I'm like, "That is a really good deal on sheet cake, and I do enjoy cake."
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.300]   [laughter]
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.300]   And a quarter of a cake.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.300]   It's not that much.
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.300]   It's not the entire cake.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.300]   It's not the cake.
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.300]   Exactly.
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.300]   It's a cake.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.300]   Are you saying it's a queen size or is it a California king?
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.300]   I mean, how big is the sheet?
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.300]   I was, I had Pro 12.9 inch.
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.300]   Oh, perfect.
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.300]   That's true.
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.300]   No, no, I'm saying that's a quarter of that is like 12.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.300]   Whoever it is that like quit and they had a going away party
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.300]   must have circulated a memo on how much,
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.300]   how would they really feel about the entire staff
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.300]   and so they canceled like the party.
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.300]   I will say it's just too much cake for someone who lives alone
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.300]   and is not necessarily of gossamer proportions to begin with.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.300]   It's medically contraindicated.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.300]   However, everyone said, "Well, if I could just have one like lovely cake,
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.300]   I'll freeze the restaurant, I promise.
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.300]   Whatever I don't eat during this show or dinner tonight, I will freeze."
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.300]   This is a, by the way, New World Record Andy actually has now two titles in one sentence.
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.300]   Medically, contraindicated would be, I think, an excellent title for this show.
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.300]   And then there was another one which, of course, I only have a short-term memory of a gnat,
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.300]   so I can't remember.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.300]   But you said it and we'll go back and listen again and find it.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.300]   I try to continue to add value even after so much for us, so many years for the show.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.300]   After so many pieces of sheet cake.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.300]   Also with us from Office Hours and 090.media, Alex Lindsey.
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.300]   I referred to somebody on the radio show to you this week
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.300]   because he wanted to set up a streaming thing
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.300]   and he was wondering what kind of cameras, etc.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.300]   He's actually was an interesting call, a guy named Charlton as in Heston.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.300]   He said, "He's in Hollywood. He's an art director.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.300]   He does..."
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.300]   Right, don't tell anybody. He was doing the sets for Westworld.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.300]   So, you know, he's been working on it since the inaugural episode.
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.300]   So, he really, you know, that's a, I said, "Well, I want to give you props
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.300]   because the people who do these beautiful sets don't get really acknowledged.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.300]   And yet I, as when I watch a movie, I don't know, I guess it's because of you, Alex.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.300]   I'm always thinking about behind the scenes production.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.300]   And I'm thinking, God, they put so much effort into making that look real and perfect.
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.300]   It's so good.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.300]   And the next day, it's gone. He said, "Yeah, yeah, that's it.
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.300]   You shoot for two days, ten seconds of film.
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.300]   It's up and we throw it out."
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.300]   So, I don't know. Props to him, but he wanted to do a streaming thing.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.300]   And I said, "Well, go to Office Hours."
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.300]   So, look for Charlton on Office Hours.
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.300]   We will. We'll keep our eye out for him.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.300]   I said, "You go in there, join the Zoom, just ask the question,
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.300]   and then sit back as an avalanche of knowledge."
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.300]   It really is amazing.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.300]   Every once in a while, I wake up and we're getting ready.
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.300]   Like, there's this roll-up, you know, to seven o'clock in the morning every day,
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.300]   specific standard time.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.300]   And there's like a, at six-thirties, the mic checks.
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.300]   And the mic's like, today we had, you know, all these people are doing mic checks
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.300]   and they're checking their camera angles and all their bits and pieces.
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.300]   And then we had a guest. We had this company called Harrison.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.300]   They make mixers.
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.300]   And they have this online audio mixing system called Mixbus.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.300]   And so they come in and they do their thing.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.300]   And then everyone's kind of setting up.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.300]   And there's this huge movement.
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.300]   And as I'm making my coffee, like listening to it kind of work out,
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.300]   I was like, "This is crazy."
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.300]   It is amazing what you've done.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.300]   It's truly amazing what you've said.
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.300]   Yeah.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.300]   It's such a great bunch of people.
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.300]   And every time you, every time, you know, between when I'm not in meetings,
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.300]   I just leave after hours, which is our, runs 21 hours a day.
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.300]   I just leave it on.
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.300]   It's like, I just sit in the background and the people are talking about.
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.300]   I mean, someone yesterday was talking about like, how to, you know,
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.300]   how to weld pieces of stuff for their jeeps and put cameras on them.
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.300]   And they're like a live streamer with like, you know, a lot of followers, you know,
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.300]   on YouTube.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.300]   And, you know, they're just kind of, but they were just kind of hacking through ideas
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.300]   and so on and so forth. And so it's quite a thing.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.300]   Yeah.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.300]   Unbelievable.
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.300]   A great resource, highly recommended office hours.
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.300]   Global.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:05.300]   So let's talk about that Wall Street Journal piece because I, you think you nailed it,
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:11.300]   Renee, when you said at this time of year, publications have to come up with something,
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.300]   anything to keep you reading. I mean, there's plenty of financial news,
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.300]   but the Wall Street Journal decided it's time to talk about how Apple is bullying teenagers.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:26.300]   And this came from a study that said 80, I think was 87% of all teenagers have iPhones.
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.300]   I thought it was 70%, but it might be.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.300]   I have to give credit to Neil Seibart because he tweeted Wall Street Journal editor.
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.300]   It's been a while since we had an Apple story. Any ideas? Wall Street Journal reporter.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:40.300]   How about iMessage popularity amongst teens, editor, boring, any way to spice it up?
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.300]   Reporter, how about Apple leverages teen bullying and peer pressure to give itself an edge in
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:44.300]   messaging?
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.300]   Editor, Bingo, Bingo.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.300]   Why Apple's my message is winning.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.300]   Teens dread the green text bubble.
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.300]   The iPhone maker cultivated iMessage as a must have texting tool for teens.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:00.300]   Android users trigger a just a little less cool green bubble.
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.300]   Ew, that's gross. And that's just the headline.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:08.300]   In the US, people actually use iMessage, right? Because the rest of the world is like,
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.300]   what's iMessage?
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.300]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.300]   It's such a tiny platform.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.300]   It's like iMessage is like this tiny.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.300]   I did some research for this when I saw this article and I was looking trying to find their
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.300]   market share. And it's like, doesn't even show up on most of the charts. Like it's like this
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.300]   tiny little, you know, in the US, I think it might be 17% depending on how they have, but evidently
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.300]   US teens, I think it's important, which of course, we should bring legislators involved
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:37.300]   by our legislators because we now need to worry about how teens are interacting with their
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.300]   phone.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.300]   Yeah.
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.300]   But there is a point to be made. And this is, of course, Google and the Android team jumped
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:50.300]   on this article immediately and said, this is Roshi Lockheimer saying, this is why Apple,
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:55.300]   although their solution was not Apple should port iMessages to Android. Gasei realized that's
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.300]   futile. We know Apple has no intent on doing that because of Lock-in. I mean, let's admit it.
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.300]   Apple admits it in their emails.
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.300]   As Craig Federighi himself explicitly said, an email is discovered.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.300]   Yeah.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:11.300]   Yeah, I pick a lawsuit. By the way, Alex, there are two different numbers. That's where you got
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:18.300]   the same number of people who are not going to do that. And I think that's a lot of people
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:25.300]   who are not going to do that. And I think that's a lot of people who are not going to do that.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.300]   And I think that's a lot of people who are not going to do that.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.300]   I think that's a lot of people who are not going to do that.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.300]   I think that's a lot of people who are not going to do that.
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.300]   I think that's a lot of people who are not going to do that.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.300]   I think that's a lot of people who are not going to do that.
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.300]   I think that's a lot of people who are not going to do that.
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.300]   I think that's a lot of people who are not going to do that.
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.300]   I think that's a lot of people who are not going to do that.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.300]   I think that's a lot of people who are not going to do that.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.300]   I think that's a lot of people who are not going to do that.
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.300]   I think that's a lot of people who are not going to do that.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.300]   I think that's a lot of people who are not going to do that.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.300]   It's not ridiculous.
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.300]   It does have an effect on conversations, even for grown-ups.
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.300]   Most of my immediate family have iPhones.
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:18.300]   And the idea of I don't want to have to give them a two-sentence reaction to something,
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.300]   but I just want to say, "Ooh, cool photo."
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:25.300]   But, rest, they can just simply long-press and say favorite or love or like,
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:29.300]   I still have to go through the regular SMS channels.
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.300]   And so, yeah, I am kind of at a disadvantage.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:36.300]   And, yeah, it does cause a problem when they're using what they consider to be advanced chat features.
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:44.300]   And I have to say that I wish that Apple would explain what the problem is with RCS and other standards
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.300]   that they don't want to just roll that into the standard phone messaging app.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.300]   I understand the argument for not supporting iMessage on Android.
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:59.300]   Even outside of the email evidence that, "Hey, we don't want to give families an easy excuse
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.300]   to buy cheap Android phones for their kids."
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.300]   But I understand that there are technical reasons that there's who's going to pay for the backbone of this network,
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.300]   etc., etc.
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:14.300]   But I do think that Apple needs to respond broadly by saying we're going to at least make our standard messaging app
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:21.300]   for phone-to-phone conversation and support as many good emerging standards that are being supported in the United States as we can.
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.300]   I'm way more selfish because my whole thing with this, well, two things.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.300]   One is the green bubble, blue bubble originally served a real purpose because text messages you paid for
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.300]   and they were not encrypted.
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:37.300]   And Apple believed you needed a visual state to know that if your message was falling over into SMS,
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.300]   you might be charged for it or it may no longer be secure.
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.300]   And the way they did that was with the green and blue differentiation.
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.300]   And, of course, society ran with that.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.300]   But my thing is it still does that.
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:51.300]   Like it's 2021 and it'll still fall over to SMS if it can't make an iMessage connection.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:57.300]   Or if somebody switches devices and they're suddenly on a non-iPhone, that group chat will fall out of iMessage.
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.300]   And I don't ever want to be just in the position to have no control over whether my messages are secured or not.
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.300]   And RCS is not a great solution yet.
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.300]   It's still maturing.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.300]   It's way better than it used to be.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.300]   It does now support one-to-one encryption.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.300]   It's working on one to many.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.300]   And Apple doesn't announce the stuff before June anyway.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:20.300]   So I think it's weird that Hiroshi is all angry about it in January when there's no chance Apple's going to announce anything for six months.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:26.300]   But I would love it just as a security-conscious privacy-conscious iPhone user if I never had to see SMS again in my chat.
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:37.300]   So you make an interesting point, which is that this is a US, mostly a US-only problem because in the rest of the world, WhatsApp or a line or WeChat, whatever, depending on the region you're in.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.300]   So dominant and provides all those features that there is an initiative, right?
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.300]   Right.
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.300]   So it's only not a WhatsApp in Brazil.
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.300]   It's a US, right.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.300]   It's a US.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:58.300]   It's primarily a US thing and the thing is Apple's not going to do anything unless they're legally forced to do it and they're not going to be forced to do something with iMessage because they're like a tiny part of the market.
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:02.300]   And so the thing is that I just don't think that there's going to be any real movement here.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:15.300]   I think any time a company has, unless it's some larger thing they're forced to do legally, but they're not going to do anything on their own because you don't have, this is every company, you control what makes it a little bit more difficult.
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:21.300]   What makes you different and you commoditize what doesn't and Apple does the same thing with Swift and USDZ.
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.300]   They're trying to break into those markets.
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.300]   They don't control those markets.
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.300]   So they want to support those and make them as open as they possibly can.
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.300]   Although, yes, Swift is open, but honestly, nobody uses it except on Mac.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.300]   I mean, there was an attempt.
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:39.300]   In fact, IBM even had like a Swift playground and stuff, but those, all of those attempts have kind of failed.
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.300]   Well, well, I'm not talking about whether they succeed or fail.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.300]   I'm just talking about what they're trying to make them open.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.300]   Really, that was the idea.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.300]   So and it's still open, but Apple's still contributing to it.
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.300]   Apple's tendency is to really...
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.300]   Yeah, I think they only compete when they have to.
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.300]   Right.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.300]   But anytime...
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.300]   Yep, go ahead.
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.300]   That's your point, though, is that they only do this because they have to.
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:06.300]   Well, and the thing is, is that when you submit to a standard or when you go more open, you are going to be slowed down by that standard.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.300]   You know, that is... standards are useful.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.300]   I use lots of standards that are useful for me.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.300]   But that's the cost.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.300]   The cost is you can't innovate and do everything that you want to do.
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.300]   You can't make it... you can't keep on making it better just the way you want.
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:24.300]   You have to now interact with everybody, you know, everybody else who's doing something and try to figure out...
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:29.300]   you spend a big chunk of your time trying to figure out how it's going to work inside of everybody else's.
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.300]   Apple doesn't want to do that and doesn't need to do that.
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.300]   And so, you know, until they're forced to...
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.300]   I think that the... I mean, sure that there's lock into it as well.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:45.300]   But as a minority stakeholder in the phone market and a very minority stakeholder in the messaging market, both globally and domestically,
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.300]   it's going to be very hard to force them to change their own life.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.300]   I don't know if that's fair to say domestically. I think Apple is not a minority.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.300]   It is. It's just under 50%.
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.300]   No under 50%.
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:05.300]   Every company, though, will take... every company will try to keep proprietary and close what makes them money and open up and try to disseminate what makes their competitors money.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.300]   It's like why WebKit is open and Swift is open and why AdSense is not.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.300]   It's just a normal course of business.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:21.300]   But this, to me, is like a fundamental issue of Apple is going to be the security privacy first company and SMS is notoriously horribly outdated and flawed and vulnerable in a myriad of ways.
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.300]   They're going to have to keep updating that.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.300]   Have to, you know, like in terms of just...
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.300]   ...staying true to their own rhetoric, it's just they're not going to do it in January.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.300]   If they're going to do it like a WWDC, they'll announce, "Oh, and by the way, now we support..."
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.300]   And they're not going to pre-announce it either. They're very, very real.
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.300]   But if they support RCS, it's just going to be a green bubble still.
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.300]   Like it's going to be green bubble.
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.300]   Yeah, it doesn't matter. It's just a green bubble.
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.300]   And it's not...
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.300]   ...as another people have voted out after.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:49.300]   ...putting R's technical once R's got a hold of Hiroshi Lockheimer's statement is...
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.300]   RCS is kind of an... is actually not the answer to this.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.300]   It's kind of...
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.300]   It's a disaster.
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.300]   I mean, it's still on old ideas.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.300]   But the point is that the telephone numbers are outdated.
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.300]   Like his whole thing...
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.300]   He's trying to run a body of the author of...
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:08.300]   Yeah, he's angry about it because telephone numbers are outdated and shouldn't be used as a basis for any communications account anymore.
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.300]   And that's true. I mean, but that's like SMS as that problem already.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.300]   So you're just... you're fixing a bad problem. You're not fixing the root cause of it.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.300]   Yeah. I mean, the thing is...
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.300]   The wrong run tweeted. RCS is a terrible... This is yesterday.
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:23.300]   A terrible messaging standard because it's dependent on a carrier phone bill.
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:27.300]   It's anti-internet and should not be promoted or advocated for.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.300]   My Verizon bill is not my identity. Point well taken.
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.300]   Apple lock in is bad and the solution is carrier lock in? No.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:40.300]   Well, his argument is you can't go into the library and use an email address to log into your RCS account and get your messages.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.300]   Wouldn't it be the idea if everybody in the United States would just get together and say, "Let's use WhatsApp."
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.300]   And then, well, maybe not because it's Facebook.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.300]   But...
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.300]   Yeah, see that's...
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.300]   Isn't it amazing on that, probably?
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.300]   Isn't it amazing?
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.300]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.300]   Isn't it amazing that Facebook owns all this messaging and Google owns none of it?
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.300]   Like Facebook owns WhatsApp.
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.300]   Well, and that was Ron's point on our...
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.300]   That's the end.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.300]   Because this is only because Google fumbled it.
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.300]   It's because Google fumbled it, but also they have almost no market share in the US and they're not almost...
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:09.300]   But they have a dwindling market share in the US and that's why I think Orochi decided to weigh in on this.
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.300]   Because there's very little way to turn that around if Apple has all of these lock-ins.
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:18.300]   So they don't care about this in Kenya or in Eastern Europe because it's not an issue.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.300]   They care very bad.
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.300]   And I'm not saying it's wrong.
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.300]   I think it's important.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.300]   I think the reason... part of the reason they do have that problem is because I messaged like the way it is.
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.300]   Andy, go ahead.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:29.300]   I was just going to say that if you're...
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:34.300]   I'm surprised that people are more concerned about carrier lock-in where I can take my phone to any other...
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:39.300]   I'll talk about United States laws, but I can take this to any other carrier I want, take my phone number with me,
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.300]   and my text messages will follow me wherever I go.
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.300]   But they won't be concerned about, well, yes, we've got WhatsApp.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.300]   Yes, but that's a private corporation that follows your phone around wherever you go.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.300]   Is that a better solution?
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.300]   And yes, RCS isn't perfect.
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.300]   It's not even... I don't think it's fully baked yet.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:07.300]   But you can add features to iMessage that will address a lot of the problems about being an iMessage user in a larger world and vice versa.
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.300]   You can have secure communications.
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:15.300]   You can have even just simple things like long press on something to hold down and, hey, I liked this.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.300]   Have a better interaction of group chats.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:25.300]   I would also say that I'm not necessarily disagreeing with what Renee is saying,
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.300]   but this problem didn't just pop up with this Wall Street Journal article.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.300]   They could have started addressing this three or four years ago.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.300]   We've talked about it.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.300]   We've been talking about the sad blue bubbles for years.
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:43.300]   Yeah, so Apple could have started saying that, hey, look, we have two components to our stock messaging gap.
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:54.300]   One is one that tries to be the most compatible and secure and useful messaging app that works just basically carrier to carrier app to app system to system OS to OS.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:20:00.300]   The other is, hey, if we recognize that you're using... if it's an iPhone to iPhone, we will add extra enhancements,
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:11.300]   but we're not going to deliberately keep non-iPhone to iPhone communications in the Clinton administration just because we're afraid that if we give people a better messaging app,
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.300]   they'll stop giving us their money.
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.300]   I think that's something that Apple has to respond to it these days.
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:23.300]   I just don't know if it's that critical of an issue because, like for me, there's like two people or three people that I interact with,
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.300]   and they've been one of them over a green bubble.
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.300]   And mostly because if they have a green bubble, I immediately just move to another messaging platform.
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.300]   I just go, okay, well, let's talk on Signal.
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:38.300]   Signal is my primary one if I'm not using the iMessage.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.300]   Or I get a random couple messages. I check into Facebook once in a month.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.300]   They say, sorry, I don't just check this very often.
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.300]   And then LinkedIn, I use... because I'm old.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:55.300]   But I think that there's so many messaging apps and so many ways for people to communicate with each other.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.300]   I don't know if this rises at this point too.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.300]   I get that the Wall Street Journal had a great article and I was very upset.
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.300]   We're debating that actually.
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.300]   I know.
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.300]   They have an article about it or whatever.
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:11.300]   What I'm saying is that I just don't know if it really impacts anybody because if you don't, if you have that,
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.300]   you just move to another platform.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.300]   And so it's not like the only thing we have access to.
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.300]   Isn't this a big opportunity?
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:25.300]   Clearly Google fumbled this, but isn't this a big opportunity for somebody, maybe it's Signal, to come along and say to the US,
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.300]   we've got a cross-platform solution that does everything.
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.300]   Maybe it doesn't do Memojis.
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.300]   That's what Apple's trying to do is add things that only Apple can do.
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.300]   Memojis are pretty cool.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.300]   [laughter]
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.300]   That's a lot.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.300]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:50.300]   But everybody's napping, everybody has some sort of Memoji that's not as maybe simple as Apple.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:54.300]   Again, it's a very fragmented market and people pick the ones that they want to do.
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.300]   That's part of the problem.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.300]   The reason...
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.300]   High school students will...
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:04.300]   The most historic reasons that WhatsApp exists is because SMS messaging was so expensive around the world.
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.300]   Right.
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.300]   The people didn't want to use it.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:11.300]   And here in the United States, we didn't use it because it was so difficult because on early phones, before the iPhone,
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.300]   you had to use T9 and it was almost impossible to message.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.300]   They even had...
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:20.300]   You might remember like on the Tonight Show that have races among T9 people and stuff.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.300]   I used to...
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.300]   Or you use BBM, right?
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.300]   That was like...
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.300]   BBM.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.300]   But that was another lock-in, right?
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.300]   I remember being in 2005, being in Africa and watching everybody texting and I was like, "What are they doing?"
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.300]   Exactly.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.300]   Like, what is this like?
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.300]   I had the same experience as...
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.300]   I think outside of North America.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.300]   I think outside of North America.
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.300]   Good job.
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.300]   Before the iPhone came out and every French person was staring at their phone, I thought, "This is really bizarre."
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.300]   Going back to BBM, there was a four-runner.
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:47.300]   If you didn't have BBM, at that point in time, you could not work on Wall Street or date on Wall Street.
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.300]   That was like your complete social structure.
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:54.300]   Well, there was a moment in time when the US government said, "We can't let Blackberry fail because everybody in God's
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.300]   because everybody in government uses Blackberries."
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.300]   Yeah.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:02.300]   Well, and I think that Google has a longer-term problem, which is probably one of the reasons
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:07.300]   they're a little stressed about it, is that there's this one experience that all these teenagers are using,
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.300]   Apple products, and not really interested in Google products.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:17.300]   The other problem is that their Chromebooks have been a huge success business-wise, but I can tell you,
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.300]   my kids hate them.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.300]   They hate them.
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.300]   And so the problem is that they just attach them to school.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.300]   And they get out of school.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.300]   I don't know if they ever want to see a Google product again.
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:33.300]   And so they have a, while they've been successful at getting their products in there, the products lack vision most of the time.
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:43.300]   And they're utilitarian, but they're not, they're generally kind of mushed down to a lowest-combat-and-nominator situation,
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.300]   which gets them out to a lot of places, but doesn't provide a great experience.
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.300]   And I think that that's been one of their problems that, in a short attention span.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.300]   Well, this is Ron's headline in ours, Technica.
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:57.300]   After ruining Android messaging, Google says, "I message is too powerful.
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.300]   Please stop kicking our butts so badly."
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.300]   Google failed to compete with iMessage for years now, once Apple to play nice.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.300]   And RCS, I agree, is not the solution.
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.300]   Honestly, I don't think Google or Apple should have dominance in this.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.300]   They don't love it.
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.300]   They're not even close.
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.300]   Like nobody has any dominance, like other than WhatsApp.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.300]   I mean, but I don't think that they don't-
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.300]   It's regionalized.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.300]   It's regionalized.
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.300]   It's broken up.
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:26.300]   I mean, nobody- This is a perfect example of a market that there is no dominance of-
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.940]   Some people have larger percentages, but in Apple and Google are definitely not one of
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:30.940]   them.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:35.300]   So, it's a very fragmented market.
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:36.300]   And there's a lot of competition.
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.300]   I have a full page on my phone.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.300]   That's in the US, right?
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.300]   In other countries there are dominant.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.300]   Well, it's mostly WhatsApp.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.300]   Well, Brazil.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.300]   As somebody just said, in Brazil, if you don't use WhatsApp, you're out of luck.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.300]   As soon as I leave the country, I have to be on WhatsApp the whole time.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.300]   Yeah.
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.300]   I didn't have WhatsApp till we went to Mexico, and then I realized the only way I could
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.300]   message Mike and Amir hope was through WhatsApp.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.300]   So, I had to install it and reactivate my account.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.300]   But I don't want it to be Facebook either.
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.300]   I don't think that's a great solution.
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:09.300]   To me, that just illustrates the scale of the problem.
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:14.300]   There are so many people that, for my address book, needs to make a note of, "Hey, if you
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.300]   send a text message to this person, they will never see it.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.300]   You send this person."
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.300]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.300]   It doesn't SMS work for everybody.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.300]   I mean, isn't that what you're saying?
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.300]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:30.300]   I'm using this as a broad example where everyone has that messaging app or that service that
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.300]   gets their full and daily attention.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:37.800]   I'm just like Alex, where I will be shocked to find out that my aunt sent me this really
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.300]   beautiful message on Facebook Messenger, so I didn't see it for like three and a half
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.300]   weeks.
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.300]   I'm like, "Call her and say, "I'm sorry, I didn't see it.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.300]   I didn't see it.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.300]   I didn't see it."
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:52.300]   And this is the, and if you're talking to somebody who doesn't really check, they don't, they
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.300]   don't, they have turned off notifications on their SMS app because they feel as though
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.300]   that's always going to be a scammer.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.300]   That's not someone who knows them, knows to get in touch with them via signal or via
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.300]   WhatsApp.
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.300]   We have the situation where I think that I'm, I think that I've sent someone a message,
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.300]   but I don't know if it's through a means that they're going to pay attention to.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:12.300]   And if we had, if SMS were, excuse me, if the standard carrier-based messaging service
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:17.300]   were a lot more robust and had the features and the muscularity of a lot of these third-party
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.300]   apps, we might see a reduction in this.
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.300]   And I'm on the same boat with everybody else.
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.300]   I hate the fact that I've got WhatsApp.
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:29.300]   I've got it frozen on my phone because I just hate the idea of any sort of a Facebook-owned
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.300]   mobile app on my mobile device.
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.300]   It's just anathema.
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.300]   I like that every minute about what my phone.
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.300]   Yeah, Messenger same thing, exactly.
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:41.300]   And yet, by the way, both platforms do all of the things that people want.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:42.300]   I mean, they're great ways to share.
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:46.300]   I've got a LinkedIn once a year and there's 80 messages waiting for me later.
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.300]   I know.
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.300]   I just, I can't get it.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.300]   It's so funny.
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.300]   Lisa and I were just talking about that the other day.
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.300]   People, Messenger, and MeToo on LinkedIn, it's like, "Oh, wow, I never saw it."
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:59.300]   I wish I could remember the story years ago when Elon Musk launched, "I don't know whether
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:04.300]   it was SpaceX or Tesla," or the, I think he was staffing up on a big way on a new project.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:10.300]   And some engineer tweeted out that, "Yeah, I wish I finally got caught up on my LinkedIn
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.300]   messages found that I actually got an email from Elon Musk's top recruiter."
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.300]   Whoops.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.300]   Like a year and a half ago.
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.300]   Whoops.
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.300]   Ask if I'd like to join the new team.
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.300]   Whoops.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.300]   Like, "Oh, dear."
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.300]   Hey, speaking of which, maybe Elon should do a messaging platform.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.300]   But if he has liked somebody who comes a long way, did you have to be somebody who would
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.300]   be chrass watching?
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.300]   But it'd have to be somebody who will know enough.
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.300]   He always will know enough.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.300]   He's a way from shipping a perfect product.
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.300]   Yeah, and that won't work either.
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.300]   I don't think.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.300]   I don't think Mike has just stepped down as CEO of Signal.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.300]   But I still think Signal has great potential.
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.300]   It's great to worry about the commerce though, that the commerce is going to break it open
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.300]   for anything.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:48.300]   Well, they're putting Bitcoin in it or a crypto in it, which I think is a, everything's got
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.300]   crypto in it now.
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.300]   And I really feel like that's such a mistake.
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.300]   But the AP is selling NFTs of their photographs.
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.300]   I don't know what world it lives.
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.300]   It's up to.
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:28:00.300]   You're speaking of which, in this relation to what you were talking about, Alex, in terms
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:05.300]   of the power of platform, a Moxie wrote, it seems, this seems completely transient.
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.300]   It's completely different from what we were talking about, but it's not.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:13.300]   My first impressions of Web3, he's talking about Web3 and it was a really good piece in
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:20.300]   which, but the point is actually you could say replace Web3 with iMessage or messaging.
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.300]   These are the important points he makes.
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.300]   People don't want to run their own servers and never will.
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.300]   That's absolutely God's truth.
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.300]   Even big companies don't run their own servers anymore.
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:34.300]   So that means a truly decentralized system is not going to happen.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.300]   Because people don't want to run their own servers.
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:41.300]   A protocol moves much more slowly than a platform.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:49.300]   And this is to your point, Alex, which is the platform, in other words, Apple, can develop
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.300]   so much more quickly than a protocol.
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:56.300]   In fact, he gives us an example IRC, which we love and use.
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:01.300]   He says people are still trying to standardize sharing a video reliably over IRC.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:05.300]   Meanwhile, Slack lets you create custom reaction emoji space on your face.
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:10.300]   And that's the point is that a single centralized own company-owned platform is always going
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.300]   to iterate much, much faster than a protocol.
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:17.300]   So that's why his position is why Web3 is hopeless.
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.300]   But you're never going to have it.
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.300]   It's just going to be another platform.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.300]   It's going to be run by the big platforms.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.300]   Many have said that, including Jack Dorsey or Twitter.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.300]   But I think it also applies to messaging.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:31.300]   This is why RCS is struggling to keep up with Apple's messaging.
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:36.300]   And really Google blew it because Google could potentially have done something with the Apple.
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.300]   I was on the messages.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.300]   Now, on the time of mentally, I was contracting heavily with Google.
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.300]   For Google, my company was.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:47.300]   But when Hangouts was out, we were using it probably more than anything else with everyone.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.300]   And it was a great platform.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.300]   And you could switch from video to audio to, you know, you had all these things all set up.
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:57.300]   And it was probably the best platform out there across the board for all the things that you wanted to do.
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:02.300]   And then, you know, they had some internal politics, you know, and it ended.
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.300]   Like, that's what happened.
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.300]   I mean, like, there was some internal issues.
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.300]   And then it just, and then for political issues, it just-
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:11.300]   So then whining about RCS, I have to agree with Rana.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.300]   Marty, is a little bit, you know, play me.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.300]   If they won, they wouldn't be saying anything, right?
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:20.300]   Like, if they owned WhatsApp and Messenger and Instagram DM equivalents, they wouldn't be saying anything.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:28.300]   And Ron's point also, and I think is well taken, is RCS is not a better alternative to anything.
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.300]   It's out of date, it's antiquated.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.300]   There's a lot of problems with it.
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.300]   And the hard part is that there's so many players.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:39.300]   Well, when you have so many players and you're trying to do a protocol, it's almost never going to work.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.300]   Yes.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:47.300]   Like, in platforms, it's, you know, it's just going to always be this thing that is, because everybody has their own thing that they think is absolutely important.
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.300]   And I won't move forward if I don't have this. And it's different for everyone.
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.300]   So you end up with this kind of lowest common denominator moving in a crawl space.
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:31:00.300]   And this industry, all of these industries are moving too fast to be slowed down by that process, you know?
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.300]   And I think that that's the issue.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:05.300]   No one really wants to do it other than Google because Google doesn't really have anything else.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.300]   Like, they don't have any solution there.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.300]   So, too-
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.300]   And they're not going to.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.300]   So, yeah, the carriers have been dragging their feet.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.300]   They finally came along, but it's not going to-
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:15.300]   So no one wants to be connected to the carrier because no one likes the carriers.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.300]   Like, that's the problem is we all are frustrated with our experience.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:22.300]   Like, I won't buy a phone from a carrier because, you know, because I don't want to deal with them.
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:29.300]   In fact, that's maybe part of the Apple's success with the iPhone is that they were able to surmount the carrier hegemony and do their own thing.
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:36.300]   So history showed us that even though US was laggard in SMS, eventually we caught up.
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:44.300]   Maybe now we're in the same boat where we're laggard with centralized messaging because we have the same problem we have with SMS, which is there's all these different-
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:50.300]   platforms and there's no unified way of talking, except SMS to everybody.
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:57.300]   Maybe you think what's Apple become dominant or something will become dominant in the years to come just as SMS finally took over in the US?
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.300]   I don't think so.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.300]   I don't think so.
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.300]   I think they're just going to keep on being pregnant.
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.300]   I have a whole page on my iPhone that is just-
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.300]   It's so terrible.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.300]   It's a terrible experience.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.300]   At this point, I just want to know how you fix it.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:12.300]   We can say that it is a terrible experience, but, you know, it's not-
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.300]   This is one of those ones that I just don't know if it's fixable.
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.300]   You know, like I think we sometimes-
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.300]   We can say, "Oh, it should be some way."
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.300]   But-
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.300]   Yeah.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.300]   Remember like, we're Brazil would shut down what's out for a day for some legal reason.
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.300]   The entire country would stop and they'd have to put it back up.
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.300]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.300]   It's just like the power of these-
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.300]   Yeah.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.300]   Where we chat in China is how they do-
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.300]   Like, you live on WeChat.
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.300]   It doesn't even matter about Android or iPhone very much anymore.
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.300]   You live on WeChat and the government's control of it.
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.300]   Yeah.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:36.300]   Right.
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:41.300]   Although as Moxie and others have pointed out, you know, WeChat is far from end-to-end encrypted.
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.300]   I don't know if people care about end-to-end encrypted.
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:52.300]   For a while, I was really pushing Telegram, which I love, has all the features and then some of a great chat app.
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.300]   You know, if everybody in the news box suddenly-
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.300]   Do you see-
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.300]   Let's use Telegram.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.300]   I'd be so happy.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.300]   But it's not necessarily secure, but that's-
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.300]   You know, that's neither here nor there.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.300]   Signal is probably the most secure.
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:08.300]   And for the folks that I talked to and signal, a lot of us have like expiring, you know, like expiring your message-
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.300]   Because you're just talking, right?
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.300]   And so you just let it expire every day.
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.300]   Yeah.
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:16.300]   And then the signal still is that it's tied to your phone number, although that they're working on a way around that.
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.300]   Yeah.
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.300]   Which is like RCS, right?
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:19.300]   That's the still the phone number is the-
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.300]   Yeah.
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:24.300]   You need some sort of universal ID, a unique ID, a GUID.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.300]   Every human you have a GUID.
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.300]   Or just allow email addresses.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.300]   Like just allow email addresses.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.300]   Yeah.
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.300]   It would solve a lot of this.
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.300]   Yeah.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:38.300]   Email is nice because you can- if you're- it all sophisticated, and even if you're not, you can create dummy addresses that you can use that are anonymous.
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.300]   But dedicated, that kind of thing.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.300]   That does cut both ways.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:55.300]   If there are circumstances under which you really want to talk, you really want to transport in which the person who's participating in this messaging app has at some point demonstrated that, "Hi, I'm a real person.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.300]   Hi.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:04.300]   Here is an address where I'm building stuff to, establishing stuff like that as opposed to, "Hi, I know that I can get a free email address at gmail.com."
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.300]   Yeah.
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.300]   And so I can pretend to be a real estate emperor.
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:17.300]   Steve Gibson is a fan of "Threema," which by the way, I think the Swiss military just announced is the only messaging platform that can be used by the Swiss military.
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.300]   All kinds of milk.
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.300]   And they guard the pope.
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.300]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.300]   No, no, that's- I don't think the Swiss guards are actually Swiss.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.300]   Are they?
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.300]   I don't know.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.300]   Are they?
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.300]   I'll have to ask if that's not true.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.300]   I'm going to be so disappointed.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.300]   They have damn nice outfits.
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:43.300]   Anyway, the "Threema," T-H-R-E-E-M-A.C-H, has a mechanism, and this is why Steve likes it, for identifying people, you exchange a "Threema" code.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:54.300]   And if you feel certain that the person you're talking to is the person who's sending you that code, you can lock that in and then know that that's who I'm talking to without tying it to any central authority.
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:59.300]   The ideal way to do it is meeting in person, but there are other mechanisms for doing that.
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.300]   That's kind of the problem with PGP.
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:09.300]   You have to have PGP for a while, recommended signing parties where you'd all get together in a room and cite each other's key.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.300]   Oh, yeah, no.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.300]   Regular people don't do that stuff.
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.300]   Nobody's going to do that.
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.300]   That's a bolt of that.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.300]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.300]   And "Threema" might even be more complicated than it needs to be.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.300]   "Threema" is now open source.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:23.300]   The reason I did not agree with Steve, the "Threema" was the right choice.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:28.300]   He really liked the dot system they used of authentication, but they weren't open source at the time.
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.300]   They have now open sourced their software.
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.300]   And I think that "Threema" might be the right choice.
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.300]   Steve, you can't believe it.
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:39.300]   But I could say that technically, there's no way to convince family and friends to use it.
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:45.300]   I tried to get my family to use "Jigsy" instead of Zoom for two whole years of pandemic, and it never happened.
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.300]   VHS-C beta for a reason, Leo.
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.300]   People don't care about this technology.
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.300]   The worst stuff often wins.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:36:04.300]   But one part of, I think, something that's going to be, hopefully, will be an influence on this, is that more and more, like, national militaries are saying, "Okay, here are the chat apps you are not allowed to install on any of your phones.
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:08.300]   Here's the only approved list of phones, of apps that we're going to get.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:14.300]   Not all those choices are going to be pro-consumer, because I'm sure that the military themselves would like to be able to take a peek into this.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:18.300]   They're people who work for them, their phones from time to time as it is.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:25.300]   But it does indicate that at least there's a spreading awareness that you have to know who you're sending your message through.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:43.300]   The fact that is "end to end encrypted" is it really end to end encrypted, or is the company that's running this service saying, "Oh, well, to make sure that we're giving you the greatest highest quality service, we will, from time to time, be able to take a look at your traffic just to verify that we're trying to do it."
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:46.300]   You can verify that we're giving you the best possible.
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:51.300]   Well, and this is why, and of course, everyone was so freaked out about Huawei.
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.300]   I mean, it was the real problem.
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.300]   You start putting those switches.
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:01.300]   You put those switches everywhere, and that was a true issue.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:14.300]   The biggest problem, though, with using, say, "Threema," and the reason iMessage wins is if somebody's not using "Threema," you can't message them through "Threema."
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:18.300]   But with iMessage, you always have this SMS fallback.
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:22.300]   In theory, there is no one you can't contact.
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.300]   It's not perfect, but there's no one you can't contact with.
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.300]   It's also the default.
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.300]   It's just built into your phone.
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.300]   You have no idea.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:29.300]   It's the SMS.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.300]   You don't know anything about it.
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.300]   Yeah, and it's just iMessage.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:39.300]   That's one of the reasons why first iMessage for Android isn't a clear win because people would have to install it and use it the way they install and use WhatsApp.
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.300]   People like their defaults.
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.300]   They like what they're using already.
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:46.300]   But also, there's just not that level of integration.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:53.300]   We forget about this stuff, but Scott Forest will spend a long time trying to get a carrier's solution before they made iMessage.
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:57.300]   He just could not get them to agree on anything, so they eventually made iMessage.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:09.300]   And even then, the carriers were super angry about it for a really long time because i believe no key admitted once that SMS messages were the most profitable legal business ever devised by human beings at the height of their their new streams.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:14.300]   They were charging 25 cents for carrier channel communications.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:18.300]   So this is a very different world than when a lot of stuff was developed.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.300]   Yeah.
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.300]   Well, i guess there's really no answer.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:36.300]   So long as we don't throw our hands up at the air and say it's an insoluble problem, let's not try to improve things for a basic technology that benefits so many people in so many different ways.
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.300]   There are always going to be ways we can improve it.
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:49.300]   If we're not looking for something that's perfect, if we're not looking for something that will rub the one message, the one true ring drew to hold upon us all, let's just keep making things better.
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.300]   I do think that an app like iMessage can be made better.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.300]   I do believe that SMS could be made better.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.300]   And you know what the real answer is going to be, right?
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:02.300]   It's going to be iMessage plus where for $3 a month Android and iOS users get gold bubbles.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.300]   Then you're like, you're going to be a good one.
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:15.300]   I think the reality is part of the reason that all these other messaging apps have sprung up is because RCS and SMS and all these are so far behind.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.300]   And I think that's why I just don't think any of these.
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:24.300]   No one's going to bother with these other formats because they're already way past it.
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:27.300]   And why would they go? Not just Apple, but all the message.
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.300]   Well, all the way they didn't have the infrastructure and the costs were extreme.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:35.300]   Outside of Northern Hurricane, it was incredibly expensive and the infrastructure was terrible and the query was not cooperating.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:40.300]   What's that? BBM and then what's... people used to buy just BBM plans for their phones 10 years ago.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.300]   It cost almost nothing, especially in emerging markets.
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:48.300]   And then there was like, what's up plans? That was the only way that they could communicate because even voice was way too expensive.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:53.300]   Yeah. So I just don't... I think that that... I do think that this was solvable a decade ago.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:57.300]   I don't think it's... I do think that it's going to continue to just be something that's fragmented.
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:03.300]   I think that there's... there is not... you know, you can't fix everything.
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.300]   I think those ones are going to be hard to fix.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.300]   I'm going to hold up my 3M of QR code for anybody.
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:13.300]   Now, you know, no one else could fake this.
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:15.300]   I should probably put my face in front of it.
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.300]   But me mojis, you're not going to be giving up your me mojis.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:23.300]   I don't like mo... you know, there is one use for me mojis I really like.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:27.300]   When you... now on the modern Macs...
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.300]   I can't use that as my pey use for mojis at the end.
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:33.300]   And then when you put your finger on wrong, it goes... it looks at you.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.300]   It makes fun of you.
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.300]   It's the best feature.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.300]   But that's literally the best... VR avatar.
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.300]   Like that's why they built it.
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.300]   Is it going to be my VR avatar?
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.300]   Because yeah, what's nice is you can change it.
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.300]   So I just put a mask on.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:48.300]   I had a Mexican hat on me when I was in Mexico and a sauroppy.
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.300]   I can change it.
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.300]   I love that.
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.300]   When you're in the Apple Metaverse, that's going to be you Leo.
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:57.300]   Oh, but I got to tell you, if people listening haven't done this,
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:03.300]   if you change your... your avatar... your login image to your moji
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:05.300]   in... you know, if you're on Monterey,
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.300]   it's like literally, in my opinion.
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.300]   I know there's been a lot of new updates in Monterey.
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.300]   It's like one of my...
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:11.300]   Best feature.
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.300]   It's the best feature.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.300]   It's the one that brings me the most joy.
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.300]   I miss type like three or four times every time I go into a new computer.
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.300]   I'm like, "Oh, let's see what he does.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.300]   Let's see what he does."
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.300]   He shakes his head up.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.300]   He's got a real personality.
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:21.300]   He rolls his eyes.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.300]   And it's not the same.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.300]   It's like a random... you know, it's like sometimes he's really disgusted with you.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.300]   And sometimes he's just like, "No."
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:32.300]   And so it's like a little slot machine of reactions.
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:33.300]   And it's so much fun.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.300]   It's not a pop.
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.300]   I wouldn't put up with that with a co-worker.
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:39.300]   I don't know why anybody else thinks that they should put up with it on something that I paid it down.
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.300]   It's like those restaurants that yell at you, Andy.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.300]   They're in cruelty.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.300]   Let me see if I can go find.
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.300]   I showed this before, but I'll show it again.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.300]   This is an example from Daniel Yout of what your mimeoji does.
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.300]   If you see it follows your mouse around.
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:55.300]   That's not a good...
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.300]   And he looks down while you're typing.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.300]   So you put it in there and he looks down while you're typing.
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.300]   He's like, "Yeah, I can't look what you're doing."
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:01.300]   Yeah, it's scrutinizing you.
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.300]   And if you get it, if you do it wrong,
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.300]   it shakes his hand at you.
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.300]   He's going to be unhappy with your password.
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.300]   Oh, it didn't do it.
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.300]   I didn't do it.
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:12.300]   Oh, it's so good.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.300]   Isn't that fun?
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.300]   I love that.
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.300]   It just doesn't have downable scale beards, but it's not a solvable problem.
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:18.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.300]   You can use both with mime line and from Expo 13.
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.300]   Oh, maybe this is an apple video.
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.300]   I should probably see if I can find the apple video.
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.300]   It sounds like this is an apple video.
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.300]   Because anyway, it's a voice.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.300]   It's so much fun.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.300]   It's really fun.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.300]   But it's also a really good way to boil water to get people used to seeing themselves in
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.300]   an avatar digital 3D augmented reality virtual way.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.300]   You think that's really the secret agenda of all of this is to get into that.
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:45.300]   No, it wasn't designed.
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.300]   Like, Apple, often people think Apple have a master plan and then you talk to them like,
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:51.300]   "Oh, no, no, like we had no idea, but it was super convenient that we had this thing that
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.300]   we could use, you know, already waiting for us."
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.300]   I think that's how the tech industry kind of works, isn't it?
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:59.300]   It's like, "Oh, there's a good use for it.
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:03.300]   If it weren't for Christmasina, we wouldn't know about hashtags."
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:09.300]   Twitter finally realized the @ sign meant something and started to implement it.
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.300]   All of that just serendipitous.
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.300]   Erendipitous.
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.300]   Yeah.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.300]   Maybe I'm not going to give up hope.
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:22.300]   Maybe the forces will align and at some point we'll have a universal messaging system in
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.300]   the US as the rest of the world does.
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.300]   It'll be email.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.300]   Yeah.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:29.300]   Oh, no.
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.300]   There's a solution.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.300]   It's a hate email.
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.300]   Standard.
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.300]   Standard.
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:35.300]   You're right.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.300]   People think that they're communicating with me when they email me.
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.300]   No.
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:42.300]   It's just a mountain over there that you're adding your bit to.
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:43.300]   That's all.
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.300]   No.
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.300]   Surprise.
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:46.300]   Like, the Pixel does such a good job navigating phone trees.
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:48.300]   I wish that we'd just navigate Gmail for me.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.300]   Like, because like so much Gmail I don't need to respond to.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.300]   Just like the Pixel handle.
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.300]   I'd leave it on and just let it be my mail dummy for the whole year.
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:59.020]   Hey, let's take a little break for a word from our sponsor Macbreak Weekly on the air.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:00.780]   We did find a little something.
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.300]   Thank you Wall Street Journal for that stupid article.
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:08.180]   Give us food for thought and Ron Amario in ours Technica as well.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.940]   Our show today brought to you by New Relic.
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:16.060]   If you are an engineer, a sysadmin, if you have to monitor a performance of an app or
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.420]   a network, you know the name New Relic.
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.140]   I know you do.
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:24.380]   Just you know you've been through this 9 and PM.
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.980]   You're winding down.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.740]   Maybe you're thinking about, oh, settle down to an advent of code problem or something.
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.620]   And then your phone buzzes with an alert.
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:33.620]   Something's broken.
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:36.260]   You're already thinking what could be wrong.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.380]   And then think about this.
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:39.380]   This is a nightmare.
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:40.380]   Is it the back end?
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:41.380]   Is it the front end?
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:42.380]   Is it global?
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:43.380]   Is it just one server?
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.380]   Is it the network?
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:45.380]   Is it the cloud provider?
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:48.220]   Do we have slow queries on our MongoDB?
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.660]   Did I introduce a bug in my last deploy?
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:52.980]   The mind reels.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:57.540]   And now your whole team is scrambling from tool to tool, messaging person to person to
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.060]   find and fix the issue.
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:07.500]   And it's all because in your in this fog, this cloud of unknown, this cloud of mystery,
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:13.500]   wouldn't it be nice if you could clear up the cloud and actually see what's going on?
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.220]   This is what New Relic is all about.
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:21.620]   And what's sad to me is according to New Relic, only half of all organizations currently
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:25.300]   implement some form of observability for the networks and systems.
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:29.860]   That means the other half is in that fog, that shroud of war, that mystery where they
[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.420]   just don't know what's going on.
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:36.900]   The report showed how maintaining network observability continues to be an issue for companies around
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:37.900]   the world.
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:41.340]   But it won't happen if you get New Relic or get the boss to get New Relic.
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:45.140]   Actually, what's cool about New Relic, you can install it right now for free.
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.900]   You don't have to get the boss's permission.
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.380]   You don't have to write a check.
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:51.740]   No credit card even required.
[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:52.980]   So you can start using it now.
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:56.460]   In fact, I think that's what how a lot of our organizations start using New Relic.
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.300]   And they realize its value and they expand.
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.780]   New Relic has 16 different monitoring products.
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:06.780]   Normally, you'd have to buy them separately that you can use to see your entire stack
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.380]   in one place.
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.340]   You get, of course, application monitoring.
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:17.500]   You can build right into your apps, 8 PM, Unified Monitoring for Apps and Microservices.
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:21.620]   If you're using Kubernetes, you know probably, I hope you know about PIXI.
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:25.860]   You can get instant Kubernetes observability with PIXI.
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:26.980]   Very important on those clusters.
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:27.980]   Distributed tracing.
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.220]   You can see all your traces without management headaches.
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.300]   So you can find and fix issues fast.
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.580]   You've got network performance monitoring.
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:38.940]   So you don't have to guess where performance issues start.
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:44.980]   You can ditch data silos for a system-wide correlated view.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:46.620]   It's just a breath of fresh air.
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:50.700]   You're going to be so, so happy.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:55.220]   More importantly, you can actually pinpoint issues down to a line of code.
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:57.820]   If you use the APM, your symbol table is available.
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:02.780]   It'll actually say, you know, it's this function, this procedure, this object that's dying on
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:03.860]   you.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:09.700]   That's why the devs and ops teams at DoorDash use New Relic, GitHub uses New Relic, Epic
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.580]   Games uses New Relic.
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:16.860]   It's more than 14,000 companies use New Relic to debug and improve their software.
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:21.860]   And for the rest of you, I just, you have my deepest sympathy.
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.860]   I don't know how you, how do you live?
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:28.100]   Whether you run a cloud native startup or a Fortune 500 company, it'll take you five
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.740]   minutes to set up New Relic.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:36.180]   And as I said, you can get access to the entire platform and 100 gigabytes of data free forever.
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:40.940]   And that's a lot, by the way, without a credit card, free forever.
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:43.220]   Look that 9 p.m. call is just waiting to happen.
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:44.540]   Get New Relic before it does.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:49.540]   Sign up at New Relic, n-e-w-r-e-l-i-c.com/Macbreak.
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:56.300]   And e-w-r-e-l-i-c, new relic.com/Macbreak.
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:59.460]   Time to get out of the dark ages and into the light.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.340]   New Relic.com/Macbreak.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:04.100]   We thank you so much for supporting Mac Break Weekly.
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.740]   I told him, I said, I said, no, you know what?
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:09.940]   There are lots of Apple people who would use this new Mac break folks.
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:10.940]   You show them.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:13.100]   Now you show them that I didn't make a mistake here.
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:16.100]   New Relic.com/Macbreak.
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.900]   Oh, let's get back.
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.900]   Where the nerds are.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.340]   Where the nerds are.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.620]   That's right.
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:27.540]   Where the nerds are.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:31.660]   So Apple is going to have to bend in South Korea.
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:38.420]   They are going to start allowing an alternative payment system because South Korean courts
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:43.900]   said you have to, unlike here in the United States, that this is it.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:47.620]   They say it like Trump, like Mr. Stallone and Judge Dred.
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:48.620]   We are the law.
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:49.820]   And Apple just had to.
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.900]   They said it like in the squid game.
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:55.300]   Do this or else.
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.660]   Apple will allow alternative payment systems in South Korea, complying with a new local
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:00.500]   law that bans App Store.
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:04.980]   By the way, it was called the anti-Google law because it affects Google's Android Play
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:06.540]   Store as well.
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.580]   And Google has already done this in November.
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:10.220]   In November, Google implemented it.
[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:13.900]   Apple, you know, as slowly as possible.
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:18.580]   Bands in App Store operators from forcing their own in-app payment systems.
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.660]   The law went to effect in September.
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:24.740]   In November, Google pledged to provide an alternative payment system on its App Store
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:28.100]   in Korea, a slightly reduced service charge.
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:32.540]   Apple says it's going to provide an alternative payment system at a reduced service charge
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:35.260]   compared to the 30%.
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:40.380]   They have just turned in their compliance plans to the Korean Communications Commission,
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.140]   the KCC.
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.900]   But they did not say dates.
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:48.860]   I'm sure at some point Korean law will start saying, you know, you got to do this.
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:54.140]   But they are moving forward anyway, or at least apparently moving forward to do that.
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:55.140]   Yeah.
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.380]   We saw Google's very valuable ability.
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.780]   Yeah, Google apparently, well, you see, I get I don't know.
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.580]   15% and 11% if it's off the store, but you still have to pay them commission.
[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:06.580]   I think that's how it works.
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:09.780]   Yeah, isn't that what Apple said is, well, we'll just bill you for the details.
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:10.780]   Yeah.
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:11.780]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.980]   Good luck to everyone who gets audited.
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:17.220]   Like, you know, like, that's the thing is that you're going to get, you know, like for
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:21.220]   companies that go down this path, I mean, they're going to, if they make any significant
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:24.260]   amount of money, Apple, there's going to be legal cases around it.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:28.700]   And whatever they say, you price it enough down that nobody's going to actually do it.
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:32.420]   Like they have the appearance of freedom, but it's like, oh, for 4% I'll let Apple handle
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.420]   the taxes.
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:34.420]   That's not a problem.
[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:37.580]   And I think that I think that on a smaller market having this happen might be good for
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:38.580]   Apple.
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:39.580]   We'll see how it goes.
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:41.100]   But, you know, the user experience is not going to be as good.
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:45.660]   You know, and, and this is a place where it is fixable for users right now, which is
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:49.420]   that they don't, you know, they, you know, this is something that's being pushed by the
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:54.300]   developers, but not by the users, you know, and, and this is the user's user experience
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:58.620]   is going to suck, you know, and, and because now I mean, anybody who's had an app that
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:03.180]   on Apple TV that makes you go and sign into something else and file it, fill a bunch of
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:05.220]   stuff out, I mean, welcome to the future.
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:06.220]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:08.020]   Welcome to the future on your phone and people.
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:11.660]   And so we'll see, we'll see, I mean, my guess is that people are going to do this and
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.380]   people are not going to like it.
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:14.380]   So.
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:17.940]   We are, we already have this problem with other areas of the app store experience.
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.580]   So I don't have a problem with that.
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:24.180]   Also, I think we, if Apple is going to continue to boast how much money that they're making
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:28.300]   for developers, they need to acknowledge that developers are their customers as well.
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:31.820]   And if this is something that, that a lot of developers are asking for, they should be
[00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:33.020]   able to provide it.
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:37.580]   And thirdly, I did, it's not so as long as they're not forcing developers to make a choice
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:41.140]   that they don't want to make, I think it's all to the good.
[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:47.140]   I mean, if I, in the abstract, I don't deny that if I were, if I were a small to mid range
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:51.220]   developer, I would much rather have Apple do all the accounting and just simply take a
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.220]   check.
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:56.180]   But that if maybe that would not be what I would decide, maybe I would be part of a larger
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:58.300]   company that wouldn't make sense for me.
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:02.660]   It's all about, does it make sense for Apple to make this a requirement?
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:06.660]   If not, then they should, they should make that an option.
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:13.780]   Actually, maybe this is coincidental, but Apple announced how much revenue it's generated
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:18.260]   for developers in the App Store for 2021.
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:25.100]   And it's, you know, it's about $5 billion a month, 260 billion since the App Store launched
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:26.100]   in 2008.
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:29.220]   That's up 60 billion from the figure a year ago.
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:33.540]   So Mark Gurman says that, you know, to do the division, do the math.
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:37.220]   This was an announcement it made yesterday as part of a summary of the performance of
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:40.180]   its digital services across 2021.
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:44.860]   The company said the App Store generated a new yearly record for App Store developer
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.660]   earnings last year.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:47.660]   Yeah.
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:54.980]   But as we found out last year, we're not talking about every developer reaping a banana.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:59.820]   We're talking about a small percentage of one aspect of the App Store marketplace.
[00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:05.740]   And even then, it's not as though all iPhone users are making those huge contributions
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:06.940]   to that bottom line.
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:12.780]   It is a very, very disproportionate amount of iPhone users that are contributing the
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:15.140]   King's ransom of that percentage.
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:19.940]   So it's not as simple as Simpsons tapped out donuts is really what it is.
[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:22.100]   Let's be honest about this.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:23.100]   Yeah.
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:24.860]   But yeah, that's fine going on about it.
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:30.780]   If for Apple, you I don't think that it's as easy for Apple to make that as a boast.
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:35.900]   It still works as a demonstration of here's how well that our services are making.
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:39.780]   Here's the contributions that all that work that we're doing is making to our bottom line.
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.260]   So long as they don't claim that.
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:46.300]   Yes, you see we're a benevolent organization that creates jobs and creates new business
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.300]   opportunities.
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:49.300]   It's like, excuse me.
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:50.300]   Testimony.
[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:51.300]   They actually do.
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:52.300]   Testimony.
[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:53.300]   I mean, that's.
[00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:55.780]   They actually do produce a lot of opportunity.
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:56.780]   Like that's the only.
[00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:58.620]   That's why I brought with that.
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:01.140]   Not the way that the way that they would sell.
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:02.140]   $60 billion.
[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:06.060]   Like $59 billion goes to Epic and a billion goes to small guys.
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:07.060]   It's still something.
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.060]   But it's not 60.
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:11.500]   There's I mean, the thing is this is there's I mean, again, anecdotally, I know a lot of
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:15.940]   developers that either making some side part or not working anymore because of what they
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:19.860]   made that they wrote out of a win and put on the app store.
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:24.380]   Now, you know, is the right market and the right thing and every market has a lot of
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:27.780]   people that don't that don't figure out how to nail it just right.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:31.740]   So whether you're, you know, talking about like the life, the life, talk about the investment
[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:36.260]   and how long and how long a restaurant lasts, you know, like, you know, like it's there's
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:39.140]   a huge investment in restaurants and most of them go under, you know, and so the thing
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:43.900]   is that and so you don't have to, you don't have to go buy a restaurant or even a food
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:44.900]   truck capital.
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.180]   It's really a brain time.
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:52.780]   And really like now, now that you can take swift playgrounds and publish to the app store,
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:55.900]   you know, the thing is is that you can find little things that you want to solve and are
[00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:57.540]   you going to retire on it?
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:58.540]   Maybe not.
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:02.620]   But there are a lot of people making a reasonable amount of money, you know, on this, on this
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:09.300]   market and it is as someone who's, I mean, I've sold stuff and on many different platforms,
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:14.220]   the currently the iPhone is one of the best opportunities for an individual.
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:17.460]   Especially for scammers.
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:23.340]   Costa Elle Serio has already posted another just in response to this.
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:26.220]   How to make $13 million on the app store.
[00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:31.420]   This is a guy who like, as you said, Alex is probably on the beach, make a basic app people
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:38.500]   might be searching for, for example, a volume booster, charge and absurd $10 a week, $5
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:43.980]   to $20 a year for an auto renewing subscription that's easy to sign up for, but much harder
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:52.900]   to cancel by lots of fake reviews on a daily basis and profit.
[00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:55.700]   And so this is a specific example he's using here.
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:56:02.500]   And I know because my mom signed up for a memory cleaner and I became aware of it when
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:09.020]   I saw the weekly $5 bill, I knew that she had gotten scammed and it's an easy thing for
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:10.540]   anybody to get scammed on.
[00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:14.500]   And if you're not paying attention to your credit card statements, it might take a while
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:15.500]   for you to notice.
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:20.060]   I will say that at this point though, the Google Play Store, I won't buy anything that's
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:23.020]   not a major brand because I just have no idea what I'm going to get.
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:27.100]   Okay, but if Apple is going to make this big deal about how curated the store is and
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:30.820]   how careful we are, these things should not continue to happen.
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:34.500]   And I'm I can't I mean, I think for bringing these up.
[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:35.500]   Sure.
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:36.500]   Like he's such a dork.
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:41.940]   So anyway, so the like he just like he takes all he goes into this thing like, well, you
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:45.700]   see like everything has an exception, everything.
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:49.100]   You know, like like there is nothing there is no place that you're 100% safe.
[00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:51.340]   There is no place where you're 100% secure.
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:57.180]   You know, and the idea that we're not I mean, the fact is the curation makes it much less.
[00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.100]   Is it going is it going to make it to zero?
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:00.260]   That's impossible.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:03.300]   You know, and are there going to be problems that you have to deal with on a market this
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:04.300]   size?
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:07.700]   Anybody who thinks that you can just get rid of all of these things is naive.
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:11.340]   Like it just like anybody I will cover you out.
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:12.340]   I have a hard time here.
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:18.140]   Who thinks Apple is happy about this because it gets 15 to 30% of the revenue is naive.
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:21.020]   Apple is not incentive to fix this.
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:23.660]   They are in center to fix it because the people complain about it.
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:25.820]   Why does it keep happening?
[00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:30.060]   Because because well, again, it is a complete it's impossible to make something completely
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:34.500]   but every day moderators review worldwide app store charts for quality and accuracy.
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:35.500]   Mm hmm.
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.500]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:39.820]   And they put and you know, the apps you love place you can trust.
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:40.820]   Yeah.
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:46.820]   If Apple wants to dunk on Android for doing this, they really have to have a little they
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:51.300]   they I sometimes think that this messaging denies the fact that as I agree with you, Alex,
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:56.180]   this is not this is not a problem that can be 100% solved.
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:58:01.460]   And I also think that you're free to not buy stuff off the Android's of the Android play
[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:02.460]   store.
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:03.460]   I don't.
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:05.700]   I think that I think that's a really extreme reaction.
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:07.500]   I don't think that's really warranted.
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:14.260]   But it's it's it's my difficulty is always with Apple trying to dunk on other platforms,
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:16.420]   mostly Android but other platforms as well.
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:21.140]   When if you're going to dunk on somebody else, okay, fine, let's open up the floor for Q
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:23.540]   and A because there's a lot of questions that Apple.
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:28.540]   And I would say it's easy to spot an app that's charging $5.
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:29.540]   I'd love to.
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:30.540]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:34.940]   I don't think that's a hard thing to find that that seems like something that you you
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:36.020]   want a human being to look at.
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:42.100]   I say, okay, is this a sales force enterprise scale app that is designed to basically make
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:46.860]   people $100 a week based based based on their productivity, their ability to follow through
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:50.020]   on projects or are they looking for a memory cleaner?
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:53.660]   And that does seem like something that should be flagged really, really quickly.
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:57.380]   Yeah, a couple of things that were that I thought was really interesting with this.
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:00.780]   Some people did look into it because this is like an especially egregious example.
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:04.340]   And it turns out, and again, like you can talk about any one specific example and it
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:07.620]   may or may not help fulfill the pattern, but this app was a legitimate app.
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:10.620]   It was not only picked by Apple for editorial review many times.
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:14.580]   It was featured in a bunch of tech publications and it seems like it's under new ownership
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:17.220]   and they didn't like the amount of money it was making and the person has a background
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:21.100]   in internet advertising, so they basically decided to scam as much money out of it as
[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:22.100]   they could.
[00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:26.740]   But it's been updated as a real legitimate people really liked it app for many years.
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:30.980]   So that's probably why it didn't get in the initial scrutiny it deserved.
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:34.940]   But also like you when you start arbitrating price, like if Apple comes in and says, your
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:38.780]   app is not and this is also Neil cyborg's been making these arguments too.
[00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:42.380]   If Apple starts coming in and saying, well, your app is really only worth $5 a month and
[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:45.380]   your app is really only worth $10 a month.
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:48.180]   It's like it's one of those things where we get angry at Twitter and Facebook about it.
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:51.300]   It's like, who are you to arbiter, but also why aren't you arbitering?
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:56.260]   And it's a very difficult line to walk between allowing enough freedom and dictating enough
[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:57.260]   control.
[00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:00.820]   And the last thing I'll add is I've talked to Apple engineers and Google engineers on
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:04.580]   Google Play and YouTube engineers about this problem in general.
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:07.340]   And the consistent answer I've gotten and these are all really good people.
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:11.220]   These aren't people you think are like, like enjoy the scam aspect of it.
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:17.060]   These are like really caring, considerate, creator first, user first people is that at
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:23.140]   this scale of user generated content, it is almost impossible to get every edge case.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:26.820]   So they work on the middle, like they try to make sure the middle is as solid as possible
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:31.780]   knowing that they'll ban some people by accident on one end and they'll allow some scams through
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:36.500]   on the other and they'll keep adjusting where that middle is because it's always changing.
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:41.180]   And they're facing incredibly well funded bad actors whose only mission it is to get these
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:45.300]   apps and these scams on in the minute they change something, those apps are changing things
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:46.300]   too.
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:50.980]   So it's continual cat and mouse and whack them all and they put a ton of resources into
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:54.620]   it, but they just will be honest and admit that it is not a solved problem at their scale
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.620]   yet.
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.620]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:02.020]   I would address one point though that Apple already is making those kind of value judgments
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:07.940]   for the who are there is an argument to be made as silly as it is that, well, who are
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:11.100]   you to decide that I can't have a fart app on my iPhone?
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:15.100]   It's like if you're rejecting my app because you don't think it adds value, maybe if there
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:20.220]   are 500 people amongst the entire user base that thinks it has incredible value, who are
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:23.580]   you to decide that those people shouldn't have access to an app that they want.
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:28.740]   So it's not it's not a great extension to basically have them look at problems like that, especially
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:35.540]   given how old this kind of scam is where companies will swoop in find a an app that has probably
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:39.940]   played itself out in terms of its earning a potential for its original creator, say,
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:43.580]   Hey, we'll give you a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for for rights to your app.
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.700]   And then basically guess what we're going to rebuild it.
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:47.020]   We're gonna have all kinds of trackers in it now.
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.260]   We're gonna have all kinds of malware in it right now.
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:50.820]   We're gonna change the pricing schedule.
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.180]   So you're absolutely right.
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.180]   And I've had this.
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:54.180]   I've had the exact same.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:57.900]   It's a little bit heartbreaking when you're talking to engineers and executives who are
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:02.620]   working these problems that know that all they can do is control the rate of the flooding.
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:04.460]   They can't stop the flooding at all.
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:08.660]   They know that and if they if they do their jobs really, really well, all they can do
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:12.820]   is stop the rate of flooding from increasing incredibly.
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.140]   So it is it is a heartbreaking thing to take a look at.
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:20.780]   However, it is something that whenever you find an incident like this, you are hoping
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:25.660]   that it is lighting fires in the right places and making the mass questions about how can
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.220]   we do this a little bit better.
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:32.220]   And once again, it is this is a particular just one of my little buttons that again,
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:35.700]   if a company, whether it's Google, whether it's Facebook, whether it's Twitter, whether
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:41.700]   it's anybody wants to dunk on its competitors saying, Oh, we are more private or we do a
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:45.540]   better content creation than these other people who are not being responsible.
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:50.660]   Again, you have to open up the floor to Q and A and the people who know the whole breadth
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:55.620]   of the story are going to start asking questions about, okay, but what about this?
[01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:59.860]   If you are saying that this is that people, this is a defining characteristic of your service
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:06.100]   over your competitors, can you absolutely just can you absolutely back that up without
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:10.740]   having to be be be sued and have a deposition process which we can actually get access to
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.740]   your internal emails.
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:16.380]   I would just have someone monitoring that dude's Twitter account and then just yoke any app
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.940]   that he tweets about almost immediately.
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.380]   I mean, I got to point out the first road and monitor the top 100.
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:25.540]   The Verge wrote this article in April of last year.
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.260]   This is not a new problem.
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:32.940]   I don't see how why Apple couldn't say, let's just check everything that charges more than
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:38.260]   say $5 a week or make $10 a week and just check it.
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:40.020]   There's a top 100 in his category, right?
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:43.700]   Because that one person who's job is every day to look at the top 100 apps because those
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:47.220]   are the why I really question their desire to do that.
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:50.300]   I just don't think they want to do that.
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:53.220]   I don't think if they don't do that, I think they should stop saying you could trust us
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:54.900]   with the App Store.
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:55.900]   Period.
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.740]   I know you guys.
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:59.580]   I know Alex, you disagree.
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.420]   No, I did ask someone, not Apple.
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:03.260]   I don't want to say who it is because I don't want anyone in the bad life.
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:06.580]   But I did ask someone fairly high up at a not Apple company who has a similar problem.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:08.620]   And they're like, why can't you just look at the top 100 of that?
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:11.380]   And he's like, because that's the top 100 that got through.
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:14.460]   We stopped the 300,000 other ones that didn't get through.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.460]   Good.
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.180]   And we see the ones on Twitter that break through.
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:18.180]   Good.
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:22.860]   But it's one of those things where the failures are reported and the successes never are.
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.860]   Yeah, you tell that to my mom.
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:25.860]   OK?
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:26.860]   Just tell them to my mom.
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:28.860]   I agree with you.
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:29.860]   It's not.
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:37.140]   People are spending hundreds of dollars unnecessarily and Apple's getting 30%.
[01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:41.740]   But two Apple's credit, I really, really do enjoy the fact that they're handling subscriptions
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:47.460]   at their end and that it's usually possible to me to simply say, oh, I didn't know I was
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:48.460]   being charged for this.
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:49.460]   Boom.
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:50.460]   Guess what?
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:54.420]   Next time you try to build Apple for this stuff, you're not going to be allowed to get that
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:55.420]   charge through.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:59.660]   I've had a lot of them where I've complained about it and they'll say, like, when did
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:02.700]   I've gone back and said these last six months, I just didn't notice that I was getting charged
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.860]   for this and it gets sent back to me.
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:08.020]   It just goes, I think Apple's like, OK, you know, and I don't know what happens to the
[01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:11.700]   developer on the other end of that because they probably just take, just clons it away
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.540]   from them, hands it back to me.
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:17.380]   So it doesn't, you know, like, so I think that it, I've had a lot of pretty amazing experiences
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:21.620]   with just being able to complain about the fact that I had this thing and there's a whole
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:23.500]   of the system on your thing to do that.
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.500]   So it's--
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.700]   So, Apple's new logo should be let the buyer beware.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.100]   It's up to you to find this.
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.100]   Ask us for a refund.
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:30.100]   We'll give it to you.
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:33.340]   Well, I, again, I just think that we're keeping pretty naive.
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.820]   I'm trying to bring it.
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:38.620]   Pretty naive when you have it, when you have a platform that lets you publish from a swift
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:42.300]   playground, you know, the number that it's just the sheer numbers are on.
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:43.300]   OK, fine.
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:45.580]   Apple should say, "You can't trust us.
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.340]   The sheer numbers are overwhelming.
[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:48.540]   We'll do our best."
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.380]   Not, "You can trust us.
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:51.380]   There's a difference."
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:55.620]   But they do say, well, I mean, if they can't do the job, they shouldn't claim they're doing
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:57.620]   the job.
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:01.340]   By the, by that, you should say nothing is safe ever, ever.
[01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:02.340]   Like nothing is safe.
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:06.820]   Like if you say if you can't do that, there's no, there's nothing safe if you, if you, if
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:12.900]   you don't allow for, you know, a point, oh, I mean, you shouldn't get on a plane because
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:14.660]   I've seen news where planes go down.
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:18.260]   You know, like it's, but the percentages are probably not that far apart.
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:21.820]   You know, like, you know, and so the, of how many scamming apps and how many, and how many
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:24.580]   planes go down, probably pretty close in percentage.
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.420]   And so the thing is, is that so if we say that we shouldn't fly because, or we shouldn't
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:29.260]   get in a, you definitely should not get in a car.
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:30.260]   But Delta should not have a car.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:31.260]   Because cars are safe.
[01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:33.180]   Our planes never crash.
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:35.180]   And they don't, by the way.
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.180]   And Apple does.
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:37.180]   They say, you know, you can trust us.
[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:38.180]   So everything's safe.
[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:39.180]   This is good.
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:40.180]   But my mom wants to buy an app.
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:42.180]   It must be safe because it's approved in the app store.
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:46.020]   I don't, I think I completely disagree with you.
[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:55.060]   I think Apple is abrogating its responsibility.
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:59.820]   And somebody, you can't, it's not doing Apple or consumers any favors say, oh, you're doing
[01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:01.060]   the best you can.
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:02.380]   You keep on keeping on keeping on.
[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.620]   Oh, I would say they're doing significantly better than everyone else.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:09.740]   Now you got to get, this is me acquiescing to this because if it was me, I'd have Apple
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:11.140]   curate everything.
[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:14.980]   I'd have them, you know, like go very slowly, it'd be hard to publish.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.580]   And then you have all the developers upset that it takes them so long to get to their
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:20.500]   app because there'd be a two year wait to get to publish.
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.500]   All you have to do is write it as a consumer.
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.260]   I'd be able to do this as it charges more than five bucks a week.
[01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:26.780]   Let's have somebody look at that.
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:29.980]   And if it's a hundred thousand apps, well, how many do you think it is?
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.420]   Is it a hundred thousand apps?
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:32.420]   It could be.
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:33.420]   It could be.
[01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:36.060]   Get five people to look at it.
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.460]   I think that's doable.
[01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:39.860]   Apple is a three trillion dollar company.
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:43.380]   I don't think we're asking too much for that.
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:44.380]   I don't.
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:45.380]   I really.
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:50.380]   I do think that we should have reasonable expectations that I do believe that it's never
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:51.980]   something they're going to solve completely.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:56.860]   However, I also, but I agree with most of what the rest of what you're saying that again,
[01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:58.500]   take the drinking game.
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:01.020]   The drinking game phrase is dunking on competitors.
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:05.820]   Again, if Apple's going to make this a reason for people to buy their platform instead of
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:10.020]   someone else's, they are they are helped to be held to a much higher degree of responsibility
[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:12.140]   than any of their competitors.
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:15.660]   And also, I also don't like the when the arguments made though.
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:19.380]   Well, there are there's they only have so many people they can put on this task.
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:21.780]   So hire more people if it becomes a problem.
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:25.900]   It's have you ever hired more than a hundred people have you ever hired more than a hundred
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:29.380]   people because I've hired 30 and I get, you know, in six months and I can tell you that
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:32.860]   it was it is a horribly hard process to get to do.
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:33.860]   I think Apple's.
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:37.860]   No, I'm saying I'm saying what I'm saying though is that to pick the right people for
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:41.740]   the right team and to get them to fit in and not have them be problematic and not have
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:42.740]   all the other things.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.740]   It's not like just to say, Oh, we should hire a thousand or two thousand or three thousand
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:49.580]   more people that are technically sufficient to do what we're trying to do inside of a
[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:50.900]   highly competitive market.
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:51.900]   Good luck.
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:52.900]   You know, good luck with that.
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:55.380]   You know, the thing is that when people say, oh, they should just hire more people.
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:57.300]   They are not they have never done it.
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:03.860]   Nobody who nobody was ever done that at mass ever ever says that nobody only people who
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:04.860]   never had to hire a hundred people.
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:06.980]   I'm so adept at making excuses for Apple.
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:08.700]   I just don't understand why you know, I'm not.
[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:10.260]   There's lots of things I don't like about Apple.
[01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:13.300]   I just don't I just think that this is not I would just it's just not you're not being
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:14.300]   practical.
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:17.140]   Like, you know, like the thing is is that there are these are these are things that are these
[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.140]   are hard problems.
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:21.300]   And anytime someone says something simple, you generally know they don't know about it.
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:24.500]   They don't know about it because if they knew about it, they don't understand how complicated
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.500]   it was.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.980]   Now, now I absolutely need to respond to that.
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:32.980]   I know I have not hired 30, 30 hundred people at one time.
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:39.180]   However, over my 20 some one actually 30 years as a tech reporter, I have had one on one
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:48.180]   conversations with CEOs of companies that have 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 110,000 people worldwide.
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:52.180]   Some of those conversations do get into operations, things like that on situations that are
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:57.580]   not dissimilar to that and the acknowledgement in so many words is that it's not a question
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.700]   of being able to do it or not being able to do it.
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:05.300]   It's a question of priorities or not priorities, which is a rational response to that to that
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:06.460]   sort of question.
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:11.220]   However, no time at no point have I ever raised that question and got the answer that no,
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:16.060]   it's just too difficult for us to hire 2,000 people that have the respect that we want.
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:20.820]   Every single I can't I don't want to drift into things I'm not allowed to talk about.
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:26.060]   But when a company is launching an entirely new product category that they have never
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:32.460]   even been tangentially involved in before, they're essentially launching a company with
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:37.380]   with 3,000 people with that is a priority for this enormous company.
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:39.300]   They find those 3,000 people.
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:45.300]   So I will dismiss your insistence that the fact that I haven't hired 30 people means
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:50.660]   that I am unaware of the limitations of hiring and what can and cannot be done by a large
[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:55.580]   company that has a sense of its own priorities and its resources because so many people are
[01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:58.940]   having such an easy time hiring people right now.
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:00.980]   I hear it's super easy right now.
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.860]   The job market is super open.
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:07.500]   If I were going to try to make some money right now, I would create a clone world app
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.860]   in the app store that had a yearly subscription.
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:14.580]   Oh, wait, I admit that as a FSC is already a nine of them.
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:16.700]   Every day should be an NFT that we mint Leo.
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:20.740]   That's how we maximize revenue on this.
[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:27.180]   Wertle the app, which is not created by Joseph Josh Wartle who said all his entire time it's
[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:28.340]   going to be free.
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:30.100]   No ads.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:36.180]   Wertle the app is $10 a week, by the way, just in case you want to want to play this.
[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:37.180]   Just in case.
[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:45.140]   Oh my God, that developer, they must have a heart of purest 24 karat gold because they
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:51.180]   must get their inbox is filled with, hi, I'll give you $800,000 for to take over this
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:52.580]   code project for you.
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:57.380]   We would like to load up that website with all kinds of stuff that would make us cajillions
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:01.100]   of dollars and because we're evil people, we can sleep late at night.
[01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:04.780]   Nice thing about actually it's only $30 a year.
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:05.780]   I take it back.
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:06.780]   It's cheap.
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:09.380]   The only thing about it is you can do more than five letter words.
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:10.380]   That's cool.
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:15.020]   You're getting something of value and you get a nice little trophy and you can share it with
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:16.020]   your friends.
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.780]   Let's take a little break.
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:18.780]   Come back.
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:19.780]   There is more to talk about.
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:22.660]   In fact, if you want to get upset, let's get upset at T-Mobile.
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:23.660]   I'm upset.
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:28.660]   But first, a word from BetterHelp.
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:30.540]   Maybe I need this right now.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:31.540]   Maybe I do.
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:35.020]   Actually, I don't want to breach confidence.
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:42.340]   I have close friends who have used BetterHelp therapy online who have gotten such great value
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:43.340]   of it out of it.
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:46.700]   In fact, the other day I was talking to somebody who said, "Oh, yeah, I found out that this
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:54.380]   incredible service through my therapist at BetterHelp that is available to all she's
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:55.380]   using it for her son."
[01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:56.860]   It's really a neat story.
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:57.860]   BetterHelp.
[01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:02.340]   By the way, the timing couldn't be better as we are stuck here inside once again.
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:06.100]   BetterHelp, if something's preventing you from achieving your goals, if something's
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:09.900]   interfering with your happiness, if you feel anxiety in the pit of your stomach, check
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:13.660]   out betterhelp.com/macbreak.
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:18.460]   BetterHelp is a place to talk to a licensed professional therapist.
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:19.460]   It's safe.
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:20.460]   It's private.
[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:21.460]   It's online.
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:22.460]   It's so easy.
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:23.460]   You can start communicating in under 48 hours.
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:25.420]   Now, I want to be very clear.
[01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:29.460]   This is not a crisis line.
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:30.460]   That's not what we're offering here.
[01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:32.020]   It's not self-help.
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:35.420]   It's professional counseling done securely online.
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:39.740]   You can send a message to your counselor anytime you get timely and thoughtful responses.
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:43.740]   You could schedule a weekly video or if you don't want to be on camera phone sessions,
[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:45.060]   that's fine too.
[01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:48.100]   You never have to sit in an uncomfortable waiting room.
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:49.740]   It's completely private.
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:52.900]   It's really a great way to get the help you need.
[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:53.940]   There's no stigma with this.
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:58.180]   This is about talking to somebody that's going to understand that's going to make a
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:13:59.940]   difference in your life.
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:03.060]   BetterHelp is committed to facilitating great therapeutic matches.
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.980]   They do something I think is really, really important.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:08.660]   They make it easy and free to change counselors if needed.
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:12.780]   That is because as good as any counselor might be, they may not be right for you.
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:18.340]   You want to find the person that's the perfect match for you and BetterHelp makes that easy
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:20.620]   and it doesn't cost you anything.
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:24.660]   It's of course more affordable than traditional offline counseling.
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:26.780]   They even have financial aid.
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:27.980]   It's available globally.
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:29.700]   It's worldwide.
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:32.100]   You can find the particular expertise you need online.
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:35.420]   You don't have to limit yourself to counselors located near you.
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:40.740]   Finding the therapist you need, if you're just looking locally in the phone book, it's
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:43.420]   because Tough with BetterHelp, it's very easy.
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:48.100]   You can get licensed professional counselors, specialized in almost anything that might
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:49.100]   be bugging you.
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:57.020]   Depression, stress, anxiety, relationships, sleeping, trauma, anger, family conflicts,
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:01.460]   LBG2, Q matters, grief, self-esteem.
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:04.060]   Of course, anything you share is confidential.
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:05.900]   It's completely professional.
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:09.300]   It's really convenient, very affordable.
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:15.660]   All you have to do if you don't trust me is to look at the testimonials that people post
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:18.220]   every day on their site.
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:23.580]   I know people, many who have used BetterHelp, who are very, very happy.
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:25.340]   So many people are using BetterHelp.
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:28.140]   They're recruiting additional counselors in all 50 states.
[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:33.820]   This is a thing we need these days.
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:35.780]   I want you to start living a happier life today.
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:36.940]   I don't want you to suffer.
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:38.100]   There's no need to.
[01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:45.620]   If you're a listener, you're going to get 10% off your first month, just go to betterhelp.com/macbreak.
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:47.460]   This is a sponsor I can really support.
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:54.740]   BetterHelp, B-E-T-T-E-R-H-E-L-P, BetterHelp.com/macbreak.
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:59.500]   Over a million people have taken charge of their mental health.
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.540]   Macbreak weekly, folks, you're not immune either.
[01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:03.540]   It's okay.
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:04.540]   There's nothing wrong with it.
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.820]   Why suffer when you go to betterhelp.com/macbreak?
[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:09.700]   That's almost about it.
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:11.700]   Betterhelp.com/macbreak.
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:16.140]   I'm a little miffed with T-Mobile.
[01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:20.340]   Maybe there's a little miffed.
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:24.900]   Apple announced this really great thing called Private Relay.
[01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:31.340]   It's basically a little bit like a VPN that you can use in your smartphone with your iPhone.
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:32.540]   It's automatically on.
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:34.900]   If you're an iCloud subscriber, you get it.
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:36.900]   I think it's automatically available.
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:38.420]   I think the user has to turn it on.
[01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:39.420]   It's not on by default.
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.900]   In beta, it's not on by default.
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:42.900]   Once it's public, it's going to be...
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:44.300]   I use to subscribe to iCloud Plus to get it.
[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.700]   iCloud Plus.
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:46.700]   Not just any iCloud accounts.
[01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:47.700]   You actually have storage.
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:48.700]   Yeah.
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:53.140]   If you're paying for iCloud, then you have it.
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:57.620]   I get it since I use Apple One, I'm getting it.
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:00.100]   T-Mobile is blocking it.
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:01.100]   They're going to start blocking it.
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:02.100]   I'm going with O2 and a whole bunch of it.
[01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:04.700]   A lot of European carriers as well.
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:10.780]   Now, they're saying the reason we block it, customers who choose plans and features with
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:16.060]   content filtering, for instance, parental controls, do not have access to the iCloud
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:20.500]   private relay because these services won't work otherwise.
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:24.940]   If you want them to work as designed, you can't use relay, but all other customers have
[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:27.260]   no restrictions.
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:32.260]   If you have content filtering, I don't have content filtering.
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:33.260]   That's not what they're...
[01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:35.500]   I mean, that's silly, as you know.
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:36.500]   It's because there's two things.
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:37.500]   One is there's selling data.
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:40.420]   Yeah, well, they're selling your data in mass.
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:42.420]   And number two is they packet-shape.
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:47.060]   They want to be able to force you down to a different...
[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:50.740]   For instance, if you open up a video app, they want to make sure that you're forced
[01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:56.460]   on the manifest down to a 480p signal, not the highest res that's available to you because
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:59.940]   that would use their network harder.
[01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:03.420]   There's a little bit of an argument for the packet-shaping thing that they do, but not
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:04.420]   really.
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:08.020]   You're paying for that connection so you should be able to get what you want to get.
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:10.500]   The content filtering is obviously a red herring.
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:11.500]   Yeah.
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:12.500]   Well, it's hard.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:16.860]   I'm kind of sorry the T-Mobile got lumped into what a lot of the international carriers
[01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:17.860]   are doing.
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:21.980]   The international carriers are simply saying, "We want no part of this for the reasons
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:25.860]   that we've discussed, that we make a lot of revenue and we can make a lot more profits
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:29.020]   if we have absolute access to your traffic."
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:30.020]   Right.
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:34.180]   However, T-Mobile, they did quickly clarify that we're not shutting it down for everybody.
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:43.660]   I tell somebody who has more knowledge about this, about how T-Mobile packages these services
[01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:48.380]   can explain to me how those services work, I'm willing to at least give them a little
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:51.260]   bit of the benefit of the depth because they're not shutting it down on everybody.
[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:54.780]   They're saying, "If you have these services that require us to take a look at what your
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:19:00.980]   traffic is so that we can, at your request, block content that you don't want to find
[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:02.980]   us with your phone, that's legitimate."
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:07.900]   I mean, even Wikipedia after the service was announced was saying that, "Okay, we're
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:13.380]   going to have to ask people how they feel about this because we're using IP identification
[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:18.660]   as a way of validating that the person, the editor who's trying to edit or manage one
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:23.620]   of these Wikipedia pages is who they say they are because we recognize this IP address.
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:26.500]   If you're hiding your IP address, we can't validate that.
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:30.860]   So we are considering forcing people to turn that feature off if they want to continue
[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:32.260]   to edit certain pages.
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:34.180]   It's causing certain knock-on effects.
[01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:39.700]   So it's not as though every time there's a restriction on a service or provider decides
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:44.980]   to restrict access or use of the service, it's necessarily them being scummy.
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:49.540]   However, I think every service that does this has to demonstrate that, no, there is
[01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:55.060]   an actual legitimate verifiable technical reason why we think that this service causes
[01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:57.660]   a problem for certain products that we're creating.
[01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:01.980]   But again, mostly it is going to be, we want to manage our network our own way, which is
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:06.900]   limited, kind of neutral evil because there is an argument that we want to be able to
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:14.140]   shape, to have you not stream necessarily 4K on your phone if you don't have to.
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:17.660]   But mostly again, to prevent them from trying to profiteer if you can just simply flip a
[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:21.300]   switch on your iPhone and lock out a lot of what's possible there.
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:28.460]   In fact, I have to update this because as you show, Mark Gurman just tweeted about
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:32.460]   45 minutes ago, "Over night, our team identified..."
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:34.380]   This is a T-Mobile response to Mark Gurman.
[01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:39.620]   "Over night, our team identified that in the iOS 15.2 release, some device settings default
[01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:41.860]   to the feature being toggled off.
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:42.860]   We've shared this with Apple.
[01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:44.820]   This is not specific to T-Mobile.
[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:48.100]   Again though, we have not broadly blocked iCloud private.
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:54.580]   They say iCloud is a private relay is only blocked if you have turned on content filtering,
[01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:56.500]   otherwise it should not be turned off."
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.300]   So that does make sense.
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:00.180]   The Europeans are on the other hand.
[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:01.180]   They are doing it.
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:04.980]   I have to point out T-Mobile is Deutsche Telekom.
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:07.980]   They are in Europe as well and I think they are doing it in Europe.
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:10.100]   I also turn it off myself sometimes.
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:13.300]   If I'm uploading a big file sometimes it's just taking forever, I turn off private relay
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:17.100]   because that relay has extra whatever roadblocks and the way it just goes.
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:18.100]   I guess it's important.
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:20.980]   It is important to note that it's not perf.
[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:21.980]   There's a good reason to have that.
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:22.980]   It's like a VPN.
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:23.980]   I have the same...
[01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:24.980]   It's basically easy.
[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:25.980]   It's just easy VPN.
[01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:28.980]   That's what you call it.
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:30.860]   They don't because you can't...
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:32.860]   What is it?
[01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:36.220]   Geohop, like you can for some VPN to get that fiction.
[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:39.500]   In fact, at least it does country.
[01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:43.420]   And you can say, and in fact I have allow it to be a little more specific like it knows
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:44.420]   I'm in Petaloma.
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:45.420]   For the Brits, right?
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:46.420]   You want your Starbucks.
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:47.660]   You don't want Starbucks to go to Boston.
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:49.540]   You want Starbucks to come to you.
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:50.540]   Exactly.
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:51.540]   Exactly.
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:55.740]   So yeah, there are always going to be a little bit of some drawbacks using a VPN.
[01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:59.660]   So those are, I guess, biting Apple a little bit.
[01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:01.860]   But I think that with all of these, what we're seeing...
[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:04.900]   You know, Apple will put it up and then people will react to it and then Apple will tighten
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:05.900]   in a little bit.
[01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:09.940]   And what I think you're constantly seeing is Apple constantly looking at privacy and not
[01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:13.620]   necessarily, again, closing all the gates at one time.
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:17.580]   But they're just slowly just moving the gates very, very slowly.
[01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:18.580]   I love it.
[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:21.740]   This is all part of a bigger program of app transparency.
[01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:22.740]   Yeah, sure.
[01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:24.060]   It doesn't have a lot of teeth yet.
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:30.180]   But if you start looking at all of these as a unified process, what you're seeing is Apple
[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:35.220]   slowly closing everything in and making it more and more private and harder and more
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:38.940]   and more opaque to advertisers and everyone tracking us.
[01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:43.060]   But it does show how difficult this process is going to be.
[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:47.540]   If people start using this feature and things stop breaking, if the things that they're
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:51.740]   counting on using stop working, that's not a result that Apple wants.
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:54.860]   And then suddenly Facebook will not log them in automatically.
[01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:58.500]   If the Facebook says, "Ooh, you're logging in from a brand new IP address."
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:02.500]   Therefore, we're going to demand two-factor authentication right now to make sure that
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:04.260]   you are who you say you are.
[01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:06.340]   That's going to be a reason for a lot of people to say, "You know what?
[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:10.180]   I'm going to turn this feature off and I don't have a need to turn it on ever again."
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:13.500]   So I think there's a reason why this is an extended beta.
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:16.060]   I don't think they're necessarily having trouble implementing it.
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:19.860]   I think they're having trouble making sure that people will turn that on, get the benefits
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:23.860]   of it and not find a good reason to turn it off.
[01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:31.780]   And every one of these becomes kind of a game of chicken where you basically decide, "Oh,
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:33.980]   I can't use this service.
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:38.180]   Do I care about my security and privacy and I'm just not going to use that service anymore?"
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:41.700]   In some cases, like Facebook, someone might not choose that, but they might choose it.
[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:47.140]   Like, for instance, when things start, you might choose those services over the privacy.
[01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:49.060]   But as things move forward.
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:56.620]   When I started to, when Apple Pay came out, I prioritized places, obviously, that had
[01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:57.620]   Apple Pay.
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:58.620]   I just was like, "Cool.
[01:23:58.620 --> 01:23:59.620]   It was something I wanted to test."
[01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:01.780]   But I still pay in a lot of other places.
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:05.460]   At this point, if I go to a retail place and they don't have Apple Pay, I just set the
[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:06.780]   objects down and leave.
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:08.260]   Like literally, I don't even take them back.
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:10.660]   I just leave them on the counter like, "You should do that."
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:12.580]   And I walk out.
[01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:18.500]   And so the only place I'll pay for anything without Apple Pay is the farmer's market.
[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:26.140]   And so I think that, again, these are progressions of things that happen over years.
[01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:30.460]   And so this is just step one.
[01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:35.300]   And they'll find out ways to still make money off of people even if private relay is a thing
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:38.060]   that they can't work around.
[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:39.060]   Yeah.
[01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:40.060]   Sure.
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:46.380]   I have to say, Greg Conne, five and I were talking before the show about how much we love
[01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:49.100]   our new M1 MacBook Pros.
[01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:51.740]   I bought the base model 14-inch thinking, "Oh, I'm sad.
[01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:52.820]   I'm not going to get the max."
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:55.060]   And I think it's fantastic.
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:56.540]   It's the best laptop I've ever had.
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:57.900]   He kind of agrees.
[01:24:57.900 --> 01:25:04.220]   So I have to say, on the one hand, I'm a little sad to report that Intel has stolen Jeff Wilcox
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:06.180]   from Apple.
[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:10.380]   On the other hand, if I really think about it, it's good because Intel should be making
[01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:12.220]   such great chips too.
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.020]   It would be a good thing.
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:15.020]   Wilcox.
[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:16.020]   I love you guys.
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:20.140]   And now, in Intel, Wilcox, I mean, Apple's going to spread silicon across to the world.
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:26.900]   Wilcox came to Apple eight years ago from Intel to really design the M1 architecture.
[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:31.740]   He's director of Max System Architecture, was director of Max System Architecture.
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:33.500]   He's moved on.
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:34.980]   He's gone back to Intel.
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:37.820]   He's an Intel Fellow in the Design Engineering Group.
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:39.940]   He's a CTO there.
[01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:46.220]   And so he'll be involved in designing systems on a chip for Intel.
[01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:49.860]   The reality is we have to remember that the trajectory of a chip, the part that he does
[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:53.020]   on a chip is probably three, four, five years out.
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:57.900]   So Apple's probably not-- most of those things have been already figured out as far as what
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:59.660]   needs to actually happen there.
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:02.460]   So does it change as Apple's trajectory?
[01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:03.460]   Probably not a lot.
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:08.660]   However, for Intel, bringing someone with that capacity and that history into it really
[01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:15.180]   gives them a huge shot in the arm to be competitive for five years, maybe six, seven, eight years
[01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:16.180]   out.
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:19.900]   Because from the time people start doing designs to the time it ends up in silicon and ends
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:22.380]   up in mass production is a long time.
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:27.380]   And I just kick myself because I should have become a chip designer, not a podcaster.
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:28.380]   But--
[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:30.820]   What a lost all of us.
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:32.980]   I don't chip Leo or--
[01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:33.980]   Yeah, Kettlechips.
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:34.980]   Yeah, Kettlechips.
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:35.980]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:36.980]   Pringles, I was thinking.
[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:37.980]   But--
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:38.980]   Pera.
[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:39.980]   Pera chips.
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:44.700]   We mentioned last week that Apple has apparently being paying a $180,000 bonuses to engineers
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:46.620]   to keep them from leaving.
[01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:54.260]   Intel has a $2.4 billion fund to attract new talent or old talent back.
[01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:55.260]   Facebook, too.
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:57.540]   I mean, that's not a huge theory.
[01:26:57.540 --> 01:26:59.980]   Jeff probably cashed a pretty big check.
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:02.540]   A good time to be an A-list engineer right now.
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:08.820]   No, that's-- if only the entire workforce everywhere was treated this way.
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:11.300]   You have an amazing set of gifts.
[01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:15.580]   Now that you've done this wonderful project, you're that much more valuable on the open
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:16.580]   market.
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:20.780]   So if your current company is not giving you the entire package that you deserve, there
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:25.700]   will be another company that will be more than happy to pay for your package.
[01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:26.700]   Eric, just giving you a third--
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:27.700]   What?
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:28.700]   It's usually better, right?
[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:32.380]   Like they can justify-- like a pillaging bonus more than they can usually justify salary
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:33.380]   being a pillaging bonus.
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:34.380]   Yes.
[01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:35.380]   I'm taking a pillaging bonus.
[01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:37.460]   Yeah, people who hop around get more money.
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:40.980]   Because people under-- and your compatriots understand it.
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:44.020]   If Bob or Sarah gets a bigger raise than I do, I'm mad.
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:47.500]   But if they had to bring Bob or Sarah in, I understand they had to pay extra to attract
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:48.500]   them.
[01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:49.500]   I'm not so grumpy.
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.380]   I mean, that's just the way this works.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:53.580]   And I think that he's more valuable at Intel than he is at Apple.
[01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:57.140]   I mean, Apple probably had an opportunity to match something to do it.
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:00.780]   And they probably made a decision that they didn't need his services as much as Intel
[01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:01.780]   was willing to pay him.
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:04.100]   I'm sure that it was huge.
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:09.580]   And the thing is that for the-- and engineers, all of these companies are getting $1,000,000,
[01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:10.580]   $180,000.
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:12.580]   It's cute.
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:16.940]   But I know if you folks that get bigger stock bonuses than that.
[01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:20.580]   And so that's not a big stock bonus to be thrown at somebody to make sure that they don't go
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:21.580]   anywhere.
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:25.820]   And so those golden handcuffs can get really thick.
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:31.420]   And so especially slow vesting ones and that type of-- so I think that, again, I don't
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:33.700]   think Apple necessarily looks at Intel.
[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:37.060]   It probably looks at Apple more as a competitor because they're losing all their business.
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:40.540]   I don't think Apple is that worried about Intel catching up anytime soon.
[01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:44.260]   Apple really is serving its own market as effectively as it possibly can.
[01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:48.620]   And it's not head-to-head in the same way.
[01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:51.100]   So but Intel definitely has to come up to speed.
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:54.460]   And the only thing that's worth adding is that they're-- sorry, Andy, go ahead.
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:29:00.740]   I was just going to quickly off of that saying, Intel is in a very, very different sort of
[01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:01.740]   business than Apple.
[01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:05.780]   Is Apple is building specific chips specifically for actual products that they are going to
[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:07.500]   be building from end to end?
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:12.500]   And they don't have dominance in the market on any of those laptop or desktop markets.
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:17.100]   Whereas Intel, they are creating the grease for the gears of industry.
[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:21.500]   They have to build a chipsets that are going to satisfy every type of computer that's going
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:25.660]   to be made, supporting every single type of industry that's all over the world.
[01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:31.260]   So they definitely are missing a few clubs from their bag and definitely hiring people
[01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:34.940]   that can give them some of the skills that they're missing right now.
[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:42.060]   But that doesn't mean that Intel is a doomed company because benchmarking on an M1 MacBook
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:46.020]   is much, much higher than on a comparable Intel-based laptop.
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:50.460]   And one thing, you see this a lot in the industry.
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:52.900]   It's like, why don't all stores just copy the Apple store?
[01:29:52.900 --> 01:29:54.620]   And on all stores just copy IP.
[01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:58.500]   I don't all chip companies just copy what Apple's own with Apple Silicon.
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:02.500]   And it's usually not the engineers that are the differences, often like a philosophical
[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:03.500]   thing.
[01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.940]   Beyond what Andy said, which is really true, Apple doesn't have to work as a Silicon
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:06.940]   merchant.
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:07.940]   Like they just don't.
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:11.460]   And the realities of not having to satisfy the various different needs of a bunch of other
[01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:16.940]   vendors is huge, but also Apple invested 10 years in this architecture.
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:21.380]   Like I'll joke that Apple keeps using the same bionic term again, but it's the architecture.
[01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:24.820]   And they put it down and they iterate year after year and they put up with headlines
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:28.060]   saying Apple can't innovate when Apple's like, we're not trying to innovate.
[01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:30.060]   In 10 years, we want to hit this target.
[01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:34.860]   And that takes very patient steady progress every year.
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:38.780]   And we've seen this now with the NUVA people who left Apple and went to work at Qualcomm.
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:42.660]   And we may see it with Wilcox at Intel is unless you have that sort of management.
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:48.260]   Like Johnny Saruji was willing to invest in this low, slow, wide approach, which was
[01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:50.220]   the complete opposite of what Intel wanted.
[01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:53.460]   They wanted a fire hose in every chipset.
[01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:58.060]   And they thought Apple was dumb and Qualcomm did not understand 64-bit when Apple was like,
[01:30:58.060 --> 01:30:59.060]   it's not 64-bit.
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:02.860]   We got armed to write us our own ISA basically.
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:04.620]   These were all decade long bets.
[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:08.900]   And a lot of them don't have the patience or the management to set those up.
[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:12.500]   So what they're able to accomplish there is going to be different, but hopefully good
[01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:13.500]   to see.
[01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:14.500]   Yeah.
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:17.100]   And I think there's a lot going on.
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:22.220]   A lot of what everyone needs to understand is that when you have a company as large as
[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:28.140]   Apple, as large as Intel, as large as Tesla, as large as any large innovative company,
[01:31:28.140 --> 01:31:30.900]   the MacBook is not necessarily Apple's product.
[01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:35.220]   Apple's product on an ongoing basis is the process, the resources, and the procedures
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:37.460]   that can create a product like that.
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:42.180]   And so we're just seeing the end result of Apple's eternal project, which is to make
[01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:47.980]   sure that whatever they want to do, they can execute on that plan and a very, very far
[01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:48.980]   forward basis.
[01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:55.180]   And even when a company on that scale has a failure per se, yes, the product is a consumer
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:56.180]   failure.
[01:31:56.180 --> 01:32:01.180]   However, the process that allowed this thing to be created and developed and manipulated
[01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:05.380]   is actually makes the company better and stronger, makes the next thing better and stronger.
[01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:10.180]   And I think the thing that makes Apple different as well, I mean, to just write on that, I
[01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:11.500]   completely agree with that.
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:19.340]   And the, Apple's ability that they write the operating system and design the end product
[01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:24.260]   and write many of the apps that are being used allows them to, you know, this, the silicon
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:27.140]   is a different beast for them completely.
[01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:28.460]   And it's all part of them owning that.
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:31.780]   And I think that we'll just see them continue to take over their own silicon across the board.
[01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:35.260]   I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if we get to a point where the iPhone is like a chip.
[01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:39.100]   There's like a chip and a handful of little components that stick to the chip, you know,
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:40.820]   and, and they just print them out that way.
[01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:43.740]   And so I think that that's where I think that Apple is going to keep on going because it
[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:46.500]   just gives them more control over their, over their destiny.
[01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:52.700]   I'm just checking to see if you wanted to buy a M1 MacBook right now.
[01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:54.740]   I'm going to say cleaning cloth.
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:33:00.300]   I don't know if the cleaning cloth is back in stock, but it's back in stock as of today.
[01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:02.300]   Oh, do you have a cleaning cloth?
[01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:03.300]   No.
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:05.620]   No, Renee, do you have a cleaning cloth?
[01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:08.180]   I think one came with the XDR display, but I'm.
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:09.180]   Yeah, it did.
[01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:10.900]   I don't know if that's the same.
[01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:12.620]   One is the $19 version that there's.
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:14.220]   I heard that they're very nice.
[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:15.220]   They've got apples.
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:20.180]   The logo is embedded in it, you know, heard they're very soft.
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:21.180]   They better be.
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:22.180]   I want a whole park.
[01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:23.180]   I think the word is.
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:24.180]   I think the word is supple.
[01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:25.180]   So it's good.
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:28.980]   So they're probably were like eight million of them in a container on a ship somewhere
[01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:29.980]   outside of Long Beach.
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:30.980]   The Los Angeles port.
[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:31.980]   Yeah.
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:32.980]   And they just arrived.
[01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:34.380]   So you can order them now.
[01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:35.380]   Yeah.
[01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:36.380]   M1 pros.
[01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:44.340]   At the stock model, not a BTO, February 2nd, this is on a 14 inch M1 Max March 4th.
[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:45.340]   And that's for the stock.
[01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:49.060]   If you add a little memory, it's no, it's still March 4th.
[01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:50.060]   That's good news.
[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:51.060]   I think that's a.
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:52.060]   Yeah.
[01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:53.060]   You're already.
[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:54.060]   Those are all in custom builds.
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:56.780]   Once they start, what about if you give it the next one up, 32 core?
[01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:58.980]   Oh, let's go all the way.
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:33:59.980]   There's 64.
[01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:00.980]   Yeah, it's just custom build.
[01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:02.660]   Yeah, just how long it takes to build.
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:03.660]   Yeah.
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:06.660]   That's a storage only 6,000 for a 14 inch.
[01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:08.740]   But man, that's that'd be a great.
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:12.540]   You know, I am, I have to say I was so sad because I wanted to get it right away so we
[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:13.540]   could talk about it.
[01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:21.660]   And so I had to get the base model 512 gigs of storage for crying out loud like an animal.
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:22.660]   Like an animal.
[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:24.380]   But it's really great.
[01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:26.860]   And you were absolutely right about the magsafe adapter.
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:28.740]   Alex, love it.
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:30.660]   Isn't it so nice?
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:31.660]   All those ports.
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:32.940]   I haven't used the HDMI port.
[01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:34.940]   But it feels good knowing it's there.
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:36.100]   But you have it.
[01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:37.100]   I have it.
[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:39.700]   I'm still using USB C. Don't hate me.
[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:40.700]   I'm still charging.
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:41.700]   I don't miss the touch bar.
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:42.700]   I'm on my lap.
[01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:44.900]   It's hysterical because it's CES last week.
[01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:49.060]   Dell effectively announced an XPS with a touch bar.
[01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:53.420]   Instead of functioning, it's got an electronic bar.
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:54.420]   It's like one.
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:56.220]   Like a shelf mouse.
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:57.660]   Someone started cropping out back then.
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:59.420]   And they finally came out the other end.
[01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:01.860]   I'm around to releasing it, I guess.
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:06.100]   At least it's not the only Windows laptop being put onto the market.
[01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.100]   OK, let's listen.
[01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:08.100]   That's true.
[01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:09.300]   You're not forced to get it.
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:14.500]   Although I like the XPS is I'm just a little disappointed that it also doesn't.
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:16.740]   It has something about the trackpad.
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:19.220]   It's a little weird with a because it doesn't.
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:20.220]   You can't see the outline.
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:21.220]   So it must.
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:22.220]   I don't know.
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:23.580]   There's some sort of weird trackpad.
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:27.340]   But you know, Apple, you did it right.
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:29.140]   You got rid of the touch bar.
[01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:31.860]   I kept the fingerprint, which works great.
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:35.700]   And you kept the and made even made the escape key even a little bit bigger.
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.580]   It was a huge recovery.
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:41.100]   And you wonder whether that's a Johnny I've did a lot of great things.
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:47.060]   But you wonder if him moving on created the space to like correct for form of a.
[01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:48.060]   It must have been.
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:51.060]   I have to think a battle inside of Apple.
[01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:53.220]   And Johnny says, no, no, we want thin.
[01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:54.220]   We want light.
[01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:55.220]   We want touch bar.
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:56.220]   It wasn't just Johnny, but it was a battle.
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:57.220]   Yeah.
[01:35:57.220 --> 01:36:03.060]   And somebody else, probably somebody uses e-max was saying, no, you need a escape key for
[01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:04.420]   crying out loud.
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:07.860]   And that person finally is somehow by sticking in.
[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:08.860]   Well, I think it helps.
[01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:10.660]   We can help all of us work a planning about it.
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:12.660]   Like everybody was complaining about the problem.
[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:17.420]   TLDR, like to my understanding, the TLDR was that that point when Steve came in and slapped
[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:20.460]   the iPad down on the table and said, why can't the Mac do this?
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:25.340]   It set this like series of dominoes down that was like, why don't we make the Mac more like
[01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:28.220]   mainstream, like friendly so that?
[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:32.420]   And they sold like the Mac that we hate, you know, I don't hate it as much as some people,
[01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:36.980]   but like that Mac sold so much like there was just such a market for what I'm going to
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:37.980]   call faux.
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:38.980]   I don't want to call it faux pros.
[01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:43.380]   That's mean, but people who self self identified as a pro but didn't have the same needs as
[01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:44.500]   a traditional pro.
[01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:48.340]   And that was a huge battle because the Mac department is filled with people like us,
[01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:51.340]   traditional Mac people who were not happy about it.
[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:54.940]   And over recent years, they've now they've now taken those reins back.
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:57.420]   And you can see it obviously in a product line.
[01:36:57.420 --> 01:36:58.420]   Yeah.
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:03.340]   The thing that bummed me out the most about that MacBook was simply that they didn't make
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:04.740]   it all that much thinner.
[01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:09.660]   They sacrificed so much all in the name of style and they didn't really seem to think
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:12.020]   any of these decisions through.
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:13.020]   And that's it.
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:17.900]   I'll keep saying it that the first time that I used a Mac with a touch bar and I had to
[01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:23.420]   take my hands off the keyboard and almost say out loud to myself, it really thinks I'm
[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:28.580]   going to take my hands off the keyboard to auto complete the word there.
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:31.380]   I'm going to tell you that's what these engineers thought.
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:32.380]   I was using this.
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:33.380]   No, they're there.
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:34.380]   Yeah.
[01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:38.020]   I think his problem was it was just the constant constantly hitting the mic for those things.
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:39.020]   It's a hell of a drug.
[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:40.460]   But they just been updated, right?
[01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:44.540]   Like they announced it in 2016 and they did nothing to it since then.
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:47.540]   And I never want to be more invested in a product than the company makes it.
[01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:48.540]   They didn't add haptics.
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:49.540]   They didn't add anything.
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:51.420]   It was they announced it and didn't lift it.
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:52.820]   And that's not a good sign.
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:55.620]   They didn't add the most important feature that they could have added to it, which is
[01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:59.260]   turn this darn thing off so I don't keep on accidentally hitting it with my hands.
[01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:01.740]   You know, like there was no button that just said, turn it all off.
[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:02.820]   Like just just make it black.
[01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:03.820]   Like that's what I do.
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:04.820]   I do.
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:05.820]   Monit was fine.
[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:06.820]   Getting out there.
[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:09.660]   I'm looking for actually, I can't wait to see what they do with the MacBook Airs because
[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:15.340]   there will be a beautiful elegant choice in a couple of months, I think, that will have
[01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:16.340]   the one.
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:18.620]   And it should be gorgeous.
[01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:20.620]   And that's going to be.
[01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:22.940]   Yeah, I might have to get another.
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:30.260]   If they take an iPad and iPad Pro with a smart keyboard and basically said, let's make the
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:35.180]   MacBook Air exactly like this except for instead of being some sort of laminated plastic cover,
[01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:36.740]   it will be all aluminum.
[01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:42.860]   Oh my goodness, what I it would be so hard for me not to just simply say, I want this.
[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:44.180]   I have the money for this.
[01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:45.620]   So I'm going to own this.
[01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:46.620]   Shut up, Andy.
[01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:49.180]   Shut up, dad voice.
[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:50.180]   We're owning this.
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:53.660]   I'm just saying I could be happier with that 14 inch M1 Pro.
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:58.300]   That's saying, if I was Apple, like my look, there's this, the shiller, everyone knows
[01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:02.140]   that the Tim Cook Doctrine, but the shiller doctrine was always that every product should
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:06.980]   be pushing so hard on top of the product on top of it that it forces that product to
[01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:10.260]   reevaluate its need to exist, like gladiatorial combat.
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:14.420]   And then those products need to reinvent new ways to stay important and push back on the
[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:15.740]   upcoming products.
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:19.340]   And I would just love if Apple's mentality was all those people on Twitter who keep asking
[01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:25.140]   for Mac OS on the iPad, we're going to make Max so good, so good that nobody who wants
[01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:28.300]   Mac OS would ever want to buy anything but a Mac.
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:30.900]   Like if they could make that their mission statement, it might be super happy.
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:31.900]   Yeah.
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:36.460]   And there is somebody in the chat room who says, how can you ignore the fact that Intel
[01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:42.820]   just announced at CES 60 new CPU models that are faster than the M1?
[01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:43.820]   Faster is easy.
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:47.780]   Like the key to beating any Apple silicon is just add voltage because Apple's never going
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:48.780]   to add voltage.
[01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:51.540]   They will reduce voltage to increase battery life.
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:55.220]   So if you tweak voltage, you will beat Apple on any benchmark ever, but it's like it's
[01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:56.220]   benchmarked at that point.
[01:39:56.220 --> 01:40:02.260]   It's like it's not, you know, professional power users don't use laptops, which is a
[01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:04.620]   little bizarre.
[01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:10.300]   And he also says programmers could get a buy on an atom processor.
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:12.340]   So he's obviously, it's always been easy to beat.
[01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:13.860]   But it's way too easy to beat Apple.
[01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:14.860]   And I think, you know, great.
[01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:20.060]   I'm glad Scaldor like, I mean, all their lake is fast and hot.
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:21.060]   And and you know what?
[01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:25.460]   If you want a laptop that is fast and hot and has no battery life, you can get a fast
[01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:26.460]   great Canadian winter.
[01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:28.860]   Yeah, I miss my until now.
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:29.860]   Okay.
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:31.340]   Well, that's not necessarily fair.
[01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:34.980]   I mean, if they remember, I like what they're doing with the Evo platform.
[01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:38.220]   I think that's what they could come up with, but what people, what ASOS and the rest could
[01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:41.300]   be shipping by the end of the year could be really, really very interesting.
[01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:44.860]   I think they made the line of chips, the really broad line of chips that they need to make
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:46.340]   to serve all of their customers.
[01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:50.740]   Yeah, the problem is that they can't, they can't show off this one commercial laptop with
[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:54.460]   a ship date and a price to it that shows off everything that this platform can possibly
[01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:55.460]   do.
[01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:59.180]   They have to do a reference platform and then bring other people onto the stage to shoot.
[01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:03.020]   Here's here are people who are interpreting who are showing the what can be done with
[01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:04.020]   this new platform.
[01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:07.460]   Here's what we're doing with our new with our new class of GPUs that you can actually
[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:10.220]   buy unlike a buy at list price.
[01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:16.180]   Do you think Apple is tempted because they're going to do desktops faster desktops this
[01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:18.660]   spring and we think are by June anyway, WWDC.
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:22.700]   Do you think they're tempted to say, well, let's not worry about the power profile on
[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:27.700]   the desktop and really show them what we could do if we don't mind using, you know, 100
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:28.700]   watts.
[01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:36.940]   Well, they can't even for like a quad die M1 max will have roughly the same power profile
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:41.660]   as a like running at higher frequency.
[01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:45.460]   And I think you could fit six like in an overclocked, ultra-laked power profile.
[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:50.700]   It would be really hard to go any hotter than an older like this.
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:56.660]   But I'm just saying if they wanted to make a desktop, that would be the fastest desktop
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:42:00.940]   out there that Intel could just even with a Xeon couldn't compete with.
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:02.420]   They're going to just make a smaller Leo.
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:04.420]   You know that like the if they're not going to do that.
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:11.260]   It's not really their goal is it now for you, Alex, a Mac Pro.
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:15.140]   I mean, I don't know if you even if you even need that much performance, but.
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:17.900]   Yeah, I mean, for some of the stuff we're doing, especially when you start talking about
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:21.780]   photogrammetry, I mean, I have a we've talked about it in the past that I have a one.
[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:23.420]   Anyone tell someone says they've got a computer.
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:27.420]   Send me that because I want to try it on this M1 throw and just to see because it's not
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:30.260]   supposed to be the fastest by any means.
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:31.620]   I'm just getting off to you.
[01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:34.940]   It's the time and give me some idea of what the timing I should be looking at.
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:36.740]   Is it four days?
[01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:41.060]   My my I Mac will my this is an older I Mac that I first started testing it on.
[01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:42.820]   We'll go for three days before it crash.
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:43.820]   Okay.
[01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:45.820]   Like it just doesn't go.
[01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:49.820]   And yeah, it's like and I haven't seen anybody even on a Mac Pro.
[01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:54.220]   I haven't seen anybody do it faster than I think I think the Mac Pro even doesn't always
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:55.940]   make it to the other end.
[01:42:55.940 --> 01:42:57.860]   It's only if you turn all the dials all the way up.
[01:42:57.860 --> 01:42:59.500]   This is like a memory issue.
[01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.580]   I mean, if it is, I only know we think.
[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:02.580]   We think it's a heat.
[01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:03.580]   Well, it's a memory.
[01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:09.100]   You may have trouble with 16 gigs to manage it, but we think it's a heat issue is that
[01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:14.500]   the literally the chip can't maintain maximum throughput, you know, for three days.
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:16.220]   And then it just goes, oh, I can't do this anymore.
[01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:21.180]   And so and you should you saw you saw when I sent it to Justine and she put it on the
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:26.580]   Mac Pro and she had like literally the Mac Pro was maxed all the way out.
[01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:31.220]   And that has also to do with the fact that Metashape utilizes the hardware of the.
[01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:32.700]   They should really well as they should.
[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:34.100]   So so they stack it up.
[01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:37.220]   And so so it's it's it's a pretty, but I'll send you a link.
[01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:38.300]   It's you can play with it.
[01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:43.580]   I don't know if I really want to give up my computer for four days and then have a crash.
[01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:45.540]   You can run it overnight and see how far it gets.
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:46.940]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:47.940]   That's good.
[01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:54.740]   But undoubtedly they'll be a Mac Pro and Apple will I think Apple will still want the thermal
[01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:58.660]   envelope to be low and we'll want to keep it low.
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:43:59.660]   I think I don't know.
[01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:04.060]   I think that Mac Pro I could I could imagine them really turning, you know, just not only
[01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:07.340]   putting on a dime but having multiple chips or something.
[01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:08.820]   Yeah, multi core.
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:13.740]   And so I think that you could you could theoretically do a lot on a Mac Pro where you go.
[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:14.740]   We don't care.
[01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:18.700]   Like someone's gonna if someone was spent $60,000 with us, they can spend $60,000 and
[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:20.700]   we're going to give them a computer that just screams.
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:23.980]   It strikes me though that one of the things Apple has done, which is really interesting
[01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:29.460]   is instead of saying, let's have the general purpose architecture be as fast as possible.
[01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:32.660]   They create they have the ProRes playback chip.
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:38.940]   If you if you offload the things that are the most burdensome dedicated silicon, then
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:40.700]   it's not then you kind of have this.
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:43.580]   I mean, that chip that chip is unbelievable.
[01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:45.980]   Like, you know, like the it's still the thing that keeps me.
[01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:50.060]   I haven't bought the laptop yet, but I still want to just because of the just because of
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:52.740]   that pro rest chip, you know, that, you know, being able to export.
[01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:57.460]   I was exporting stuff in ProRes the other last night and it was taking I was like, if it
[01:44:57.460 --> 01:45:01.380]   really was 10 times faster, this would this would have not been so painful.
[01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:02.860]   And it also doesn't hit your CPU.
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:04.340]   You can keep working while it's rendering.
[01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:05.340]   Right.
[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:06.340]   No, it's amazing.
[01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:08.860]   You could you could be on Twitter and Photoshop.
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:09.860]   I'm doing Photoshop now.
[01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:13.740]   Like I could barely usurp the web on my Intel when I was rendering ProRes now I can I'm
[01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:15.700]   doing Photoshop thumbnails while I'm rendering.
[01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:16.700]   Right.
[01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:22.380]   So my son, as you know, does a lot of tiktok certainly would benefit from an M1 Max.
[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:23.940]   Should I wait for the desktops though?
[01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:26.460]   Should I say, Henry, I don't want to get you a laptop.
[01:45:26.460 --> 01:45:28.580]   I want to get you the mini instead or.
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:29.580]   Yeah, the forwards.
[01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:30.580]   Yeah.
[01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:31.980]   What does he think?
[01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:36.300]   I think he probably wants portable because you know, he was he was just down in LA doing
[01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:38.540]   a collab sandwich guy and stuff.
[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:41.540]   So maybe I would probably I'd probably get the laptop.
[01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:42.540]   Yeah.
[01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:43.540]   It's fast enough.
[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:46.740]   Yeah, it's versus it's more and it's it's way more versatile.
[01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:48.260]   I but I but I'm with you.
[01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:50.540]   I cannot wait for Apple to get a mini.
[01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:51.540]   It's a sure.
[01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:52.540]   Yeah.
[01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:56.140]   Once they once they dispose themselves of the idea of here's how sleek and colorful and
[01:45:56.140 --> 01:46:00.940]   come and and and how long has to work on battery and how how cool that has to run.
[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:07.260]   I want them to just get rid of all that simply say here is a boring aluminum box that we're
[01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:12.540]   going to fill with as much power as we can possibly put into this thing.
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:18.060]   So that stuff that you didn't even want to experiment with like as Renee says, I'm rendering
[01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:21.580]   something but I'm also it doesn't mean that I have to walk away from this computer.
[01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:26.060]   I still have three quarters of a really, really powerful computer left to play with.
[01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:28.700]   That's the sort of stuff that I've got to grand in my pocket for.
[01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:29.700]   Yeah.
[01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:30.700]   Yeah.
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:36.580]   Do you think how much you how what are we going to see with a Mac mini?
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:38.620]   Let's get some speculation here.
[01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:41.140]   The M1 Pro and the M1 Max versions, I think.
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:43.780]   Yeah, with 64 gigs of a brand.
[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:44.780]   Yeah.
[01:46:44.780 --> 01:46:52.180]   Basically replace the Intel space gray Mac mini we have right now and a lot of a lot of connectivity.
[01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:53.180]   A lot of ports.
[01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:54.180]   Yeah.
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:55.180]   Yeah.
[01:46:55.180 --> 01:47:00.980]   And it turns out not having an HDMI 2.1 doesn't matter because it doesn't mean anything anymore.
[01:47:00.980 --> 01:47:01.980]   Yeah.
[01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:03.980]   Those numbers are totally randomly generated.
[01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:04.980]   That's hysterical.
[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:05.980]   That's really scary.
[01:47:05.980 --> 01:47:12.260]   No, you're talking about what the HDMI folks, whatever the certification group just told
[01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:15.260]   us that everything's 2.0 now.
[01:47:15.260 --> 01:47:16.260]   Yeah.
[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:17.260]   It's all optional.
[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:19.900]   Any features you want to add doesn't matter.
[01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:20.900]   What is what's the standard?
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:22.500]   Because the standards are going too slow.
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:24.260]   And we literally we thought you was.
[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:25.580]   What you see was confusing.
[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:27.580]   Oh my gosh.
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:31.020]   Yeah, they solved it by making you never know what you need to do anything anymore because
[01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:32.180]   all the boxes say the same.
[01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:34.580]   And you got to read a manual to figure out what they actually do.
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:35.580]   Yeah.
[01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:39.900]   I mean some of this is also, you know, I think that some of this is a fight over who should
[01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:44.180]   control color to the camp to the that that's the big thing being able to who's going to
[01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:47.540]   control the color to the to the TV.
[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:49.660]   Specifically, you know, going down to SDR.
[01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:52.420]   I mean, that's that's the 2.1 a.
[01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:56.300]   You know, it has a lot of stuff around, you know, who and because there's a growing number
[01:47:56.300 --> 01:48:00.300]   of people that would really prefer to have a TV that doesn't do anything other than what
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:01.300]   it's told.
[01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:04.500]   You know, like that, that there's a, you know, that they don't want any features.
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:07.100]   They don't want it to have any standard versus game mode.
[01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:11.980]   They want it to be, you know, a native 120 frame per second, uh, Dolby Vision capable
[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:12.980]   window.
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:17.420]   You know, and like, you know, and that means it can still do 24 frames a second.
[01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:18.420]   It can do 30.
[01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:19.420]   It can do 60.
[01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:20.420]   It can do 120.
[01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:21.420]   It does it.
[01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:24.300]   It'll need any menus just turned on and it just does the thing.
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:32.060]   You know, and that's what and so to do that though, you have to be able to push 2.1 a.
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:33.940]   You can't, you can't do it with the current standard.
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:37.260]   But, but, but, but, but, you know, that that that that that that that future doesn't exist
[01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:38.540]   in for two or three years.
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:39.540]   Okay.
[01:48:39.540 --> 01:48:40.540]   So it's too, it's too, too.
[01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:41.540]   Two three years out.
[01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:42.540]   Okay.
[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:43.540]   Shh.
[01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:48.300]   I just, uh, you know, I really loved the idea.
[01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:52.460]   One of the things I thought was so cool about the Apple Watch was that I can order and-
[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:53.460]   Strap is fire, Leo.
[01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:54.460]   I can stop as a man.
[01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:55.460]   Do you like my strap?
[01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:56.460]   Isn't that beautiful?
[01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:57.460]   Yes.
[01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:58.460]   It's made out of almost the same one.
[01:48:58.460 --> 01:48:59.460]   It's made out of old baseball gloves.
[01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:01.100]   This is not the Hermes.
[01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:02.660]   It's the- It's old baseball glove?
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:03.660]   It's old baseball glove.
[01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:04.660]   It's a cooler.
[01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:05.660]   Yeah.
[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:06.660]   Or something.
[01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:07.660]   Because-
[01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:08.660]   Because-
[01:49:08.660 --> 01:49:09.660]   It's trueless Joe, trueless Joe.
[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:12.460]   You know, it was a silly thing to buy, but you know, I treated myself.
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:14.660]   Leo, this is, this is, uh, it even-
[01:49:14.660 --> 01:49:15.660]   It's awesome.
[01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:16.660]   Hey, nothing silly if you like it, Leo.
[01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:17.660]   No, no, no, no.
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:19.020]   Yeah, I think it's- is it Pad and Quill?
[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:20.020]   Is that the one you have?
[01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:21.020]   Yeah.
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:22.020]   They're amazing.
[01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:23.020]   Yeah.
[01:49:23.020 --> 01:49:24.700]   Mine is the original Apple one, but I love the Pad and Quill stuff.
[01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:25.700]   Yeah.
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:30.420]   So Pad and Quill, um, I don't know if they still don't- they probably don't offer it
[01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:33.220]   still, but they said we found some old leather.
[01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:36.380]   That was like 100 year old leather.
[01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:37.380]   That's really soft.
[01:49:37.380 --> 01:49:38.380]   That's amazing.
[01:49:38.380 --> 01:49:39.380]   And really nice.
[01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:44.300]   So we're going to make a limited number of Apple Watch bands out of this leather.
[01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:45.300]   Yeah, I don't- I don't know if they-
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:46.300]   You feel like Indiana Jones.
[01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:47.300]   It's just-
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:48.300]   It's just patina so nicely.
[01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:50.580]   It's so- it's like an old baseball glove.
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:52.980]   When I was a kid, I don't think kids do this anymore.
[01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:56.900]   You'd get your baseball glove and you coat it with neat foot oil, you'd put a baseball
[01:49:56.900 --> 01:50:01.140]   in it and you tape it closed and you'd let it sit for two weeks so they would develop
[01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:02.140]   a pocket.
[01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:03.140]   Now they all come with pockets.
[01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:04.140]   I don't know what you're saying.
[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:05.140]   Andy and I do it now.
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:06.140]   You still have to do it together.
[01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:07.140]   You still have to do it together.
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:08.660]   Oh yeah, I just did one now.
[01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:09.660]   Did you really?
[01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:10.660]   Oh, that makes me happy.
[01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:11.660]   Man.
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:13.460]   Baseball is always going to live in the past.
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:15.780]   I think that's just the nature of the game.
[01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:20.500]   But so I think they didn't say where the leather came from but they said we found a
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:25.180]   cash of old leather and our artisans they even have the name of the guy who made it
[01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:27.100]   stamped on the band.
[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:28.100]   And it was expensive.
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:31.620]   It was like a couple hundred bucks instead of 80 or whatever.
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:32.620]   But-
[01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:33.620]   Man, it's nice.
[01:50:33.620 --> 01:50:36.580]   And it's- you know what I don't like about leather bands is they're stiff.
[01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:38.940]   And this one's so soft.
[01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:41.300]   Okay, how did I get out of that?
[01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:42.300]   I can't remember.
[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:45.540]   Oh, you're going to talk about my watch app.
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:49.700]   So one of the things I really like, thank you Renee.
[01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:51.540]   You young people, your brains work so well.
[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:52.540]   No, I distracted you.
[01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:53.540]   I just checked in.
[01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:54.540]   I was distracting you.
[01:50:54.540 --> 01:51:00.340]   I used to love it that I could call an Uber on my watch but go ahead, launch your Uber
[01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:06.260]   app now it says, and this is a direct quote, "Please switch to the Uber mobile app.
[01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:10.260]   We no longer supporting the Apple Watch app.
[01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:12.500]   We no longer supporting the Apple Watch app."
[01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:13.500]   Is that what they did?
[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.500]   Yeah, apparently they had so much-
[01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:15.500]   They had so much better.
[01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:16.500]   You're up to the right message.
[01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:18.500]   They were like, "Oh, just write something."
[01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:19.500]   They messaged me.
[01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:21.540]   They notified me eight times a day.
[01:51:21.540 --> 01:51:24.300]   If I even accidentally opened an Uber app that comes back and says, "We're trying to
[01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:25.300]   order an Uber?"
[01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:28.980]   And they vomit notifications on me but they won't be bothered to put it on the Apple
[01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:29.980]   Watch.
[01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:34.140]   Yeah, for some reason, you know, I understand why you don't have Twitter on an Apple Watch.
[01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:36.460]   I can live with that.
[01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:39.660]   You know, there's a lot of apps that don't really make sense in the watch.
[01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:40.660]   Uber is not one of them.
[01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:42.660]   Uber is the perfect.
[01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:45.340]   Otherwise, you had to keep your phone out.
[01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:46.940]   Uber would tell you it was on-road.
[01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:51.220]   It would tell you who your driver was, what kind of car he was driving on the watch.
[01:51:51.220 --> 01:51:53.580]   In fact, there's- What's his name?
[01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:55.580]   Showing it off.
[01:51:55.580 --> 01:51:56.580]   Kevin.
[01:51:56.580 --> 01:51:57.580]   Kevin Lynch.
[01:51:57.580 --> 01:51:58.580]   Watch guy.
[01:51:58.580 --> 01:51:59.580]   He was ordering an Apple car.
[01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:00.580]   We didn't know.
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:06.820]   So now Kevin Lynch is running Apple car and Uber is off the watch.
[01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:07.820]   Do we use any?
[01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:09.660]   Does anyone use- I mean, I can just-
[01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:10.660]   You don't go anywhere.
[01:52:10.660 --> 01:52:11.660]   I don't go anywhere.
[01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:15.660]   But what I mean by that is I don't use very many apps on the watch.
[01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:20.780]   I don't use this activity, but that's, you know, I don't think that counts, right?
[01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:21.780]   That's part of the time.
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:22.780]   I use the app on the phone.
[01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:24.540]   The notifications on the watch.
[01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:29.460]   So on my watch face complication, I have the activity because I work out and I want to
[01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:30.460]   get credit.
[01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:33.900]   In fact, if I forget and don't do that, I feel terrible like I didn't work out.
[01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:34.900]   What's your workout, Nelio?
[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:35.900]   I'm going to distract you again.
[01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:36.900]   You're terrible, Renee.
[01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:37.900]   Squirrel.
[01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:38.900]   He's always a little-
[01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:39.900]   He's always a little-
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:40.900]   I used to.
[01:52:40.900 --> 01:52:45.100]   I have a trainer I go to on Monday and Friday.
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:46.300]   Will, he works me out.
[01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:49.220]   He's got a- he used to work at the gym.
[01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:50.540]   I used to go to him at the gym.
[01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:51.860]   We don't go to the gym anymore.
[01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:52.860]   Yes.
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:54.660]   He's built out his barn with all his equipment.
[01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:55.660]   It's a quick time.
[01:52:55.660 --> 01:52:56.660]   Awesome.
[01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:57.660]   It's called Red Barn.
[01:52:57.660 --> 01:52:58.660]   And it's great.
[01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:00.140]   So I go there on Monday and Friday.
[01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:05.940]   And on Wednesday, they have a boot camp where I go and Jeremiah beats the hell out of us.
[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:06.940]   That's awesome.
[01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:07.940]   It's great.
[01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:08.940]   Three days a week.
[01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:09.940]   You know, that's good, right?
[01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:11.580]   That's because all our stuff closed down now too.
[01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:12.580]   So I'm looking at all the time.
[01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:13.580]   I'm trying to get a gym.
[01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:14.740]   So this is a post down, yeah.
[01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:15.740]   This guy's personal.
[01:53:15.740 --> 01:53:21.940]   Now I have to say, I found out later that two of the people in the boot camp weren't
[01:53:21.940 --> 01:53:22.940]   anti-vaxxers.
[01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:23.940]   I stopped going.
[01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:24.940]   Oh, God.
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:26.940]   And then both of them got sick and disappeared.
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:27.940]   You know.
[01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:28.940]   I should laugh.
[01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:29.940]   That's terrible.
[01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:30.940]   They're fine.
[01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:31.940]   They didn't die.
[01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:32.940]   But they did get sick.
[01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:36.180]   And so now I can go again because everybody there is safe.
[01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:41.180]   I'm going to come back.
[01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:46.180]   They made it like you have to be vaxxed order to get alcohol or pot.
[01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:50.180]   And we already had high rates, but now it's like four times as many people suddenly show up.
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:51.180]   I got back.
[01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:52.180]   Oh, that's good.
[01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:53.180]   I like it.
[01:53:53.180 --> 01:53:54.180]   That's a good one.
[01:53:54.180 --> 01:53:56.180]   I just in case you're wondering the jujitsu is opened in Nevada.
[01:53:56.180 --> 01:53:57.180]   Oh, okay.
[01:53:57.180 --> 01:53:58.180]   Do you do the Brazilian?
[01:53:58.180 --> 01:53:59.180]   Keeps trying to open here.
[01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:00.180]   But it's amazing.
[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:01.180]   My son doesn't.
[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:02.180]   I don't do it.
[01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:05.180]   I have a shoulder injury, but my son does a jujitsu.
[01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:06.180]   And I think it's like 10 seconds.
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:07.180]   Yeah.
[01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:08.180]   They're all close here.
[01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:09.180]   Yeah.
[01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:11.180]   It's busy.
[01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:12.180]   Busier.
[01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:13.180]   Yeah.
[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:14.180]   Did you see Rene just in his loss?
[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:19.180]   We're really, I mean, going down that rabbit hole.
[01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:25.180]   Did you see that Anthony Bourdain was posting on Reddit about his experiences in Brazilian
[01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:26.180]   jiu-jitsu?
[01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:28.180]   It was incredible.
[01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:29.180]   Yeah.
[01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:30.180]   It's amazing.
[01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:33.740]   Rolling Stone called it the lost diary of Anthony Bourdain because he was posting anonymously.
[01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:34.740]   But you know what?
[01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:39.980]   If you read it, it's so Anthony Bourdain, the writing is totally his voice.
[01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:41.740]   Now, this was many years ago.
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:45.820]   Of course, he's passed since, but I was wondering when I read it, I thought, I bet because I
[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:47.740]   know you're a physiologist.
[01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:48.740]   Yeah.
[01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:49.740]   Yeah.
[01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:51.740]   Although you're doing something new, aren't you?
[01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:55.220]   No, I just haven't been able to do jujitsu for a long time because it's been closed for
[01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:56.220]   three years.
[01:54:56.220 --> 01:54:57.220]   Oh.
[01:54:57.220 --> 01:54:58.620]   He loved his Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:54:59.780]   He loved it.
[01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:02.500]   I still have my wooden dummy from Wing Chun.
[01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:06.180]   So I set that up again and now I'm beating the crap out of the wooden dummy every day.
[01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:11.660]   I almost made Renee pass out because he taught me a head lock, but he didn't teach me that
[01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:13.380]   tapping out meant let go.
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:16.740]   Both of you and Mike Hurley have choked me out.
[01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:17.740]   It's so sorry.
[01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:18.740]   I'm so sorry.
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:23.660]   Because first of all, I would have never been able to get him in the headlock if he hadn't
[01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:24.860]   fully cooperated.
[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:26.900]   So fond memories.
[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:29.180]   Those were the days.
[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:32.460]   That was in our New Year's Eve party.
[01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:35.340]   And then finally, they go full circle on the at-pad and quill site.
[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:37.020]   They do not sell that.
[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:38.220]   Well, maybe they do.
[01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:39.620]   They have an aged Lowry cuff.
[01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:41.620]   No, I don't think that's the same.
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:42.860]   This isn't the same one I got.
[01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:45.340]   I don't think that was a limited supply because he.
[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:46.900]   The cuffs are all nice though.
[01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:51.220]   I really like this, but I'm again, I have other leather bands that are too stiff.
[01:55:51.220 --> 01:55:55.700]   The fact that this was in somebody's closet for 100 years really made the difference on
[01:55:55.700 --> 01:55:56.700]   this is so nice.
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:59.260]   But you know, what kind of risks do you have?
[01:55:59.260 --> 01:56:04.540]   I have like hairy wrists and there are a lot of bands that I absolutely cannot wear because
[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:05.860]   I just get skinned.
[01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:11.740]   I don't think any sense I will be as hairy as Andy and not co.
[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:12.740]   So he's basically.
[01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:14.220]   They're not hairless.
[01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:18.340]   Well, I am genetically optimized for winter warfare.
[01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:20.340]   That's why.
[01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:21.340]   And it doesn't bother.
[01:56:21.340 --> 01:56:23.140]   But I have long Russian winners.
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:24.140]   Fine hair.
[01:56:24.140 --> 01:56:28.820]   So maybe cold that we must what a conical survive.
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:29.820]   In any event.
[01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:33.380]   There is no land beyond the Volga.
[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:40.060]   Fortunately, I have a very efficient stack and I'm going to pop Uber back off the stack
[01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:42.700]   and move on to the next story.
[01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:43.700]   Yes.
[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:46.900]   But just before we before we tie that up.
[01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:47.900]   Push it back.
[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:48.900]   Go ahead.
[01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:49.900]   Yes.
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:56.060]   Oh, no, just I love the way that the Apple is one of the most advanced companies, most
[01:56:56.060 --> 01:56:57.700]   thoughtful companies in the world.
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:57:02.460]   They move so carefully and so cautiously and even they will never know how people are
[01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:05.540]   going to use a new product until they see how they use them.
[01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:08.980]   They've ever thought that, oh, this is going to be this new computing platform.
[01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:14.260]   It's going to be not necessarily as powerful or as interactive as a phone, but we will
[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:18.620]   be running apps on that device and we'll be using the phone to project live user interface
[01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:20.940]   interactions between the phone and the device.
[01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:23.300]   And it's like, no, please give us more fitness features.
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:25.380]   Give us give us notifications.
[01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:28.780]   We want us to be able to push a button to respond to something on a notification.
[01:57:28.780 --> 01:57:31.340]   But really, we don't want an app on our watches.
[01:57:31.340 --> 01:57:32.740]   We want Mickey Mouse.
[01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:34.300]   We want Pixar characters.
[01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:40.220]   We want to be able to like position a motion app, a motion picture behind the time.
[01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:44.700]   So it looks like the time is actually the sunglasses that my daughter is wearing.
[01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:50.260]   It's like this is why AR and VR is going to be so interesting where they're even I'm
[01:57:50.260 --> 01:57:55.220]   sure that everyone who's used trying to make a play for this understands that look.
[01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:57.460]   We're going to we're going to make hardware.
[01:57:57.460 --> 01:57:59.780]   We're going to make an API.
[01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:01.660]   We're going to do a wonderful demo.
[01:58:01.660 --> 01:58:02.780]   It's going to be great.
[01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:04.740]   The demo, it's going to be great.
[01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:08.500]   But then a year from a half from the launch, that's one we'll know what kind of product
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:10.780]   we have because the users will tell us.
[01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:14.420]   One of my favorite memories from an Apple event, I think was 2015.
[01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:18.060]   I was standing next to someone really famous, but who will remain nameless.
[01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:22.100]   And Johnny, I've walked over to us and the person said that was a terrific show.
[01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:24.740]   Johnny and Johnny just looked and he goes, was it?
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:28.260]   I mean, we create these products, but we never know what they really mean until they get
[01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:31.860]   into the hands of our customers only when we see how people use them, when we truly
[01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:32.860]   understand them.
[01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:35.060]   And the person next we said, Oh, okay, thank you, Johnny.
[01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:37.060]   And Johnny just nodded and walked off.
[01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:39.260]   I've always remembered that.
[01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:41.940]   Was it?
[01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:42.940]   It is the 50.
[01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:48.460]   We didn't really mention this, but January 9th, 2007 was the day Steve Jobs announced
[01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:49.900]   the iPhone.
[01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:53.380]   So it is in fact the 15th anniversary of the iPhone announcement, not shipping, but of
[01:58:53.380 --> 01:58:54.380]   the iPhone announcement.
[01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:57.780]   And of course, it wasn't going to work because it's a really.
[01:58:57.780 --> 01:59:02.700]   Well, in fact, that day, it really didn't work, but they were able to get it.
[01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:05.300]   But I mean, I just remember that all the rumors and people were just like, this is never going
[01:59:05.300 --> 01:59:06.300]   to happen.
[01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:07.700]   I mean, have they ever heard of a blackberry?
[01:59:07.700 --> 01:59:08.900]   I mean, I don't think this is a.
[01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:09.900]   Oh, I said this.
[01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:12.980]   I said, Scott, that he was going to smash his trio at the same day.
[01:59:12.980 --> 01:59:14.460]   Oh, yes, Scott was all in.
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:17.660]   He said, Scott and I are both all in.
[01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:18.660]   Yeah, he was all in.
[01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:19.660]   Scott born definitely.
[01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:23.700]   In fact, there's a picture of him from the San Francisco Chronicle holding his first
[01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:27.580]   iPhone aloft as he exited the store and turned on the great show.
[01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:30.420]   He wanted to make an iPhone vest.
[01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:32.420]   I think maybe Merlin made just that.
[01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:35.420]   Yeah, I'm going to wear that.
[01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:36.740]   But I was a little more skeptical.
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:40.460]   I was among the people who said, this is a tough market, the cell phone market.
[01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:42.700]   Really, you think Apple can can do well?
[01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:43.700]   I only remember.
[01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:50.260]   The only example that we had before that was the horrible eye rock that the rocker that
[01:59:50.260 --> 01:59:52.020]   they made with Motorola.
[01:59:52.020 --> 01:59:54.620]   And I thought, well, I hope it's better than that.
[01:59:54.620 --> 01:59:58.660]   But in two sense, we want 1% will be really happy with 1%.
[01:59:58.660 --> 01:59:59.660]   So they got 50.
[01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:00.660]   Yeah, that's all right.
[02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:01.660]   That's pretty good.
[02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:06.380]   Also, we have patented this up and down and top to bottom.
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:09.380]   There will never be anyone making another phone that's even with this.
[02:00:09.380 --> 02:00:10.740]   You know, it would be cool.
[02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:11.740]   Still so angry.
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:16.660]   If he had known that almost to the day, 15 years later, BlackBerry would flip the switch
[02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:23.620]   on its servers January 4, 2022 and shut them down for the last time making all BlackBerry
[02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:25.460]   devices obsolete.
[02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:27.740]   That took 15 years, but that's a victory, I guess.
[02:00:27.740 --> 02:00:31.340]   What's amazing is also that there was almost within a couple of years, there was almost
[02:00:31.340 --> 02:00:35.740]   no phone that looked anything different than what you know, it was just that it just it
[02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:36.740]   worked through it.
[02:00:36.740 --> 02:00:39.820]   And I don't think that anyone would have predicted the best thing that ever happened
[02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:40.820]   to Apple was Android.
[02:00:40.820 --> 02:00:42.580]   Like I'll fly out.
[02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:46.300]   Because Apple would have been, you know, they would have been wrapped.
[02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:49.220]   It would have been a huge issue 10 years ago.
[02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:54.060]   Quite famously, Google engineers were watching the event January 9th.
[02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:55.060]   They had a phone.
[02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:57.860]   They were ready to ship and they said, no, back to the drawing.
[02:00:57.860 --> 02:01:02.260]   That we're going to start over because that's what phones should look like going forward
[02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:03.980]   is his last slabs.
[02:01:03.980 --> 02:01:10.860]   Well, moving and also to be fair, this is a this is this is a lot like the the GUI,
[02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:15.540]   mouse and pointer interfaces where it's something that had been considered for a long time.
[02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:19.300]   A lot of the basic hardware has been they've been working on for a long time.
[02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:22.660]   Apple would just had a huge jump on actually making it useful and practical.
[02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:26.020]   So it's not as though this was being parachuted in from another planet, but nonetheless.
[02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:30.540]   And also the other thing that oftentimes gets missed in the conversation is as innovative
[02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:37.300]   as this hardware was the the fourth thought that they had in understanding that, look,
[02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:42.220]   they're two they're two large phone companies in the United States, AT&T and Verizon AT&T
[02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:45.180]   is getting their lunch take lunch stolen by Verizon.
[02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:49.340]   They are desperate and we will they will agree to pretty much everything that we ask of a
[02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:55.740]   carrier if if we make the iPhone exclusive to this sort of underdog carrier at this time.
[02:01:55.740 --> 02:02:01.540]   And so much of what the iPhone was capable of was impossible on blackberries on windows,
[02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:05.340]   mobile phones, all these sort of stuff, because they simply will not allow a phone to have
[02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:08.700]   a web a real web browser because they didn't think that their networks can handle it.
[02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:14.420]   They simply would not allow so much of what this they would not allow the device manufacturer
[02:02:14.420 --> 02:02:16.300]   to dictate to the carrier.
[02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:20.460]   Here is the device that we will make and sell you, not tell us what device you think that
[02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:24.580]   you want to market and we will make this thing and put up and slap your logo on it.
[02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:28.740]   It was so there's so much innovation that goes not only from top to bottom but side to
[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:29.740]   side.
[02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:30.740]   Yeah.
[02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:37.940]   And the fact that Apple with no market leverage held out for total control or near total control
[02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:42.500]   was a big deal like it as you said, like they didn't have the there's no reason for anybody
[02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:44.020]   to make a deal with them really.
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:45.780]   And singular at the time.
[02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:46.780]   Yeah.
[02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:51.300]   Although they they were they were AT&T then they became singular and then they that worked
[02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:52.300]   out were great.
[02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:53.940]   So they became a team for us and said no.
[02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:54.940]   Yeah.
[02:02:54.940 --> 02:02:56.460]   And then singular was desperate enough to let him do it.
[02:02:56.460 --> 02:02:57.460]   Yeah.
[02:02:57.460 --> 02:02:59.980]   And it's not forceful that an amazing interview with the computer history museum where he's
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:03.020]   like AT&T is on the same goes on the phone saying what does it look like?
[02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:04.660]   And he's like I can't tell you.
[02:03:04.660 --> 02:03:08.820]   He's like yeah, he's in a Lego phone.
[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:09.820]   Yeah.
[02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:15.900]   Anyway, 15 years later, it's completely dominant.
[02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:17.900]   Although as you point out Alex, you're in your right.
[02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:22.860]   In fact, Android is a little bit ahead right now on globally Android way, way, way, way,
[02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:23.860]   way, way, way.
[02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:26.700]   You know, it's so you know, in the United States, it's right.
[02:03:26.700 --> 02:03:28.860]   It's right at about 50 50 depending on who you talk to.
[02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:30.340]   I think that's also price.
[02:03:30.340 --> 02:03:34.620]   That's a price issue because you know, half the market is not going to spend a thousand
[02:03:34.620 --> 02:03:35.620]   dollars on a phone.
[02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:37.780]   So there are a lot of cheap Android phones.
[02:03:37.780 --> 02:03:39.220]   You know, markets are very spectrum.
[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:42.580]   My daughter uses Android because she needs a new phone every three months because they
[02:03:42.580 --> 02:03:43.580]   break.
[02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:47.100]   So I'm not going to, you know, we're not going to go for the iPhone on this.
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:48.100]   Right.
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:49.100]   It's just too expensive.
[02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:50.100]   Yeah.
[02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:51.100]   Yeah.
[02:03:51.100 --> 02:03:52.100]   But I know she break them.
[02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:55.660]   Well, you have to ask her it's it's her opinion.
[02:03:55.660 --> 02:03:59.020]   They leap from her hand in an attempt to escape.
[02:03:59.020 --> 02:04:02.340]   But you know, it's fun.
[02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:04.580]   I mean, I've tried every case under the sun.
[02:04:04.580 --> 02:04:06.060]   We tried everything.
[02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:11.820]   But you know what those Motorola, the Motorola G9 power, they're 200 bucks.
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:14.980]   They're actually very good Android phones.
[02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:19.020]   You know, and over over a year, it costs me less than one iPhone.
[02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:20.660]   So you have a drawer of them, don't you?
[02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:23.700]   Like one of them breaks and you just I'll fix it for you and you just quietly hand over
[02:04:23.700 --> 02:04:24.700]   it.
[02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:28.340]   I have quite a large drawer of broken phones of all kinds.
[02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:29.500]   I, you know, it's interesting.
[02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:31.980]   I haven't broken a phone in a long, long time.
[02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:36.180]   You know, I have this, I have this case and I drop it all the time and I haven't.
[02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:38.180]   I put a screen protector.
[02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:39.180]   It's dark industries.
[02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:40.180]   Look at it.
[02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:42.340]   This is made by smart, smart ish.
[02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:45.620]   Oh, but it's it holds my my credit cards, the stuff on the back.
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:46.620]   Yeah.
[02:04:46.620 --> 02:04:47.620]   And then it and then that's it.
[02:04:47.620 --> 02:04:49.700]   I mean, that's the big thing is it has to hold the credit cards and the key.
[02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:51.820]   But they can't do wireless charging.
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:53.220]   I don't do that.
[02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:54.220]   Yeah.
[02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:55.540]   I don't even like my watch doing wireless charging.
[02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:59.660]   I put up with it, but I but it always slides off and gets bumped and now it's not charging
[02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:01.140]   anymore.
[02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:05.700]   And so yeah, so anyway, so I I dropped this thing.
[02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:08.900]   I mean, I and then I put a screen protector on immediately.
[02:05:08.900 --> 02:05:14.380]   So as soon as I buy a new phone, I get a screen protector for the front and then I get the
[02:05:14.380 --> 02:05:15.380]   case.
[02:05:15.380 --> 02:05:16.940]   Do you get the glass protectors?
[02:05:16.940 --> 02:05:17.940]   Is that what you ask?
[02:05:17.940 --> 02:05:18.940]   Yeah.
[02:05:18.940 --> 02:05:22.820]   Yeah, they come in like they come in pairs or whatever and the videos was what's great
[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:23.820]   as they now.
[02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:24.820]   I mean, they've really gotten good at it.
[02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:26.820]   They they have a little machine.
[02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:29.540]   No, no, no, no, no, I do it at home.
[02:05:29.540 --> 02:05:30.540]   Yeah.
[02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:33.020]   And but it's got a great little template that tells you where to go.
[02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:36.340]   It it you know, they've really figured it out, you know, and you don't get with glass.
[02:05:36.340 --> 02:05:38.020]   You don't get the air bubbles underneath.
[02:05:38.020 --> 02:05:39.020]   That's the problem with plastic.
[02:05:39.020 --> 02:05:43.620]   You don't get the air bubbles, but also it really shows you how to do it.
[02:05:43.620 --> 02:05:47.860]   There's a way to, you know, use the squeegee and the thing and the thing.
[02:05:47.860 --> 02:05:50.460]   I mean, it's like a I used to be scared of it.
[02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:53.100]   Now I add things that much of my devices all the time.
[02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:55.100]   I don't I like I said, I don't break my phone.
[02:05:55.100 --> 02:05:56.100]   So I guess I don't need it.
[02:05:56.100 --> 02:06:00.100]   And I kind of have an a very I certainly have an aversion to plastic screen protectors,
[02:06:00.100 --> 02:06:02.580]   but the glass seems like and everything works the same.
[02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:03.580]   It's all yeah.
[02:06:03.580 --> 02:06:04.580]   Yeah.
[02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:05.580]   It works perfectly.
[02:06:05.580 --> 02:06:09.020]   And yeah, and what's what's funny is that I was really hard for me to get over because
[02:06:09.020 --> 02:06:12.460]   I used to every time I bought an iPhone, I would go to the Apple store and they have
[02:06:12.460 --> 02:06:17.300]   this like beast of a applicator like it's like this thing that goes around the phone
[02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:19.500]   and it's a change and it's perfect.
[02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:21.740]   And so I would always have them do it because I'll do it for free.
[02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:24.860]   If you buy it, if you buy it there, they'll just put it on for you.
[02:06:24.860 --> 02:06:27.700]   And so I would always have it then because I was like, I don't want to figure it out.
[02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:30.020]   Once I figured it out, I'm like, all my phones have something on it.
[02:06:30.020 --> 02:06:33.220]   My iPad has a my old iPad has a paper surface.
[02:06:33.220 --> 02:06:37.420]   So I think I recommended that before and because I like drawing, I like drawing on it.
[02:06:37.420 --> 02:06:43.140]   And so you just start adding them because the again, the you know, all of is the instructions
[02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:44.140]   got better.
[02:06:44.140 --> 02:06:45.460]   Like literally that was it.
[02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:49.060]   The instructions have gotten way better at how to do it.
[02:06:49.060 --> 02:06:53.020]   You know, and you you they have a little QR code and you hit it and you hit the QR code.
[02:06:53.020 --> 02:06:56.700]   It takes you to a YouTube page and it shows you the video of how to get it done.
[02:06:56.700 --> 02:06:58.700]   And then you then you do it.
[02:06:58.700 --> 02:07:02.500]   I can't see any reason to do it.
[02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:06.180]   It's just to prevent breakage and scratching.
[02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:10.020]   Mine doesn't scratch or break and then it carries my credit cards and the credit cards.
[02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:13.420]   I just I've always I've always put my phones and cases.
[02:07:13.420 --> 02:07:16.860]   Last phone I broke was an iPhone 5, but no worries.
[02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:21.100]   It blunt Apple, but I've never I've never put a protector on.
[02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:26.220]   I did my defense.
[02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:31.320]   I did say sorry, how many how many phones you think Apple loans out that get they come back
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:32.860]   broken or cracked.
[02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:34.060]   I bet a lot.
[02:07:34.060 --> 02:07:35.660]   No, comment.
[02:07:35.660 --> 02:07:42.400]   Not that they've ever been used harder because they don't they don't, right, you know, yeah,
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:46.240]   yeah, I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't do drop tests.
[02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:49.660]   I don't believe that that is within my area of that.
[02:07:49.660 --> 02:07:52.180]   It's something that they've agreed to let me do.
[02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:54.580]   But yeah, that I don't know.
[02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:58.020]   Now that I know I remember no, I remember exactly what the situation was.
[02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:03.060]   It was the I wasn't used to like the that super shine the super shiny super slippery
[02:08:03.060 --> 02:08:04.380]   glass back.
[02:08:04.380 --> 02:08:10.940]   I was at I was I was at the JP licks and ice cream place in in Jamaica plain and they have
[02:08:10.940 --> 02:08:13.940]   those those polished marble like tables.
[02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:19.620]   And so I just simply just simply placed it on the dropped it maybe a quarter of an inch
[02:08:19.620 --> 02:08:23.660]   like one inch and the thing just kept sliding sliding sliding went all the way off the edge
[02:08:23.660 --> 02:08:24.660]   of the table.
[02:08:24.660 --> 02:08:28.220]   And I'm like, that is got to be the most air hockey is phone.
[02:08:28.220 --> 02:08:30.140]   I've ever had my life.
[02:08:30.140 --> 02:08:31.700]   They really are.
[02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:34.180]   People are complaining about the Pixel six.
[02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:36.740]   I immediately put a case on it, but people are complaining.
[02:08:36.740 --> 02:08:40.580]   It's it's it's a case before it's the Nexus for.
[02:08:40.580 --> 02:08:41.580]   Yeah.
[02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:42.580]   Yeah.
[02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:43.820]   Like it's like a bar of soap.
[02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:47.380]   It just has a sports and Nexus for can still beat it off a flat surface.
[02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:49.180]   Yeah, because of the camera.
[02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:50.580]   Second it slows it down fast.
[02:08:50.580 --> 02:08:51.580]   Yeah, yeah, a little bit.
[02:08:51.580 --> 02:08:56.460]   Yeah, just I mean, even even for the some of my my test phones, these are the older ones
[02:08:56.460 --> 02:09:00.300]   that I always put even just this little rubbery one on it.
[02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:01.300]   And that's what I would.
[02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:02.300]   Yeah.
[02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:08.100]   This is actually the happens if I don't get it on fast enough is that I don't waste time
[02:09:08.100 --> 02:09:09.100]   get it on.
[02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:11.380]   I mean, literally it was like glass bad for like two days.
[02:09:11.380 --> 02:09:12.380]   And it was.
[02:09:12.380 --> 02:09:13.980]   So I put them on pretty quickly.
[02:09:13.980 --> 02:09:15.580]   I got these are some of my R&D phones.
[02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:21.380]   Apple silicone red, but this is the colors aren't very good, but it's like clear.
[02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:24.180]   Yeah, I like clear too, but this is nice.
[02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:28.820]   It's and it's grippy and I you know, and it's easy to spot across the room.
[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:33.380]   So yeah, I do I do too much photography not to have like a really, really great nice.
[02:09:33.380 --> 02:09:34.380]   Oh, that's nice.
[02:09:34.380 --> 02:09:35.380]   Look at that.
[02:09:35.380 --> 02:09:39.300]   And then and then I have to always I want really super wonderful colorful cases, but
[02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:43.780]   every time like I choose something like that, like, oh, I have a hot pink case.
[02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:46.420]   And then like, I'll be doing a selfie.
[02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:50.620]   There's this like pink slab of something like in my in the workplace.
[02:09:50.620 --> 02:09:55.580]   That's like, Oh, dang, I know this is an Apple show and that's a Pixel six pro, but
[02:09:55.580 --> 02:09:57.580]   what just had a curiosity.
[02:09:57.580 --> 02:09:58.580]   It is.
[02:09:58.580 --> 02:09:59.580]   It is the spigant.
[02:09:59.580 --> 02:10:05.780]   Like in case it has just a little tiny kickstand, which is all I really, really want.
[02:10:05.780 --> 02:10:08.820]   I've there are a couple other styles I really, really like.
[02:10:08.820 --> 02:10:15.420]   I think the in case, I think it's a kind of has these really, really thick rubbery, like
[02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:20.020]   the textured side grips, which is again, the number of times when I'm sort of like trying
[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:22.980]   to position something really, really weird.
[02:10:22.980 --> 02:10:27.900]   I'm realizing that or I'm trying I'm holding it like like this, like with two fingers like
[02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:28.900]   that.
[02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:29.900]   I'm like, Oh, this is bad.
[02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:30.900]   This is bad.
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:31.900]   This is bad.
[02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:32.900]   This is not a load of phone Andy.
[02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:33.900]   This is not a loaner phone Andy.
[02:10:33.900 --> 02:10:34.900]   Drop it.
[02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:35.900]   We really want that extra.
[02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:39.500]   That's how I felt when I first got the Samsung Galaxy Fold.
[02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:44.300]   Yeah, you know, $2,500 phone and I'm taking pictures with it.
[02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:47.020]   I'm thinking if I and I didn't have a case yet, I dropped this.
[02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:48.540]   I'm going to die.
[02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:52.220]   So this is the case the spigant tough armor extreme protection.
[02:10:52.220 --> 02:10:54.460]   Does it work with wireless charging?
[02:10:54.460 --> 02:10:55.460]   Yep.
[02:10:55.460 --> 02:10:56.460]   Okay.
[02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:59.740]   It's not the one that works with with Maxafe.
[02:10:59.740 --> 02:11:00.740]   There is there is a model that's.
[02:11:00.740 --> 02:11:01.740]   Yeah, no, I don't need that.
[02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:02.740]   That is Maxafe.
[02:11:02.740 --> 02:11:04.780]   But no, I might get pink.
[02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:07.740]   You know, it's funny how cheap these are.
[02:11:07.740 --> 02:11:09.100]   This is a really good example.
[02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:11.900]   So never buy an Apple watch band.
[02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:13.900]   Never buy an Apple case.
[02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:17.420]   The Apple cases are twice as three times as much as this case.
[02:11:17.420 --> 02:11:18.420]   Yeah.
[02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:20.900]   Well, it's sometimes it's sometimes you need to be cautious.
[02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:25.780]   The one thing that I'm looking for is that it has to be just absolutely snug.
[02:11:25.780 --> 02:11:29.140]   Like I've dipped this in like liquid vinyl or something like this.
[02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:31.580]   Nothing nothing annoys me more than like a silicone case.
[02:11:31.580 --> 02:11:32.580]   Rattles around.
[02:11:32.580 --> 02:11:33.580]   That's just a little bit.
[02:11:33.580 --> 02:11:34.580]   Yeah.
[02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:39.780]   So if it's not difficult to remove, so difficult that I'm not apt to even try to remove it,
[02:11:39.780 --> 02:11:42.060]   I'm not interested.
[02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:43.540]   Yeah.
[02:11:43.540 --> 02:11:48.540]   That we should just edit that out because this isn't a quick clip.
[02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:49.540]   Okay.
[02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:51.540]   Just going to mention that.
[02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:52.540]   Let's see.
[02:11:52.540 --> 02:11:53.540]   All right.
[02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:56.420]   As long as we're on tangential, did you love Alex?
[02:11:56.420 --> 02:11:58.180]   I wanted to get your opinion on this.
[02:11:58.180 --> 02:12:04.300]   Netflix published for their partners, people making movies for Netflix, their camera guide.
[02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:05.300]   Did you see that Alex?
[02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:06.300]   Yeah.
[02:12:06.300 --> 02:12:07.300]   That's been around for a long time.
[02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:08.300]   Oh, okay.
[02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:09.300]   I just find that.
[02:12:09.300 --> 02:12:10.300]   Yeah.
[02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:11.300]   It's incredible.
[02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:13.220]   Like it's not just the camera guides.
[02:12:13.220 --> 02:12:20.180]   So Netflix has this is this what's on their webpage, I think is a is a pretty basic.
[02:12:20.180 --> 02:12:23.580]   Like Blackmagic, they only recommend the Ursa mini or mini.
[02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:24.580]   The Ursa's.
[02:12:24.580 --> 02:12:25.580]   Yeah.
[02:12:25.580 --> 02:12:26.580]   Yeah.
[02:12:26.580 --> 02:12:27.580]   Yeah.
[02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:28.580]   My Canada is safe.
[02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:29.580]   Your Canon.
[02:12:29.580 --> 02:12:30.580]   Let's see.
[02:12:30.580 --> 02:12:31.580]   Is your Canon in the list?
[02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:32.580]   The C 300 or 500?
[02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:33.580]   Yeah.
[02:12:33.580 --> 02:12:36.620]   Even a C 70, you could make a movie for Netflix.
[02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:37.620]   Yep.
[02:12:37.620 --> 02:12:38.620]   Doing it now.
[02:12:38.620 --> 02:12:44.220]   There's a whole section here that's imaging, but if you look at sound delivery.
[02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:45.220]   Look at everything.
[02:12:45.220 --> 02:12:48.340]   There's a lot of things and it's great because Netflix arguably.
[02:12:48.340 --> 02:12:51.580]   I mean, I had a friend that was the producer.
[02:12:51.580 --> 02:12:56.980]   He was a producer and he said he's one of 900 producers that were working on shows and
[02:12:56.980 --> 02:12:59.420]   he said, and they're 900 short.
[02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:00.580]   Like this was an.
[02:13:00.580 --> 02:13:01.740]   They need more.
[02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:04.620]   They're just like this giant machine of a building.
[02:13:04.620 --> 02:13:10.900]   So that what the big thing is is that they know the big thing.
[02:13:10.900 --> 02:13:11.900]   They know how to do this.
[02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:15.540]   Like they know how like how to get the content out to the other end.
[02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:18.100]   And so they put out all these practices that saves them a lot of time.
[02:13:18.100 --> 02:13:22.180]   And if you start like even if you hope to do it at some point, then then you should
[02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:23.180]   be looking at this.
[02:13:23.180 --> 02:13:26.500]   But if you're content creating, it's worth reading no matter what because it's really
[02:13:26.500 --> 02:13:27.500]   well done.
[02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:28.500]   Yeah.
[02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:30.500]   Some of the guys on the team I've worked with in the past that the right.
[02:13:30.500 --> 02:13:32.700]   Is it the camera recommendations or all those?
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:33.700]   Yeah.
[02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:34.700]   Yeah.
[02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:35.700]   Those are great cameras.
[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:37.460]   It seems like there's other stuff that's left out.
[02:13:37.460 --> 02:13:42.660]   I think that the sick like the six K that black magic makes, I don't think the images
[02:13:42.660 --> 02:13:47.300]   any worse than the than the Ursa's, but there's just give you more more stuff, you know, so
[02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:48.500]   that maybe that makes sense.
[02:13:48.500 --> 02:13:52.140]   But the image quality, I think on the six K is well, and they don't need more than with
[02:13:52.140 --> 02:13:55.460]   the G two point six K obviously just in a camp, isn't it?
[02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:58.500]   They just as long as you're a fairly good Senate camera on that list because it doesn't
[02:13:58.500 --> 02:14:00.700]   seem like they have any of the prosumer mirrorless.
[02:14:00.700 --> 02:14:01.700]   Yeah.
[02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:02.700]   Yeah.
[02:14:02.700 --> 02:14:04.420]   I think that that was I mean, I think well, most of the prosumer stuff doesn't record
[02:14:04.420 --> 02:14:05.420]   raw.
[02:14:05.420 --> 02:14:07.580]   So, so most of the prosumer stuff is some weird.
[02:14:07.580 --> 02:14:08.900]   It has to say one as well.
[02:14:08.900 --> 02:14:09.900]   H.
[02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:10.900]   Two sixty five.
[02:14:10.900 --> 02:14:14.140]   And so they and without that you don't have enough bit depth to get and you don't have
[02:14:14.140 --> 02:14:15.580]   enough bit depth and you don't have enough resolution.
[02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:19.900]   There's a whole bunch of things that you don't have to get because it's not what you
[02:14:19.900 --> 02:14:20.900]   can shoot.
[02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:22.300]   It's what you can grade.
[02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:26.100]   So you have to be able to grade the image, you know, so color, you know, have the color
[02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:31.020]   depth so you need X number of stops within the color data that's coming in because it's
[02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:34.380]   because when you're shooting when you're shooting a show, you're not.
[02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:35.380]   It's not whizzy wig.
[02:14:35.380 --> 02:14:36.380]   It's not like, oh, I see it.
[02:14:36.380 --> 02:14:38.660]   It's going to go and that's why log is so important.
[02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:45.020]   But that log is a limited value if that log is in 8 bit or if it's in a, you know, lower
[02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:46.380]   bit rate.
[02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:49.420]   So you can because it means that, okay, now I'm going to take this low contrast image
[02:14:49.420 --> 02:14:51.780]   and make it high, higher contrast.
[02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:54.020]   And the problem that I have there is I'm going to start stretching all those colors
[02:14:54.020 --> 02:14:55.020]   out.
[02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:56.020]   So I'm going to take this little bit depth.
[02:14:56.020 --> 02:15:00.740]   If I'm not at 10 bit or 12 bit, if I'm not, if I don't have that data there to grab onto
[02:15:00.740 --> 02:15:04.940]   or the bit rate to hang on to all the details, like you take an iPhone out and sure you can
[02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:09.100]   shoot 4K HDR except one more trees.
[02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:10.500]   It looks like swirly things.
[02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:12.340]   And if you shoot with a real camera, it looks real.
[02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:14.700]   So it turned into office hours mini.
[02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:15.700]   Sorry.
[02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:16.700]   Yes.
[02:15:16.700 --> 02:15:17.780]   But I have one more question for you.
[02:15:17.780 --> 02:15:23.780]   You asked this Friday, Apple TV plus Macbeth Joel Cohen's Macbeth with Denzel Washington,
[02:15:23.780 --> 02:15:24.780]   Francis McKeown.
[02:15:24.780 --> 02:15:25.780]   Let's see this.
[02:15:25.780 --> 02:15:28.420]   First of all, it's four by three, which is really interesting.
[02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:29.420]   Weird.
[02:15:29.420 --> 02:15:30.420]   Black and white high contrast.
[02:15:30.420 --> 02:15:33.860]   What do you think they should is this on an airy or maybe or?
[02:15:33.860 --> 02:15:34.860]   Yeah.
[02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:35.860]   Yeah.
[02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:37.900]   It's like, yes, for sure.
[02:15:37.900 --> 02:15:38.900]   Right?
[02:15:38.900 --> 02:15:44.020]   I mean, all the, I mean, not all, but the vast majority of high end films that could
[02:15:44.020 --> 02:15:45.100]   have been shot on film too.
[02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:46.100]   I mean, I don't, I don't know.
[02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:47.100]   No, no, no, no, it's digital.
[02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:49.100]   You can, if you look at it, it's digital for sure.
[02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:50.100]   Yeah.
[02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:52.100]   But I, my airy kind of owns the.
[02:15:52.100 --> 02:15:57.540]   Well, you know, Roma, Roma was shot on an election and almost everything.
[02:15:57.540 --> 02:16:00.100]   It's like 80%, 80% of the major major films.
[02:16:00.100 --> 02:16:03.660]   Quarron's Academy Award winner from a couple of years back.
[02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:08.700]   It's the, so the, the, the knees, the, the knees in the area, the colored management.
[02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:09.860]   Something about it.
[02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:14.140]   It's got the soft knee on the highlights and the, and the shadows that just is a really
[02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:17.500]   pleasing, you know, black and white.
[02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:18.500]   Yeah.
[02:16:18.500 --> 02:16:19.500]   And so it's a.
[02:16:19.500 --> 02:16:20.540]   Now, why does it do for three?
[02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:21.540]   Why for three?
[02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:23.420]   Well, they probably cropped it.
[02:16:23.420 --> 02:16:24.420]   That's how I.
[02:16:24.420 --> 02:16:25.420]   Yeah.
[02:16:25.420 --> 02:16:26.420]   Yeah.
[02:16:26.420 --> 02:16:27.420]   But, but the.
[02:16:27.420 --> 02:16:28.420]   Unless it was actually later.
[02:16:28.420 --> 02:16:29.420]   Yeah.
[02:16:29.420 --> 02:16:30.420]   Yeah.
[02:16:30.420 --> 02:16:33.140]   And a lot of times you get that great.
[02:16:33.140 --> 02:16:36.820]   The best black and white isn't just converting it to black and white, like, because that
[02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:39.100]   would just be grabbing the luminance or whatever.
[02:16:39.100 --> 02:16:44.500]   Usually that's a creative combination of the color channels, um, to, you know, to, to
[02:16:44.500 --> 02:16:45.500]   affect the black and white.
[02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:51.460]   In fact, you can do that in Photoshop and you can get a much higher quality, um, black
[02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:56.980]   and white rendition by taking all the color channels and then.
[02:16:56.980 --> 02:16:58.980]   In combining them as part of the grade.
[02:16:58.980 --> 02:17:02.620]   I can't wait to see it.
[02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:03.620]   That's come up.
[02:17:03.620 --> 02:17:04.620]   It's going to be on that.
[02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:06.980]   It just looks like a great, it looks like a great version of the other thing in the.
[02:17:06.980 --> 02:17:09.260]   Danzel, Washington and, and Francis McDormand.
[02:17:09.260 --> 02:17:10.260]   Francis McDormand.
[02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:11.260]   Yeah.
[02:17:11.260 --> 02:17:12.260]   I mean, Cohen, done.
[02:17:12.260 --> 02:17:13.260]   And he had the, and he had the.
[02:17:13.260 --> 02:17:14.260]   Done.
[02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:15.260]   Yeah.
[02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:16.260]   Joe Cohen.
[02:17:16.260 --> 02:17:18.660]   I think it was just like, Joe, this is one of those because a whole bunch of the streaming
[02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:25.660]   companies, um, Apple included have, I've heard these stories that they basically go to, um,
[02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:27.100]   folks that they want to include it.
[02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:30.820]   And they say, what's your, like, what's that dream project that no one will fund?
[02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:31.820]   Will fund it.
[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:32.820]   Yeah.
[02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:36.500]   Like that's how, that's how like first they killed my father by Angelina Jolie.
[02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:40.500]   They said, what, what, we'll give you a budget, you know, $25 million to make it anything you
[02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:41.500]   want.
[02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:44.980]   And she said, well, I want to make this, I want to make something in the, the, the
[02:17:44.980 --> 02:17:47.700]   computer language, you know, like I was like, I'm going to go down the hole the whole way
[02:17:47.700 --> 02:17:50.500]   down and, and do this, this really pure.
[02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:52.740]   And they were like, uh, okay.
[02:17:52.740 --> 02:17:53.740]   And it was good.
[02:17:53.740 --> 02:17:54.740]   It's good.
[02:17:54.740 --> 02:17:57.100]   You know, it's, but so it's allowing the actors and the directors to do whatever they
[02:17:57.100 --> 02:17:58.100]   want.
[02:17:58.100 --> 02:18:02.420]   So I think that Apple just said, we'll pay for whatever you want to do.
[02:18:02.420 --> 02:18:05.340]   Um, although it's because it's a 24, it may have already been done.
[02:18:05.340 --> 02:18:08.460]   I have this in my mind for complete another fantasy.
[02:18:08.460 --> 02:18:09.460]   I don't know.
[02:18:09.460 --> 02:18:10.460]   But they're married.
[02:18:10.460 --> 02:18:11.460]   Francis McDormand and Joel Cohen.
[02:18:11.460 --> 02:18:14.900]   And I had the fantasy that one night he looked over on the, uh, the, the, the, the, the,
[02:18:14.900 --> 02:18:18.220]   and said, Francis, if you could do anything, what would you want to do?
[02:18:18.220 --> 02:18:19.820]   She said, I always want to play Lady Macbeth.
[02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:20.820]   He says done.
[02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:21.820]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:18:21.820 --> 02:18:22.820]   Apple's called me.
[02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:25.060]   Apple called me and said that I can do whatever I want.
[02:18:25.060 --> 02:18:26.060]   What do you want to do, honey?
[02:18:26.060 --> 02:18:28.060]   She was like, I want to play.
[02:18:28.060 --> 02:18:32.380]   And then she, and then he says, okay, Francis, and, and who do you think Macbeth?
[02:18:32.380 --> 02:18:33.380]   What do you think?
[02:18:33.380 --> 02:18:34.860]   I want to do it with Denzel.
[02:18:34.860 --> 02:18:35.860]   Obviously, right?
[02:18:35.860 --> 02:18:36.860]   Yeah.
[02:18:36.860 --> 02:18:38.860]   I would, I would not be surprised if that was.
[02:18:38.860 --> 02:18:39.860]   I want to play the shark.
[02:18:39.860 --> 02:18:40.860]   Oh my God.
[02:18:40.860 --> 02:18:42.620]   I can't wait to see this.
[02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:44.980]   It looks, and the reviews are incredible.
[02:18:44.980 --> 02:18:45.980]   Oh yeah.
[02:18:45.980 --> 02:18:48.620]   It's almost, it's almost perfect on the rotten tomatoes.
[02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:49.620]   Yeah.
[02:18:49.620 --> 02:18:52.620]   It's, uh, it's going to be a dying to see it.
[02:18:52.620 --> 02:18:53.620]   Yeah.
[02:18:53.620 --> 02:18:54.620]   Now, do you, uh, yeah.
[02:18:54.620 --> 02:18:55.620]   So retcon five has seen it.
[02:18:55.620 --> 02:19:00.220]   Uh, he saw it in the cinemas, uh, last year.
[02:19:00.220 --> 02:19:03.420]   Um, is it how close to the Shakespeare is it?
[02:19:03.420 --> 02:19:08.660]   It says written by Joel Cohen, but I can't imagine, you know, it says written for the
[02:19:08.660 --> 02:19:11.740]   screen by Joel Cohen based on the play by William Shakespeare.
[02:19:11.740 --> 02:19:15.660]   But then every bit I've seen in the clips have been actual Shakespearean language.
[02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:19.300]   So, oh, he says it's the fastest Macbeth ever.
[02:19:19.300 --> 02:19:21.860]   Well, a lot of times a lot of Shakespeare gets cut out.
[02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:23.940]   Like if you look at like Kenneth Berna's, oh yeah.
[02:19:23.940 --> 02:19:27.100]   And even, and even Lawrence Libby, a British and a Paris.
[02:19:27.100 --> 02:19:28.100]   Yeah.
[02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:29.100]   Yeah.
[02:19:29.100 --> 02:19:30.100]   But if you take their Henry the fifth, they cut huge chunks.
[02:19:30.100 --> 02:19:31.100]   Yeah.
[02:19:31.100 --> 02:19:32.100]   I interviewed Kenneth.
[02:19:32.100 --> 02:19:33.100]   I don't know when that came out actually.
[02:19:33.100 --> 02:19:34.100]   Oh, nice.
[02:19:34.100 --> 02:19:35.100]   Cause I was very curious.
[02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:36.100]   Yeah.
[02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:37.580]   And he's, uh, he's watching a theater when it came out.
[02:19:37.580 --> 02:19:38.580]   Yeah.
[02:19:38.580 --> 02:19:39.580]   Me too.
[02:19:39.580 --> 02:19:40.580]   Cause that's all we had.
[02:19:40.580 --> 02:19:41.580]   Yep.
[02:19:41.580 --> 02:19:42.580]   Had to watch it in theater.
[02:19:42.580 --> 02:19:49.100]   I'm going to watch this on my 4K OLED screen with HDR.
[02:19:49.100 --> 02:19:50.100]   Great.
[02:19:50.100 --> 02:19:52.540]   And it's going to be, I've already, I've been watching, I've watched the trailer like
[02:19:52.540 --> 02:19:53.540]   10 times.
[02:19:53.540 --> 02:19:56.220]   Cause that's why I want to know about the camera.
[02:19:56.220 --> 02:20:00.260]   Cause it's just, there's something about the richness of that black and white.
[02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:03.260]   It just looks so good.
[02:20:03.260 --> 02:20:04.260]   So good.
[02:20:04.260 --> 02:20:05.260]   Yeah.
[02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:06.260]   Yeah.
[02:20:06.260 --> 02:20:09.820]   Your mind has such a powerful ability to fill in details.
[02:20:09.820 --> 02:20:11.820]   And it is more real than any real audience.
[02:20:11.820 --> 02:20:12.820]   Yeah.
[02:20:12.820 --> 02:20:13.820]   That should be in black and white.
[02:20:13.820 --> 02:20:14.820]   Absolutely.
[02:20:14.820 --> 02:20:20.180]   You remember in the, in the really old days, uh, because blood on black and white doesn't
[02:20:20.180 --> 02:20:24.660]   look like blood and they would wear yellow face paint.
[02:20:24.660 --> 02:20:29.420]   Uh, cause it looked more real and they would use chocolate syrup for blood because they,
[02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:30.420]   oh yeah.
[02:20:30.420 --> 02:20:34.700]   You have to think about these things because you're going black and white, right?
[02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:40.300]   One of my favorite pieces of a special effects tricks are like from a black and white movies
[02:20:40.300 --> 02:20:44.860]   where they would do like a transformation where like beautiful wind turns into a witch
[02:20:44.860 --> 02:20:49.860]   or even like a monster transformation where it's like, Oh my God, this is 1931, but this
[02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:51.900]   is like perfect CGI.
[02:20:51.900 --> 02:20:57.340]   And the, the, what they did was they were, they had the, the person painted their face
[02:20:57.340 --> 02:21:02.140]   painted with multi-colored different makeup and they simply changed like the colored gels
[02:21:02.140 --> 02:21:03.540]   over the lighting.
[02:21:03.540 --> 02:21:08.260]   So that suddenly the black and white film was registering different highs, different
[02:21:08.260 --> 02:21:13.020]   lows and absolutely changing like from one painted mask to another, so to speak.
[02:21:13.020 --> 02:21:15.940]   That's like, my God, those people were clever in the 30s.
[02:21:15.940 --> 02:21:22.100]   So in this, in this article, uh, they mentioned that the costume designer Mary Zofris was
[02:21:22.100 --> 02:21:24.900]   on Roger Deakins and James Deakins podcast.
[02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:31.700]   And she was talking about, uh, that because McBeth was shot in black and white, um, of
[02:21:31.700 --> 02:21:34.060]   course she wants to do costume test foes in black and white.
[02:21:34.060 --> 02:21:37.100]   She said, we used to have to use a polaroid with black and white stock, but now we just
[02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:40.380]   use the iPhone with the noir setting.
[02:21:40.380 --> 02:21:45.300]   Another use for the iPhone.
[02:21:45.300 --> 02:21:46.300]   It's everywhere.
[02:21:46.300 --> 02:21:48.780]   The iPhone with the noir setting.
[02:21:48.780 --> 02:21:49.780]   Okay.
[02:21:49.780 --> 02:21:50.780]   I'm correct.
[02:21:50.780 --> 02:21:56.900]   It credits to kind of guess it color by deluxe lenses by pad of flex and filters by Instagram.
[02:21:56.900 --> 02:21:59.100]   Oh my God.
[02:21:59.100 --> 02:22:01.660]   Well, that's good to know though.
[02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:03.420]   Because, uh, that's good to know.
[02:22:03.420 --> 02:22:06.260]   I will be, uh, I'll be using the noir setting from now on.
[02:22:06.260 --> 02:22:07.380]   I just love that look.
[02:22:07.380 --> 02:22:08.820]   Don't never gave us Gotham back.
[02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:11.500]   Oh, excuseable and excusable.
[02:22:11.500 --> 02:22:15.980]   Uh, let's see here is before we take our final break.
[02:22:15.980 --> 02:22:23.900]   If there is anything I missed in the rundown that you guys wanted to talk about, um, Spotify,
[02:22:23.900 --> 02:22:28.140]   high-fied the lady indefinitely company says, we don't know what we're going to do that.
[02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:28.980]   You know what?
[02:22:28.980 --> 02:22:30.540]   I think they realize no one care.
[02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:32.260]   Well, exactly, Alex.
[02:22:32.260 --> 02:22:34.420]   Nobody wants this.
[02:22:34.420 --> 02:22:36.700]   Well, we already have enough speakers.
[02:22:36.700 --> 02:22:38.660]   Like I was like, yeah.
[02:22:38.660 --> 02:22:43.420]   But to be fair, it's more like delayed indefinitely.
[02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:45.380]   That's like that's like air power.
[02:22:45.380 --> 02:22:47.500]   That's like that's been delayed indefinitely.
[02:22:47.500 --> 02:22:47.780]   Yeah.
[02:22:47.780 --> 02:22:49.620]   This is like, yeah, we're still doing it.
[02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:53.700]   We just don't know when they did say by the end of 2021.
[02:22:53.700 --> 02:22:57.900]   So yes, I suppose you could say delayed indefinitely, but that just means they're not going to be doing it, I guess.
[02:22:57.900 --> 02:22:58.620]   Well, we'll see.
[02:22:58.620 --> 02:22:59.060]   Well, one.
[02:22:59.060 --> 02:22:59.540]   I think that would.
[02:22:59.540 --> 02:23:02.300]   I think that's a we didn't give up, but we're not going to do it.
[02:23:02.300 --> 02:23:05.260]   And this story is for Renee Richie.
[02:23:05.260 --> 02:23:16.900]   Um, just for you, the LA police officers who were recorded in 2017 by their digital in car video system.
[02:23:16.900 --> 02:23:27.260]   When they decided to go after a Snorlax instead of responding to an armed robbery and progress in a mall, um, are still fired.
[02:23:27.260 --> 02:23:29.300]   The California appeals court says.
[02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:29.820]   Right.
[02:23:29.820 --> 02:23:31.820]   No, uh, we're Nate.
[02:23:31.820 --> 02:23:32.180]   We're Nate.
[02:23:32.180 --> 02:23:33.260]   But it was a Snorlax.
[02:23:33.260 --> 02:23:34.540]   It was a Snorlax.
[02:23:34.540 --> 02:23:36.420]   Like how rare, how rare is the Snorlax?
[02:23:36.420 --> 02:23:37.100]   That's what I want to know.
[02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:40.700]   So when I first heard the story, I thought this is ridiculous because who wants a garbage Snorlax?
[02:23:40.700 --> 02:23:44.460]   And then I didn't realize it was 2017 where they're like, it was really, really rare early.
[02:23:44.460 --> 02:23:44.660]   Dear.
[02:23:44.660 --> 02:23:46.900]   So, uh, this is from the ruling.
[02:23:46.900 --> 02:23:50.340]   The hunt for Snorlax allegedly began at 609 PM.
[02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:58.940]   Uh, officer Mitchell alerted Lozano that Snorlax just, this is quotes from the digital recording system in the.
[02:23:59.420 --> 02:24:06.780]   In the, in the squad car just popped up at 46th and Limert after noting that Limert doesn't go all the way to 46.
[02:24:06.780 --> 02:24:09.540]   Lozano responded, Oh, you know what I can do?
[02:24:09.540 --> 02:24:12.180]   I'll go down 11th and swing up on Crenshaw.
[02:24:12.180 --> 02:24:13.460]   I know the way I can get to it.
[02:24:13.460 --> 02:24:16.900]   Mitchell suggested a different route than told Lozano.
[02:24:16.900 --> 02:24:22.900]   We got four minutes now, Renee, as you know, that means yes, that was a raid, right?
[02:24:22.900 --> 02:24:24.740]   That was going to end in four minutes.
[02:24:25.060 --> 02:24:29.700]   Well, but like back in the day, you also had the tracking apps that would tell you the spawn time for a longer.
[02:24:29.700 --> 02:24:30.860]   So maybe it wasn't a raid.
[02:24:30.860 --> 02:24:31.820]   Okay.
[02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:35.900]   And so what I'm guessing is they're like, uh, we have a code 143 143.
[02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:37.940]   Yes, that's the Pokedex entry for a Snorlax.
[02:24:37.940 --> 02:24:41.180]   We have a code 143 on the corner of Sunday.
[02:24:41.180 --> 02:24:44.580]   Dale, we don't have to imagine we have the recording.
[02:24:44.580 --> 02:24:51.060]   Yeah, approximately the next 20 minutes, the in car camera system captioned capture the petitioners,
[02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:56.260]   discussing Pokemon as they drove to different locations where the virtual creatures have
[02:24:56.260 --> 02:24:59.740]   apparently appeared on their mobile phones on their way to the Snorlax location.
[02:24:59.740 --> 02:25:05.020]   Officer Mitchell alerted Officer Lozano that a togetic just popped up.
[02:25:05.020 --> 02:25:12.300]   On Crenshaw, just south of 50th after Mitchell apparently caught the Snorlax,
[02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:15.940]   exclaiming in true Pokemon fashion got him.
[02:25:16.900 --> 02:25:20.660]   Petitioners agreed to go get the togetic and drove off.
[02:25:20.660 --> 02:25:22.180]   Is it dogetic or dogetic?
[02:25:22.180 --> 02:25:23.860]   Toge, I think.
[02:25:23.860 --> 02:25:28.820]   But the thing about Pokemon goal that like if you play it for any length of time,
[02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:34.860]   what it takes you in human amount of effort to get one year will be like things you throw out next to your garbage.
[02:25:34.860 --> 02:25:35.660]   Pokemon now.
[02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:35.940]   Yeah.
[02:25:35.940 --> 02:25:36.220]   Yeah.
[02:25:36.220 --> 02:25:40.900]   My, my godson was the only one who didn't get the toga tick when it was pointing at Mount Royal this one time.
[02:25:40.900 --> 02:25:41.580]   And he was so upset.
[02:25:41.580 --> 02:25:44.140]   He like, he, he was a tiny kid at the time.
[02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:44.380]   Yeah.
[02:25:44.380 --> 02:25:49.420]   Like a sit about it. So another one spawned and I raced with, with his father to go get it.
[02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:52.140]   And we arrived and I ran and I finally got it the last second.
[02:25:52.140 --> 02:25:53.660]   And now they're like on every street corner.
[02:25:53.660 --> 02:25:56.740]   But see, you understand then the officer's legitimate concern,
[02:25:56.740 --> 02:26:01.500]   even when the radio called in a robbery in progress to local mall.
[02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:04.060]   Well, wait a minute, I'll get.
[02:26:04.060 --> 02:26:09.740]   After communications made a second attempt to contact petitioners,
[02:26:09.740 --> 02:26:12.700]   Officer Lozano asked, should we ask communications?
[02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:16.860]   If there's a message, Officer Mitchell replied, it's up to you, whatever you think.
[02:26:16.860 --> 02:26:19.620]   I don't want them to think we're not paying attention to the radio.
[02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:22.580]   Lozano responded, oh, screw it.
[02:26:22.580 --> 02:26:29.540]   And they went after the Snorlax, but it didn't end there after they got the toga tick.
[02:26:29.540 --> 02:26:33.820]   The recording recorded Mitchell saying, don't run away.
[02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:35.020]   Don't run away.
[02:26:35.020 --> 02:26:41.460]   While Roslano described how he buried it and ultra bald, the toga tick before announcing got him.
[02:26:41.980 --> 02:26:44.380]   Mitchell advised he was still trying to catch it.
[02:26:44.380 --> 02:26:48.460]   This isn't the court filing, by the way, adding holy crap, man.
[02:26:48.460 --> 02:26:50.500]   This thing is fighting the crap out of me.
[02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:56.900]   Eventually, Mitchell exclaimed, holy crap, finally, apparently in reference to capturing the toga tick.
[02:26:56.900 --> 02:27:01.420]   He remarked, the guys are going to be so jealous.
[02:27:01.420 --> 02:27:03.300]   Why isn't this a TV plus show?
[02:27:03.300 --> 02:27:09.180]   But the owners then agreed to return to the 7/11 to end their watch on the way.
[02:27:09.180 --> 02:27:11.860]   Mitchell remarked, I got you a no Pokemon today, dude.
[02:27:11.860 --> 02:27:15.260]   When confronted by their sergeant saying, what the hell?
[02:27:15.260 --> 02:27:22.540]   They they claimed they were merely having a conversation about Pokemon go.
[02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:25.340]   It's going to be an episode of SWAT.
[02:27:25.340 --> 02:27:26.100]   This is amazing.
[02:27:26.100 --> 02:27:30.140]   We weren't playing a video game.
[02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:36.140]   They were charged with one failing to respond to a robbery in progress called to making misleading statements to their sergeant.
[02:27:36.140 --> 02:27:41.660]   One asked why they didn't hear the radio three failing to respond on the radio when the unit was called for
[02:27:41.660 --> 02:27:47.140]   failing to handle and assign radio call five playing Pokemon go on patrol.
[02:27:47.140 --> 02:27:47.420]   Yeah.
[02:27:47.420 --> 02:27:49.620]   That's number five.
[02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:51.820]   That's the one on the list.
[02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:54.820]   I remember like a few years ago, a friend of mine got kicked.
[02:27:54.820 --> 02:27:56.220]   She was at the cemetery at night.
[02:27:56.220 --> 02:27:57.940]   These cemeteries are always good spawning down.
[02:27:57.940 --> 02:28:00.340]   She was taking all the gyms and the police stopped her.
[02:28:00.340 --> 02:28:03.660]   And even though it's a public park, there were still hours that you're allowed to be there.
[02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:09.060]   They made her leave and then she had to watch him outside as they took all the gyms that she just spent an hour.
[02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:11.820]   Like in their squad card, driving to the different gyms and taking them.
[02:28:11.820 --> 02:28:13.460]   So it's like it's a long standing thing.
[02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:14.860]   So there.
[02:28:14.860 --> 02:28:21.060]   Yeah, if only if only we could like gamify law enforcement that I think we would clear the streets of all crime,
[02:28:21.060 --> 02:28:27.220]   like in 10 seconds, if they could basically say if there's an app that was like, send them to the next place where they could catch like a drug dealer.
[02:28:27.220 --> 02:28:32.620]   Like, oh, oh, just give vaguely Japanese game and a really cool emoji.
[02:28:32.620 --> 02:28:36.220]   Like their mug shots will turn them into emoji and say, oh, got to catch them all.
[02:28:36.220 --> 02:28:38.260]   Yes, please do petitioners.
[02:28:38.260 --> 02:28:48.780]   They admitted leaving their foot beat area in search of Snorlax, but they insisted they did so both as part of an extra patrol and to catch.
[02:28:48.780 --> 02:28:50.100]   It was a dangerous snorlax.
[02:28:50.100 --> 02:28:51.100]   It was a cold creature.
[02:28:51.100 --> 02:28:52.100]   It was cold.
[02:28:52.100 --> 02:28:54.380]   I mean, I thought that the Snorlax was dealing.
[02:28:54.380 --> 02:28:56.220]   Exactly.
[02:28:56.220 --> 02:28:57.220]   Snorlax.
[02:28:57.220 --> 02:28:58.220]   Huggy.
[02:28:58.220 --> 02:29:04.580]   You know, I really blame Huggy Bear because word on the street was that is a big crit.
[02:29:04.580 --> 02:29:06.860]   The big crits were going after the Pokemon.
[02:29:06.860 --> 02:29:08.460]   This is Star Ski and Hutch Ref.
[02:29:08.460 --> 02:29:11.020]   Well, you know that you know that Pikachu is a shock collar, right?
[02:29:11.020 --> 02:29:12.820]   Like, that's just got to be the shock collar.
[02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:15.260]   There's an awful lot of people watching here.
[02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:16.180]   Just like, what are these guys?
[02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:17.340]   Huggy Bear.
[02:29:17.340 --> 02:29:18.740]   Oh, no, you know what?
[02:29:18.740 --> 02:29:23.500]   As Lisa will reassure me at all times, people still play Pokemon Go.
[02:29:23.500 --> 02:29:24.900]   Yeah, it's a hot topic.
[02:29:24.900 --> 02:29:27.020]   We drive by the Mormon church or no, I'm sorry.
[02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:28.060]   It's not Mormon.
[02:29:28.060 --> 02:29:31.180]   It's well, whatever the church by our house.
[02:29:31.180 --> 02:29:32.500]   She swears.
[02:29:32.500 --> 02:29:33.740]   They got the gym again.
[02:29:35.140 --> 02:29:37.860]   And she has to put the red guy back in it every time.
[02:29:37.860 --> 02:29:39.780]   They got my gym.
[02:29:39.780 --> 02:29:41.580]   Lisa knows how Lisa knows how the game.
[02:29:41.580 --> 02:29:42.100]   She knows.
[02:29:42.100 --> 02:29:42.420]   She knows.
[02:29:42.420 --> 02:29:46.340]   So the craziest one is still that it's actually probably when I stopped playing
[02:29:46.340 --> 02:29:50.140]   Pokemon was when I was at the Hagia Sophia in in and.
[02:29:50.140 --> 02:29:52.100]   Oh, yeah.
[02:29:52.100 --> 02:29:52.660]   But it passed.
[02:29:52.660 --> 02:29:53.420]   No, not but it passed.
[02:29:53.420 --> 02:29:53.740]   It's not.
[02:29:53.740 --> 02:29:54.500]   No, I always confused.
[02:29:54.500 --> 02:29:54.980]   It's simple.
[02:29:54.980 --> 02:29:55.260]   Yeah.
[02:29:55.260 --> 02:29:56.460]   I was in the middle of the night.
[02:29:56.460 --> 02:29:58.820]   We were we were walking past it.
[02:29:58.820 --> 02:30:03.500]   And there's a whole bunch of people all hunched over and they're next to the
[02:30:03.500 --> 02:30:06.340]   Hagia Sophia and they're all hunched over playing Pokemon.
[02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:07.820]   Most beautiful church in the middle.
[02:30:07.820 --> 02:30:09.260]   And I was like, yeah, I don't just like.
[02:30:09.260 --> 02:30:13.780]   I can't actually Joseph's in Montreal.
[02:30:13.780 --> 02:30:14.980]   I can actually meet you.
[02:30:14.980 --> 02:30:18.500]   I've told the story on other shows, but I was we at least and I were in Malta.
[02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:23.780]   And we're standing there, you know, as one does spinning and throwing our
[02:30:23.780 --> 02:30:28.060]   pokey balls and a bunch of guy young guys comes up to us.
[02:30:28.060 --> 02:30:30.540]   We're getting a little nervous there and they don't speak English.
[02:30:30.540 --> 02:30:33.660]   Go on, go on, go on. And they brought us back to the Malta Cathedral,
[02:30:33.660 --> 02:30:34.500]   beautiful cathedral.
[02:30:34.500 --> 02:30:36.340]   And they say, raid, raid.
[02:30:36.340 --> 02:30:43.060]   It was a beautiful moment of togetherness cross cultural.
[02:30:43.060 --> 02:30:44.540]   There's there's still no gyms at Apple Park.
[02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:46.340]   If I could just put that out there for people who might be
[02:30:46.340 --> 02:30:47.940]   thinking they're adding some.
[02:30:47.940 --> 02:30:51.820]   There's still no jim that infinite loop, but there's no gyms at Apple Park.
[02:30:51.820 --> 02:30:52.740]   That's interesting.
[02:30:52.740 --> 02:30:53.500]   That's funny.
[02:30:53.500 --> 02:30:57.180]   Let's take a little break on that note.
[02:30:58.140 --> 02:31:00.860]   Your picks of the week coming up next guys.
[02:31:00.860 --> 02:31:04.580]   This episode of Mac Break Weekly brought to you by our crowd.
[02:31:04.580 --> 02:31:05.940]   What a neat idea.
[02:31:05.940 --> 02:31:09.420]   Those of us in the tech industry often see deals.
[02:31:09.420 --> 02:31:11.820]   Kevin Rose always said, Leo, you should invest.
[02:31:11.820 --> 02:31:12.620]   You got deal flow.
[02:31:12.620 --> 02:31:14.620]   You know, I don't know.
[02:31:14.620 --> 02:31:16.700]   I think I would just I wouldn't know what to do.
[02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:21.700]   But if you're an investor and you've done all the, you know, you've put away
[02:31:21.700 --> 02:31:22.660]   money for your retirement.
[02:31:22.660 --> 02:31:25.020]   I don't want you to bet the rent or anything like that.
[02:31:25.300 --> 02:31:30.140]   But if you're an investor looking to get into deal flow of companies, not even
[02:31:30.140 --> 02:31:34.860]   public yet, companies in the very earliest stages, companies really where the
[02:31:34.860 --> 02:31:37.420]   potential for growth is best.
[02:31:37.420 --> 02:31:39.100]   You ought to know about our crowd.

[02:32:03.300 --> 02:32:08.660]   like personalized medicine, cybersecurity, breakthrough stuff like robotics, quantum
[02:32:08.660 --> 02:32:13.860]   computing, all over the world, as state of the art labs, startup garages, anywhere
[02:32:13.860 --> 02:32:17.940]   in between our crowd is identifying innovators so you can invest when the growth
[02:32:17.940 --> 02:32:19.340]   potential is greatest early.

[02:32:30.220 --> 02:32:33.860]   about this in the US, they call it an accredited investor.
[02:32:33.860 --> 02:32:35.900]   You have to satisfy certain net worth requirements.
[02:32:35.900 --> 02:32:38.900]   And it's really to protect people from betting the rent money.
[02:32:38.900 --> 02:32:44.180]   This has to be for somebody who has investment money is looking for a new way to invest.
[02:32:44.180 --> 02:32:48.620]   A credited investors at our crowd have already invested over a billion dollars
[02:32:48.660 --> 02:32:50.580]   in growing tech companies.
[02:32:50.580 --> 02:32:55.020]   Twenty one of our crowd's portfolio companies are unicorns with more than a
[02:32:55.020 --> 02:32:55.900]   billion dollars.
[02:32:55.900 --> 02:33:00.740]   And many of our crowd's members have benefited from over 40 IPOs or sale
[02:33:00.740 --> 02:33:02.180]   exits of portfolio companies.
[02:33:02.180 --> 02:33:03.420]   That's why you want to get in early.
[02:33:03.420 --> 02:33:07.500]   You want to get in before the exit before the rest of the world knows what's going on.
[02:33:07.500 --> 02:33:09.260]   You have to be accredited.
[02:33:09.260 --> 02:33:12.660]   You can get started for as little as $10,000.
[02:33:12.660 --> 02:33:14.260]   That's the minimum required to invest.
[02:33:14.260 --> 02:33:16.660]   You can get into a single company deal for that.
[02:33:17.260 --> 02:33:19.500]   If you want, our crowd also has put together funds.
[02:33:19.500 --> 02:33:23.020]   So if you feel more comfortable with the fund, $50,000 is the minimum
[02:33:23.020 --> 02:33:23.860]   investment there.
[02:33:23.860 --> 02:33:27.380]   But terms will vary, as I said, depending on where you invest.
[02:33:27.380 --> 02:33:29.620]   So go to the site and put the country.
[02:33:29.620 --> 02:33:32.460]   I'll give you an example of some of the early deals, though.
[02:33:32.460 --> 02:33:35.820]   There's one there they're working right now that you could invest in right now
[02:33:35.820 --> 02:33:41.020]   called Blue Tree who could revolutionize the billion dollar plus total

[02:33:47.380 --> 02:33:52.820]   in any natural liquid, lowering health risks while retaining great taste.
[02:33:52.820 --> 02:33:54.100]   Seems like a brilliant idea.
[02:33:54.100 --> 02:33:57.620]   Blue Tree has already signed a five year, 100 million leader contract
[02:33:57.620 --> 02:33:58.780]   with an industry leader.

[02:34:42.180 --> 02:34:43.860]   So my listening, I'm really excited about.
[02:34:43.860 --> 02:34:47.420]   So Cleo Abram has been working at Vox for years.
[02:34:47.420 --> 02:34:50.100]   She's worked on the Vox Explained series for Netflix.
[02:34:50.100 --> 02:34:53.940]   Worked on a ton of videos for Vox as a really, really good TikTok account.
[02:34:53.940 --> 02:34:57.220]   She is just so immensely talented as a journalist.
[02:34:57.220 --> 02:35:00.380]   But she decided to go indie recently because she thought that a lot of
[02:35:00.380 --> 02:35:02.940]   journalism these days is kind of a little bit cynical.
[02:35:02.940 --> 02:35:05.900]   It's not as optimistic as she would like.
[02:35:05.900 --> 02:35:07.900]   And she thinks that we live much like I do.
[02:35:07.900 --> 02:35:09.500]   Like we live in an age of wonders.
[02:35:09.500 --> 02:35:13.380]   And it's not everything that we have around us now is going to become
[02:35:13.380 --> 02:35:15.300]   a change agent for the future.
[02:35:15.300 --> 02:35:18.780]   And it's hard to predict which ones will, but she wants to sort of look them out,
[02:35:18.780 --> 02:35:24.660]   find them and do like real, you know, down on the earth journalism about them.
[02:35:24.660 --> 02:35:28.140]   So she can sort of watch them as these different things are all attempted.
[02:35:28.140 --> 02:35:30.020]   And so she's she's gone independent now.
[02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:33.420]   She started a new YouTube channel and she's going to be posting regularly,
[02:35:33.420 --> 02:35:38.460]   doing a really like deep dive into a lot of the potentially transformative
[02:35:38.460 --> 02:35:40.780]   technologies that we're seeing emerge right now.
[02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:44.020]   And I just couldn't be more excited because she is so immensely talented.
[02:35:44.020 --> 02:35:50.140]   And this will give her the freedom that I think she really needs to to not just like
[02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:53.420]   whenever you do like for a big media organization, even really good ones, like
[02:35:53.420 --> 02:35:56.780]   Vox, there's always a lot of limitations on what you can do and a lot of other
[02:35:56.780 --> 02:35:59.060]   concerns and competing agendas.
[02:35:59.060 --> 02:36:01.500]   And I think this will just let her be her.
[02:36:01.500 --> 02:36:02.900]   So I'm really excited about it.
[02:36:02.900 --> 02:36:05.180]   She has her first video up already.
[02:36:05.180 --> 02:36:06.780]   She's got a really cute dog too.
[02:36:06.780 --> 02:36:07.220]   I might.
[02:36:07.220 --> 02:36:10.340]   I mean, she's just I love.
[02:36:10.340 --> 02:36:13.540]   I love the name of this huge asterisk, if true.
[02:36:13.540 --> 02:36:16.580]   Cleo, a B R, a M.
[02:36:16.580 --> 02:36:17.340]   There's her puppy.
[02:36:17.340 --> 02:36:18.380]   Oh my goodness.
[02:36:18.380 --> 02:36:19.300]   You're a good boy.
[02:36:19.300 --> 02:36:20.300]   What a good boy.
[02:36:20.300 --> 02:36:24.220]   Well, so the first video already 70,000 views.
[02:36:24.220 --> 02:36:25.060]   Why I left Vox?
[02:36:25.060 --> 02:36:25.420]   That's it.
[02:36:25.420 --> 02:36:27.420]   I'm not familiar with her work, but that's great.
[02:36:27.420 --> 02:36:28.620]   Yeah.
[02:36:28.620 --> 02:36:31.740]   And she got the huge of true from just like you see there in part of the video.
[02:36:31.740 --> 02:36:35.660]   She shows a bunch of tweets from well-known analysts just flashing by with
[02:36:35.660 --> 02:36:38.900]   all these sarcastic replies saying a huge of true, huge of true.
[02:36:38.900 --> 02:36:39.060]   Yeah.
[02:36:39.060 --> 02:36:40.900]   She just merges that into her logo.
[02:36:40.900 --> 02:36:41.220]   Yeah.
[02:36:41.220 --> 02:36:41.940]   That's good.
[02:36:41.940 --> 02:36:42.420]   I like it.
[02:36:42.420 --> 02:36:43.340]   It's a good premise.
[02:36:43.340 --> 02:36:43.540]   Yeah.
[02:36:43.540 --> 02:36:45.700]   Optimistic journalism was always going to have a place in my heart.
[02:36:45.700 --> 02:36:46.340]   Yeah.
[02:36:46.340 --> 02:36:51.180]   It's, you know, there was a recent piece from the editor in chief at Wired.
[02:36:51.180 --> 02:36:54.140]   Saying, you know, when Wired was started, it was optimistic.
[02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:56.820]   It was all about how tech is going to change the world and make a better world.
[02:36:56.820 --> 02:37:00.100]   But over time, especially under his leadership, it's gotten more and more negative.
[02:37:00.100 --> 02:37:03.180]   And he said, we kind of we got to recalibrate.
[02:37:03.180 --> 02:37:06.700]   We don't want to be pure optimists, but we don't want to be pure pessimists either.
[02:37:07.460 --> 02:37:09.620]   So we got to see it call as it lays.
[02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:13.580]   And when something is exciting and new and transformative, we should say that it's a
[02:37:13.580 --> 02:37:14.580]   challenge we have to.
[02:37:14.580 --> 02:37:16.740]   It's easy to get very cynical and negative.
[02:37:16.740 --> 02:37:19.580]   Well, also, you see that like in a lot of the critiques now of the Wall Street
[02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:23.300]   Journal, Washington Post and New York Times that a lot of it is taking stories that
[02:37:23.300 --> 02:37:24.820]   could legitimately go either way.
[02:37:24.820 --> 02:37:29.420]   But but because people have tested this, they'll put up a positive version of a story
[02:37:29.420 --> 02:37:30.620]   and a negative version of a story.
[02:37:30.620 --> 02:37:33.500]   And we'll click on the negative one way more than we'll have one.
[02:37:33.500 --> 02:37:35.820]   And sometimes bottom lines just went out with that.
[02:37:35.820 --> 02:37:37.740]   And they noticed the trends and they go for it.
[02:37:37.740 --> 02:37:39.100]   And you have to make a concerted effort.
[02:37:39.100 --> 02:37:42.100]   Like it takes energy to move things forward in a positive way.
[02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:45.540]   And like you said, I don't I don't espouse like whitewashing anything or being
[02:37:45.540 --> 02:37:50.940]   overly, but we live in an age of wonders and it's okay to sort of enjoy those things.
[02:37:50.940 --> 02:37:54.140]   Like while you're being skeptical, while you're being realistic about it, but we
[02:37:54.140 --> 02:37:56.340]   live in an age of wonders and it's fun to celebrate that too.
[02:37:56.340 --> 02:37:57.260]   Yeah. Yeah.
[02:37:57.260 --> 02:38:00.900]   Cleo Abram, huge, if true.
[02:38:00.900 --> 02:38:02.700]   New YouTube channel.
[02:38:02.700 --> 02:38:04.780]   Nothing up yet except the preview, but the.
[02:38:05.340 --> 02:38:08.300]   Maybe that was time to smash the what is it?
[02:38:08.300 --> 02:38:10.180]   Smash the like button.
[02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:11.180]   It does a scribe button.
[02:38:11.180 --> 02:38:12.540]   It do all that thing.
[02:38:12.540 --> 02:38:15.900]   Do those things as youtubers talk about Annie and I go pick of the way.
[02:38:15.900 --> 02:38:19.820]   Mine is a screen saver, believe it or not, but a really, really cool one.
[02:38:19.820 --> 02:38:20.340]   What is it?
[02:38:20.340 --> 02:38:20.900]   Is it is nice?
[02:38:20.900 --> 02:38:23.100]   I know they still exist.
[02:38:23.100 --> 02:38:27.540]   And so and those are you who are using a 24 inch CRT Sony Turner
[02:38:27.540 --> 02:38:28.580]   trust to your max.
[02:38:28.580 --> 02:38:32.140]   You definitely want to prevent burn in for those phosphors are very vulnerable.
[02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:38.300]   But this one really got my attention because it's it reproduces a clock that
[02:38:38.300 --> 02:38:41.100]   was produced by a Swedish design company that is so cool.
[02:38:41.100 --> 02:38:46.620]   It is a bank of 24 clock faces, just our hand and minute hands and the hands
[02:38:46.620 --> 02:38:51.300]   themselves keep revolving to make the shapes of a digital clock.
[02:38:51.300 --> 02:38:55.500]   So we'll tell you what time it is, like 1234, but it'll be these hands from
[02:38:55.500 --> 02:38:59.060]   these individual clock faces turning to basically make the shapes of these
[02:38:59.060 --> 02:39:02.020]   letters and numbers and also different styles and different patterns.
[02:39:02.460 --> 02:39:09.060]   Now, if I if I had not gone for the less lucrative, but more personally
[02:39:09.060 --> 02:39:13.220]   fulfilling field of independent journalism, I might be able to afford the
[02:39:13.220 --> 02:39:18.140]   $6,000 limited edition clock that this Swedish design from created.
[02:39:18.140 --> 02:39:23.540]   Fortunately, this developer just posted on GitHub just a few days ago, a
[02:39:23.540 --> 02:39:27.020]   screensaver version of this, and it shows you exactly how cool these
[02:39:27.020 --> 02:39:27.620]   animations are.
[02:39:27.620 --> 02:39:32.420]   I've had it running like since since Monday, and it's like, not only is it
[02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:35.420]   just cool to be able to look across the office and see what time it is in a
[02:39:35.420 --> 02:39:38.660]   very, very cool way and pretend that I can afford a $6,000 mantle clock.
[02:39:38.660 --> 02:39:42.740]   But also it reminded me that screensavers are supposed to be cool and
[02:39:42.740 --> 02:39:45.060]   entertaining flying toasters made us all happy.
[02:39:45.060 --> 02:39:47.860]   Like, why don't we have like really good screensavers anymore?
[02:39:47.860 --> 02:39:51.260]   For that matter, why don't we have why don't we have really good like Apple
[02:39:51.260 --> 02:39:52.780]   music visualizers anymore?
[02:39:52.780 --> 02:39:57.460]   Why do we only have like the one thing, especially for for all these
[02:39:57.460 --> 02:40:00.860]   different really good screens, all these really good like Apple TV devices we
[02:40:00.860 --> 02:40:01.180]   have.
[02:40:01.180 --> 02:40:03.380]   So I've had this thing installed.
[02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:07.260]   Yes, it only runs for me for about 45 minutes before the system says, Oh, by
[02:40:07.260 --> 02:40:09.340]   the way, I'm going to go into low power mode now.
[02:40:09.340 --> 02:40:11.940]   But for those 45 minutes, it's a pretty good time.
[02:40:11.940 --> 02:40:15.020]   Brad Root, it's open source written in Swift.
[02:40:15.020 --> 02:40:19.100]   In fact, even says shows you how you can add animations in Swift.
[02:40:19.100 --> 02:40:22.220]   Yeah, if you want to, which is very, very cool.
[02:40:22.220 --> 02:40:22.940]   Nice job.
[02:40:22.940 --> 02:40:26.340]   And again, it's a get so you can get the Xcode project.
[02:40:26.340 --> 02:40:27.300]   You can make modifications.
[02:40:27.300 --> 02:40:28.100]   You can see how it works.
[02:40:28.100 --> 02:40:28.460]   Yeah.
[02:40:28.460 --> 02:40:28.980]   Yeah.
[02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:30.340]   Really cool.
[02:40:30.340 --> 02:40:34.540]   Uh, in fact, you can help him make the numbers not negative because he
[02:40:34.540 --> 02:40:38.220]   didn't, he was too lazy to go back and make him positive after reworking the
[02:40:38.220 --> 02:40:39.180]   animation system.
[02:40:39.180 --> 02:40:42.460]   So that would be a good poll request.
[02:40:42.460 --> 02:40:45.380]   You might want to submit just just for that.
[02:40:45.380 --> 02:40:46.980]   Uh, Mr.
[02:40:46.980 --> 02:40:48.740]   Alex Lindsey, I saved the best.
[02:40:48.740 --> 02:40:51.620]   Well, maybe not the best, but the most expensive for last.
[02:40:51.620 --> 02:40:52.460]   What do you get?
[02:40:52.460 --> 02:40:54.500]   Some of it's expensive as home as not.
[02:40:54.540 --> 02:40:56.460]   So, um, this one looks expensive.
[02:40:56.460 --> 02:40:57.540]   It can be.
[02:40:57.540 --> 02:40:58.340]   Um, yeah.
[02:40:58.340 --> 02:41:03.500]   So the, uh, so we had a Harrison consoles on this morning, actually, and I
[02:41:03.500 --> 02:41:05.660]   didn't really know much about them to be honest.
[02:41:05.660 --> 02:41:09.820]   They've been around for 40 years, but I hadn't really used Harrison consoles.
[02:41:09.820 --> 02:41:12.420]   I'd heard about them, but I didn't really know much, much about it at all.
[02:41:12.420 --> 02:41:14.580]   They don't go to a lot of conferences and I just hadn't seen them.
[02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:19.740]   It turns out that about 10 years, 13 years ago, they pivoted and started, um,
[02:41:19.740 --> 02:41:23.780]   you know, doing virtual, you know, doz, you know, digital audio workstations.
[02:41:23.820 --> 02:41:26.500]   Um, you know, based on hardware, they were all software.
[02:41:26.500 --> 02:41:27.860]   Well, they make hardware.
[02:41:27.860 --> 02:41:31.180]   And so they were already going, they had already moved to software based
[02:41:31.180 --> 02:41:33.460]   mixers, um, hardware mixers.
[02:41:33.460 --> 02:41:36.620]   They started with analog hardware mixers and they went to software based in like
[02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:39.300]   2004, 2005, then they started doing gauze.
[02:41:39.300 --> 02:41:42.100]   And what happened was at the beginning of COVID, everyone was looking.
[02:41:42.100 --> 02:41:44.820]   All of us were trying to figure out how do I mix audio in the cloud?
[02:41:44.820 --> 02:41:46.340]   And so they're all looking around.
[02:41:46.340 --> 02:41:50.340]   And the only thing that really was close was, um, their mix bus.
[02:41:50.340 --> 02:41:51.140]   This is a mix bus.
[02:41:51.140 --> 02:41:52.740]   Um, now this is a VBM.
[02:41:52.740 --> 02:41:56.820]   This is what actually, um, what they ended up with, um, and they're just
[02:41:56.820 --> 02:41:58.740]   releasing, uh, in the last couple of months.
[02:41:58.740 --> 02:42:02.580]   So, um, mix bus 32 and mix bus itself.
[02:42:02.580 --> 02:42:06.180]   Those are relatively inexpensive little doz that will let you that you can
[02:42:06.180 --> 02:42:10.940]   actually mix a show with, um, and they are 50 bucks and $350 each, depending
[02:42:10.940 --> 02:42:11.700]   on which one you have.
[02:42:11.700 --> 02:42:16.180]   Now this one, this cloud ready broadcast mixer is $2,800 a year.
[02:42:16.180 --> 02:42:19.860]   Like this is when you get serious and go, I'm going to make a business out of
[02:42:19.860 --> 02:42:23.420]   this, this is what you can, you know, get as a, um, you know, kind of a
[02:42:23.420 --> 02:42:27.580]   monthly for, I don't know, you know, it's all the inputs be in the cloud too.
[02:42:27.580 --> 02:42:28.100]   I mean, is it?
[02:42:28.100 --> 02:42:28.500]   Yeah.
[02:42:28.500 --> 02:42:30.300]   So basically you can use NDI.
[02:42:30.300 --> 02:42:34.380]   So you can basically have a show and have, because a lot of us are building
[02:42:34.380 --> 02:42:38.300]   shows where we have, for instance, we have a bunch of zoom in the cloud and
[02:42:38.300 --> 02:42:42.780]   we're pushing those via NDI out into a, into a switcher, like V mix in the cloud.
[02:42:42.780 --> 02:42:44.780]   But the hardest part was what do you do with the audio?
[02:42:44.780 --> 02:42:46.020]   Like how do you make the audio work?
[02:42:46.060 --> 02:42:51.620]   And so you can now pass this into it and big companies like Google and Yahoo and,
[02:42:51.620 --> 02:42:54.460]   you know, a bunch of other people are testing it like Sky and other folks are,
[02:42:54.460 --> 02:42:59.140]   like this is the thing right now that is, that is, um, working, you know, for
[02:42:59.140 --> 02:42:59.780]   what they're doing.
[02:42:59.780 --> 02:43:03.180]   And, um, and so it, and they built it, basically what they did is they took a
[02:43:03.180 --> 02:43:06.460]   whole bunch of input over the last year and started building in all the mix
[02:43:06.460 --> 02:43:06.900]   minuses.
[02:43:06.900 --> 02:43:09.580]   So instead of having to like design a mix minus that you would normally do in
[02:43:09.580 --> 02:43:10.540]   the die, you just hit a button.
[02:43:10.540 --> 02:43:11.900]   This is another contributor.
[02:43:11.900 --> 02:43:14.860]   And then, you know, and, and so they've had a lot of really good input.
[02:43:14.860 --> 02:43:18.620]   And so, so anyway, so it's, if you're trying to do something, I mean, it will work
[02:43:18.620 --> 02:43:20.900]   locally as well as a software mixer.
[02:43:20.900 --> 02:43:26.940]   Now, but it's, it is what a lot of people are using it for is, uh, is putting it
[02:43:26.940 --> 02:43:29.060]   like literally on an AWS instance.
[02:43:29.060 --> 02:43:32.660]   And then now all their audio can be managed and powerfully.
[02:43:32.660 --> 02:43:37.620]   And again, it was something that I was pretty, even, even doing what I do, I'd
[02:43:37.620 --> 02:43:40.540]   heard it go by a little bit, but until a couple of weeks ago, I didn't even
[02:43:40.540 --> 02:43:41.140]   know it existed.
[02:43:41.140 --> 02:43:42.340]   It was someone in office hours.
[02:43:43.340 --> 02:43:46.660]   Was saying, Oh, we really need to bring, we really need to bring these guys on.
[02:43:46.660 --> 02:43:47.700]   They're doing something pretty cool.
[02:43:47.700 --> 02:43:52.180]   And, uh, and so when I met with them last week and talked and talked about it and
[02:43:52.180 --> 02:43:56.300]   started and, and then some of folks in our group already use it.
[02:43:56.300 --> 02:43:58.300]   Um, and they were like, Oh, this is great.
[02:43:58.300 --> 02:43:59.060]   This is what we use.
[02:43:59.060 --> 02:44:01.140]   And so, so anyway, so, um, we're pretty excited.
[02:44:01.140 --> 02:44:04.460]   We're going to start using this a lot in our, in our own cloud productions.
[02:44:04.460 --> 02:44:05.620]   Wow.
[02:44:05.620 --> 02:44:06.620]   That's really cool.
[02:44:06.620 --> 02:44:07.380]   Yeah.
[02:44:07.380 --> 02:44:08.300]   Really neat.
[02:44:08.300 --> 02:44:13.060]   Um, it is Harrison, which is at Harrison consoles.
[02:44:13.540 --> 02:44:14.740]   Dot com.
[02:44:14.740 --> 02:44:16.300]   That's right there on the front page.
[02:44:16.300 --> 02:44:17.820]   Mixbus VBM.
[02:44:17.820 --> 02:44:21.980]   Kids, it's a, it's about time we wrapped this thing up.
[02:44:21.980 --> 02:44:25.500]   All those rat holes made the show an hour longer than usual.
[02:44:25.500 --> 02:44:29.660]   So, uh, I thought we would have anything to say.
[02:44:29.660 --> 02:44:32.860]   We never have that problem.
[02:44:32.860 --> 02:44:38.900]   No, no, this is why the teacher, this is why the teacher keeps separating us
[02:44:38.900 --> 02:44:42.420]   because we have the same row together to disrupt the whole class.
[02:44:42.420 --> 02:44:43.420]   Yeah.
[02:44:43.420 --> 02:44:48.020]   You could find Alex Lindsey at office hours dot a global.
[02:44:48.020 --> 02:44:50.340]   That is, uh, that is the full time.
[02:44:50.340 --> 02:44:51.380]   It's not just Alex.
[02:44:51.380 --> 02:44:57.980]   It's much, much more, uh, full time zoom conference that is on Twitter.
[02:44:57.980 --> 02:44:59.540]   Uh, sorry, uh, YouTube.
[02:44:59.540 --> 02:45:01.660]   You stream the whole thing on YouTube now, right?
[02:45:01.660 --> 02:45:03.900]   Uh, we, yeah, we put it all on YouTube.
[02:45:03.900 --> 02:45:05.700]   Um, we, we don't stream all of it.
[02:45:05.700 --> 02:45:09.940]   We stream two hours a day of it, but it's people are talking 24 hours a day.
[02:45:10.140 --> 02:45:12.500]   There's two hours that we, that we make it look like a show.
[02:45:12.500 --> 02:45:15.380]   Um, one thing we started doing in the background.
[02:45:15.380 --> 02:45:16.860]   Yeah, we're all just talking.
[02:45:16.860 --> 02:45:20.300]   You're like, you know, just random conversations and depending on who's there.
[02:45:20.300 --> 02:45:21.900]   It just becomes kind of a geeky conversation.
[02:45:21.900 --> 02:45:24.260]   I would love this keynote deep dive with Alex Lindsey.
[02:45:24.260 --> 02:45:25.700]   That looks really good.
[02:45:25.700 --> 02:45:26.380]   Yeah, we did that.
[02:45:26.380 --> 02:45:31.820]   So we're starting our education, uh, hour, two, two hours on Saturday has now.
[02:45:31.820 --> 02:45:33.260]   We've added another hour to it.
[02:45:33.260 --> 02:45:36.780]   So it's three hours long and it is, uh, but it's technical talks.
[02:45:36.780 --> 02:45:40.940]   So technical talks that hopefully impact educators or people in education of all kinds.
[02:45:40.940 --> 02:45:52.580]   And so we wanted to do last week we did, I did kind of a, it wasn't, I mean, it was really like we, we started doing, um, just all the things that the way I, I'm, I'm build three or four slide decks a week in keynote.
[02:45:52.580 --> 02:45:57.860]   And, um, so I was just talking about some of the, here's some of the tools that I use that I don't see anybody else use.
[02:45:57.860 --> 02:46:00.620]   So just me talking about the things that I use that no one else uses.
[02:46:00.620 --> 02:46:06.380]   And then, um, next week we're, we have, we have some great folks coming on to talk about, um,
[02:46:06.380 --> 02:46:16.220]   uh, they're going to talk about how they're using live, um, uh, the live video inside of keynote for, to build a video.
[02:46:16.220 --> 02:46:18.860]   So literally you can just use keynote as a video production.
[02:46:18.860 --> 02:46:28.540]   They're using it as a live video production tool, like they're cutting to things and showing things and playing videos and everything else with a live input from a switcher going into keynote, um, in real time.
[02:46:28.540 --> 02:46:29.980]   And so they're going to talk a little bit about that.
[02:46:29.980 --> 02:46:31.740]   And I'm going to show a couple of examples of that as well.
[02:46:31.740 --> 02:46:35.420]   So we're going to talk about the new live, the newer live video.
[02:46:35.420 --> 02:46:42.540]   Um, uh, support and keynote when we took talking about that on the, the Saturday on Sabado, Cagante.
[02:46:42.540 --> 02:46:48.940]   That was, that was a little while ago, but yeah, that's sad.
[02:46:48.940 --> 02:46:51.020]   That was, we, we, we did four hours.
[02:46:51.020 --> 02:46:53.980]   We had concerts and cooking and all kinds of that super Saturday.
[02:46:53.980 --> 02:46:57.340]   Office hours are global.
[02:46:57.340 --> 02:47:02.860]   And of course, if you want to hire Alex, as many, many do some of the biggest companies, uh, and governments in the world.
[02:47:02.860 --> 02:47:06.540]   Oh, nine, oh, dot media, oh, no media.
[02:47:06.540 --> 02:47:07.140]   Dot com.
[02:47:07.140 --> 02:47:09.980]   Oh, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no, no.
[02:47:09.980 --> 02:47:10.540]   Dot media.
[02:47:10.540 --> 02:47:11.020]   Yeah.
[02:47:11.020 --> 02:47:11.900]   Exactly.
[02:47:11.900 --> 02:47:13.020]   And we, we do.
[02:47:13.020 --> 02:47:13.260]   Yeah.
[02:47:13.260 --> 02:47:16.220]   Virtual events and, um, complex pipelines.
[02:47:16.220 --> 02:47:22.300]   Mr. Andy Anaco, WGBH Boston next to performance.
[02:47:22.300 --> 02:47:32.620]   Uh, uh, 1230 on Friday, uh, go to WGBH new, WGBH news.org live or left or, or, or later to stream it live or later.
[02:47:32.620 --> 02:47:40.380]   And I'm also going to be doing an, an AMA on, uh, on the Twitch, uh, Discord of, right after I finished doing NPR.
[02:47:40.380 --> 02:47:46.220]   So questions, if you remember any questions you have about me or any questions, you would ideally,
[02:47:46.220 --> 02:47:51.740]   questions that are not about me, but you'd like to my opinion on what you probably, because I'm not really that interesting.
[02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:52.940]   Uh, I will not have that.
[02:47:52.940 --> 02:47:57.340]   And let me just, let me just start off with, I'm not telling you what is behind the screen.
[02:47:57.340 --> 02:47:59.020]   Oh, that's what we really want to know.
[02:47:59.020 --> 02:48:01.740]   There's a legal issue there.
[02:48:01.740 --> 02:48:03.580]   There's a person.
[02:48:03.580 --> 02:48:05.500]   It's a person behind the screen.
[02:48:05.500 --> 02:48:07.980]   That is for, by the way, club, Twitch members.
[02:48:07.980 --> 02:48:12.140]   And we'd love to have you join club, now 4,000 strong and growing.
[02:48:12.140 --> 02:48:17.660]   And, uh, it's really helpful for us to smooth out the economic ups and downs,
[02:48:17.660 --> 02:48:18.780]   especially during COVID.
[02:48:18.780 --> 02:48:22.780]   It's been kind of crazy, but also it's a great way to get extra content from
[02:48:22.780 --> 02:48:27.660]   Twitch, $7 a month. You get ad free versions of all the shows. You also get access to the
[02:48:27.660 --> 02:48:30.540]   Twitch Discord, which is always a great place to hang.
[02:48:30.540 --> 02:48:36.140]   And that's where we do some of these events like, uh, Andy's asked me anything this week.
[02:48:36.140 --> 02:48:39.980]   Stacy has her book club. Stacy, you got both them's book club there.
[02:48:39.980 --> 02:48:44.140]   The Giz fizz, the untitled Linux show, there's all sorts of stuff going on in the club,
[02:48:44.140 --> 02:48:50.220]   Twitch Discord, plus, uh, you know, you get the Twitch plus feed, which is where Andy's asked me
[02:48:50.220 --> 02:48:54.460]   anything will end up, uh, uh, as after it's all done.
[02:48:54.460 --> 02:48:59.580]   And there's all sorts of stuff in the Twitch plus feed, including, um, uh, stuff before and
[02:48:59.580 --> 02:49:03.500]   after the show that, that believe you're not as often more interesting than the shows themselves.
[02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:09.340]   Friday, 10 a.m. Andy and Aco, that's going to be something to listen to.
[02:49:09.340 --> 02:49:12.220]   You can listen live or after the fact on the Twitch plus feed.
[02:49:12.220 --> 02:49:14.460]   If you're not a club, Twitter member, why the heck not?
[02:49:14.460 --> 02:49:18.780]   We want to invite you to join, uh, just go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:49:18.780 --> 02:49:21.980]   There's also corporate membership. So you have several corporate members now as well.
[02:49:21.980 --> 02:49:25.980]   And we welcome that. It's great to have you. Thank you so much club twit members.
[02:49:25.980 --> 02:49:30.300]   Renee Richie is on YouTube, youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:49:30.300 --> 02:49:36.140]   Yes, sir. Oh, you know, I'm just giving you a chance to plug something.
[02:49:36.140 --> 02:49:40.540]   Oh, you're so nice to everybody else. You should plug yourself sometimes.
[02:49:40.540 --> 02:49:44.860]   I did a two minute highlight reel of the original Steve Jobs iPhone introduction,
[02:49:44.860 --> 02:49:50.220]   but with footage from the last 15 years of introductions just so that I love those words.
[02:49:50.220 --> 02:49:56.620]   They're so iconic, but you can see the entire sort of history of the iPhone play out in the,
[02:49:56.620 --> 02:50:03.100]   in those two minutes of him announcing. Oh, that's what a great idea. I definitely
[02:50:03.100 --> 02:50:10.540]   watch that. That sounds really, really cool. Join the 303,000 subscribers now who are devotees
[02:50:10.540 --> 02:50:17.020]   of Renee's YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie. There's also the untold history of the iPhone.
[02:50:17.020 --> 02:50:21.900]   Yeah. Oh, nice. So many stories. So many stories.
[02:50:21.900 --> 02:50:26.460]   I'm working on a continuation of that. I want to do a part two where it talks about Eric,
[02:50:26.460 --> 02:50:32.300]   Eric Schmitt's interesting gambit between the Android team and the iPhone team as to who knew
[02:50:32.300 --> 02:50:38.380]   what and when about, you know, everything that was going on. Oh, that's fun. Very nice.
[02:50:38.380 --> 02:50:41.900]   You're doing such a good, good job. Renee Ritchie is on YouTube.
[02:50:41.900 --> 02:50:49.420]   Smash the subscribe button, hit the bell, ding the dong, do it all because he's awesome.
[02:50:49.420 --> 02:50:53.500]   What's now? There's this thing that says join next to the subscribe button. What's that mean?
[02:50:53.500 --> 02:51:00.220]   Oh, yeah. I'm testing that out because Patreon is like, it's different. Like, it's very different.
[02:51:00.220 --> 02:51:04.460]   And YouTube has this new membership thing where they let you have like a members-only area and
[02:51:04.460 --> 02:51:08.140]   let you offer members-only videos and stuff. So I'm trying it out. Might move from Patreon
[02:51:08.140 --> 02:51:12.460]   to YouTube, but I'm not sure yet. Everything in one basket versus the convenience of integration.
[02:51:12.460 --> 02:51:15.980]   Yeah. So you could do both. I guess you can't really.
[02:51:15.980 --> 02:51:20.060]   Yeah, you can. Like it's just maintaining all these digital gardens at some point.
[02:51:20.060 --> 02:51:24.460]   Well, I support it. That's great. Join. I'm going to enjoy.
[02:51:24.460 --> 02:51:31.580]   We do Mac break weekly of a Tuesday. We start a little late today because, well, we were talking
[02:51:31.580 --> 02:51:39.260]   about comic books. You know how it is. Normally, you should tune in at 11am Pacific for the comic book
[02:51:39.260 --> 02:51:46.620]   conversation. 11am Pacific 2pm Eastern 1800, I'm sorry, 1900 UTC of a Tuesday morning or afternoon,
[02:51:46.620 --> 02:51:52.940]   depending on where you are, you can watch it at live.twit.tv. If you're watching live chat live at irc.twit.tv
[02:51:52.940 --> 02:51:59.820]   or in the club Twit Discord. After the fact on demand versions of the show available at twit.tv/mbw.
[02:52:00.380 --> 02:52:04.860]   There's a YouTube channel dedicated to Mac break weekly. And of course, the best way to
[02:52:04.860 --> 02:52:10.940]   subscribe would be to get out that podcast player of yours and add us. So you get it automatically.
[02:52:10.940 --> 02:52:18.060]   The minute it's available. And if your podcast program allows reviews, would you do me the service
[02:52:18.060 --> 02:52:23.500]   of favor of just giving us a five star review. That's all I ask. Just helps spread the word
[02:52:23.500 --> 02:52:29.180]   about Mac break weekly. Thanks everybody. Get back to work though now because, say it with me,
[02:52:29.180 --> 02:52:31.420]   break time is over. Bye bye.
[02:52:31.980 --> 02:52:37.420]   Do you have an iPhone, an Apple watch, an iPad or any number of Apple devices? Well,
[02:52:37.420 --> 02:52:42.700]   you have got to check out iOS today with me, Mike as Sergeant and Rosemary Orchard. We cover
[02:52:42.700 --> 02:52:51.580]   all things iOS and help you get the most out of your devices.
