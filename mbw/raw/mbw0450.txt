[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.880]   Hello.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.280]   Leila Port is off in Las Vegas at NAB,
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.920]   leaving me and Yannaco of the Chicago Suntimes,
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.660]   nominally in charge of the panel,
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.220]   but we have their usual powerhouse panel,
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.360]   including the guest panelist,
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.760]   Substream for Leo that we most like to have.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.860]   First up, Alex Lindsey, though, is back with us.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.260]   Alex, how you doing today?
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.960]   -Hello from Vegas.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.860]   -From Vegas.
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.000]   So we're seeing a really good hotel room interior.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   What's your light source?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.640]   Because your light source is gorgeous.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.440]   -It's a window.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.440]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.140]   -All I have is a big window.
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.740]   I'm looking out over Las Vegas right now.
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.980]   It turns out to be a very good light source.
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.980]   -Is it a high roller window or is it a deadbeat window?
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.180]   -I think it's a deadbeat window.
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.020]   -I believe this didn't -- -That's the N.D.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.920]   -Didn't they dome over Las Vegas
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.920]   so that they could have one son for the people,
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.020]   for the whales and another one for the bus traffic?
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.360]   -No, I think the whales are right above me
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.460]   in the real nice places.
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.560]   I can see the little edge where that begins.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.160]   In fact, when the wind blows, some of the metal is vibrating.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.900]   -If you're underneath, you can't see the whales breach.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.940]   And that's the most majestic reason to happen.
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.040]   -Also with us, for my more, is Renee Ritchie.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.340]   Renee, how you doing?
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.240]   -It's going to be very well, Andy.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.240]   We finally thought out.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.640]   I can look outside and see something that approximates green.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.580]   -I know.
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.480]   -Just last week, I had to go for Boulder,
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.980]   but for two days before that,
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.620]   the critters were back in the backyard
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.720]   for the first time in months.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.620]   They were shell-shocked, but they were ready to trust again.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.220]   And the squirrels were desperately trying to get at the hordes.
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.720]   They buried four months ago,
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.260]   but they haven't been able to get at because of the ice.
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.360]   -Soggy greatness, Andy. Soggy greatness.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.400]   -I will take gray skies and people playing baseball
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.040]   and being able to back into my driveway
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.700]   without having to cut the wheel twice.
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.000]   That's springtime to me.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.720]   -Beautiful.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.500]   Filling in for Leo this week is,
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.720]   Srenee Caldwell, also for my more Srenee.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.720]   How you doing this week?
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.060]   -I'm doing great. How are you doing, Leo?
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.460]   I just called you Leo. That's really hilarious.
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.160]   How are you doing, Andy?
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.900]   I'm really -- Yeah, I'm tired, but otherwise great.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.600]   -Yeah, I know what you mean.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.940]   I am guest Leo this week,
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.400]   but I don't have the guts to either shave my head
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.500]   or tattoo my butt.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.940]   -There you go. I gave you the lower third.
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.900]   You're Leo now. -There you go.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.400]   There we go.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.600]   -Ooh, that's right. -This is your new name.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.240]   You've been even present.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.940]   -Do I have access to Leo's corporate amex?
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.940]   -I'm working on it. -I'm working on it.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.980]   -Because everybody -- I think it's bonus time
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.580]   here at Mac Break Weekly.
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.620]   Some of us don't have Apple watches.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.880]   Some of us don't have new Mac books,
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.720]   but we can fix that before Leo gets back.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.720]   Yes, but finally, we got some great stuff
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.160]   to talk about this week with both the start of pre-orders
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.700]   for the Apple Watch last Friday
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.900]   and also the start of availability for the new Mac book,
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.700]   but let's start talking about the Apple Watch.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.400]   There are some pre-order sales numbers
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.440]   from a research group called Slice Intelligence.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.740]   They have access to only U.S. data,
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.540]   and I talked to them a couple of days ago
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.740]   about where they're getting their data from.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.040]   They have basically a panel,
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.540]   a sample of 2 million users,
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.180]   and they have access to their e-reseats.
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.380]   But for whatever this is worth,
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.220]   they figure that Apple sold roughly
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.720]   about a million Apple watches pre-ordered.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.960]   They're saying that 2/3 of those
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.860]   were the sport model, the cheapest model of course.
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.100]   Each consumer spent an average of $540, $504.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.700]   The average order is 1.3,
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.600]   so you can get one for yourself
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.900]   and one for your 0.3 kids.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.400]   And the most popular was the space gray color
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.280]   followed by steel,
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.080]   and the black band was most popular.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.120]   Also interesting that 71%
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.880]   seem to have bought the larger
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.780]   as opposed to the smaller watch.
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.580]   Let's actually start off by asking,
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.940]   I want to know who has anybody pre-ordered one yet?
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.280]   I will answer my old question first.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.520]   I did not because it was a $350 minimum thing,
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.780]   and I run an Android phone,
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.080]   so I couldn't really justify it.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.420]   But Alex, did you pre-order?
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.000]   - I have not, I went to pre-order.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.120]   And of course, the first thing that I found out
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.760]   is I didn't really know what prices would be what.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.400]   Of course, the one that I want was the most expensive one
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.960]   other than the old one.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.040]   So first, I decided I had to think about that a little bit.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.640]   And secondly, it wouldn't ship until July.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.280]   And so I felt like I could probably wait now
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.340]   that I've missed the boat.
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.180]   And that was like eight o'clock in the morning
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.460]   or nine o'clock in the morning on Friday
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.460]   that I found out that it was gonna be July.
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.500]   So they've obviously sold a couple
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.260]   or they didn't make very many.
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260]   - You know, go ahead.
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.820]   - I'm sorry, go ahead, keep talking.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.460]   - I think that's interesting.
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.780]   The reports of 5.5 million, it'll be interesting to see.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.540]   But there's also so many variations.
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.240]   So there's so many different options
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.240]   of how many fit into each one of these little panels.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.120]   I think that's probably one of the challenges.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.120]   But it's like everything else
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.920]   probably need to be patient and figure out.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.440]   And we're gonna spend that much money.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.520]   I do definitely want the one that I want.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.440]   (laughing)
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.640]   - Yeah, that was a big deal for me too.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.640]   I did check, I did do another check of the store
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.000]   just an hour ago and things seem to have improved
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.720]   a little bit because I couldn't find a watch
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.920]   that was not available later than June.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.720]   So maybe they figured out,
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.280]   when the container ship is coming back,
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.580]   Renee, did you pre-order a watch?
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.980]   - I did, I don't usually pre-order
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.280]   'cause I actually like going to the stores
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.100]   when they have lineups and they do the little song
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.500]   and dance routines and everyone claps and you come in.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.540]   And I like all those festivities.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.500]   But we talked about that Angela Aaron's memo
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.340]   press release last week and about how they were trying
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.420]   to push everyone online.
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.900]   So I wasn't sure there would be any in store availability.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.760]   So I broke down and bought the watch that Alex didn't get.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.060]   So I'm thankful that Alex left it available for him.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.100]   (laughing)
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.780]   And then I got a bunch of bands to go with it.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.560]   I always panic and you're like,
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.040]   I'm gonna wait just ask you what you want
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.880]   and you haven't made up your mind
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.980]   and you blurt something out.
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.760]   And I was saying, I want the black stainless steel,
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.800]   but then it won't go with the bands.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   And then the silver stainless steel,
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.560]   but then I might as well get the silver aluminum,
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.400]   but then it's not, you know, it's not the metals not as.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.200]   And I just ended up getting the black stainless steel.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.200]   - And you feel like your place in line is about to go away.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.360]   There's a, the short version of the most embarrassing
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.600]   social errors of my life,
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.760]   I wound up sticking a friend with the cost
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.640]   of a full lobster dinner because I arrived late,
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.760]   did not know that he said that,
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.900]   he announced he was going to be picking up the whole check.
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.560]   The waitress took about 45 minutes to get our order.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.700]   And when I ordered the casserole, I wanted to get,
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.280]   they were out and she was about to leave
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.120]   for another half hour.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.960]   So I desperately said, fine,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.520]   give me the lobster was a lobster place.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.580]   So I know what you mean.
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.540]   It's like, you see the countdown timer saying,
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.420]   give me, give me, give me the whale gray made out
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.100]   of dolphin beak and you have an 81 millimeter,
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.780]   well, I'll take the 81 millimeter one.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.700]   - Exactly. - How about you, Ryn?
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.540]   - I did pre-order.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.820]   I pre-ordered a 38 millimeter sport
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.060]   with the white sport band.
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.300]   That was a late last minute decision.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.220]   I was originally pretty gung-ho on the blue.
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.460]   And then at the very last second was like,
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.980]   well, the white might be more appropriate for all.
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.340]   I'm just gonna go with the white.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.340]   But I also got a Milanese loop thinking that,
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.660]   well, I really want a slightly fancier band
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.980]   for non-roller derby endeavors.
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.660]   And I really liked the look of the modern buckle,
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.260]   but unfortunately it's $249,
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.360]   which is about as much as the sport itself.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.820]   So the Milanese is a slightly less pricey $149.
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:47.780]   And that kind of sold me.
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.620]   And I'm like, well, I really liked the look of it too.
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.900]   And when I went and tried it on yesterday
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.660]   and actually even got the watch specialist
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.860]   to swap out bands.
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.540]   So I could see how the sport looked with the Milanese.
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.460]   I was totally 100% confirmed.
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.940]   I managed to order in the first three minutes
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.940]   through the App Store, Apple Store app.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.900]   And as a result, I theoretically, I think,
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.860]   I'm in the original ship window,
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.700]   which is I think 424 to May 2nd.
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.060]   I'm, yeah, hey, look at that.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.020]   I even, there's a thing up on IMOR too
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.900]   that has more beautiful pictures of it
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.660]   that I posted this morning.
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:31.660]   But yeah, I'm a little terrified about ship times
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.020]   because I had it shipped to my parents' house
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.220]   since I'm gonna be down in the California area
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.940]   for Yosemite, for the Yosemite Conference by Coco Comf,
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.940]   which you're going to that as well, Andy, yeah.
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.860]   - You're saying? - Is that right?
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.980]   - Indeed. - Yeah.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.220]   So I'm going down to LA after that.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.420]   And I'm like, oh, shoot, I'm gonna be in Los Angeles
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.780]   on Apple Watch launch day.
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.220]   So I'm really hoping that I had the initial launch
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.380]   and it's getting sent to my parents' house.
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.980]   Otherwise, I'm gonna be back home
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.940]   and my watch is gonna be in California
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.580]   and I'm gonna be very, very sad.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.580]   - Ren, I hope that right now,
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.820]   throughout, through the chat room,
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.220]   throughout everyone listening live,
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.700]   you can feel the waves of sympathy and support,
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.380]   as you say, that you might have to wait three days
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.820]   till the maybe the end of April before you get your watch.
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.220]   So I, you know, surely on this side of Jerusalem,
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.020]   none suffer as you suffer.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.740]   - No, but, Locke, I'm interested in your thought process
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.580]   on buying it.
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.300]   Like, let's say, if you could divorce yourself
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.780]   from the idea that you are a tech writer
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.940]   and people are gonna be asking you for your opinions on this
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.940]   and you can generate a lot of different things
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.020]   to write about about this,
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.540]   would you still have bought it just as a regular consumer?
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:46.740]   - I would say yes, primarily for the health tracking functions
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.820]   and the fact that pretty much it all centers
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.500]   around roller derby and me being a jerk to people.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.700]   The roller derby side is very much that I have yet
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.180]   to find a fitness tractor that accurately represents
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.300]   what I do on roller skates on a daily basis,
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.300]   which is to say the kind of high intensity sport
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.980]   that I play is not easily measured by steps
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.820]   because you're on roller skates and it's very,
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.020]   it's fast paced, there's a lot of movement,
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.900]   you're working muscles in a very different way
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.180]   than you are in other sports,
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.220]   and it becomes, and it's not, you know,
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.820]   there's not basketball under most activity entries, right?
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:30.180]   You can't, roller derby is so new that people don't quite
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.580]   know how to categorize it or know how many calories
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.100]   or how good it is for your body or bad, I suppose,
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:43.100]   if you get hurt a lot, but the watch is tracking functions
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.140]   while they don't have a roller derby insert per se,
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:52.140]   they offer, they track a lot more varied health statistics
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:57.020]   than your average Fitbit, for instance.
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.340]   And the combination of it also integrating with my iPhone
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.220]   means that for the first time, I will not be,
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.140]   I will not have to carry a phone on my roller skates
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.020]   while I am coaching, I can just put the watch on,
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.700]   and then I can use the watch to read off my drills
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.700]   and make sure, okay, we're on task, the time is, you know,
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.580]   we've gone through 40 minutes of our practice
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.580]   and we're still on the second drill, got to speed things up.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.300]   Previous to this, I would carry around my phone
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.380]   and pray that I didn't drop it anywhere,
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.740]   like on the concrete floor that we skate on,
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.380]   or as happened to my brand new iPhone 6,
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.620]   the first four days I got it, I rolled over it
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.500]   because I set it down to do something,
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.940]   it didn't hurt it because pressure on these screens
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.660]   is actually surprisingly good, but still,
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.100]   it's like I would like to avoid destroying my phones
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.020]   while playing the sport that I like.
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.380]   So I'm really kind of hoping that the watch
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.540]   is gonna be the thing for me.
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:58.020]   Now, it remains to be seen how durable it is
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.700]   when met with roller derby.
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.300]   I have high hopes for the ION X-Class.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.460]   I thought about going up to the steel just for the sapphire,
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.380]   but at the same time, I'm like,
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.140]   what if it does get scratched?
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.220]   And then I've just spent almost $1,000 on a device
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.700]   that I'm, you know, smashing around.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.460]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.540]   - Also, is there some sort of rule that says
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.500]   there's a weight limit to how heavy and how hard
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.420]   a watch that you're swinging around in the end of your arm
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.300]   could be when you're playing roller derby?
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.060]   - Yeah, there is, there is not.
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.580]   Well, it would be under my wrist guard,
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.180]   so I'm not really worried about it hitting concrete
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.500]   or hitting other people because it's gonna be under my gear,
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.380]   but it is a general concern just in terms of like,
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.380]   yeah, I don't know.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.220]   I wore a Fitbit for a while just out of curiosity
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.020]   to see if it could track things.
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.780]   And I've killed every Fitbit that I've ever owned from sweat.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:50.860]   It's very sad.
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.140]   - Andy, if I can ask,
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.740]   my mom's never gotten a first gen iPhone or iPad,
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.660]   but she saw the most recent commercial
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.700]   and she wanted to order one.
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.900]   So I took her for a try on yesterday
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.700]   and she went there and she went across the table
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.380]   and she went and tried the machines while she was waiting.
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.420]   Then they showed her the watch and she was super happy.
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.980]   She said, one of the things that startled her is that she's,
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.340]   she's senior enough that she has a little bit of arthritis
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.620]   and she has a lot of trouble with her jewelry
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.620]   and she had no problem at all,
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.900]   especially with the loops, both a lot of the bands
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.660]   and her current watch gives her a lot of trouble
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.500]   to take on and off and she really liked it
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.500]   sort of from an accessibility point of view.
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.660]   And then she thought it'd be great
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.460]   because she leaves her phone in her purse
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.300]   and she misses calls and she misses texts.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.020]   And she's hoping that at least with the watch on,
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.580]   she'll see when, well, she'll still skip my calls and texts,
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.060]   but at least people she wants to talk to will get through.
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.780]   - Yeah, I've been following on Twitter.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.980]   A lot of people have been very, very excitedly
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.980]   reporting on their experiences with their concierge appointments,
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.860]   so trying on the watch.
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.820]   And it's causing a lot of delight and a lot of excitement
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.660]   as long as you don't take a camera
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.260]   because there have been a couple of people also tweeting
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.900]   that they tried to video it and they said,
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.100]   "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, please,
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.380]   I don't know why they had a Russian accent
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.700]   when they said this to these people."
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.620]   - No, meerkit, no, meerkit.
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.140]   - Exactly.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.180]   So it seems to be a good, good will gesture at least.
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.940]   I don't know if it's translating into sales yet
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.020]   'cause we're gonna have to,
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.500]   I was a little bit surprised that Apple didn't
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.180]   have a big announcement as they did
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.060]   for other successful pre-order launches.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.580]   Like, hey, we sold, you believe we sold
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:17.980]   six million of these in the very first week
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.100]   and we sold more in the first day
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.860]   than we sold of iPads in the very first year.
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.460]   So I don't think that means anything
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.180]   but I think it's an interesting thing to note.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:33.580]   Also, none of us seem to have been so gifted
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.900]   with pre-advanced hardware.
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.260]   So we don't have day-to-day experience.
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.700]   Let's note that there have been,
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.100]   early reviews started to hit middle of last week
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.020]   about half a dozen people, seemed to get them.
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.340]   Let's just acknowledge that they,
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.980]   people, it seems like every reviewer had something positive
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.860]   and something not so positive to say about it,
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.940]   bit of a mixed bag.
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.260]   I can't talk about that because I have not been reading
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.020]   any of those 'cause I expect to get one
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.740]   in the next week or two for review
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.580]   and I want my head to be clear for that.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.660]   But, Alice, what do you think about how these reviews
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.340]   are gonna affect people's interest in the watch
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.820]   'cause it's still a brand new sort of thing.
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.660]   People still need to be convinced that
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.180]   they should start wearing a watch again
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:18.660]   much less start spending three or $400 on a gadget watch.
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.940]   Are people really gonna be scared off
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.100]   by any sort of negative review?
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.460]   Anything that's not the usual?
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.980]   Oh my God, apples, apples once again
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.860]   brought the Lord down to our front
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.020]   and put him in a watch, you know,
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.980]   that sort of positive review?
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.300]   You know, I think that the first round of these watches
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.500]   are gonna be picked up by people who are early adopters.
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.860]   There's probably three to five million people
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.220]   that are gonna buy these just because they wanna be
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.780]   the first people that have them.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.540]   And so I think that that's not gonna be affected
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.500]   by the reviewers, most of those people
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.540]   have already decided they're gonna buy a watch.
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.380]   I think that the next step is when you start seeing
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.100]   applications, I think the big cheerleaders for the watch
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.820]   are gonna be the app developers who are developing
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.740]   really cool tools that allow you
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:01.580]   to use your watch.
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.100]   I was looking for it here, but I can't buy it.
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:08.300]   There was someone at NEB that had a,
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.380]   that have calm systems that you'd use,
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.540]   you know, to talk to the rest of your team.
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.220]   And they had set it up so that you can tap the watch
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.820]   when you wanna talk, like push to talk with your watch.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:22.700]   And for me, that was a very, very great, you know,
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.460]   connection, you know, to that process.
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.900]   And I think that as we see people doing really innovative
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.620]   things, apps, you know, I think that's what's gonna
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.980]   draw people, they're gonna see something,
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.660]   they're gonna see a handful of things,
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.980]   they get them really excited about what they could do
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.060]   with the watch.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.740]   I think that's what's really gonna push it.
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.180]   There's a lot of integration that may or may not happen,
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.300]   but I think that the timing is actually of the whole process.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.740]   I think has been masterfully kind of laid out
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.140]   because you have this early launch, the pre-order,
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.540]   they're gonna be able to realize those sales,
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.060]   or realize a lot of them, you know,
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.140]   before the end of the quarter, they'll have a,
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.860]   you know, they'll talk about that in May,
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.780]   and then you have WWDC where they're really gonna
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.780]   talk about, okay, this is how many have sold,
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.700]   and this is the real opportunity for developers,
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.460]   and then you really have, you're really going
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.820]   into the summer with a lot of developers
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.180]   who if they aren't thinking about it,
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.020]   will be thinking about it.
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.420]   And I think that that's gonna push a lot of watches,
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.500]   is the real use of them.
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.540]   More than, you know, the first three to five million,
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.700]   we'll just be people excited, but the next five,
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.380]   the 10 million or 20 million will be people
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.220]   seeing something in their life that is actually gonna
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.180]   be affected by the watch.
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.380]   - Yeah, and I think it's gonna be a big deal
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.420]   when people start having friends who have them,
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.420]   and they can actually ask them,
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.380]   what's the experience like?
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.580]   Because I think there's sort of three tiers to reactions
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.100]   to the watch or even reviews.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.460]   I think the first tier is you've had it for a couple of days,
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.020]   and you actually can use it in your own life,
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.620]   but then the next important tier is going to be,
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.260]   you've been using it for an entire month,
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.940]   and now you're totally used to it.
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.220]   And then the third tier will be once, as you say,
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.100]   a lot of these third party apps that totally take advantage
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.380]   of Apple Watch come out there, and it stops being,
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.380]   "Hey, look, it takes time.
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.900]   Hey, look, it's a fitness tracker.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.820]   Hey, look, it gets, I can take phone calls,
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.020]   and I can do Siri from it."
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.660]   But when your favorite app on your phone is now also available
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.020]   as a watch app, I think that's when people start
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.180]   to really fall in love with it.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.700]   Renee, you're about to say?
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.940]   - Well, and I think that I think--
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.220]   - Oh, I'm sure. - Oh, yeah.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.660]   I think you're gonna see stuff like, for instance,
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.940]   being able to fire off your camera,
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.460]   I mean, obviously you'll be able to do it with your iPhone,
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.020]   but you'll see controllers where I can sit there
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.380]   and stand in front and tap my watch,
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.220]   and it'll take a picture, or start video,
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.380]   or start slow-sto video in my field.
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.300]   But I think that those kind of things are gonna,
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.980]   it's not gonna take very many of those
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.260]   before people decide, oh, I gotta have one of those.
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.100]   - Mm.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.660]   - Yeah, I'm sorry, Renee, were you about to say?
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.460]   - No, I was just gonna agree with Alex.
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.340]   I mean, I think it'll, I think one of the things
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.340]   that are interesting about the watch,
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.620]   we remember the, it's an internet communicator,
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.260]   it's a phone, it's an iPod,
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.540]   and we remember the iPad was for reading and for watching,
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.780]   and they gave all these use cases
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.340]   where the Apple watch, it felt a little bit more unsettled,
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.260]   like no one really knew what exactly it was gonna be,
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.420]   and they tried to whittle that down at the last event,
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.600]   but I still think a lot of people
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.060]   will have completely different use cases,
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.500]   like, so Renee's gonna love it for rollerblading,
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.500]   and especially roller derby,
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.420]   and my mom's gonna love it for notifications,
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.580]   and I might like it for something completely different,
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.740]   like home automation, and I think it has sort of
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.780]   these unique aspects, and everyone,
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.060]   if they find something like about it,
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.260]   we'll find one or two of those
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.900]   that really make a difference to them,
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.580]   and that's where they're gonna go with.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.700]   - Yeah, one password announced on their blog,
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.980]   I think it was today,
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.340]   that they're gonna be supporting the watch,
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.500]   so that once you're done with your workout,
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.540]   you go back to your locker at the health club,
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.940]   you can actually pull up your combination
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.220]   for the locker there.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.580]   WebMD has also showed off what they're gonna be doing
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.260]   with the app, and it's gonna be things like,
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.940]   not just reminding you to take your pills,
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.860]   but here is what your pills look like,
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.740]   and here's how many you need to take,
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.740]   and also some sort of service where you can,
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.460]   it ties into a phone where you can then,
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.260]   if you need a consultation with an actual doctor for $2.99,
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.780]   you can actually talk to a real doctor,
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.780]   a regular provider for this sort of stuff,
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.860]   and yeah, all that stuff is actually right,
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:57.340]   I mean, the delightful thing is not when you start to buy apps
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.900]   and install them, but when your normal apps start to update
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.700]   and your watch starts to do things,
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.860]   it did not do two days ago, like Alex said,
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.180]   the first time I try to take a picture,
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.700]   I noticed that on the bottom of my Android Wear watch
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:11.540]   is a little control, and say,
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.460]   "Oh, if you want to trigger the shutter from here,
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.500]   "by all means do that."
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.660]   Like, "Oh, isn't that nice?"
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.300]   You figure that out on your own.
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.260]   Aren't you getting smarter and smarter, little watch?
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.620]   Why are you, sorry, go ahead.
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.820]   - Well, I'm gonna say, and I think that also,
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.900]   one of the things that a lot of people keep on asking me here
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.940]   is do I think that the watch is going to kill
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.340]   all the other watches, and I think this is actually
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.140]   gonna be a huge boom for Motorola,
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.060]   I think it's gonna be a big push for Pebble,
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.780]   because there's gonna be a lot of people
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:35.940]   that really look at the Apple watch
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.340]   and get excited about a smart watch
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.700]   and get not excited about the price.
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.180]   You know, and I so, I think that there's a huge market
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.020]   that's still, that's gonna be wide open
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.140]   in the sub 250 sub 200 range.
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.660]   - Yeah, Wired has, excuse, who is it?
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.500]   No, I'm sorry, the Verge had an article quoting sources
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.860]   that they couldn't name that Google is very, very close
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:58.380]   to finishing an Android Wear component app for iOS,
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.940]   so that the iPhone will have most of the,
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.060]   as much of the functionality as possible
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.060]   for Android Wear watches like the Moto 360
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.420]   as they have on Android, which would be terrific
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:12.220]   because I do see both Apple watch and Android Wear
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.220]   as having two really different philosophies,
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.100]   and both of them are totally, totally valid.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.620]   That's reason enough to support both watches.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.540]   The other reason being that a lot of people
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.420]   can't even afford the $350 one,
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.780]   and we have really good, I think the best watch available
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.740]   for Android Wear is the Moto 360, it costs 200 bucks.
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:33.180]   And also, every single Apple watch is the exact same style,
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.020]   and at least with Android Wear,
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.940]   if you want a round face, you can get a round face.
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.620]   If you want a square face that has a different sort
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.860]   of bezel to it, there are at least a half a dozen,
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.860]   now I think there are eight or nine different manufacturers,
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.180]   and so I really do think this will shake things up
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.700]   and make things pretty good.
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.300]   That wasn't the only hardware stuff from last week,
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.940]   also Apple started shipping the brand new MacBook,
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.100]   thoughtfully named MacBook,
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.620]   so as to not cause any confusion between this device
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.900]   and anything else that Apple is shipping
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.820]   that runs Mac OS.
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:10.620]   Renee, your review just landed this morning, didn't it?
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.700]   - Yes, absolutely, and I really like,
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.740]   so there's a huge caveat for me, I really like it.
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.700]   It's got a lot of things that I think are incredibly practical.
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.820]   To me, it's almost like an iPad in Mac's clothing,
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.540]   where it's very light, it's retinets, got one port,
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.580]   it's made to be really accessible and appealing
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.660]   to people for whom computers might have always been intimidating,
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.140]   or who gravitated towards an iPad
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.220]   and then decided they need more of a computer,
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.580]   and I get people who complain about the keyboard
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.980]   or about the trackpad or about the lack of ports,
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.700]   but to me, the only caveat right now is price,
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.980]   because it starts at $1,200, the original era started at $1,799,
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.420]   so it's not exactly. - Oh, that's not exactly.
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.780]   - Yeah, $1,299, sorry, yeah, and the original era started at $1,799,
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:52.660]   so it's not unusual for new computers to be pricey,
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.420]   but I think as years go on and this gets cheaper,
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.740]   I mean, the 11-inch era is now $8.99.
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.500]   This will be a new generation of accessible computers,
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.740]   it will very much be sort of an iPad for Mac's,
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.580]   and I think that's a terribly exciting idea.
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.540]   - Yeah, I agree, I was away last week,
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.940]   so I only got it this week, and boy,
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.340]   I'm surprised at how much I'm liking this,
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.260]   because people are sick to death of me
[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.500]   talking about the limitations of the MacBook Pros,
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.340]   and but I think they made a lot of really smart choices here.
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.780]   The trackpad we've already talked about
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.180]   how just magical the trackpad experiences,
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.100]   it's not a clicky button, but it feels like a clicky button.
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.180]   My next bit of skepticism was going to be
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.300]   about the super, super, super, super flat keyboard
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.060]   with a new key switch technology,
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.420]   and it is super, super, super, super, duper flat,
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.540]   it's like the flattest feeling keyboard I've ever used,
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.940]   maybe next to the Surface Pro, Microsoft Surface Pro 3,
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.900]   like the cardboard keyboard that's the keyboard cover,
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.180]   and yet the fact that they made the keys bigger,
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.940]   it's, I'm still, I barely,
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:56.780]   I've only written maybe about 800 to 1000 words on it yet,
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.820]   but I can see myself getting used to it without,
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.900]   it's not like it's slowing me down any,
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.900]   and you're right, there's something so compelling
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.020]   about this just tiny, tiny little object.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.900]   Last week for the conference,
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.140]   I was going for an entire week, and I packed grumpy.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.020]   Meaning you've had one of those days
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.700]   where you're packing and you're like,
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.100]   you kind of wish you were staying home
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.940]   and there's so much work to do with staying in the office,
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:21.700]   and they're like, I'm not going to take the laptop,
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.460]   I don't know what to take it out for TSA,
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.380]   I don't want to have to carry my laptop bag,
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.340]   I'm just going to take my iPad with me,
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.900]   and so for good and for bad, it took my iPad with me,
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.620]   but if I had this MacBook with me in the office,
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.740]   oh boy, that would not have been an issue whatsoever.
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.380]   It's also--
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.780]   - One of the things that was,
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.260]   oh, there's one of the things that was startling to me
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.780]   is I went back to using my 13 inch MacBook Pro today
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.060]   because I have a VPN on that
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.420]   that I needed to do a few things with,
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.780]   and I hadn't set that up yet,
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.860]   and immediately the keys felt loosey-goosey.
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.820]   It took me about three hours to get used to the keys,
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.460]   but now these keys feel loosey-goosey,
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.340]   and I tried to force press to bring up details and messages
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.380]   and to bring up a file at some point,
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.940]   and it didn't work, and it just,
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.820]   it occurred to me again how quickly our brains
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.060]   can make the new things seem normal
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.500]   and the old things seem utterly strange.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.820]   - Yeah, the new keyboard is absolutely crazy
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.020]   in terms of the fact that, like,
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.420]   I know Jason and Snell and I were talking about this a lot,
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.740]   in terms of when you first type on it,
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.100]   especially if you're used to deeper, thicker keyboards,
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.660]   it definitely feels weird, it definitely feels like,
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.660]   a little bit like you're typing on glass,
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.700]   which is to say that you don't have,
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.580]   you know, you don't have the same kind of deep indentation
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.300]   pressure that you're used to from a keyboard,
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.020]   but that said, I actually found that once I kind of got used
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.980]   to typing on it, I actually feel like I type a lot cleaner,
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.780]   whereas when I'm typing on my MacBook Air,
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.420]   I feel like I occasionally I'll hit keys the wrong way
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.620]   or my fingers will slip,
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.180]   but the, I don't know if it's the new key mechanism
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.820]   or if it's just the fact that it's slightly thinner,
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.300]   but I find that my fingers are almost gliding
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.860]   across the keys when I'm typing,
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.780]   and it's allowing me to type much, much quicker
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.860]   than I normally do, which is kind of,
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.580]   I mean, it's definitely is gonna take some adjustment,
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.060]   but I tested this again when I went in for my try-on
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.940]   appointment by watch try-on appointment yesterday,
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.020]   and I like, I find myself liking that keyboard more and more
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.820]   despite the fact that I've always been a fan
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.700]   of kind of the deeper squishier keyboards.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:23.940]   - Yeah, I'm totally with you,
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.900]   and I wonder how much of it is just the size
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.860]   that the fact that they made the keys larger
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.900]   and they made the gaps between them smaller.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.540]   So you can miss hit them.
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.140]   It's not just, it's a bigger target area,
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.860]   but that it's a flatter surface area.
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.540]   So that if you miss hit it by a little bit,
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.580]   it still feels like you hit it dead center,
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.900]   and it really gives you a sense of confidence.
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.900]   I had this thought that absolutely didn't occur to me
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:50.900]   until I started using it, that I can't believe I'm saying this,
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.420]   but if Apple decided to get rid of mechanical keyboards
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.260]   completely and just go with haptics
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.340]   to give that sort of little sensation,
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.860]   I could sort of see that working,
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.260]   because when I move from tapping the trackpad,
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.020]   which does not have a key switch to an actual key
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.380]   that actually does have a key switch,
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.180]   it's hard for my brain to process
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.020]   that there's a difference between the feel.
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.620]   So I'm not saying I'm asking for a keyboard like that,
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.460]   but now my mind is open to it in a way that wasn't before.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:22.420]   - Andy, I'm sorry, I completely agree with you on that point.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.900]   That's actually the first thing I thought of
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.460]   when I was handling it during the hands-on area,
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.700]   during the March event,
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.340]   where it just, it definitely feels like they're getting
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.140]   closer and closer to the idea of experimenting
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.180]   with no keyboard at all,
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.100]   but taking Force Touch technology
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.060]   and maybe transplanting it over.
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.180]   Based on, again, the Houdou magic
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.340]   that the Force Touch trackpad employs,
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.260]   I can envision, I don't know if this,
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.740]   I don't know if the future is coming in two years
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.060]   or coming in 10 years,
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.900]   but I can definitely envision a point
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:55.620]   where the haptics technology allows you
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.980]   as you brush your fingers across an otherwise smooth surface.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.580]   If there's supposed to be a keyboard there,
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:04.460]   you get little tactical, not even buzzes so much,
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.580]   but it feels like you have individual keys,
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.580]   and then as you press down,
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.420]   it feels like you're pressing key.
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:11.860]   Like, I can see that happening.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.460]   - Or a piano.
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:17.220]   - Yeah, or I mean, there are lots of avenues for that to work
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.700]   if you open it up to third party apps.
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.980]   - Now, do you think it would work better
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.660]   if it's now just a glass screen
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.420]   that basically virtualizes whatever control you want,
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.620]   or do you think you'd rather still have
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.100]   the notebook form factor,
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.100]   only you have this sort of space gray rectangle
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.380]   that is pre-printed with key caps and back lighting,
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.540]   but can also be a game controller if you want?
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.940]   - Yeah, I don't think the pre-printing is necessarily
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:46.460]   a good idea 'cause it does limit it to a certain extent,
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.940]   but at the same time, I'm not sure that I want,
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.620]   like, obviously haptics are coming to the iPad.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.460]   It's gonna happen.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.700]   I don't know if it's gonna happen this year,
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.180]   but it's gonna happen.
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.500]   But do we want an iPad that still,
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.460]   the keyboard takes up half of the screen,
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.860]   and then you're limited to that little narrow window
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.940]   on a potential future laptop?
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:06.940]   I don't know about that.
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:11.380]   I'm not quite sure if getting rid of the form factor
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:16.380]   is the answer, especially also you think about artists
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:20.020]   and you think about things like the Wacom tablets
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.100]   and the Cintiq.
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.940]   Part of the appeal for artists
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.820]   and for musicians and things like that
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:29.580]   is to work tactically directly with your environment
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.420]   and with whatever you have on the screen,
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:34.740]   but I feel like that differs from profession to profession.
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.220]   Artists wanna draw directly on their screens
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:40.100]   and they don't necessarily want a substitute
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.940]   if they can avoid it,
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.940]   whereas someone like a musician might want
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.980]   that full-size screen for their music
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.300]   and then want the second screen
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:53.020]   or the haptic surface to play their instrument.
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.780]   I just, I don't know.
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.620]   We're talking such future tech right now
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.820]   that it's really exciting to me,
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.700]   but I just, I can't predict where Apple will go.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.140]   I'm sure they're testing both though.
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.380]   - It'll be a great center console for the Apple car
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.340]   in 2018, that's for sure.
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.740]   Let's make sure we note that there are some big pain
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:14.780]   in the butt things about it,
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.900]   including that one, and only one port.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.420]   I'm going to be, as Ren mentioned,
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.940]   we're both gonna be speaking at the Coco Conference
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.540]   in Yosemite next week.
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.980]   And now I'm really am excited about using this
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.060]   as my only computer and I was trying to work out the problem
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.620]   of, oh man, how am I gonna drive a presentation from this
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:36.100]   and can I spend $70 on an Apple adapter
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.700]   just hook it up to the projector?
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:41.100]   And it's, my mind has been so ingrained into the idea
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.100]   that video is something you plug a cable into.
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:43.940]   I forgot that.
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.740]   Well, you could just take an Apple TV and use AirPlay
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.940]   and have that as a wireless thing.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.940]   So it really is a machine that tries to browbeat you
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.740]   in a positive way into adapting the way that you work
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:57.340]   to work around the limitations of what you have.
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:00.580]   But is, Renee, are you worried about the CPU?
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:04.900]   What was your experience using this really not terribly
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.060]   impressive, let's say CPU, fanless?
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:10.300]   - Yeah, it's Core M, which was code named Broadwell Y
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.260]   previously, and it's a super low power chip.
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.900]   And I don't think Apple has used them before
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.940]   though other vendors have, but it's roughly analogous
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.740]   to maybe a 2011 MacBook Air, but a lot of people still
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.460]   use those and those are still practical machines.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.220]   It's just, I recently switched from a MacBook Air
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.420]   to a MacBook Pro because I was on the road so much
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.900]   and I do use Final Cut.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.260]   I don't know some people, you know,
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.060]   they want to use Handbrake
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.780]   or they want to use Xcode and they want to do things
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:32.860]   that are high performance.
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.700]   And this is not the laptop for that.
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.340]   It's why Apple makes the MacBook Pro.
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.700]   And, you know, there's data out there about how many people
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.140]   actually plug into external displays and a lot of peripherals
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.980]   and it's not many, but for those people,
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.580]   it's why Apple left the MacBook Air on the market.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.740]   So I think this, you really have to know your use cases.
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.180]   And for a lot of people, I was joking about this before,
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:55.140]   but during the event I got a text and people were like,
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.780]   "Only one port, I don't have to worry about
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.220]   what to plug in, where anymore."
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.180]   That's a huge stress reliever for me.
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.180]   And as someone who's plugged USB into MagSafe before
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.660]   and had the computer shut down,
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.460]   I kind of appreciate where they're coming from.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.780]   This really is almost like iPad level simple to use.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:15.580]   - Yeah, Alex, the question I want to ask you about this
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:18.060]   sort of stuff though is, though I like the fact
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:21.740]   that Apple has decided to not replace anything with this.
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.180]   It's clear that at some point the MacBook Airline
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.340]   is going to age out of the system.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.780]   And then when people are ready for a one port
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.340]   or two port computer, this is going to replace it
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.900]   in sometimes the next two or three years,
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.140]   but there's going to be sort of a handoff period
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.060]   between the two.
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.980]   But as somebody who travels with computers
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.900]   and you have to do pretty intense stuff,
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.620]   is there like sort of a benchmark for you
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.980]   as to how you trade off something that's super light
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.340]   and portable and it's easy to get from job to job
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.260]   versus something that you're not willing to compromise
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:51.900]   tech specs for?
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.020]   - Yeah, I mean, I have to admit that I carry both.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.380]   So I have, I think of my little 11 inch air
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:01.460]   as kind of a little shuttle that comes out
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.740]   of the enterprise.
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:06.860]   So when I'm, I have a retina, at least one of them,
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.820]   usually in my backpack that I'm really doing work on
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.020]   for the most part, whether jumping into visual effects
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.540]   or Final Cut or whatever.
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:18.100]   And then the little one is just where I put in a small bag
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.740]   that I can walk around and still know
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.460]   that I can get connected.
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:25.500]   I think that the problem for me is that unlike you,
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.140]   I very much addicted to my mag safe because I have kids
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.860]   and I may have frozen here.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.420]   So we'll see if you can.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:36.260]   - Sounds like a good time.
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:39.220]   Yeah, sounds like a good time as any to go to a commercial.
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.860]   We were going to reach out in the dim pass
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.540]   the grim specter of Leo Laport from an age old time
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.380]   with this message from Audible.
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.220]   - Thanks, Andy.
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.860]   We're going to interrupt just for a little bit
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.460]   so I could tell you about audible.com
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.060]   that backed more of Mac break weekly.
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.780]   I don't, I mean Andy's a huge Audible fan.
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:58.620]   We all are.
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.020]   We love listening to audio books on Audible.
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:06.540]   I think I get the, I win in terms of the longest Audible
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:07.380]   subscriber.
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.260]   I started subscribing, I think February 2000.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:11.100]   You know what?
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.660]   One of the nice things about Audible
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:16.500]   is all of your books are always visible online
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.420]   and downloadable.
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.980]   So it's kind of like your library.
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:21.860]   Right now I'm listening to "Becoming Steve Jobs",
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.940]   the evolution of reckless upstart into a visionary leader.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:25.780]   It's actually great.
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.820]   We've been talking about that.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.580]   Some of these are Andy's recommendations,
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:33.020]   Pat Naswald's silver screen fiends to waitin'
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.180]   to get to that one.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.420]   As you wish, the behind the scenes story
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.620]   of "The Princess Bride", Audible has so many great books,
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:44.620]   both fiction and nonfiction, lots of great science fiction.
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.300]   I'm reading the new, just starting other language,
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.860]   John Slinning has recommended.
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.300]   So this is my first Audible book.
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:55.300]   Yeah, February 7th, 2000, 0-0.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:59.260]   So I've been an Audible member now for more than 15 years.
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.300]   It is a lifesaver.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.140]   Can you believe that?
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:02.500]   It is a lifesaver.
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.740]   I started listening to Audible when I was commuting
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.100]   to the screen savers.
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:11.100]   I had a two hour commute, sometimes two hours each way,
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.220]   depending on traffic, an Audible may get me from going crazy.
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.940]   In the car, at the gym, walkin' the dog,
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.420]   washing the dishes.
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.140]   Lisa and I both listen to Audible all the time.
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.980]   And you know, there's so much choice.
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.260]   So here's what I'm gonna do for you.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.580]   I'm gonna get you your first title, absolutely free.
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.580]   Go to Audible.com/MacBreak.
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:35.020]   You're gonna sign up for the gold account.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.340]   That's a book of months.
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.100]   What I do is I alternate fiction and nonfiction.
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.260]   So right now, listen to the Steve Jobs book.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.260]   I'm gonna go into the other land series as my next book.
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.580]   One of my favorite books of all time, "Cryptanomicon".
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.500]   I have it, I'm just saving it.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.500]   'Cause it's really long, I'm saving it for a moment
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:53.660]   when I just, I need a break, I need to be uplifted.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.620]   There's some, oh, Laszlo Box work rules
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.580]   are supposed to be amazing.
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:00.180]   The HR guy at Google.
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.420]   It's supposed to be incredible.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.940]   The art of war by, so here's the deal.
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:08.900]   Go to Audible.com/MacBreak, sign up for the gold account.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.300]   That's, oh, oh, this is funny, little finger,
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.780]   narrates the art of war.
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.380]   Now that's good.
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.660]   Let's hear it.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.660]   Set.
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:21.580]   The control of a large force is the same principle
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.540]   as the control of a few men.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.220]   It is merely a question of dividing--
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:26.740]   It is little finger.
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.620]   Who better to narrate,
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.820]   allows us the art of war.
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:31.660]   No one.
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.740]   Audible's so creative, I have to say.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.780]   Go there, pick a book.
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.980]   There's so much great stuff.

[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.900]   the gold account that's a book of months,
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.300]   first month free.

[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.260]   of the Wall Street Journal
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.220]   as part of your subscription of all subscriptions.

[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:52.500]   It's yours forever.
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.700]   But I don't think you're gonna wanna cancel.
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.780]   It is so amazing.
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:02.780]   Martin Short, I must say my life is a humble comedy legend.
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:05.820]   - The man is an idiot.
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.620]   Nevertheless, after questioning both candidates,
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:09.460]   the interviewer--
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:13.780]   - I have to say, I love listening to these bio,
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.300]   autobiographies by comics when they read 'em themselves.
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.820]   It's just hysterical.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.380]   Look, I shouldn't have to say it anymore.
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.700]   Just go right now.
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:24.140]   If you're not yet a member, audible.com/macbreak,
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.940]   pick a great audio book, get it for free,
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.140]   and the whole world of listening
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.260]   is gonna open up for you.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:33.740]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.260]   Back to Mac Break Weekly and Dan Optko.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:40.500]   - Thank you, a voice from the Post-Tollocks Leo.
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:43.060]   Actually, before we leave the new MacBook,
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.300]   two quick notes.
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.860]   One that seems to be shorted just the same way
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.180]   as the watches have.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.060]   They're supposed to be on sale starting on Friday,
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.580]   but if you go to the Apple Store,
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.060]   you're gonna have to wait about four weeks
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.620]   for your delivery to arrive.
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.340]   And also while listening to Leo tell us about Audible,
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.380]   I said, "Hey, I wonder what happens
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.820]   "when you use Force Press on the outliner
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.140]   "and it crashed on the outliner."
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.340]   So, clearly, clearly there's gonna be have to be
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.860]   some people updating how their apps adapt
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.940]   to Force Touch track beds.
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.900]   - I still want y'all to go to make a Mars edit button
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.260]   where if you Force Press it, it turns everything upper caps
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.100]   to all caps and you blog angry.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.220]   I think that would be spectacular.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.500]   - Or at least it should actually talk to your Apple watch
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.020]   and get a pulse rate to say. (laughs)
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:25.980]   And if it's you, for pulses above that,
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:26.820]   you know what?
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.740]   We're just not gonna let you post this.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.260]   We're gonna catch that release say,
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.720]   and it'll post in 24 hours.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.600]   You have time to pull this back just in case your lawyers say,
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.240]   oh, no, no, no.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.380]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.780]   No.
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:44.180]   We also had a new iOS drop last week,
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:48.260]   iOS 8.3 long feature list as usual,
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.660]   the kinds that some leap out and some are,
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.740]   oh, so you've actually changed the stack nature
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:55.300]   so that a stack overrun that is only possible
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.380]   when you're using a certain kind of keyboard
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:01.500]   does not happen when you're connected to a non-pleased network.
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:05.820]   But the coolest, the coolest feature that I've been playing with
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.140]   is that the amount of diversity that Apple added
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:10.020]   to Emojis of all thing, things.
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.220]   So now that any emoji that is a human emoji,
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.500]   you can adjust the skin tone.
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.500]   There's also Emojis that show families.
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:21.780]   Now there is same-sex couples represented as families.
[00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.940]   It's little stuff like this that actually is,
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:28.420]   it's when you improve these finer, finer points
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.180]   of the experience of using something,
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:33.740]   that's when you really get a big smile on your face.
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.420]   But what else is in there?
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:39.220]   I mean, I did read that there is some,
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.380]   it was breaking touch ID if we're some people
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.180]   that are not having a problem with it.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.100]   Renee, have you heard of anything?
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:47.420]   Any reason not to update to 8.3?
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.180]   No, yes, some people did have a touch ID problem,
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.380]   but if you disabled it, rebooted and re-enabled it,
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.220]   it would come back.
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.820]   It was mainly for App Store app purchases.
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:56.260]   Some people got confused too,
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.740]   and they thought that touch ID wasn't working
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:58.940]   in third-party apps.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:01.860]   But when you reboot your phone like you do
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:03.820]   when there is a new iOS update,
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.940]   you then have to launch the app that holds extension,
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.500]   type in your password and authorize that.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.620]   Mostly it's with one password.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.140]   You've got to put in your master password,
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.180]   then it re-enables touch ID for all your apps.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.900]   And I think some people, we reboot so rarely now
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.460]   that people forget about that when updates occur.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.180]   But also, it's a ton of security stuff,
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.660]   which was really, I was really happy to see.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:27.300]   Yeah, and I was looking at the list yesterday
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.540]   over the weekend and they were,
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:32.820]   the usual esoteric stuff that doesn't look like
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.220]   they're gonna affect much of anybody,
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.700]   but if you're one of the lucky one in 100,000,
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.100]   that's probably a good thing to close up.
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.860]   One of them was a lingering bug
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:44.780]   that someone was trying to force you through a proxy.
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.220]   They could do some nasty things and lock you out.
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:48.620]   And IP box was another one.
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:50.460]   They fixed it previously in 8.1.3,
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:54.340]   but they double-dog dared you to try and break it now.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.540]   Yeah, and it seemed they all seem to be the sort of stuff
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:01.540]   where like most angry, fear-mongering, oh my God,
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.860]   the iOS is now insecure.
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.660]   It's like a really long step of sequence of events
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:08.300]   that has to happen in the proper order
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.260]   in order to render your device vulnerable,
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.420]   but that doesn't mean that you would like
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.460]   to have your device vulnerable.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:17.940]   Much more interesting is that Apple dropped a new beta
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:22.940]   of iOS 8.4 showing us a new tech towards the music app,
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.980]   which boy am I happy to hear that?
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.820]   Because just last week, I was reminding myself
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:31.500]   of why I don't use the music app on my iPad very much,
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.620]   because it's just so hard to use.
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.380]   Has anybody downloaded the video yet?
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.460]   I have not.
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:38.460]   Okay.
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.020]   I was busy not booking.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:43.380]   I am technically not officially allowed to see
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.940]   whether I have or not.
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:45.740]   Okay.
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.660]   So we can say that there have been published reports
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:53.660]   to allude to the idea that creating custom playlists
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.380]   is a lot faster.
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:58.860]   If there's a rumor that it will also be possible
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.140]   to when you create custom playlists
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.380]   to add your own artwork to represent it,
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:06.260]   there is also a very, very well sourced rumor
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:10.460]   about new hooks for iTunes radio
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.740]   to make that more prominent.
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.860]   Since there's stuff that we can't talk about,
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:16.180]   I suppose on this show,
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:19.260]   let's talk about what we're hoping is gonna happen to music.
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.820]   I'll tell you that I'm very, very surprised
[00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:26.460]   that most of my music is available through iTunes match.
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:29.060]   I can use the native apps if I want to,
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:32.060]   but I find myself using the Google Play Music app
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.420]   and I find myself using my Amazon Music Cloud Music app
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.700]   because they're just more reliable.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:38.620]   And it's,
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:39.860]   Ren, do you have the same problems?
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:41.540]   Are you happy with the current app?
[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.220]   Oh God, I'm so unhappy.
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:48.460]   I listen to a lot of music.
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.140]   I don't have a commute because I work from home,
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.820]   but I have a boyfriend who lives 45 minutes away
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:55.420]   an hour and a half in traffic.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.780]   So I spend a lot of time listening to music
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.660]   or I have been in the last couple of months
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:01.540]   doing that drive.
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.780]   And I've very quickly discovered
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:07.220]   just how much I hate working with the music app.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.260]   In terms of, it's hard,
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:11.100]   the organization is difficult,
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:15.700]   especially if my car is only partially integrated
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.500]   with Bluetooth, so it's very hard for me
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.580]   to quickly search for songs
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.900]   and the only way that I can try and get things to work
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:22.740]   is usually by like,
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:26.580]   "Hey, Siri, sorry to everybody who was listening.
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.140]   Play this song."
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:32.620]   And I don't know, I have some problems with the music app,
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:33.940]   even off of that as well.
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.540]   I was trying to make a playlist the other day
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.780]   for like a roller derby thing.
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.820]   And when I was trying to make this playlist,
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.100]   I'm like, "Okay, I have these songs."
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.980]   And I go to add songs and some songs,
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.100]   you tap on them and they just won't add.
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.140]   And it's not an iTunes match error
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.260]   because I was adding songs
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:57.340]   that I hadn't personally downloaded to my iPhone,
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:00.100]   but just some songs wouldn't add.
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:03.220]   It just, no idea why.
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:07.940]   So it's, there's little bits here and there, organization.
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:09.340]   I love beats.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:14.140]   So I'm really kind of hoping that beats is custom playlists
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:17.940]   as well as some of their technology
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:20.660]   is either integrated into iTunes radio
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:22.980]   or replaces iTunes radio.
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.980]   It would just, it would be real swell.
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.580]   - Yeah, I'm now, to save all of us,
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.900]   I've pulled up the article from 9-5 Mac.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.820]   So we're just quoting 9-5 Mac here.
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:36.380]   Quote in 9-5 Mac quotes the release note saying
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:37.540]   that it has an all new design,
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.780]   a beautiful new design that makes exploring a music collection
[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.740]   easier and more fun.
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:43.300]   Recently added, which is a feature
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.380]   that I've wanted for so long.
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.300]   Albums and playlists you've recently added
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:48.900]   are now at the top of your library.
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:52.580]   So you don't have to figure out now what album did I add?
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:55.260]   And is it alphabetized under the Beatles,
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.860]   or some sort of stupid studio thing?
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.740]   iTunes radio has been streamlined.
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:03.140]   There's a new mini player now that a new,
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.060]   a better now playing list.
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:08.140]   So that's easy to see what's playing right now,
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:09.420]   what's gonna come up next.
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:10.820]   And another thing that,
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:13.180]   have you ever had that experience where
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.340]   you can't make something work
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:16.860]   and the only thing going through your mind
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.100]   is I must be really stupid
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.100]   because it must be right in my face.
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.060]   I can't believe I'm so stupid
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:26.980]   that I can't find the search box in the music player
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:30.260]   because obviously that's like the first thing you put in there,
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:31.620]   a big button marked search
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:32.860]   because I can't believe I can't,
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:35.660]   I must be drunk or maybe the oxygen here in the airplane.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.460]   And then no, it's because it's just so darn hard to find.
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:41.980]   So supposedly there will be a new global search.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.980]   You can now search from anywhere in the music app.
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.620]   Just tap the omnipresent magnifying glass
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.340]   and search results are completely--
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:49.220]   - I don't remember, maybe you guys remember,
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.460]   but I don't remember Apple doing such a core application
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:53.900]   of a point release beta before.
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.700]   They almost always wait for the big number,
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.580]   like the eight or the seven or the eight or the nine
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:00.020]   to show off the new music app.
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:03.180]   - It's interesting to me that they put it in 8.4.
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.500]   - It's kind of interesting that they wouldn't do that
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.060]   to as part of the rollout
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:11.860]   for the new Beats Music integration.
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:15.540]   And so I wasn't expecting any news about this until June,
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:18.300]   WWDC, but maybe, I don't know,
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.940]   maybe there's other cards that left to play
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:23.580]   or maybe just the people inside Apple are sick
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:26.220]   of the music players as much as we are.
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.140]   - As we can see Craig going,
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:29.100]   we've got a brand new music app for you.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.540]   Let me show it to you.
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:32.580]   I'm gonna miss that now.
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:34.620]   - Well, I mean, okay, so here's the other thing,
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:37.420]   is that 8.4 may just be a preview
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:38.940]   of some of the things that they are working on.
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.420]   There's nothing to say that Craig still doesn't have
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:44.660]   an all new music app up his wrist,
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:49.660]   which might well be paired with a new version of iTunes.
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.500]   - Up the sleeve was totally unintentional.
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.900]   - Oh my gosh, please.
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.820]   So there was a great little app made by a developer
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.580]   who I think later went to work for Apple called Seamless,
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.380]   which was an editor's pick of mine from way back when,
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.900]   I think 2011, that does, Seamless did the exact same thing,
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:09.620]   essentially what then continuity did
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.980]   where it would hand off the song you were playing
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:16.180]   in iTunes to the song you might be playing on your phone,
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.540]   so you could just walk out of the door
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:21.140]   and theoretically continue listening to where you left off.
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.580]   - You're double with me, is Ellie the room?
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:24.380]   - Yeah, exactly, but it has been updated
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.500]   because I think the developer went to go work for Apple
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:29.140]   or another Silicon Valley technology company
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:32.780]   and I'm so bummed, 'cause I really want that feature.
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:35.980]   Apple, it should be so easy, why is it not?
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:40.580]   - Yeah, you ever get the sense that you're walking through
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:43.620]   like a house that is only one month away
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:45.220]   from getting its occupancy permit,
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.620]   because you can see the stove and the fridge
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:50.540]   are all hooked up and the water's connected to them
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:52.300]   and there are bathrooms and there's stuff like this,
[00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:54.020]   but there's no carpet laid yet
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:56.260]   and there's a lot of bare walls.
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.060]   That's sometimes the feeling I get
[00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.220]   when I walk through iOS and macOS
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:02.940]   that I see so many great components
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.940]   that are just waiting to be hooked up
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:07.900]   and then one switch flipped to make all of this work
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.780]   so amazingly well, although I'm a dope
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:11.700]   and I've been sort of saying that
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.020]   about the music app for the past two years probably,
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:18.740]   which is why all my music is now in Google Play or Amazon.
[00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:21.540]   Other updates though, I've got an update to Final Cut
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:23.700]   which dropped just yesterday.
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.500]   Alex, I think I'm gonna ask you about this
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:28.820]   'cause I'm guessing you know more about Final Cut than I do.
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:33.820]   - Yeah, so it's as I have a dot release update,
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.860]   but there's some really interesting things
[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:36.700]   that are in it now.
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:39.820]   There's some basic stuff that's kind of more technical,
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:41.940]   support some different support for red, raw,
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:45.100]   as well as being able to open more than one scope.
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:47.540]   I think that those are things that I'll get excited about,
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:49.020]   but I'm not sure if everyone listening would be
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:50.020]   that excited about.
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.980]   The big news of course is 3D text.
[00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:55.700]   So, you know, and it's really more than just 3D text,
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.300]   it's a 3D renderer that's inside of motion in Final Cut.
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:01.860]   And I think that, you know, there's a lot of performance
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.500]   and a lot of underline bits and pieces,
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.340]   but one of the things about this is that
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:11.060]   they've really kind of experimented with
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:13.300]   making it a lot easier for the average person
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.780]   to use 3D text.
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:17.620]   And I think that my guess is of course,
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:20.020]   this is kind of a dip in that pool.
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:23.420]   So what you can do now is you can have your text there
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.500]   and you can just select the little selector
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.300]   that says, I would like this to be 3D.
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:29.060]   And now it's extruded.
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:30.700]   And one of the things that they did
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.860]   that was a little different is guys like me
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:35.740]   are used to like really setting up all the materials
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:36.700]   and putting it all together.
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.620]   And Apple did what Apple does,
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:40.140]   which is they simplified everything.
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:44.020]   So they said, you know, you can do metal or plastic or stone
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:48.140]   or wood or concrete and you can even add layers.
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:50.300]   So you can add extra substances on top of those,
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:53.780]   but they really stopped talking about surface attributes,
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:56.620]   you know, specular versus diffuse versus reflectivity
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.860]   and really just went shininess and thickness.
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:00.380]   And we're going to add these things.
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:01.780]   And at first when I first turned it on,
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.980]   I was like, oh, I don't know, this is a good idea.
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:05.380]   Because you don't, you kind of feel like
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:07.460]   as someone who does 3D, you feel like you can't get a cold
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:10.260]   of everything the way you want to.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.540]   But as I've started to play with it a bit more,
[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:14.340]   I think that for the average editor
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:17.580]   and for emotion designer, this is going to be great.
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:18.540]   I think we're going to see a lot
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:19.820]   of really interesting things with it.
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.980]   So I think that that is, you know,
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:24.140]   and you can do things like, for instance,
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:26.020]   it only handles text right now,
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:29.260]   but you can, if you went into a font editor,
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.620]   take your logo and make it A.
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:33.660]   (laughs)
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.940]   And then you can extrude your logo out.
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:38.660]   So there's a little bit of a roundabout way
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:39.780]   to bring your own graphics in.
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:41.140]   It's still just a straight extrusion.
[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.020]   It's not whole 3D models.
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:46.420]   But it's obvious that there's an engine in there.
[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:47.340]   It looks great.
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:51.300]   I mean, the renders, you know, look really nice.
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.580]   There's a lot under the hood there
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:54.660]   that you can really get into.
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:57.540]   So I think that that was the big thing that they added for there.
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:58.940]   There are some other things that are interesting
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:02.940]   around compressor that kind of let you, you know,
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:04.900]   deal with a variety of issues that you would need
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:08.780]   to publish more effectively to iTunes,
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.380]   which I think, you know, could be really interesting
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:14.020]   that that's becoming more widely available.
[00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:19.020]   You know, that might be a precursor
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:22.580]   to the things in the future.
[00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:23.980]   You know, I don't know that for sure,
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:26.380]   but it definitely is interesting
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:27.500]   that they're making it much more easy.
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:28.900]   I mean, it's always been one of those things
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:30.900]   that I've always been kind of surprised by
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:33.420]   is that Apple has basically
[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:36.260]   an entire vertical market all the way from
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:40.660]   when you're creating content to when you're watching it on TV.
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:43.260]   And they've never felt like kind of like what you were talking
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.660]   about with, you know, all these things not being quite hooked up.
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.380]   You never feel like that pipeline is completely
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:51.100]   and probably on purpose, completely connected.
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:55.020]   But it feels like they might be connecting that a little bit further.
[00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:58.780]   So how important is it that they've improved support
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.820]   for compressor inside the app itself?
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:04.420]   Is that they added, taken features from the compressor app
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:05.580]   and put it inside Final Cut?
[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:07.740]   Or is it just an integration thing?
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:10.380]   You know, I believe that there have been some additions
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:12.100]   of taking some of the compressor pieces.
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:13.820]   And I haven't really tested that heavily.
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:18.100]   And I have to admit that that has more to do with me than then.
[00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:20.580]   And I wasn't on a beta or anything of Final Cut.
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:21.940]   So I just got it.
[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:26.340]   I've been in a hotel, so I got it late last night.
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.620]   Finally, after, you know, as you can see
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:31.860]   with my connection here on Skype, it was like that downloading a big file.
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:35.500]   So, but the, so I haven't tested it that heavily.
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:41.700]   I usually kind of glaze over the compressing in Final Cut conversation
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:43.220]   because I just don't do that ever.
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:46.180]   So I don't, I'm really old school about,
[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:50.140]   I want a Apple ProRes file to come out of Final Cut.
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:51.980]   And then I'll put that into compressor.
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:54.340]   So that if anything goes wrong with the compression,
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:57.740]   I have my file that I'm now just working with that.
[00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:59.940]   I'm not opening up Final Cut every time I want it,
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:01.180]   you know, to recompress something.
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:04.020]   So, so I, so I have to admit,
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:05.460]   I've never been a very good tester of that,
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:08.060]   of those tools of being able to compress straight out of Final Cut
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:11.580]   because I'm, I kind of have a religious, you know,
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:15.940]   objection to, to rendering straight H.264
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:19.660]   from any, any of my contribution software devices.
[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:20.500]   So,
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:22.180]   - Go ahead. - Go ahead.
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:23.260]   - Go ahead. - That's just gonna ask,
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.300]   why do you think the compressor is so hard to use?
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.420]   I have it, I try to figure out how to make it work
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:30.900]   because I'd much rather have better,
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:33.500]   when I do do videos, I'd much rather have higher qualities,
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:37.940]   lower file size, but it really is, it's for somebody with,
[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:39.660]   I don't know, nine years of ITT technical
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.260]   is a two plus post credit.
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:42.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:45.500]   Is it, is it, or is it just never intended for somebody
[00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:48.100]   who is not a professional in the video field
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:50.380]   and a high level professional to use?
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.260]   - You know, I, you know, I, I have to admit
[00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:57.460]   that I've been using compressor since pretty much day one,
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:58.580]   or a little before day one.
[00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:00.500]   And so, for me, it's always been the,
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.140]   there was a big jump when they went to 10
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:04.380]   where there was a, you know, big interface change,
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:06.020]   but for me, it's always been kind of incremental.
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:07.980]   So I don't think I noticed it as much.
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:11.260]   I think that, there's oftentimes I, you know,
[00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:12.580]   just with quick time, I used to just have
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:14.980]   a little quick time settings that I would still use
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:15.820]   to get something out.
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.180]   I think that the big advantage of compressor is
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.740]   that you do have a lot of control.
[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:21.740]   The problem you really get into is with, you know,
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.220]   with great power comes, you know, great responsibility.
[00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:26.540]   And so I think a lot of people have trouble.
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:28.060]   There's so many little buttons in there
[00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:29.660]   that you can grab onto.
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:33.420]   And you can really, you know, mess up your files.
[00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:38.420]   I don't really use any of the presets that are in compressor.
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:42.540]   So I have my own little presets that are like, you know,
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:45.780]   my fast, my, my, there's like upload to YouTube,
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.460]   upload fast to YouTube, which is slightly different
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:49.820]   compression setting.
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:52.780]   And so I have a couple of, you know,
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:55.380]   a lot of different things that I use for outputs.
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.660]   You know, I think that you do have to have a little bit,
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:58.700]   if you're going to open up a compressor,
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:55:59.740]   you have to have a little knowledge
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:02.620]   of how compression works and what you're doing to your file.
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:05.460]   It also, there's a lot of management issues.
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:07.660]   You know, one of the big advantages of compressor is
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:11.020]   it is blindingly fast on the newer Macs.
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.260]   I mean, I like, I can remember back in the day
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:15.780]   when we were talking about the compression time being,
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:18.580]   you know, two minutes for every one minute of content.
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:21.460]   And now it's like 10 seconds for every one minute of content.
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:23.540]   I mean, it's, you know, compressor is, you know,
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:26.900]   incredibly fast on the modern architectures.
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:28.980]   And because of that, I use it all the time,
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:30.260]   just because I don't want it, you know,
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:31.300]   I used to think quick time,
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.300]   I'll get something relatively good out of it,
[00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.660]   you know, the old quick time seven.
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:40.660]   And now I'm fairly, you know, the compressor 10.
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:43.660]   And I think that Final Cut will do this as crap.
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:50.740]   Okay, but now before we, well, since we're on Final Cut though,
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.540]   do you think that pros are,
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:55.140]   as Apple making pros happy with Final Cut now
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:56.900]   is the mutiny of a few years ago,
[00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:58.300]   kind of over with and forgotten
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:01.340]   or have the people who are gonna leave already left?
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:05.380]   - Hard for, like, I really like using Final Cut Pro 10.
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.140]   I liked seven as well.
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:10.220]   I feel like 10 made it much easier to do some things
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:12.420]   and more obtuse to do others.
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:15.120]   But I can't really, like, I can't answer the,
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:19.180]   the Exodus question because I'm no longer really actively
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:20.020]   working in film.
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:21.980]   And I can't be like, I'm not gonna speak
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:23.100]   on behalf of other people.
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:26.420]   But it certainly feels like the drama and the fervor
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:28.060]   has kind of died down a little bit.
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.380]   And, you know, people are either quietly switching
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:33.420]   to Final Cut Pro 10 or the people who are using, you know,
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:36.660]   continuing to use Avid, continuing to use Premier,
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:40.180]   other apps that better sort their needs.
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:43.700]   - And I think that, I'm sorry, I brought that again.
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:46.300]   I think that the interesting thing about it is
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:48.300]   is that I talked to a lot of folks who,
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.740]   the folks that are really, you know,
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:52.940]   that were high-end film guys that were using Final Cut
[00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:55.860]   went back to Avid or went to Premier.
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:57.340]   But there's this huge group of people
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.780]   that have entered the Final Cut.
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.740]   And I think they're kind of invisible to a lot of people
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:02.020]   because they're not the, you know,
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:04.420]   the guys working on Conan O'Brien or whatever.
[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:06.420]   But they are, you know, just average folks
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:07.780]   that just wanna get their edits done.
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:09.780]   You know, and I think that a lot of people are finding
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:11.180]   that it's just a lot faster and easier
[00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:12.340]   to put that together.
[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:16.060]   And so, and, you know, the things that are big pluses,
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:19.380]   of course, is that, you know, there's, it's $300.
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:20.940]   It's not a subscription.
[00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:23.740]   It is not, you know, we haven't paid for an upgrade
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:26.460]   since it was released.
[00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:27.620]   You know, if you're an average person
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:28.740]   kind of putting that stuff together,
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.540]   that's pretty compelling.
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:31.900]   Once you get used to using it,
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:34.540]   I have to say that it's very hard to go back
[00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:36.700]   to the older platforms.
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.780]   You know, like the older way of approaching things.
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:41.860]   You know, I was, you know, I've been editing
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:44.300]   on some kind of nonlinear editor since 1993.
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:46.900]   So it was definitely a process for me
[00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:47.980]   to kind of get into that.
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:51.500]   But it's, you know, I don't got so much faster.
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:53.540]   It's so much faster than most work done.
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:55.700]   That, you know, by the time I would normally organize
[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:59.780]   a set of files, I'll have the edit, you know, largely done.
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:01.540]   And so it's just very hard to, like,
[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:03.460]   especially for journalists or anyone trying to do anything
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:05.060]   with that, that are fast turns.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:06.660]   To me, when they say they're using something else,
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:08.540]   I kind of internally just go,
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:10.420]   well, how's that working for you?
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:14.220]   I mean, that's my nicest way of saying that's crazy, you know?
[00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:16.100]   So. - What's your blood pressure today?
[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:17.700]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:22.580]   - That's been on my mind because last week,
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:24.900]   I haven't even downloaded yet because it's part of the things
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:27.860]   I need to catch up on after a week of speaking
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.700]   for like three hours a day for five days a week.
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:34.460]   Apple released a macOS 10, 10.10.3,
[00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:36.900]   and the highlight is the new Photos app.
[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:39.020]   Renee, is that the official release?
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.660]   It's officially out of beta now?
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:43.860]   - Yep, Photos for OS 10 and iCloud Photo Library,
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:46.580]   all of them out of beta and into your life.
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:50.780]   - I should have guessed because I'm more has a wonderful
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:54.620]   multi-part series that explains all about photos.
[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:57.340]   I'm trying to figure out, so I'm hoping you're gonna help me
[00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:59.460]   out with this 'cause I'm an aperture user
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:01.540]   and I'm the sort of person who would,
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:04.980]   I will put on the artistic beard and say,
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:07.860]   you know, my needs for photo editing,
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:12.860]   far surpassed those of a consumer-oriented editing option.
[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:16.020]   I mean, there are things I understand about light
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.540]   and feels and emotion that I don't think
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:21.380]   that simply pushing slide is around in a free app
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.860]   I'm going to do.
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:26.980]   So obviously, you and Ren have been spending a lot of time
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:28.340]   with photos.
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:30.860]   Will somebody who wants to do more than tweak brightness
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.140]   and contrast have a lot of fun with photos?
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:35.780]   Or is it really gonna be, here's your excuse
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:38.300]   for moving to Lightroom now that aperture has been killed?
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:39.180]   - So I really-- - I know that Ren
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:40.260]   hander the big old picture.
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:42.220]   My quick take is 'cause I'm an aperture user too,
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:45.260]   but I would say 50% of my aperture use was right click,
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:48.980]   edit in Photoshop 'cause I'm just way more used to Photoshop.
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.940]   And this is similar to me.
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.500]   I can get away with using photos
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:54.340]   because right now there's a one click send to aperture button.
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:56.980]   So anything that even if it's just, I could do it,
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:58.660]   but I don't know how and I don't want to spend the time
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:00.300]   learning, I just send it to aperture.
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:03.020]   So right now I feel like it's a really safe place Andy,
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:04.740]   we don't have to make any hard choices yet,
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:06.140]   but there's a lot to like.
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:07.940]   And like I said, Ren's been spending a lot of time
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:10.140]   on that part of it. - Yeah, yeah, Ren, I mean,
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:12.740]   I've been starting to learn Lightroom
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:15.140]   because I know that at some point I have to know
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.340]   how to use it better.
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:19.220]   And also I didn't want to start the investment in photos.
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:23.180]   Do you think that I'd be better off trying to learn
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.180]   how to build workflows for photos
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:29.780]   or is it a limited option do you think for editing?
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:31.900]   - I really think it depends on your needs.
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.260]   After using, I've used photos from Max
[01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:37.340]   since the first developer beta came out.
[01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:42.340]   And I am of the opinion that if you are anything
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:47.900]   under a frequent prosumer, which is to say that
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:52.500]   you have a DSLR and you take a lot of really awesome photos
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.700]   on vacation or you wander around, say the Boston Common
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:58.180]   and take a lot of photos.
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:01.100]   I think actually any of those use cases on down
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:04.100]   to super beginner, you'll actually really like photos
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:07.340]   because photos has those super basic sliders, yes,
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:11.220]   but those super basic sliders can turn into much more
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:15.580]   complicated sliders and get yourself additional
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:19.500]   little widgets like levels, contrast and brightness,
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:24.340]   histograms so that you can see where your colors are being
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.180]   integrated.
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:28.740]   Again, I feel like it's your personal use case
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:29.740]   and it really depends.
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:32.180]   But what I would suggest is if you're interested
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:34.460]   in at least playing around with photos and seeing
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:38.340]   if it's potentially good for your use case,
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:43.020]   take 500 to 1,000 photos or even just one batch of photos
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:46.020]   and create a tiny photos library that isn't connected
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:47.740]   to iCloud Photo Library.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:50.660]   Just make yourself a demo photos library
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:51.900]   and play around with the editing tools.
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:55.540]   It's a free program and it comes installed as part of OS X.
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:59.140]   So it's not like you're losing money or really time
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:01.700]   to give it a quick whirl and test through.
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:03.260]   And if you don't like what it has
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:05.660]   or if it doesn't currently suit your needs,
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:06.820]   then you don't have to use it.
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:11.300]   I do think that from a management perspective
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:14.180]   and especially when you incorporate iCloud Photo Library,
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:16.220]   if having your photos available to you
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:19.580]   from any device is important to you, photos is a must have.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:23.860]   And the editing process unfortunately open in
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.740]   does not currently work, which is very annoying for me
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:27.980]   and it's something that I really hope
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:30.420]   that they fix in future versions.
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:34.500]   But even that said, the cumbersome process
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:38.180]   of exporting the photo out and editing in Photoshop
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:40.340]   and popping it back into your library,
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:42.980]   that's worth it if you want to be able to carry
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:44.380]   around all of your images.
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:48.020]   The fact that I now have a 15,000 photo library
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:51.700]   and I can pull up any photo I want on my iPhone 6
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:53.140]   at any point in time.
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:55.260]   I did this while I was traveling in Pittsburgh.
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:58.900]   We stopped over at my friend's mother's house
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:00.740]   and we were talking about cats and I was like,
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:02.260]   "Oh, I used to have a cat that would try
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:03.340]   "and climb out my window."
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.220]   And he would like, "Paw up."
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:07.020]   And I'm like, "Let me see if I can find a picture."
[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:10.140]   'Cause I took like a billion pictures of this back in 2010.
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:12.580]   And I knew it was 2010, so I just scrolled up.
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:17.300]   I found the cat photo in probably five seconds,
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:18.860]   10 seconds and I showed it to her.
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:21.180]   And she wasn't even looking at the cat.
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:23.580]   She was looking at my tiny years grid
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:25.900]   and she's like, "How did you get all of your photos
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:27.260]   "on your phone?
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:28.820]   "I wanna be able to do that.
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:30.020]   "Can you tell me how to do that?
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:31.660]   "That's amazing."
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:35.580]   So I really do feel that photos is incredibly useful
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.100]   if you want your large library on your phone
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.540]   or at least potentially referenced on your phone.
[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:42.580]   And I go into greater detail about why that.
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:45.140]   I think that's important in my photos review.
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:47.300]   So I don't wanna take the entirety of Macbreak Weekly
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.340]   on going on and on about photos.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:53.980]   But for that subset and for again,
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.380]   the prosumers on down, I think it's great.
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:58.180]   If you're a professional photographer,
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:59.660]   you will be unhappy with photos.
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:01.700]   It is not aperture, it is not lightroom.
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:04.460]   It is not designed to be aperture or lightroom.
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.380]   Apple may fix some things.
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:07.940]   I really hope it fixes some things.
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:09.380]   I hope it adds some more brushes
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:11.060]   than its tiny little retouch button.
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:14.020]   I hope it adds edit in an external editor
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:16.540]   other than just this weird add to aperture button.
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.820]   But for the time being,
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:22.020]   I think it's a remarkably stable 1.0 release.
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:24.100]   And I feel like a great number of people
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:25.380]   will be very happy with it.
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:28.100]   Professionals, no, you still gotta either use
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.300]   aperture or lightroom.
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.460]   I'm sorry about that, but it doesn't seem like--
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:33.300]   (laughing)
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:35.300]   Like this apple is not solving your dilemma.
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:37.340]   Apple is not positioning photos
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:39.940]   as an aperture replacement all off Final Cut Pro 10
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:43.700]   being like, I know it's kind of loosey goosy,
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:44.980]   but we'll fix it later.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:47.500]   No, they're like, this is the photo editing program
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.060]   and management program for the vast majority of people.
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:51.660]   If you don't fit in this little box
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:54.100]   or in this very big container
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:55.860]   and you fit instead in a little box,
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:58.060]   we're sorry, we love to support the little box,
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:01.580]   but we can only do so many projects.
[01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:04.060]   We already have a watch and a Mac
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.700]   and a maybe a television and maybe a car
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:07.780]   and all of this software.
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:09.660]   - We didn't say television, we didn't say television.
[01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:11.020]   We didn't say television.
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:12.020]   (laughing)
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.260]   It's obviously a real slim dunk for consumers.
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:16.900]   I mean, just like you say, the ability to simply,
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:18.260]   I can make an edit on a photo
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:20.300]   and I know that no matter what Apple device I have,
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:22.180]   I can access that photo and show it off.
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:25.540]   That's just, it's such a really great reinterpretation
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:29.100]   of how people use photos in 2015.
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:31.460]   As good as whatever they had before that was working,
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:34.500]   it was really like a 2002, 2003.
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.700]   I will upload it to a public photo album
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:38.460]   then share out that album.
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:42.180]   I was wondering what the,
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:44.660]   I've been trying to figure out what Apple's motive was
[01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:46.220]   though in killing aperture.
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:47.980]   And one of the things that was on my mind is,
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:50.260]   well, maybe they're actually saying that,
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:52.500]   the new framework is not just this photos app,
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.740]   it really is a whole architecture for photos
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:56.660]   on every single device that Apple makes.
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:58.460]   Maybe they're saying that we can,
[01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.820]   you'll be able to do as much with photos plus maybe
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:03.700]   a $30 or $40 plug in that a third party will come up with
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:06.380]   as you could with aperture or lightroom
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:07.980]   or anything else you'd like to use.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:10.780]   So I've been, I do have the developer build.
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:12.660]   I've been trying it a little bit,
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:15.420]   but certainly not as intensively as you have.
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.180]   So I guess the other big problem,
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.540]   the other big question for myself
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.460]   and so many other people,
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:25.660]   Ren, can I trust giving it one of my aperture libraries
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:28.300]   or my iPhoto library or do I,
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:31.860]   my instinct is I'm going to create a copy
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:34.300]   of my aperture library on my current MacBook.
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:35.660]   I'm going to put it on a flash drive
[01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:38.660]   and I'm going to mail it to myself by root of Kazil
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:40.260]   to make sure it's 3000 miles away
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.700]   before I show photos this library.
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:45.020]   Is there, what's the worst that can happen?
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.900]   Okay, let's not say the worst that can happen
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:48.420]   is that asteroids kill us all
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:50.900]   while we're trying to get my photos loaded in.
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:54.580]   But realistically, can I feel as though I can trust photos
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:56.420]   with my existing libraries?
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:59.180]   Yeah, well, so the number one concern that you have
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.740]   that photos might otherwise destroy.
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:04.740]   I'm stuck using photos and now I can't open up an aperture
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:05.580]   and stuff like that.
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:08.220]   So when photos, when photos looks at your aperture
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.940]   in your iPhoto library, it doesn't actually convert it.
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.500]   So you actually can still keep on using aperture
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:16.780]   with that original library that you made way back when
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.660]   or iPhoto with your original iPhoto library,
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:22.660]   even after you have converted the library
[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:24.420]   because it's actually not converting it,
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:28.300]   it's making a second copy with hard links,
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:31.740]   which basically allow it to take up the same amount
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.380]   of storage space despite the fact
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:36.100]   that theoretically your hard drive thinks
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:38.540]   that it's taking up twice as much storage space,
[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:41.580]   but it's not actually from an overall picture.
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:44.740]   It's just sharing the data in between libraries
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:47.260]   so that if you're, you know, you can still keep
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:49.860]   on editing an aperture, you can keep on editing in photos,
[01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:52.900]   but your management is entirely separate.
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:54.740]   There are two separate libraries,
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.740]   something you do in photos will not reflect
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:58.180]   an aperture and vice versa.
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:08:59.980]   But if you delete your aperture library
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:02.460]   or if you delete your photos library,
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:04.140]   your aperture library is still fine
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.860]   or your photos library is still fine.
[01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:09.020]   It's not going to destroy one or the other
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:09.860]   if the other is not.
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:12.140]   It's not a symbiotic relationship.
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:13.500]   You can part them if you want
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.860]   or you can keep them together on the same hard drive
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:18.500]   and run them side by side even if you wanted to.
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.860]   It's not a huge problem.
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:25.820]   In general, I kind of, again, I feel like it's totally worth
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:27.780]   getting, you know, giving the risk,
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:29.020]   taking the, or not taking the risk,
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:30.620]   taking the jump and just being like,
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:31.980]   "I'm going to test this out."
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:34.620]   And if it's awful, I will just delete the photos library
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:37.140]   and then whatever, then we're cool.
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:39.980]   Or honestly, I know a couple people,
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:41.820]   friends of mine who are doing this,
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:44.140]   who are actually using photos as a way
[01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:47.860]   to just store their final finished edited photos,
[01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:50.460]   their sort of marquee product, so to speak.
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:53.780]   And then syncing those with iCloud Photo Library.
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:57.580]   So they do all their work in either Lightroom or aperture.
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.260]   And then they're using photos as a way
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:00.740]   almost to have a portfolio.
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:04.260]   So that those photos all sync across all their devices.
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:06.740]   And in addition, if they have optimized storage on
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:09.020]   and they're not storing them locally to their phone,
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:12.300]   they can pull low-res versions of those photos up,
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:13.420]   even while they're offline.
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:17.420]   So if like, you know, my friend James who takes photos
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.620]   is sitting on a plane and he's suddenly sitting next
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:21.700]   to a National Geographic photographer,
[01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:24.220]   he can still pull up a low-res version of a photo
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.740]   he took five years ago in Africa
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.220]   and show it to the photographer
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:30.340]   without having to be stored locally on his device.
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:31.340]   And I think that's really cool.
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:35.220]   That's like a big plus of photos for me over something
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:39.740]   like Dropbox or even Creative Cloud,
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:43.460]   where it's like, if I don't or can't store all of my photos
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:46.100]   on my phone or my iPad because of space reasons,
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:49.460]   iCloud Photo Library allows you to have sort of those low-res,
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:52.460]   very minimalistic space taking up copies
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:55.140]   and allows me to look at them,
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:57.060]   even if I have no internet connection.
[01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:59.740]   And if I have internet connection,
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:02.340]   it allows me to pull it down almost immediately
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:05.100]   from the great expanse of iCloud.
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:10.180]   So yeah, I mean, back to your essential question.
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.620]   If you're an Aputure user and you wanna give photos a try,
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:14.140]   you can import your Aputure library
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:16.100]   and nothing bad will happen to your Aputure library.
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:18.220]   You don't need to mail it to Brazil and back.
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:19.700]   It can stay on your same computer.
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:23.220]   If you're really terrified, you can make a separate copy of it.
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.260]   In fact, I recommend everybody back up their stuff
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:27.420]   before trying something new just on, you know,
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:29.140]   point of principle.
[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:31.940]   But overall, I found photos to be incredibly stable
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:33.300]   when importing other libraries
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.580]   and doesn't screw with it at all.
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:36.580]   - Coolness.
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:37.980]   Well, we need to go to commercial, but another ad.
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:40.660]   But before we do, do you think that we're gonna have
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:43.420]   to all upgrade our, like, size of our iCloud libraries
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:45.140]   in order to make room for all these photos?
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:46.980]   We're gonna be starting to sink in.
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:48.620]   I'm on the 200 gigabyte plan.
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:50.300]   Do you think I'm gonna need to get more?
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:51.940]   - I'm on 200 gigs as well.
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:54.540]   And so far that seems to be okay for me.
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:57.140]   I think I've filled up something like 80 gigs.
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:59.540]   Granted, I don't have a super ton of raw photos
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:01.340]   in this library.
[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:03.980]   Most of it's just high quality JPEGs.
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:07.900]   But I do feel like if you have a gigantic library
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:09.180]   you may need to look into upgrading.
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:11.260]   I know some people's hesitancy is like,
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.700]   "Oh God, I don't want to pay for another storage plan."
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.380]   And I feel that because I'm already paying for Dropbox
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.740]   and then all of these other, you know,
[01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:18.900]   the pay TV subscriptions.
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:21.660]   Like I've got a lot of computer subscriptions going on.
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:23.140]   It's kind of crazy.
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:26.100]   But I will say that, again, going back
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:27.740]   to like having the reference photos
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:31.220]   and the fact that your photos are being kept securely
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:34.220]   and privately, which means that there's no chance
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:35.740]   that Apple's going to use your photos
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:38.060]   and make ad money off of it
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:41.340]   or use your photos to try and determine what you might like,
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:43.380]   you know, the way that you might run into trouble
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:46.020]   with some of the free or ad support and services.
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:48.220]   I really like that aspect of it.
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:50.820]   I like the fact that it sinks so seamlessly
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:52.100]   into the Apple ecosystem.
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:55.300]   And much as I loathe paying an extra $4 a month,
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:58.380]   I feel like it's worth it for my needs.
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:00.140]   May not be worth it for everybody else's.
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:02.620]   Again, I really stress, I think,
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:04.020]   with almost anything Apple related
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:05.940]   or anything technology related for that matter,
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:09.500]   it's like, if it doesn't fit your lifestyle, that's okay.
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.540]   Like just because one person loves it and thinks,
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.180]   oh my God, this is the perfect thing for me
[01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:15.180]   and I can't believe it wasn't available sooner,
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:17.620]   doesn't mean that that's going to be the same thing for you.
[01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:19.180]   And if it's not, then that's fine.
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:20.420]   There might be something else for you.
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:22.180]   It's no big deal.
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:25.260]   - The only wound that sometimes we suffer
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:28.900]   is that Apple has a wonderful plan for all of our lives.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:31.620]   Apple likes to remind us that we thought about this
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:33.220]   way more than you did.
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:36.300]   So Andy, don't worry, you're pretty little head
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.620]   about how to connect things to your MacBook.
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:40.020]   We've planned that for you.
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:41.100]   But how about this one thing?
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:42.380]   We've planned this for you.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:43.380]   But I can't close it.
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:45.740]   Andy, thank us and say goodbye.
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:47.780]   We've planned this out for you.
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:50.300]   We're going to be taking a break.
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:54.460]   Let's go once again to Leo Laporte from the distant past
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:56.900]   to tell us a little bit about Squarespace.
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:57.900]   - Thank you, Andy.
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.780]   - Not co, we'll be back with more Mac break weekly
[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:01.380]   in just a bit, but first I gotta tell you about
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:05.940]   our favorite web hosting company, Squarespace.com.
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:07.860]   You know, it's great about Squarespace.
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.420]   It makes sense if you're Squarespace,
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:11.700]   their web pages, their homepage is always different.
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.900]   Beautiful, it's gorgeous now.
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:16.420]   They just do such great stuff.
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:17.620]   They have the best designers.
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.060]   Now let me explain what Squarespace is.
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:22.220]   It's not just a hosting company.
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:24.900]   When you get started at Squarespace,
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:27.060]   you will choose your first template
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:28.300]   and they've got some gorgeous ones.
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.460]   And I'll tell you in a little bit
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:31.860]   why these templates are extra special.
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:34.180]   But let's just pick momentum.
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:35.580]   You'll set up your first site.
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:37.020]   And you can do this, by the way, absolutely free.
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:38.460]   You don't need to give them a credit card or anything
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:39.460]   for two weeks.
[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:40.940]   You've got the site, you've got the hosting,
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:43.180]   but you've also got the software running on top of it.
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:45.820]   And there's a real advantage to doing it this way.
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:47.540]   Because Squarespace runs the software,
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:48.980]   they know the software,
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:51.740]   and they're using custom built web servers
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:52.980]   to work with the software.
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:57.820]   So they get a really incredible performance and linking.
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:59.620]   And it just works so well.
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.860]   Every Squarespace template is what we call mobile responsive.
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:04.980]   That means it looks good on everything
[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:08.260]   from an iPhone to a 55 inch television.
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:11.420]   And when you upload an image, it'll resize.
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:12.420]   It actually make, I think,
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:14.420]   not eight or nine different thumbnails of that image.
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:16.100]   Notice right here on momentum,
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:19.540]   the big screen, the 27 inch version has the doggy,
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:21.380]   and the little mobile version has the doggy,
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:23.900]   and the mistress holding the doggy.
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:26.580]   This is a full bleed template.
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:28.180]   That means the pictures go all the way to the edge
[01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:29.900]   of the screen and they look so great.
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:33.980]   Every Squarespace template has e-commerce built into it.
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:36.580]   But more importantly, they're all customizable.
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:39.580]   So these are sites, actual customers using medium,
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.420]   and you can see each one looks different.
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:43.500]   Each one's unique, and that's why you're gonna like this.
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.020]   Squarespace lets you create a site
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:49.820]   that reflects your unique abilities, your unique style,
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:52.940]   but it gives you such a great head start doing it.
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:56.460]   And you can try it for free at squarespace.com right now.
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:59.460]   No credit card needed.
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:01.340]   If you want some help, Squarespace has live chat
[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:03.980]   and email support 24/7 right from their offices
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:05.340]   in New York City.
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:07.740]   They start as low as $8 a month after the trial,
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:09.820]   and they do the hosting, they do the software.
[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:12.700]   You even get a free domain name when you sign up for a year.
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:17.140]   I love Squarespace's new cover pages thing they have.
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:19.660]   I love it, gives you a beautiful one page online presence
[01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:22.420]   and it's also great for a kind of a one-off site
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:25.380]   or a quick landing page for a new product, that kind of thing.
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:29.820]   By the way, if you live in the area,
[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:31.700]   or if you're willing to move to the New York area,
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:34.820]   Squarespace is hiring engineers right now,
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:36.980]   or ready for the next step in their career,
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:39.620]   that's why they created NY Commit.
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:42.780]   It's an initiative that will select up to 10 engineers
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:46.980]   from all over America to, oh boy, I wish I could do this,
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:51.980]   to experience the history, vibrancy, diversity of New York City.
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:54.820]   If you apply today and the interview before April 30th,
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:58.100]   you and your spouse or partner will get a complimentary
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.340]   weekend in New York City.
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:01.340]   They'll fly you out, they'll put you up.
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:05.500]   To learn more, go to NYCOMMIT.com.
[01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:12.540]   This is a great idea, boy, this is a great idea.
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:15.460]   You use these Squarespace as a great employer.
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:17.700]   Start a trial at Squarespace, no credit card required.
[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:18.860]   Start building your website today
[01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:20.100]   when you sign up for Squarespace.
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:22.700]   All I ask, use the offer code MACBreak,
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.980]   that'll let them know you heard about it on the show,
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:29.740]   and you'll get 10% off, just as a way of saying thank you.
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:32.860]   Squarespace, build it beautiful.
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:34.660]   We thank Squarespace so much for their support
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:35.700]   at MACBreak Weekly.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:37.740]   And now I send you back to the studio,
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:40.180]   wait a minute, I'm here, Andy and I go.
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:44.420]   Signing you back to the future.
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:47.060]   Just before we start recording,
[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:51.020]   Apple announced the date for WWDC 2015
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:53.180]   and started the lottery.
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:56.220]   It's going to be June 8th through June 12th
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:01.140]   at the usual locus of insanity, the Uruvweina Center.
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:03.740]   And people can start applying for tickets today,
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:06.820]   through Friday, and I bet they're already gone.
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:09.620]   Renee, the ticket's already gone now, right?
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:10.900]   It's a lottery like last year,
[01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:12.700]   so basically you get to throw your hat
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:13.940]   in the registration ring
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.060]   and then I forget when they said,
[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:17.460]   they announced the date that they'll be telling you
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:19.780]   whether you were laboriously hand-selected
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:20.620]   for a ticket or not,
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:22.620]   and then they'll charge you associated a credit card.
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:23.540]   - Yeah, Monday April 12th.
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:24.860]   - Yeah, random selection process.
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:26.660]   It's like being drafted.
[01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:30.180]   It's like Monday, April 12th, 20th at 5 p.m.
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:32.700]   Isn't it kind of amazing that people are going to like,
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:34.340]   oh my God, I'm so lucky.
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:39.020]   I won the opportunity to spend $1,600 to go to a trade show.
[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:43.860]   But if you really need to know things first-hand,
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:46.740]   about development hardware and software,
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:48.580]   you're going to have to be there.
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:50.100]   Or am I for stating it?
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:52.340]   - Well, so the labs are always going to be the labs.
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:53.780]   There's only so many Apple engineers
[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:56.100]   and they only get so much time to actually interface
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:57.220]   with the developers.
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:58.820]   But this year, if you read the fine print,
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:00.500]   they're going to be streaming a ton of stuff,
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:02.500]   which means that if you don't get the ticket,
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:03.220]   it's way better.
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:05.700]   It used to be months, I think, before you get the videos.
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.300]   And recently, over the last couple of years,
[01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:08.980]   they got it to almost, so it was day in date.
[01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:11.860]   It'd be a few hours after the session.
[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:13.220]   But in the description, this year,
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:14.420]   it says they're going to try to stream.
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:15.380]   It doesn't say everything,
[01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:16.900]   but it seems like they're going to be streaming
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:19.460]   a lot more than just the usual keynotes
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:20.420]   and state of the unions,
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:22.260]   which means that if you don't get a ticket,
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:23.460]   you can still come for the drinks.
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:26.020]   And actually, I think a lot of people are going to rent rooms
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:28.100]   and join their friends and just watch them over the air.
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:30.980]   - That would be cool.
[01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:32.260]   Just like around the Super Bowl,
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:33.540]   if you don't get tickets to the Super Bowl,
[01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:36.180]   at least you can still be part of the Super Bowl community
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:36.820]   for that week.
[01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:37.620]   - Party.
[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:39.780]   - Is that it's, I mean,
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:43.780]   because that seems like unusual given like the historical nature
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:44.740]   of WWDC.
[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:47.780]   It used to be where the San Francisco is on lockdown.
[01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:49.860]   If you go there, you're not supposed to write about this.
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:51.300]   You're not supposed to talk about this.
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:53.460]   You're not supposed to wear the t-shirt or the blazer
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:54.820]   until three months afterward.
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:58.100]   And now, is everybody going to be able to watch these streams?
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:19:59.620]   Or is it going to be you need a developer account
[01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:00.260]   in order to do that?
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:01.460]   - I mean, last year,
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:02.980]   you were supposed to need a developer account,
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:05.460]   but it was unlocked for a surprising amount of time.
[01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:06.580]   And it might still be unlocked.
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:07.940]   If you go to developer.apple.com,
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:10.020]   I don't think they still ask you.
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:13.540]   And they were giving journalists passes to the entire event,
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:14.820]   not just for the keynote.
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:16.340]   And the basic NDA had changed
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:18.180]   so that you couldn't show screenshots or video,
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:18.980]   but you could still,
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.140]   people were basically live tweeting state of the union,
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:22.420]   which had never happened before.
[01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:25.620]   So in many ways, it is a whole new WWDC.
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:29.140]   - Is there any upside to Apple having secrecy at this point?
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:31.140]   - I don't know.
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:34.260]   I would say that anyone who's been in the industry long enough
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:36.020]   can kind of look at any platform
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:38.580]   and see what the most likely observable holes are.
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:40.900]   And you'll spend a lot of commentary off that.
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:45.060]   So I think this new climate is better for developers.
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:45.860]   They seem happier.
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:48.420]   It seems less constrained.
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:50.020]   I think it's a net positive all in all.
[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:53.380]   - Yeah, I agree with Renee there.
[01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:56.820]   I do think that there is a certain amount of,
[01:20:56.820 --> 01:21:02.820]   it's important for Apple to maintain a certain amount of secrecy,
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:05.220]   especially when it comes to developer APIs.
[01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:08.420]   Because when you're talking about,
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:11.220]   obviously these are available to anybody who has a dev account.
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:14.660]   But at the same time, a lot of it's very technical.
[01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:19.060]   It's very technical and it's very much at a,
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:20.980]   I don't know.
[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:24.500]   I feel like if we were given free reign to write about everything
[01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:26.580]   that happens during WWDC,
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:29.860]   we would probably end up with a bunch of our readers being like,
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:34.900]   why do I care about watch kit API
[01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:40.100]   that allows developers to call, sign, brackets.
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:43.460]   A lot of this stuff isn't necessarily interesting
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:45.300]   for the average user.
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.780]   And also some of the stuff is talking about features
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:49.620]   that won't officially ship until the fall.
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:53.300]   It's the same reason why Apple really isn't thrilled about sites
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:56.980]   like 9 to 5 Mac writing about the music app in 8.4
[01:21:56.980 --> 01:22:00.420]   and why on iMore we try and keep ourselves
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:02.500]   to mostly published software.
[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:06.020]   Because we don't want to either hype up a feature
[01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:08.180]   that changes in the official build
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:11.380]   or something that may disappear entirely by the time it's released.
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:14.660]   Those kinds of things can really,
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:17.940]   not only from Apple's point of view,
[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:20.020]   make users mad at them and be like,
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:21.700]   well, I bought this for this feature
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:24.260]   because I saw it on this website and now it's not here.
[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:28.020]   But from a journalistic point of view,
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:29.060]   if we're telling people,
[01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:30.660]   and we're writing how-tos about features
[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:31.860]   that haven't been released yet,
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:36.020]   and then we're basically doing disservices
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:37.220]   to the people who read us
[01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:39.620]   and the people who rely on us for good information
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:43.220]   to help them make decisions.
[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:44.500]   Because if we're telling them things
[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:45.860]   that they can't actually use,
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.780]   how is that helping them?
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:50.500]   Yeah, and I think the other problem is that
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:53.540]   this is information that Apple has put together
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:54.900]   for the benefit of developers
[01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:56.820]   and they're speaking developer language.
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:58.020]   And if you have a journalist,
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:00.180]   no matter how tech savvy he or she is,
[01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:03.940]   they might not have that broad understanding
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:06.100]   that allows them to understand the context
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:07.460]   that's being presented in.
[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:09.140]   I mean, every time that I'm trying to process
[01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:10.660]   a piece of news from WWDC,
[01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:12.740]   I have to call like a whole phalanx
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:14.340]   of seeing iNURDS to say,
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:16.180]   well, I think that this means this.
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.180]   Am I on base or on base?
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:19.620]   And say, no, you're not even,
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:20.500]   you're not playing baseball,
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:21.300]   you're playing football,
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:22.260]   they're a son.
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:24.420]   And that's the problem of when Apple's
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:25.620]   trying to communicate to developers,
[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:28.180]   but the whole world starts listening.
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:30.180]   So you mentioned,
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:32.020]   Ren, you mentioned Watch Kit, that's certainly,
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:34.260]   so we're, I think we're kind of counting on Apple,
[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:37.620]   releasing the development kit for third party watch apps at WWDC.
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:40.980]   Yeah, I'm hoping.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:44.340]   Seems like, yeah, I'm hoping that we'll see it for
[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:47.860]   more realistic is the wrong word.
[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:52.100]   More thorough Watch Kit options.
[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:53.060]   Right now, of course,
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:54.980]   developers have largely been limited to
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:58.020]   essentially handoff applications,
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:23:59.540]   things that are running on the iPhone
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:02.980]   and pushed to the Apple Watch.
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:07.300]   But I'm crossing my fingers that we might see stuff like that,
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:11.060]   more standalone apps appear at WWDC.
[01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:12.980]   Well, we'll have to wait and see.
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:14.180]   It may be a constraint,
[01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:17.140]   like as much as I really want to see
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:18.900]   full featured apps this year,
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:23.140]   it may be a constraint of the current generation Apple Watch,
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:24.420]   that it just won't,
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:26.020]   you know, it doesn't have the horsepower,
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:27.460]   it doesn't have the battery life,
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:29.220]   or any number of other things,
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:34.100]   to potentially run full applications.
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:35.060]   And if that's the case,
[01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:37.540]   we may be kind of stuck in the same kind of like iPhone
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:39.300]   to iPhone 3G limbo.
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:41.140]   Only it's a little bit better than last time,
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:42.020]   because we're not having,
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:43.860]   we're not limited to web apps.
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:46.420]   These handoff apps are actually pretty full featured
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:47.220]   and pretty awesome,
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:49.140]   and they can store a certain amount of info
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:50.340]   direct on the watch,
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:51.060]   so that you know,
[01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:52.100]   you could still use the app,
[01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:55.540]   even if your iPhone is not necessarily directly by your side.
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:57.460]   But I, you know, I don't know,
[01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:59.380]   I'm kind of up in the air on whether or not
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:00.980]   we'll see it at this year's WDC,
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:02.500]   or we'll see it during next year.
[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:04.420]   Yeah, not to reopen watch,
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.500]   but that's something that's been on my mind a lot.
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.020]   I kind of
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:12.020]   founded a Twitter storm a few days ago,
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:14.580]   but two days before pre-orders started,
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:15.300]   by sort of saying,
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:18.180]   maybe you want to consider not pre-ordering this one,
[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:19.860]   knowing that it would be great advice
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:22.020]   for anybody who was looking for advice,
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:24.020]   and the people that are most,
[01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:27.220]   are the best audience for the first generation.
[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:28.900]   Don't care what anybody says,
[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:30.820]   pro or con, they're going to buy it anyway,
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:32.820]   because I'm with you.
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:34.340]   I think it's going to be like the first iPhone,
[01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:35.220]   like the first iPad,
[01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:37.140]   where there's going to be a lot of stuff coming up,
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:39.460]   and I feel as though there's a lot of stuff coming up in 2016,
[01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:40.740]   that the first generation
[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:42.420]   won't have the hardware to handle.
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:45.060]   Although it'd be hard to imagine Apple
[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:47.140]   not having native watch apps,
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:49.300]   at least in time for the Christmas buying season,
[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:51.860]   when I hope they'll have enough stock on hand.
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:54.980]   Alex, is there anything that Apple could possibly announce
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:56.980]   at WWDC, or at least tip their hand to,
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:59.060]   that would be really, really welcome news to you?
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:00.180]   I'm trying to,
[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:02.180]   as when I heard about WWDC this morning,
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:04.180]   I was kind of like making a mental list of,
[01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:06.260]   here are all the rumored things
[01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:07.140]   that we've been hearing about,
[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:08.660]   things are picking up velocity,
[01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:10.100]   that would need developer support,
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:12.340]   and Apple would either want to announce it
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:14.100]   at the WWDC keynote,
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:15.060]   or they would at least,
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:16.660]   through some of these sessions,
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:18.660]   tip their hands to what's going to be possible
[01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:21.060]   with the phones and the iPads next year.
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:22.020]   Is there anything, particularly,
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:22.980]   that you're kind of on tenor hooks,
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:24.180]   to hear about at WWDC?
[01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:26.980]   I really want to see something with Apple TV.
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:29.380]   So, you know, to me,
[01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:30.500]   I think that, you know,
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:32.020]   you're looking at an iOS platform
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:33.860]   that is completely undeveloped.
[01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:35.700]   I think that Apple's getting serious about it.
[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:36.260]   I think that,
[01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:38.820]   I think that there's a real opportunity there
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:41.140]   to do a lot of development.
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:42.900]   I mean, I think when you think of it as a game platform,
[01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:44.500]   communications platform,
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.020]   there's a lot of things that can be done with Apple TV,
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:47.700]   and I'm not talking about big TV.
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:49.220]   Oh, man.
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:52.820]   Oh, we lost Alex again?
[01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:53.140]   Hello?
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:56.820]   I think we've lost Alex again,
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:58.100]   because he's looking contemplative.
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:00.340]   Renee, same thing to you.
[01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:01.940]   What are you looking for?
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:02.900]   Not even a prediction,
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:04.900]   but what are you hoping to learn more about,
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:07.060]   or at least see some movement on at WWDC?
[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:11.860]   Yeah, well, we'll assume that iOS 9 and OS 10, 10.11,
[01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:13.460]   you know, Apple's not getting out of the computer business,
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:14.420]   so we'll see those things.
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:15.780]   But I'm going to echo Alex.
[01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:18.580]   I think Apple TV was last updated spring, 2012.
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:21.940]   Those little boxes sat there kind of for Lauren ever since.
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:24.260]   And Apple's got all this great technology now.
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:26.740]   They have the A7 and A8 processors.
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:27.620]   They've got metal.
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.060]   They've got an SDK that's, you know,
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:30.500]   not to keep saying this.
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.420]   It's been sitting up on bricks for a long time.
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:34.660]   And I think if you put all those things in the field
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:36.820]   and you have things like the Apple Watch and HomeKit
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:39.860]   and all these other sort of like,
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:42.100]   there's always been a limit to what Apple could touch in our lives.
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:44.020]   You had to have a phone, you had to have an iPad,
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:45.940]   you had to have a Mac, but it was very little beyond that.
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:48.180]   And now that they've decoupled interfaces,
[01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:50.340]   and they've sort of unbundled functionality,
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:51.380]   an app is no longer an app.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:53.060]   An app is now a series of discrete things
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:55.220]   that you can do almost anywhere.
[01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:57.700]   It just seems like it's going to be really interesting
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:28:00.100]   when you have CarPlay and HomeKit and HealthKit
[01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:01.860]   and AirPlay and all these different things.
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:04.420]   And Apple TV that ties into that,
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:05.780]   it seems like the lone thing sort of
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:07.940]   that we're still dragging from the past.
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:09.620]   And I think when we have, you know,
[01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:11.220]   the Watch, the pads, the iPhone,
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:12.980]   even the new MacBook in some ways,
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:16.260]   it's going to be a very big, big, bright WWDC future.
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:20.740]   Yeah, I can't, I can't, yeah, no, not to oversell it either,
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:22.660]   but I mean, there was, I was kind of in the dumps
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:24.420]   with Apple about a year, year and a half ago,
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:26.340]   because I saw a lot of lack of movement
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:29.140]   on everything that I thought was going to be a really good idea
[01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:32.980]   and not a whole lot of signs that Apple is terribly interested
[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:35.060]   in things that aren't making them bucket loads of money
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.420]   at this given moment.
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:38.340]   And it's like I was saying earlier,
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:40.900]   I see so many components sitting around that,
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:42.820]   "Oh my God, they're about,
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:44.500]   they're building a giant fighting robot."
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:47.060]   They are building a fighting giant robot,
[01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:49.300]   because look, there's the big purple fist over there,
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.700]   and over there, there's like the antenna that will fit onto the head
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:54.020]   and all they got to do is snap this onto that.
[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:56.580]   So I'm pretty excited about WWDC,
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:58.820]   even if we don't have, even if we've already seen the watch,
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:00.260]   even if we know we're not going to see,
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:02.420]   oh, excuse me, we're pretty sure we're not going to see a phone
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:04.100]   and other things don't seem to make much sense.
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:07.220]   I just, I want to see all these things connected together.
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:10.340]   We will be back with our picks of the week
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:13.700]   after past Leo tells us about trunk club, Leo.
[01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:14.340]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:17.780]   They say guys don't like to shop.
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:20.180]   And I've been thinking about that.
[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:22.260]   I like to shop for gadgets,
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:23.540]   I like to shop for tools,
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:26.420]   but I don't like to shop for clothes.
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:29.060]   And that's why I was so glad, right?
[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:29.780]   Right.
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:30.900]   There is no guy alive,
[01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:32.500]   that's why we look like the way we look.
[01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:36.100]   Because we don't want, we want to give me a t-shirt,
[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:37.620]   shorts, flip flops, I'm happy.
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:39.540]   Even though, even Mark Zuckerberg,
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.220]   how rich is Mark Zuckerberg?
[01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:43.540]   Billionaire, whereas hoodies and flip flops,
[01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:46.100]   sourshoe shoes, we don't like to shop,
[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:49.300]   but what if somebody shopped for you,
[01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:51.620]   picked the stuff you really liked,
[01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:54.900]   put it together, beautifully displayed,
[01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:56.660]   and said what do you like?
[01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:59.220]   And what if they did that for you for free?
[01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:01.300]   You only pay for the stuff you keep.
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:02.500]   That's trunk club,
[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:04.660]   that's, and I love trunk club.
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:06.420]   Your own personal stylist, mine is Robin,
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:07.140]   you can't have her.
[01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:09.060]   She's really great.
[01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:10.020]   Actually, you probably can.
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:14.420]   I like to think she's a one client, Cal.
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:16.900]   Robin is, I talked to her for about half an hour,
[01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:18.580]   told her what, you know, I'm a preppy,
[01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:19.780]   I'm kind of chunky,
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:21.140]   you know, give her all the feedback.
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:22.980]   She picked out some great stuff,
[01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:24.420]   put it up on a website,
[01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:26.500]   and then Lisa and I looked at it and said,
[01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.820]   nah, yeah, no.
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:30.180]   And then she put together the trunk.
[01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:32.340]   I got my, I get my, this is not my first trunk,
[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.740]   this is, I loved it so much, I got another trunk.
[01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:36.340]   By the way, this costs nothing.
[01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:38.500]   You don't pay for the shipping or returns,
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.340]   you don't pay for Robin's time,
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:42.100]   you only pay for what you keep.
[01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:42.820]   That's it.
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:44.420]   So I haven't opened this yet.
[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:45.940]   It's gonna be my first time.
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.380]   This is the biggest trunk,
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:48.340]   this one's really big.
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:50.500]   They do such a nice job,
[01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:52.420]   though you'll be so excited when your trunk arrives.
[01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:56.180]   I can't remember what we,
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:57.620]   oh, wait a minute, I got on sideways.
[01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:58.100]   There we go.
[01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:00.980]   I can't remember what we told her this time.
[01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:03.780]   So one of the nice things they do is they,
[01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:07.140]   they give you an envelope with a turn mailing,
[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:09.540]   you see how they tie it nicely and everything.
[01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:10.500]   Great stuff.
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:11.380]   Oh my gosh.
[01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:13.220]   Okay, I'm definitely keeping that.
[01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:16.340]   Ah, probably not that.
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:18.820]   This is nice, this is like a pea coat.
[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:20.180]   Well, I can't wait to try that on.
[01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:23.300]   So here's the deal, you're gonna try all this stuff on.
[01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:24.500]   You're gonna see if you like it.
[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:26.100]   Anything you don't like,
[01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:27.780]   you just throw back in the trunk,
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:29.460]   send it back, they pay the shipping.
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:31.620]   This is a return shipping envelope.
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:33.700]   You only pay for the stuff you keep.
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:35.380]   If you keep nothing, you pay nothing.
[01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:36.660]   Now we asked it for some neckties.
[01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:38.020]   This, oh, I love this.
[01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:39.620]   Look at that.
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:40.500]   Isn't that beautiful?
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.980]   All right, we're keeping that for sure.
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:44.180]   I love this one too.
[01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:46.900]   Beautiful shirts, sweaters, but it'll be,
[01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:47.620]   it'll all depend.
[01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:48.660]   You know, this is my stuff.
[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:50.900]   It'll all depend on what you say.
[01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:52.340]   Oh, look at that.
[01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:53.140]   See, the nice thing is,
[01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:54.340]   I don't know what's trending hip.
[01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:55.620]   Robin does.
[01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:58.820]   So if Robin sends me a bright red tie,
[01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:00.020]   I know people who weren't,
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:00.900]   that will look good.
[01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:03.620]   I should wear this to my presentation.
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:04.980]   Should I?
[01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:07.060]   All right, I got a presentation of Vegas.
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:09.140]   That's why I'm not here.
[01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:12.420]   Oh, look, it's like a pocket square.
[01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:14.340]   Oh, that's so cute.
[01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:15.220]   That goes with a tie.
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:17.460]   Oh, that's so cute.
[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:22.660]   Anyway, I'm sorry, I'm going on and on about my trunk.
[01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:24.180]   Your trunk is awaiting for you.
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:25.540]   So is your stylist.
[01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:27.380]   Oh, this is made in Italy.
[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:28.500]   This is Italian shirt.
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:30.180]   That is, do you like that?
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:30.900]   I like that.
[01:32:30.900 --> 01:32:33.940]   Your stylist is awaiting right now.
[01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:37.540]   Go to trunkclub.com/twit.
[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:39.300]   You'll sign up with your stylist.
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:40.820]   It will not cost you anything.
[01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:42.340]   It's free to join.
[01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:44.340]   There's no subscription fee.
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:45.220]   Shipping is free.
[01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:46.260]   Returns are free.
[01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:47.620]   There's no minimum purchase.
[01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:50.420]   And they don't send you a box every month.
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:51.300]   It's not a subscription.
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:52.580]   It's not like the book of the month club.
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:55.460]   You talk to your stylist whenever you're in the mood
[01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:57.220]   for more stuff and she'll send you stuff.
[01:32:57.220 --> 01:32:57.940]   And that's it.
[01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.460]   It couldn't be easier.
[01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:02.180]   Gorgeous clothes handpicked for your style.
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:04.260]   You don't have to shop.
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:05.940]   You just have to talk to Robin.
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:06.660]   Trunk club.
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:07.620]   No, you can't have Robin.
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:08.500]   She's mine.
[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.740]   Trunkclub.com/twit.
[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:12.100]   Oh, I love this cable.
[01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:13.380]   That's beautiful.
[01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:15.380]   See, it's interesting because this is the second box.
[01:33:15.380 --> 01:33:18.820]   She's totally refined what she's sending me.
[01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:21.540]   It's like the first box.
[01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:23.140]   I kept a couple of sweaters.
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:25.620]   I've a few things, some shoes.
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:27.220]   This box, I'm probably going to keep much of it
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:28.260]   because it all looks gorgeous.
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:30.660]   Well, look at this jacket.
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:31.700]   It's a Vince, you know.
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:33.540]   See, I don't know from labels.
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:37.220]   But then I show this to the ladies and they go,
[01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:38.180]   "Oh, you got a Vince."
[01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:39.620]   Yeah, I got a Vince.
[01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:41.700]   I know I'm on my way around.
[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:43.300]   Find the wardrobe clothing.
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:47.060]   Trunkclub.com/twit.
[01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:47.620]   Try it today.
[01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:48.180]   You're going to love it.
[01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:51.300]   Andy, you could use a little Trunk club.
[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:52.740]   Andy, not go.
[01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:56.980]   Yeah, Leo, you got a point there because,
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:58.020]   and this is no joke.
[01:33:58.020 --> 01:33:59.940]   Last night, I was on eBay
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:01.700]   buying a secondhand sport coat
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:04.980]   because I had seen a fellow speaker
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:06.020]   at last week's conference
[01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:06.980]   wearing one just like.
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:07.860]   And I thought,
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:09.540]   "Yeah, I bet I could pull that off."
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:10.980]   And that's the, I have to,
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:11.860]   I have to be a,
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:14.580]   I'm a monkey, see monkey, do sort of self-tailer.
[01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:15.700]   I need help.
[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:16.660]   I need assistance.
[01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:19.220]   I need, I need my mom to come and just,
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:22.500]   but if not for my mom buying me clothes for Christmas,
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:25.380]   I would have nothing sporty in my wardrobe at all.
[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:27.860]   Let's get on to our picks of the week,
[01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:28.580]   starting with Alex.
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:29.460]   Alex, what you got for us?
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:32.500]   So my pick of the week is a new camera
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.980]   that is having a lot of fun with.
[01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:36.100]   I'm doing a lot of spherical work.
[01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:37.060]   So I'm shooting,
[01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:40.020]   you know, lots of stuff for,
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:42.580]   the headsets and so on and so forth.
[01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:44.660]   And the one that I actually shoot with
[01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:46.340]   looks like this,
[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:50.260]   which is very much of a spaghetti mess that-
[01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:51.700]   Is that a spherical selfie stick?
[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:56.500]   No, it's an everyone-y stick.
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:58.100]   It is an ISS space station
[01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.380]   and the worms in the ground stick.
[01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:02.660]   So anyway, that's what I'm shooting with.
[01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:04.100]   And obviously carrying that around
[01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:04.980]   all the time is hard,
[01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:07.060]   but I want to test things and think through things
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:08.340]   and try to figure things out.
[01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:11.380]   So I got this little thing called a theta.
[01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:12.500]   This is made by Rico.
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.140]   And this has lenses on both sides.
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:17.300]   You can see right there,
[01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:19.300]   there's got lenses on both sides.
[01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:22.420]   And what it actually does is shoots a spherical video
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:24.660]   or still in one click.
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:26.740]   So if I want to do this here,
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:29.300]   I just hold it up here and I might have heard that little-
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:32.980]   So anyway, that would be a really weird photo.
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:35.220]   And in black, we've all forgotten all about what you're telling us.
[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:38.100]   Exactly.
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:40.660]   It does feel like that when it makes the noise.
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:45.060]   So anyway, it is a-
[01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:46.820]   It was funny, I shot a video-
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:48.180]   And the audio is a little rough,
[01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:50.500]   but I shot a video of my mom her birthday
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:52.740]   was a couple weeks ago blowing out the candles.
[01:35:52.740 --> 01:35:55.140]   So it was like you're sitting at the table.
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:56.660]   And you put it on,
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:36:00.820]   and it's kind of the next generation of selfie
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:01.860]   because it's a selfie.
[01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:04.420]   You've had ones that are front and back,
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:05.940]   where you get the two photos.
[01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:08.420]   This is like you talking to someone,
[01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:09.700]   like picture with them,
[01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:12.660]   and everything that you were standing inside of at the same time.
[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:14.020]   I will like to say in my own defense
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:16.980]   that I did order black and somehow ended up with pink,
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:19.220]   but I needed it, so I kept it.
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:22.340]   So anyway, I did, I've done stuff like-
[01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:24.820]   I suctioned, cupped it to the front of my car,
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:28.580]   which makes a really odd experience in a gear VR
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:29.780]   because it feels like you're sitting on the-
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:32.500]   on the hood of the car.
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:36.420]   So what can you do with the video?
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:38.740]   Is it like a standard video file?
[01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:42.980]   It is a, so it creates a video file that is,
[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:44.980]   that's two halves,
[01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:46.740]   and then their software will stitch it together.
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:49.780]   And their player will do it.
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:51.940]   There are some players online that are capable of playing it,
[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:53.940]   but you can see, yeah, there's someone who took it.
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:55.060]   And what's really interesting is look at it.
[01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:56.100]   It looks like you're just pinching.
[01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:58.180]   It looks like you're just holding up your hand
[01:36:58.180 --> 01:37:02.020]   and because it maps itself out of the picture.
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:04.020]   You're putting your thumbnail first.
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:07.780]   You know, I do regret that I bite my nails now,
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:09.140]   because I keep on looking at these photos
[01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:11.060]   and they're like, oh man, that's rough.
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:14.900]   So, but you know, it's got a quarter 20 on the bottom
[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:16.580]   so that you can mount it to tripods
[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:18.020]   and do all that other fun stuff.
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:19.460]   So there's a lot of other things
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:21.540]   that you can kind of get it away from yourself.
[01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:23.620]   That's probably a better solution.
[01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:28.340]   And it's just, I'm really, you know, really enjoy it.
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:29.860]   You know, like this is where I was.
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:31.300]   This is like the whole, you know,
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:32.420]   there's some good examples there.
[01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:34.500]   Anyway, it's good.
[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:36.820]   Yeah, it's said how much is it?
[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:40.100]   Alex.
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:45.140]   Oh, no, we don't know whether to review at least.
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:45.620]   Exactly.
[01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:46.420]   We'll find out.
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:47.860]   Find out next week on the exciting conclusion.
[01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:48.340]   Exactly.
[01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:51.140]   We will find out how much that is
[01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:52.420]   in case we don't get Alex back.
[01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:54.500]   And until then, Renee, what do you got for us?
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:58.340]   So I've had a long and abiding love for an app
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:37:59.380]   called Snapseed.
[01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:00.580]   It's on iOS and Android.
[01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:02.900]   It was by Nick Software and they got bought by Google.
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:04.340]   And Google is a big company.
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:06.260]   And I understand they can't always put all their attention
[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:07.700]   everywhere that I'd like it all the time.
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:12.100]   But they sort of left it to follow for a long time.
[01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:13.780]   Felt like years and years.
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:15.460]   And it just sort of got older and older.
[01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:16.820]   And I used it less and less.
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:19.060]   Well, finally, and I'm going to use the full
[01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:21.380]   on italic bold version of finally.
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:24.340]   They've released version 2.0 of Snapseed.
[01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:25.860]   I think it was last week.
[01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:27.540]   And it is awesome.
[01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:30.260]   I haven't used it on Android yet, but on iOS, especially,
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:31.780]   it is terrific.
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:33.780]   Most of all, because they actually took the time,
[01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:36.500]   actually cared enough to implement a photo kit,
[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:39.300]   which is Apple's API that lets you tie into the non-destructive
[01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:41.620]   edit pipeline that iOS 8 introduced.
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:44.820]   So theoretically, you can do stuff in photos.
[01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:47.220]   You can do stuff in all the different filters in photos.
[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:48.660]   And you can do stuff in Snapseed.
[01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:50.500]   And then if you later change your mind,
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:52.260]   it's not, oh, I have to go back to the original
[01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:54.900]   and painstakingly reproduce this entire chain of events,
[01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:56.980]   except changing that one step that will lead me
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:38:58.420]   to a better, brighter future.
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:39:00.980]   But you can just go in and twist the knobs and dials
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:03.780]   and change just the part that you originally changed
[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:05.140]   with Snapseed.
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:06.500]   The downside is not everything,
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:07.540]   including some of Apple's stuff.
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:10.260]   Doesn't support the non-destructive edit pipeline yet.
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:11.300]   But photos does.
[01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:14.100]   And for a lot of people, that's their primary way of getting
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:17.540]   to all sorts of pictures on iOS and OS 10.
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:18.980]   And I just couldn't be happier.
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:21.780]   It is-- I don't know if it's a complete rewrite.
[01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:23.940]   And I don't know if John Knack was specifically involved,
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:26.340]   but I feel like when he arrived there at Google from Adobe,
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:28.020]   magic things started to happen.
[01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:29.940]   Yeah, he's been really active that way.
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:33.060]   I'm sorry, Ren, you were about to say?
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:33.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:34.900]   I'm just going to say anything.
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:35.620]   OK.
[01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:38.580]   And I'm just going to say I'm contentment.
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:38.980]   Exactly.
[01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:39.460]   Basking.
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:41.300]   It's just an residual.
[01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:43.860]   As usual, basking in the Renee wisdom.
[01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:46.420]   But so long as we've got the camera swung around to your--
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:48.260]   Ren, what do you got for us this week?
[01:39:48.260 --> 01:39:48.740]   All right.
[01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:52.500]   Well, I've got a physical item and then a bonus iOS app.
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:53.460]   We'll start with the physical thing.
[01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:56.260]   So I've been carrying around a--
[01:39:56.260 --> 01:39:58.820]   I've looked for a new backpack at the beginning of the year
[01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:01.700]   because I was going to be doing a lot of traveling between CES
[01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:03.940]   and-- oh, and now I'm going to Yosemite.
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:08.180]   And I wanted a good tech backpack to carry all of my tech
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:12.100]   things as well as to just carry some miscellaneous.
[01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:14.660]   And a friend of mine was like, oh, you should try Osprey.
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:17.060]   I know they usually make hiking backpacks,
[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:20.100]   but they also make these really awesome tech backpacks.
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:22.340]   So this is the Osprey Pixel.
[01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:26.580]   And I've been testing it for about four months.
[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:27.540]   I got it the first week.
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:29.380]   It was January.
[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:34.180]   So this thing is amazing because it can be really, really slim
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:36.580]   or really, really big depending on whether you need it.
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:39.380]   It looks nice and it has a million pockets,
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:42.420]   which is what I love about backpacks.
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:43.780]   So I'll show you the side.
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:46.420]   I feel like the-- their actual video.
[01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:51.060]   So it has a side pocket that fits both a laptop
[01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:57.220]   and a super side pocket that will fit a 10-inch iPad.
[01:40:57.220 --> 01:41:00.900]   And all of that is easy access right on the side.
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:02.420]   So if you're going through a lot of airports,
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:04.820]   you don't have to open your bag and dig through all of your stuff
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:07.300]   for your laptop, which I love.
[01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:09.780]   I had never seen this on a backpack until I picked this up.
[01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:11.460]   And I know that lots of backpacks have it,
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:14.580]   but it was still one of those like, my mind is blown.
[01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:17.860]   And it has these like all of the zippers to expand
[01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:19.780]   or contract the backpack.
[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:25.140]   It has a top zipper here where you could put front things.
[01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:28.500]   I have like an iPhone cable just in case.
[01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:33.060]   And I think there's a battery pack in there as well on the bottom.
[01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:34.580]   I haven't even opened the bag yet.
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:39.540]   On the bottom, there's this little pouch,
[01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:43.220]   which will fit a DSLR with a 40 millimeter pancake lens in it.
[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:45.380]   And it's actually the perfect place to hide a DSLR
[01:41:45.380 --> 01:41:49.460]   because it's, again, easy access and it's padded.
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:55.060]   And then, you open up the backpack itself.
[01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:58.340]   There's another super pocket here
[01:41:58.340 --> 01:42:01.300]   where you could put like pens and I've got more cables.
[01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:10.100]   It comes with a cable organizizer and it has giant bag space
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:12.020]   for anything you might need.
[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:14.180]   And more pouches and more.
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:15.700]   And more and more and more pouches.
[01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:16.740]   And you know what?
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:18.340]   I never knew that this was important
[01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:20.020]   until I found it on this backpack.
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:22.100]   It has a handle on the inside.
[01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:24.740]   So if you have the bag open and it's on the floor,
[01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:27.300]   you can pick it up and dig through it
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:29.300]   while you're still holding it without having to be like,
[01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:31.300]   "Oh, where is that?
[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:36.420]   Where can I charge my phone or my computer?"
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:39.860]   It's also awesome that the lining is like a bright color.
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:42.420]   It's not black, so it must be easier to find things inside there too.
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:44.500]   Yeah, I really like it.
[01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:48.580]   So I think I only got it for I think $120.
[01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:51.860]   So it's not even super, super expensive for a nice backpack.
[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:53.620]   And it's made out of the same materials.
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:56.180]   That's a great herringbone, which again,
[01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:57.460]   I feel like it looks really classy.
[01:42:57.460 --> 01:43:00.340]   It doesn't look like your average geek backpack.
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:03.140]   And it does have that nice sort of neon interior.
[01:43:03.140 --> 01:43:05.860]   But it's also made with the same kind of like high quality
[01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:09.620]   construction materials that you'd find in a hiking backpack.
[01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:11.140]   So you don't have to worry about it ripping.
[01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:13.300]   And there are extra clips and snaps.
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:15.460]   If you're putting on something particularly heavy.
[01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:21.060]   And that top coverover that holds the main compartment
[01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:23.300]   and it can be expanded or contracted as necessary.
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:26.980]   So I've stuffed things up like I had a bedroll in there.
[01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:28.980]   I could theoretically go hiking with this backpack
[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:31.060]   and have tech stuff, which is pretty cool.
[01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:33.060]   I used it extensively when I was in Ireland,
[01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:35.220]   and I really, really liked it.
[01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:37.860]   So that's my hardware thing.
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:40.580]   My software thing is more of a quick shout out.
[01:43:42.180 --> 01:43:45.300]   So I forget who mentioned this game to me.
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:48.340]   I have become addicted to a Japanese cat game.
[01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:52.260]   Which I think Tiffany and Marco are meant
[01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:55.940]   are to blame for this because Tef was talking about it in Ireland.
[01:43:55.940 --> 01:43:57.620]   And then I just, I went for it.
[01:43:57.620 --> 01:44:00.100]   It's called, I think, Nico at Sume.
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:02.420]   The game is entirely in Japanese.
[01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:04.020]   So the first time I saw it, I'm like,
[01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:04.900]   this is insane.
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:06.980]   I don't understand what to do.
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:08.420]   But it is adorable.
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:10.900]   It's basically you put out, you put out things.
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:18.580]   You buy little food and cardboard boxes and other random things.
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:21.700]   And then little tiny cats come to visit you from,
[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:23.780]   who knows, neighboring environments.
[01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:26.500]   And they come and they play with your toys.
[01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:29.220]   And then they leave you sardines as gratitude.
[01:44:29.220 --> 01:44:31.380]   And it's like, it's this little, you know,
[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:32.420]   it's set it and forget it.
[01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:35.140]   You just go back every so often and you put down little things.
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:37.860]   But all of the cat animations are so cute.
[01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:39.700]   There's like one of the cats is playing with the ball,
[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:41.700]   and it just teetles back and forth.
[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:43.700]   They're just, they're really well designed.
[01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:46.340]   It's a really well designed, very adorable little game.
[01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:48.820]   It's total fluff.
[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:51.780]   Like it's totally something that I'm just enjoying.
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:54.420]   But it gives me the same kind of like weird glee
[01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:57.780]   of actual pet ownership without the stress of like a Tamagotchi
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:44:59.060]   or like a hatch pet.
[01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:01.940]   Or it's like, I have to check this every five seconds
[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:03.140]   where the pet will die.
[01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:06.020]   With this one, it's like, the pets just wander in and out.
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:06.980]   They're not yours.
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:08.500]   You can take pictures of them.
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:09.860]   Like a real cat.
[01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:10.660]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:13.380]   The cat is not at your beck and call.
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:14.900]   It is not there to amuse you.
[01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:16.740]   It just happens to enjoy itself.
[01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:18.900]   And you can occasionally peek in on its delight.
[01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:23.300]   So it's my perfect like happy time app.
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:25.220]   So I'm just, I'm going to recommend that to everybody.
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:27.700]   I'm so sorry in advance because it is kind of addicting.
[01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:29.540]   There are in-app purchases,
[01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:32.100]   but you can totally get away with not doing them at all.
[01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:35.540]   It's just, again, just playing with adorable cats.
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:38.180]   That's not a bad thing at all.
[01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:38.980]   Do we have Alex back?
[01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:41.780]   No, we didn't.
[01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:42.260]   No, no, no.
[01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:43.140]   He's dropped.
[01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:44.180]   He's not coming back.
[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:45.380]   Although I will tell you,
[01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:50.420]   just to kind of round up his review of the Rico Theta Theta.
[01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:51.380]   It's 300 bucks.
[01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:53.380]   Okay, that's not too bad.
[01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:53.940]   Yeah.
[01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:56.580]   And for collecting stuff that you can't collect otherwise,
[01:45:56.580 --> 01:46:04.580]   I had a 160-something degree lens for like my Nikon Coolpix 990.
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:08.420]   And I was showing off my parents' house.
[01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:11.060]   Oh, here's how well this camera works.
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:12.420]   And now, oh my god, look at you.
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:15.220]   They never, my parents had never seen a digital camera before.
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:17.540]   And then like only two or three years ago,
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:20.660]   I came across those stupid pictures I took just to show it off.
[01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:24.500]   Like, oh, I have 360 degree views of my mom and dad's living room.
[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:28.580]   Oh, I have a 360 degrees views of the kitchen.
[01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:32.020]   And there's a time when you're going to be an older fool.
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:34.500]   And like, you know, your parents are going to be gone
[01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:36.660]   and your parents' house is going to be sold or events.
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:37.940]   They're going to be long, long gone.
[01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:40.020]   And maybe like, oh, look, it's just like being very good.
[01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:40.740]   Isn't this lovely?
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:41.060]   I don't know.
[01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:42.820]   I don't have to decide where to point the camera.
[01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:44.740]   So that's pretty, that's pretty cool.
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:47.860]   My pick is a free piece of software that I discovered last week.
[01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:51.940]   If a lot of us are using, if that, if this, then that,
[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:55.700]   that really cool like web app that does like internet rules,
[01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:58.020]   where you just set up a recipe like every time,
[01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:01.780]   if the RSS feed for this podcast is updated,
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:05.860]   take the web, take the episode of that web of that podcast
[01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:09.220]   and copy it into my Dropbox folder inside this folder.
[01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:11.780]   And it's just, you can basically, it's just,
[01:47:11.780 --> 01:47:13.540]   what is the thing you want to trigger an action?
[01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:15.060]   And then what action do you want it to do
[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:16.260]   as a result of that trigger?
[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:19.220]   And you can almost like, it's almost like you get to write apps yourself,
[01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:22.020]   even though all you're doing is connecting an action to a consequence.
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:28.340]   They have released a camera app for both iOS and for, and for Android.
[01:47:28.340 --> 01:47:30.740]   And it is the simplest thing ever.
[01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:32.500]   It is, I'll hold it up like that.
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:35.700]   It is a recipe app where it takes pictures,
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:38.500]   but then you get basically get to tell it what you'd like,
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:39.860]   hey, I could actually frame this up.
[01:47:39.860 --> 01:47:40.340]   There you go.
[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:43.540]   Almost like, almost like being there.
[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:46.260]   So, so you can actually set it up so that, for instance,
[01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:50.100]   this is an Evernote recipe that I've set up,
[01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:51.700]   so that every time I take this picture,
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:55.060]   like if I, if I've just had a business dinner or something,
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:57.540]   or something, I'll have to do a switch to this camera
[01:47:57.540 --> 01:47:59.940]   and then click the button, it will take a picture.
[01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:03.700]   And then that picture I take of the receipt will then go into Evernote
[01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:06.740]   inside the notebook that I keep receipts in.
[01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:09.060]   And you can define like multiple cameras.
[01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:11.140]   So, for instance, here's one that you take a picture,
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:12.980]   it will automatically just be tweeted.
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:15.300]   Here's another one where whatever photo I'll,
[01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:16.900]   I will be emailed to myself.
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:21.700]   You can do things like if you're often sending pictures to your parents,
[01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:24.580]   your boyfriend, your girlfriend, your, your kids or something like that.
[01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:26.420]   You can basically now define a camera that is,
[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:28.740]   this is the camera that whenever I take, press this button,
[01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:31.300]   whatever picture gets taken will be shared with my folks.
[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:35.380]   And there's a very, very wide recipe library available.
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:38.100]   These are obvious, these are simple and obvious ones.
[01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:41.380]   But if you look on tap on that recipe box right there,
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:46.260]   you can start to either use recipes that other people have created for you,
[01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:48.820]   or you can start creating ones of your own.
[01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:52.340]   For instance, you can do things like take a picture of something
[01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:57.220]   and then your hue lights, light bulbs will change color to match the,
[01:48:57.220 --> 01:48:59.140]   the color of whatever it is you just took a picture of.
[01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:02.900]   And it's, it's one of my favorite kinds of apps in that.
[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:05.940]   It's a tool that you use to create new tools.
[01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:08.980]   And because I'm not even a competent SWIFT programmer,
[01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:14.340]   it, I would love to have certain apps that do really tricky things that only I would
[01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:17.780]   appreciate, but I'm not going to spend a few days or a few weeks writing that.
[01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:20.660]   But when you have a tool like this, if it involves taking a,
[01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:22.980]   taking a picture, then doing something with that picture,
[01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:24.980]   it is super quick, super easy.
[01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:32.740]   And you start, it does pass my, my chainsaw test where after you use it for the task for
[01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:36.980]   which you downloaded it, do you start walking around the house seeing what else you can do with
[01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:37.460]   it?
[01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:38.020]   Yes, you do.
[01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:42.740]   That's how you wind up with a old sofa that you've been, oh, you've been meaning to take
[01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:46.980]   out of the guest bedroom and now you can carry it home in a shopping basket,
[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:49.940]   because you've cut it up with the brand new chainsaw that you were having so much fun with.
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:52.420]   That's it for Mac Break this week.
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:55.300]   I'm afraid that Alex Lindsey is gone, but he's in Las Vegas.
[01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:59.860]   He's gone to a better place, I'm sure, a mid to high price hotel in Las Vegas.
[01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:04.660]   We also have, we also have the SWEAK, Renee Ritchie from Imore.
[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:07.940]   What else is going on this week and Imore that we should know about?
[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:10.100]   Oh, I think it's recovery now, Andy.
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:12.100]   We've got some watch stuff.
[01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:12.740]   We're going to wrap it up.
[01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:13.780]   You're not allowed to recover.
[01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:16.100]   You're a trusted news resource, Renee.
[01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:17.540]   We're wrapping up for the Apple Watch, Andy.
[01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:18.660]   That's what we'll do next.
[01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:20.100]   Exactly.
[01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:26.180]   And Serenity, make sure that everybody checks out the stuff you wrote about photos, because
[01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:29.780]   it really, for me personally, again, I knew that it was going to be waiting for me when I
[01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:33.460]   came back and I spent Friday and Saturday saying, "Oh, that's good.
[01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:35.060]   Oh, okay, so I know how to do that."
[01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:36.580]   What else is going on?
[01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:40.180]   Well, we're kind of on photos.
[01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:44.020]   We're also continuing our Apple Watch ramp up coverage.
[01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:48.740]   I just posted a thing I think I mentioned earlier on my try on experience,
[01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:52.180]   including matching the sport with different bands, including the Milanese Loop.
[01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:58.180]   I'm going to write later on why I'm choosing a 38 millimeter over a 42 millimeter watch.
[01:50:58.180 --> 01:51:02.180]   I know a lot of people are having a discussion who haven't been able to try it on yet.
[01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:03.380]   Well, do I need a small one?
[01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:04.260]   Do I need the big one?
[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:05.220]   What's going on?
[01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:07.220]   We've got a buyer's guide up there.
[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:08.900]   All kinds of other fun things.
[01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:14.180]   I'm going to be continuing to write photos, how tos, because even after the 55 plus how tos,
[01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:18.020]   we wrote for Imore, people are coming in with questions and I'm like, "Oh, yeah, that's actually
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:20.980]   a great point." Let me explain how to do that.
[01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:25.380]   For instead of trying to fit it into 140 characters, let's make this an actual post.
[01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:28.740]   So a lot of photos, triage, some Apple Watch stuff.
[01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:31.140]   I'll probably bump.
[01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:35.620]   I did a guide on playing Hearthstone that just hit on the iPhone right now.
[01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:40.100]   And I know that's a secret guilty pleasure for me and quite a few other people.
[01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:44.500]   So if you're interested in that, I'm sure you can find that on iMore.com.
[01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:46.340]   Just all of the things, all of the things.
[01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:49.940]   Awesome, awesome, awesome Serenity.
[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:53.860]   And I and Jason Snell and Jim Dallerimple and a whole bunch of legitimately cool people
[01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:57.380]   are going to be at the Yosemite Cocoa Conference next week.
[01:51:57.380 --> 01:51:59.380]   I will be there with more photo equipment.
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:03.620]   I'm going to have to go through every single closet to get every single camera that I can
[01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:04.020]   to see that.
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:07.940]   I'm going to be finishing up my MacBook Pro review soon.
[01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:09.700]   I've got two or three other things in the hopper.
[01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:13.220]   I've got another Apple Watch piece coming in.
[01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:18.660]   I'm trying to be a little bit more discreet about Apple Watch because it's like you start.
[01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:22.260]   It's I think I have nine things to say about it and I've already said seven of them.
[01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:26.820]   So I got to make sure that the remaining two I really put it out there when I create
[01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:28.580]   throughout last with Grace Impact.
[01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:30.820]   Leo Laport will be back with us next week.
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:35.060]   Until then, thank you so much for watching this week and get back to work.
[01:52:35.060 --> 01:52:36.340]   Brick time is over.
[01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:38.180]   Gold bricks.
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:40.340]   You're time to lean.
[01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:41.380]   You got time to claim.
[01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:43.940]   I think.
[01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:46.740]   Didn't realize I was paying you to Facebook.
[01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:53.540]   Hope you're doing a good job of it and I'm giving you 14 bucks an hour to do it.
[01:52:53.540 --> 01:53:01.060]   [Music]
