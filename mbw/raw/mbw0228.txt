[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.840]   I think I just did--
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.600]   This is not the show you're looking for.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.680]   Not the show you're looking for.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.400]   I think he just did the droid, the Aligives.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.000]   This is not the podcast you were looking for.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.600]   There he is, Andy and Aco all the way from Boston.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.360]   Were you survived Snowpocalypse?
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.680]   Snowpocalypse Bazar to 2010/2011, yes.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.240]   We are.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.600]   But you started the reflective talk.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.160]   You're in our--
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.120]   He has the Mylar still hanging in the porch there
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.440]   to protect the kids.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.160]   The giant day ball is being rather severe.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.720]   Thank you for being here, Andy and Aco.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.560]   Despite the weather, Andy is at the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.280]   It's rare that one could say the weather is better in Chicago.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.280]   He's also--
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.280]   Exactly.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.280]   Good for the water slide.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.280]   It's a wrap up in the East Loop.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.160]   Also the editor in chief of his own website, which seems fair,
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.440]   the celestial ways to bandwidth.

[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.080]   Also with us, my friends, the fabulous Alex Lindsey
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.080]   from the Pixelcore.com for that Guild of Multimedia
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.880]   Artist, Pixelcore.tv for the podcast.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.920]   And we also are plugging his blog today, border sack
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920]   with SAC.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.960]   This is putting pressure on me to actually write.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.960]   That's why.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.200]   So border sack-- you'll see old stuff there that hasn't been
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.920]   updated for a while.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.080]   And I'm committed this year of writing for the blog
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.320]   at least once a week.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.160]   And it'll start this week with C.E.S.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.920]   I'm going to put videos up.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.920]   That's what I'm most interested in.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.000]   So you're going to use your iPhone?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.680]   So I have this thing.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.160]   I put a little headset in.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.560]   And then I walk around shows.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.920]   This is how I take notes for when
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.480]   we're going to do stuff for Gear Media Tech or Mac Break.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.800]   And I just literally shoot these videos.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.200]   And I talk about what the object is.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.320]   And that's notes for my producers, notes for me.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.640]   And I was showing someone at Pixelcore.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.640]   And they were like, you really should just post those.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.720]   And so I'm going to.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.880]   I'm going to try it at C.E.S.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.000]   But I don't want to mess up.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.280]   I don't want to do them necessarily at Pixelcore.com.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.840]   So I'm going to just put them on my own blog.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.000]   So you can check it out.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.840]   I have.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.440]   And I might use that.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.920]   When the hourly came, that little microphone
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.000]   that you plug in to the iPhone.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.760]   And it's a little bit better, a little more directional.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.360]   I have a--
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.760]   Well, I'm using a headset because I don't--
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.880]   You don't want to capture--
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.240]   And you just keep it in your front pocket.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.920]   I'm using a little countryman.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.360]   How do you get that into the iPhone?
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.120]   So I have an interface for it for my iPhone
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.480]   that I can get XLR in.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.800]   What do you have?
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.160]   A beach tech?
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.880]   It's actually a-- there's a company--
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.560]   Oh, no, I can't think of the name of it.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.320]   They make a-- I think it's called Sense 6,
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.080]   but I'll check it out.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.880]   But they make a sound analyzation software for the iPhone.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.680]   And what they do is it's got a quarter-inch balance jack
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.200]   in.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.880]   It's so that you can sample sound,
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.800]   but it turns out it gives you a perfectly clean--
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.720]   Oh, sure it should.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.360]   It should be very good.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.720]   Cable.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.440]   And so it's a little complicated because you have to run--
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.560]   the countryman isn't powered.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.840]   So I run that into a little powered box,
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.960]   and then that runs out of there.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.240]   And then I run it into either wireless,
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.160]   or I can run it into the--
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.200]   anyway, that's probably more information than you needed.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.120]   But it's--
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.160]   This is crazy.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.880]   So-- and you shoot the video on the iPhone, though.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.200]   You don't have to--
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.640]   But I shoot the video on the iPhone all handheld.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.320]   And I ordered an alley, and it hasn't shown up.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.280]   And I'm probably not going to have it for the show.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.800]   I have the alley for the three.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.360]   You want to borrow my alley?
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.320]   But I have the-- I need it for--
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.120]   You have a four?
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.760]   Do they make an alley for the four?
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.640]   That's the one I ordered.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.320]   See, I have the 3GS alley.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.800]   I could use it with the 3GS.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.360]   I want to shoot it.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.040]   It's pretty close.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.360]   If you've got a case that--
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.680]   You know, anything fits into anything else
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.680]   with enough velocity.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.040]   So--
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.120]   That's a velocity.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.080]   Do you use a mallet?
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.760]   No problem, dude.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.840]   It's just a lot of--
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.640]   We should mention the alleys, as long as we're giving them
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.840]   a plug, this is a O-W-L-E and the new boo-bo.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.600]   Now, have you seen the alley with the lens adapter?
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.120]   That's what I'm--
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.320]   I have the lens adapter.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.160]   No, no, no, no, the big lens adapter.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.080]   What's the big lens?
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.880]   There's a company that makes--
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.040]   I can't figure out-- it was on--
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.080]   If you do a search for alley and then 35 millimeter lens--
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.880]   35mm lens adapter, you can actually
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.920]   get this adapter that will attach to the alley.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.960]   And then you can put your 35 millimeter lens on it
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.240]   and get the short depth of field.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.000]   It gives you the 35 millimeter--
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.200]   Oh, wow.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.680]   And it looks--
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.360]   It looks great.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.280]   And I was almost going to get it for CES.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.600]   And I was like, I am getting--
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.120]   I'm going to spend so much time dealing with this.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.040]   I'm not going to actually shoot any videos.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.520]   When you go to CES, you see people--
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.280]   and this is actually when I first saw the alley.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.680]   It was last year at CES, people walking around with tripods
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.560]   and fancy gear and lenses.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.000]   And they have a flip cam attached or an iPhone attached.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.160]   It's like, well, dude--
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160]   But there's an example on YouTube.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.760]   You think that's sufficient?
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.640]   The alley?
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.140]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.800]   I mean, an iPhone.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.600]   No, the iPhone.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.400]   Oh, well, for the covers that I'm doing it.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   But I don't--
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.840]   No, we're going to shoot ours on a 5D.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.000]   Yeah, that's what we're doing.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.400]   The selling point is that you finish the video,
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.640]   you tap a button, and it's up and post it.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.880]   You don't have to dump it to a laptop and do any sort of editing.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.640]   When you got Wi-Fi connection.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.560]   If you can get--
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.160]   No, it won't go up over 3G because AT&T sucks.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.880]   Yeah, but for a lot of people, they're
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.600]   so efficient at doing those 43 second clips that aren't just--
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.640]   Hi, this is Todd, Super Tech Dude Blog, video YouTube.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.120]   It's more like, hello, this is Chad Ashley reporting live in CS4.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.480]   I've got an exclusive advanced look of the new Motorola tablet.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.360]   It's an iPad killer?
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.680]   Well, it's the next time.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.800]   What is the next time on the upload?
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.360]   I don't remember.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.200]   I think it's something less than a minute and a half.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.920]   Oh, that's easy.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.960]   By the way, it's called the--
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.960]   Mine are all like 50 seconds long.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.400]   The N Cinema.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.280]   Oh, yeah, that's it.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.880]   E-N.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.880]   Look at this.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.440]   Cinema.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.800]   And I'll show you a little--
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.520]   You want to see a little video, 720p example
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.720]   of what you can get with the N Cinema.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.440]   This is iPhone 4 HD video shot using an SLR lens
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.760]   featuring the Ali Bubo--
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.760]   great name-- and the N Cinema.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.400]   Oh, look at that.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.200]   They're rack and focus.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.040]   Because you can't.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.760]   Because you can.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.480]   Why not?
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.880]   It's like that guy here fraternity
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.880]   who would put the moves on anything.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.240]   There are people like, there must be a way
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.600]   I could get better optics on this.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.120]   I don't care if it's a 320 by 240 Casio.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.560]   Now, here's the thing you'll notice.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.080]   See on the outside edges?
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.120]   See how there's this weird grain there?
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.720]   That's because it doesn't have a spinning--
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.000]   like the red rocks and the lettuce and everything else
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.320]   have spinning wheels.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.800]   Is it that CMOS problem?
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.120]   No, no, it's not a CMOS problem.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.520]   It's the function that you're basically
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.640]   projecting onto a piece of glass.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.400]   And if the glass isn't moving, you'll
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.840]   end up with a kind of a static.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.120]   And if that doesn't bother you, which doesn't bother me,
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.240]   if it doesn't bother you, like I wouldn't use it for commercial--
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.440]   Is it a defect in the glass that we're seeing?
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.600]   No, it's the function.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.640]   So what a lot of these lens adapters do
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.080]   is they spin glass or they vibrate it
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.280]   so that you don't end up with a constant--
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.280]   Fixed artifact.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.680]   A fixed artifact.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.960]   You end up with grain that looks like film.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.280]   And so what you end up with sometimes is you see that grain
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.720]   and that's the fixed artifact.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.680]   But this one doesn't do that.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.840]   Makes it a lot less expensive and much smaller
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.760]   than the other option.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.920]   It is kind of amazing that they're shooting this on an iPhone
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.840]   for, I mean--
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.200]   Look at that.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.760]   It's ridiculous to attach a $1,000
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.920]   Canon EF 50 millimeter 1.8.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.280]   Actually, that's not a $1,000 lens.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.560]   That's not a very expensive lens.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.440]   And the-- anyway, I've been--
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.160]   I'm afraid--
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.240]   But they could put a very expensive lens on it.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.560]   But you can also put it on things.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.080]   There's this company that's called--
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.360]   I want to say Rincon.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.800]   Is it Rincon?
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.360]   That has-- they make manual-only lenses.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.960]   85 millimeter manual lens, a 1.4 for like $300.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.200]   And you could throw something like that on it.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.800]   Because you don't put the electronics into it,
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.440]   it's not so hard to go back a little bit.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.840]   And since you're not going to use the electronics,
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.000]   because you don't have autofocus, then it works.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.920]   But because look what they--
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.160]   Look at the fancy tripod.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.760]   What the alley gives you though is that it gives you mounts.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.400]   So you've got--
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:46.900]   Right.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.600]   --order-inch mounts everywhere.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.120]   So it's easier to mount your iPhone as well.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.000]   And then you've got it all set up for the lens.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.760]   And it's totally silly.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.360]   And that's why we like it.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.680]   Let's talk about CES.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.360]   You mentioned the V word.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.360]   Let's talk about that to begin with.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.000]   Rumor-- you know, it's interesting.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.800]   Verizon is giving a keynote at CES.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.760]   Thursday morning at 30 AM.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.800]   And some people are saying that Verizon will announce
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.840]   the Verizon iPhone.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.200]   I'm going to go-- I would not normally go to that keynote.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   I'm going to go.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.120]   I'm going to have a camera stationed outside in case.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.000]   And we will break in.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.440]   We'll do breaking news Thursday morning.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.360]   Because if Verizon announces an iPhone, then it's huge.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.160]   That's the biggest story.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:28.360]   It's--
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.480]   Doesn't it seem very unlikely though?
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.960]   Apple does not generally-- unless Apple's
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.680]   going to make absolutely no changes to the iPhone,
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.240]   and they just want to let Verizon have their thing,
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.920]   that would be the only reason like Apple wants to stay
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.400]   in the background and just say, OK, it's available now.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.160]   That might be the only reason that they would do it.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.120]   It's not a typical way to announce something.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.720]   No, not for Apple.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.720]   Well, but that's exactly why they would do it that way.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.600]   Because there's certainly not going to create a brand new iPhone
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.360]   just for Verizon.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.960]   It's going to be-- it's the exact same iPhone 4
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.560]   if you have the iPhone 4 for 18.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.080]   You know exactly what it's about.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.680]   We're-- let Verizon handle all the comments,
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.720]   all the questions about.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.600]   So you're telling consumers that they will definitely
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.200]   get a better experience on your network than on AT&T?
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.040]   I see.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.920]   There's definitely-- if that happens,
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.760]   I'm guessing there's going to be a good Apple presence there.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.200]   But I don't think--
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.280]   I don't know one way or another whether that's
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.960]   going to be the date of the announcement.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.520]   But I could definitely see Apple saying,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:23.880]   you know what?
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.440]   They get to do this on their own.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.520]   They don't have to have a full of M4.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.680]   This is actually interesting.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.320]   And you don't think that the Verizon iPhone will be an iPhone 5.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.680]   It'll be a CDMA iPhone 4.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.120]   I think that if they were to do it,
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.360]   they're either going to wait for the iPhone 5 and say,
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.520]   oh, and by the way, now it's designed from the ground up
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.160]   to be dual-- to be dual band.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.080]   We don't care about what car it goes on.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.680]   Or it's just going to simply be-- and of course,
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.000]   we've listened to consumers.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.040]   The demand is so high that we can't really
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.240]   limit it to one caror anymore.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.240]   And so therefore, we have allowed Verizon
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.200]   to have their own CDMA version as the exact same thing,
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.040]   except for a different radio build into it.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.640]   So I could believe it's going to be announced this week.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.160]   I can believe that there's going to be announced
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.040]   that some multiple announcement Apple special event
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.240]   in San Francisco in February.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.320]   Or I could believe that it's going to wait until the iPhone 5
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.400]   and simply say, oh, and by the way, intrinsically,
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.320]   this always has multiple radios in it
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.640]   so that it will work on any carrier.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.320]   It's kind of fun to watch Bloomberg and others jump up
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:19.680]   and down.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.200]   Bloomberg's been saying for a week,
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.960]   there'll be an announcement--
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.120]   And nothing happened.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:25.640]   Nothing.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.280]   Apple said nothing.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.600]   Will Apple try to deflate CES by--
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.560]   Not that they ever done that before.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.760]   Well, they didn't have to last year.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.640]   All they had to do was let the rumors fly
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.160]   that there was going to be an iPad announcement in January.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.160]   They didn't confirm it.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.240]   They didn't even send out an invite.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.880]   But that's all everybody talked about at CES.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.600]   And that's all anybody showed was that we, in fact,
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.240]   they even call them slates at the time.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.000]   Because everybody-- the rumor was it was going to be the eye slate.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.640]   They didn't have to.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.400]   Now, in previous years, they have.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.120]   I mean, they announced the iPhone in the middle of CES
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.760]   not being there.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.440]   We thought if Apple was going to do an announcement,
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.920]   they'd do it today or tomorrow before CES begins.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.480]   But no invites have gone out.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.920]   But it would be a huge shadow if on Thursday,
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   they announced the Verizon one.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.040]   That's got to scare--
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.680]   For all the smartphone-- because the problem
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.800]   is that there's so many people--
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.800]   if they thought they were going to catch up to the iPhone,
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.360]   I mean, they are starting to, I think,
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.800]   saturate the people willing to use AT&T market.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.600]   And no, but here's--
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.680]   No, they've clearly-- well, I shouldn't say that.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.240]   Because numbers are starting to come out.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.400]   At least guesses are starting to come out about the holiday
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.600]   quarter, one analyst sent shoppers into 50 different Apple
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.520]   stores and came back to report that's very strong.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.360]   iPhone sales, very strong--
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.200]   My dad bought one.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.520]   iPad sales, very strong Mac sales even.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.960]   So I can't remember the name of the analyst.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.920]   I'll find it.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.120]   And it's a big company.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.160]   It was Goldman Sachs or something.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.080]   We're predicting very big quarter for Apple.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.080]   And yes, the iPhone is still the best-selling smartphone,
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.200]   even according to the Nielsen.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.600]   I have to say, I probably would not jump if they had the Verizon.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.720]   You would not.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.200]   Andy, would you jump?
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.480]   Probably not, because I've been with AT&T for--
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.400]   I've been with AT&T so long that I signed up with AT&T
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.400]   the first time they were AT&T.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.560]   I've never had any problems with them.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.800]   But I would have to have a really good reason to jump.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.800]   Like, if they offered me a really sweet package deal
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.000]   between the MIFI and the iPhone, then if you could reduce my bill
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.520]   by at least $15 a month, then I'd really think about it.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.480]   Unlimited data on an iPad, and I'd jump in a heartbeat for that.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.480]   Because I didn't--
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.480]   I was like--
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.960]   That's good around here.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.800]   Because as it is, I've unlimited data on my iPhone and my iPad.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.800]   And good.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.560]   Golly Miss Molly, what you've got to do
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.800]   to get to break me out of that.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.280]   So you need the National Guard to get me out of that deal.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.520]   Do you mean if I have an AT&T iPhone that I've had
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.800]   since the first iPhone came out and I have the data deal?
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.600]   I'm getting unlimited data.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.800]   I'm grandfathered into unlimited data.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.000]   You should be unless you changed.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.160]   There's a couple ways you could have changed your contract
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.160]   that would have caused it.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.720]   But if you just kept on upgrading, you should have unlimited data.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.800]   And if I were to buy an iPhone with a brand new account today,
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.800]   I would not get that.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.000]   I don't think that they are now unlimited.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Exactly.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   What do you get?
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Like 500.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   I think you're two gigs.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.200]   Yeah, I think you're--
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.000]   Yeah, right exactly.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   They dropped the price of the monthly plan,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.600]   but now you're capped it too.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.800]   And there's an extra surcharge for every X unit above that.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:35.000]   And it's actually cheaper.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.600]   You know, the people for people-- I have a MIFI and an iPad.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.120]   It's actually cheaper to go--
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.200]   if you're going to upload or download 10 gigabytes,
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.880]   it's cheaper to do it on your iPad than it on your MIFI.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.600]   Because you're paying $10 a gig or $50 a gig.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.600]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.600]   That's valuable to know.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.600]   Yeah, so if you go over it, it's actually not that bad to go over it
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.000]   on the unlimited plan on the iPad.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   I mean, it's $10 a gig.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.200]   But on the Verizon, and I've done it, it's $50 a gig.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:08.800]   And if you upload 12 gigs to your-- something by accident,
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.000]   it will cost you $600.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   So here's the question.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.800]   You guys may actually be doing the right thing.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.000]   My kids-- my actually-- my kids said this,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.200]   because both kids have iPhone 4s on AT&T.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.200]   And I was saying, well, maybe we should wait till Verizon.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.400]   And-- but I said-- but then maybe everybody
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.200]   will move to Verizon.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.700]   And Henry said, which is why I'm staying with AT&T?
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.400]   Because the bandwidth-- do you think that'll happen?
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.800]   Well, the reason that I'm not going to switch
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.100]   is because I think that-- I do think that--
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.500]   I talked to someone that works in the engineering field,
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.700]   not specifically with AT&T.
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.300]   And he said that the numbers he saw
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.700]   was that an iPhone user is worth eight smartphone users.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:49.000]   And he said something crazy, like 30 regular phone users.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.800]   And he said that AT&T has been doing everything they can
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.800]   to build up capacity.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.800]   The biggest problem with San Francisco and New York
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.200]   is actually the permits to put up transmitters.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.900]   And it takes years to do that.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:05.800]   And so the thing is that I think AT&T has done a lot.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.000]   And it's-- it has been under this incredible weight
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   of the iPhone users.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.400]   And it's built up these huge muscles.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.400]   I may not look like it on the outside.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:16.900]   But I think--
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.300]   But if you just lift a little bit of the weight off--
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.340]   Well, not only that, I don't think you'll
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.100]   lift that much off.
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.700]   But I think that if Verizon gets 10 million new iPhone users,
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.300]   they're going to--
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.300]   They're going to look as bad.
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.000]   They're going to look as bad or worse than AT&T.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.600]   They're going to look like AT&T when it began,
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.500]   which is that their network will be saturated.
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.100]   The CDMA phone will not be able to--
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.300]   I think the function of CDMA, you won't be able to check it,
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.060]   talk on the phone and surf the web, not until you get 4G,
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:40.900]   I think.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.700]   Now, we've heard rumors that Verizon was going
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.700]   to figure out a way around that--
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.460]   even pre LTE, because they had some sort of trick up
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.700]   their sleeve with CDMA.
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.700]   Haven't seen that yet.
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.700]   I haven't seen it.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.700]   Just rumors.
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.100]   So, well, I'll be at the Verizon event.
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.700]   We can't stream the keynote's live, but I'll be there,
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:00.900]   and I will run out the door.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.300]   I can't wait.
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.500]   I don't know, actually, I didn't ask.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.500]   I just assumed--
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.500]   Also, I could just bring--
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.100]   You've done it before.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.100]   It's not like you've ever followed that before.
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.700]   You've never followed that before with me.
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.500]   You could Skype from your iPhone.
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.000]   OK.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:15.500]   Skype?
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.000]   FaceTime.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   FaceTime.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.400]   Who's that fan of the 10th-froering that enormous cowboy hat
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.000]   with the whole tech in the middle of it?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Why has he got an alley on his head?
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.200]   And holding the big LED light at our CDO.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.600]   You know, I thought when I saw that face--
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.400]   when I saw the Skype that now works on the--
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   You're going to get to that.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   That's a story.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   Sorry.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.400]   I just thought of you.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:33.900]   I thought--
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:34.400]   I thought--
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.900]   Leo would not have been married for this.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.900]   Oh, he wouldn't have been--
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.600]   he wouldn't have never gotten the Steve Stinkine.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.200]   Because I'd be holding up a phone instead.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.000]   It's called the SSE, Steve Stinkine.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Steve Stinkine.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Steve Stinkine.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.080]   What else-- yes, we certainly will see a lot of people trying
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.280]   to kill the iPad.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.200]   Just as for years they tried to kill the iPhone.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.760]   Is it going to be faster this time around?
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:56.760]   Because we've seen--
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.360]   iOS has been around longer.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.800]   We've-- companies are a little bit
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.640]   redier to take on the iPad than they were to take on the iPhone.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.960]   I think that the main challenge for companies
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.160]   competing with Apple is they oftentimes
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.040]   don't have a very good grip of--
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:11.560]   Why?
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.560]   -- why Apple succeeds?
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.520]   They mistake features for functionality.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.960]   And that is the thing that Apple, I think,
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.760]   does extremely well is--
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.560]   yeah, sure, you can have a bunch of extra ports,
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.920]   and you can have a bunch of other things you can do with it.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.560]   But oftentimes that comes at a cost to functionality.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.440]   You would think by now people would have figured out
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.360]   what is the secret sauce Apple has,
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.760]   but they seem to still be baffling by it.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.240]   I think it's a theory.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.640]   They have multiple problems.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.240]   Among them is that Google still hasn't really
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.040]   firmed up their first tablet operating system.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.760]   So everything we've seen up to now
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.480]   has been either pre-beta or something
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.080]   was not designed to run on tablets to begin with.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.560]   You've got a lot of hardware problems
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.800]   that developers are still dealing with.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.840]   But mostly they really have lost the--
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.760]   if there's one thing that all these tablet manufacturers or most
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.400]   of them have forgotten, it's that even Apple did not release
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.720]   the iPad in a vacuum, that they made sure
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.840]   that we will release our own really good word processor for it.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.680]   We will release our own really good keynote program for it.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.520]   And we will develop every program that we think
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.960]   is really critical to the success and adoption of the iPad.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.040]   We'll let developers do their own stuff,
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.280]   but we're going to make sure that day one out the door,
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.640]   there are apps that have been built specifically for this.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.600]   And we're not just going to let someone--
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.040]   we're not going to just license an iPhone app that will just
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.800]   sort of expand its dimensions to fit the new dimensions
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.120]   of the screen.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.880]   That's a problem I've been seeing in so many of these tablets
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.360]   where you could see the potential of what
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.080]   could be done with this hardware.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.520]   But they're just saying, well, we're
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.200]   just going to go-- we're just going to go with Docs to go.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.120]   And we're going to let it just simply again expand
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.880]   to fit the margins of the larger tablet.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.280]   It's going to look like hell.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.600]   It's going to look like a big-- it really
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.520]   is going to look like a big Android phone, even though we're
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.080]   really not costing them that much money considering
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.200]   the amount of money they've already
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.920]   put into the development of this hardware.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.400]   They have to build it with a complete package.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.520]   So anyone who doesn't do that is not going to succeed.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.240]   And the Apple app set the pace.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.120]   I mean, I think that that's sometimes not a good pace.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.280]   But they set the pace of this is the way we think that the iPad--
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.760]   this is the way we designed it to work.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.960]   And I think that that helps inform the developers
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.680]   as to where they could or should take the direction.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.480]   Yeah, again, the difference between curation and Wild,
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.280]   Wild West, there are advantages to both.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.080]   This is going to be a good test of whether or not
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.280]   you really need to have a development program with a strong
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.400]   hand on it to say, no, this is garbage.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.200]   We're not going to let you sell this to our customers
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.520]   versus whatever you guys want to do.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.720]   Please be innovative.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.080]   Please, whatever your strategy is, it's our strategy
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.040]   and we'll support you.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.000]   This is going to be the test case between those two
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.240]   philosophies.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.640]   Motorola will have, I think, its tablet based on--
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.760]   you were talking about the--
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.280]   Hi.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.560]   --hike home, the next version of the Google OS.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.560]   And the rumor is that Motorola's tablet, which they've been
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.960]   talking about, will be out.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.240]   Visio's going to have Android tablets.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.480]   I don't know how many will be based on Honeycomb.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.640]   But the other rumor is that Honeycomb will require dual
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.280]   processors.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.240]   It'll have-- it'll be ARM 9 minimum.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.120]   It's going to be--
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.200]   But it'll be really cool.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.400]   Well, that's an issue because no phones currently support it.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.440]   The only platform that does it think is the Tegra.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.200]   And I don't know.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.160]   I think there are some phones-- in fact, we'll see phones
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.320]   at CES using the AMD Tegra platform.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.040]   But isn't this a lot of hardware?
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.440]   Isn't this a whole--
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.360]   it's a lot of power sucking hardware.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.000]   When you have multiple cores and a mobile device,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.800]   you can't just simply put that out in the press release
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.360]   and expect all the ewoks to dance and sing.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.760]   You have to explain-- oh, and by the way,
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.160]   and here's how we're going to get more than two hours and 20
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.080]   minutes of battery life on a multi-core processor
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.280]   and a mobile platform.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.320]   Although the Tegra Ted was that I saw last year
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.840]   that they built like three of just to show off at CES
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:48.720]   and then suddenly vanished just soon
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.080]   after the $500 iPad was announced,
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.640]   they were pretty sprightly.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.680]   The battery life seemed to be from people
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.480]   who had them for more than 30 minutes, said they were kind of OK.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.040]   So maybe they've learned something the past year.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.560]   It's going to be-- it's very interesting.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.120]   We're going to do iPad today at the show, Sarah Lane and I.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.040]   We won't be streaming it live, but we'll have it out.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.000]   Sarah's going to shoot it with me Thursday at 10,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.720]   and we'll have it because we can't-- we
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.240]   don't get our stage until Thursday afternoon at 2 or 1,
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:15.840]   I think.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.160]   No, two.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.720]   We will start our broadcast at 1 PM.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.720]   Actually, Wednesday night, we're going to be at Showstoppers
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.960]   or digital experience.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.680]   Boy, I'm confusing everybody.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.680]   When is Showstoppers?
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.840]   Showstoppers is Thursday night.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.680]   We'll also be at that.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.440]   I send a request.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.440]   They ignore me.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:30.800]   Oh, no.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.040]   We'll get you in the Showstoppers.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:32.920]   That's easy.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.200]   Digital experience is hard.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.240]   It's that the Pepcom guys are tough.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.000]   But Stephen Leon is a good friend.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.960]   He'll get-- we'll get you in the Showstalk.
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.920]   OK.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.880]   What was I saying?
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.160]   Oh, iPad today.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.000]   We'll have-- Sarah's going to edit it that night.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   We'll have it out Friday on schedule.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.840]   So that will be covering all the iPad stuff at CES,
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.440]   but we'll also cover the iPad competitors.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:54.940]   Yeah.
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:55.600]   Time permitting.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.000]   There may be so many of them.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.840]   We'll get a handful of them.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.240]   So that's really difficult to ask.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.480]   I think that this is going to be a real race to the bottom.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.480]   Right.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.360]   And if you-- if you got-- right now,
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.680]   I've got-- I've seen three companies that have shown--
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.160]   that have shown at least look cosmetically
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.320]   and somewhat functionally complete slays out there.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.120]   Only one of them was really distinctive.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.600]   And I'm not sure if the other companies are going to--
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.320]   the other companies, Acer and MSI,
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.960]   they're not noted for innovation.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.840]   They're noted for let's take this thing to the other guy
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.760]   did and find a way to make it more affordable and more
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.840]   accessible.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.520]   And so how are any of these companies
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.520]   going to be able to distinguish themselves and simply
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.120]   and say, here's why you need-- you
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.080]   want to buy our Motorola Slate and not this one by Acer
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.280]   or not the one by Notion Inc.
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.320]   It's, again, it's going to have to be a unique suite of software
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.680]   that they have or a unique UI or a unique layer on top of Android
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.240]   that this company has that no one else has.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.840]   You think there's any issue with a supply of materials as well?
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.840]   I mean--
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.680]   I talked to it.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.360]   There's a manufacturer who are main nameless who has a product
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.840]   that they were supposed to ship in September.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:07.800]   And they have a one penny diode or capacitor or something
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.720]   that they literally--
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.000]   they've had to delay it for six months.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.440]   The release of this product, because that one little capacitor
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.840]   is also used in the iPhone and the iPad.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.920]   And there is no amount of money that
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.520]   would allow them to buy them.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.640]   Apple owns-- I mean, it basically just buys them all.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.000]   And--
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.840]   You love no money.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.720]   It's a crazy thing.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.920]   By the way, Nvidia makes the Tigri platform.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.520]   I apologize.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.640]   I got that wrong.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.800]   But I think Nvidia is going the right direction
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.680]   with their processing.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.240]   I mean, of using the GPUs, these really fast GPUs,
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.080]   to power stuff.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.280]   It's just that I haven't seen it really work yet.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.840]   Details that come.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.440]   Well, they certainly got a lot of enthusiasm behind them.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.520]   It seems as though every tablet that was being shown at last CES
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.080]   was Nvidia Tegra based on Android.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.680]   So it sounds like there's a lack of people
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.720]   who already lined up to figure out how to make this thing work.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.160]   I'm ready to see a 3D slate.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.760]   Stop with a 3D.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.560]   You num-skull.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.320]   That's all I worked on yesterday was R&D for 3D.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.920]   You like 3D?
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.120]   I like working on it.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.080]   I can tell you there'll be a lot of 3D camcorders there.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.200]   People who-- you know, I'm ready.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.200]   They've got to create-- I mean, 3D's not going to take off.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.000]   Unless we get some content on it.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.520]   I have a-- I got the new W3.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.640]   The Fuji?
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.680]   3D camcorder.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.640]   Oh, that's right.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.640]   It's a still camera, right?
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.440]   That does V3D.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.480]   It does 720p as well.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.040]   It is so awesome.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:32.640]   Oh, shut up.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.640]   The W1 was good.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.920]   The W3 is great.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.640]   And the screen is 3D.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.480]   And it's--
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.480]   Do you have to wear glasses when you walk around?
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.040]   No, because the screen is one of those ones like the Nintendo
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.640]   where you can take a look at in the ticket?
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.920]   And it totally works.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.800]   And I mean, it really looks like 3D when you're shooting it.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:53.480]   And then when I view it, I have this program called
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.640]   Stereo Splicer on the Mac.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.000]   And it'll convert it to Anagliff and then right and left
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:58.760]   and everything else.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.400]   So you can--
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.880]   Like, are you going to shoot 3D video at CES?
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.840]   I'm going to shoot something.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.480]   I'm going to definitely-- I'm taking the camera with me.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.320]   So I'll post some of that to my--
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.960]   Everyone-- oh, by the way, everybody,
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.720]   listening to the show, needs to buy red and blue glasses.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.760]   Because I'm going to stream--
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.320]   You're doing anamorphic?
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.040]   Or what do you call it?
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.040]   Anaphylacto.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.120]   Don't be watching too much of it.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.400]   You're going to get anaphylacto shot.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.240]   You call it.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.800]   So that was the--
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.280]   Alex Lindsay watching him.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.720]   This is like being stung by a bee.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.240]   Catch it, though.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.080]   Anagliff.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.200]   Anagliff, thank you.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.200]   So here's the thing.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.440]   So I'm going to stream-- we're going
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:36.680]   to stream some segments live at Macworld in 3D.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.480]   But the only way to do that to everyone with 2D screens
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.640]   is Anagliff.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.360]   So you can get them on Amazon for like $3.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.960]   And we're about to run the entire supply out.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.600]   But it's going to be-- you know, what the thing is,
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.000]   is just have a little fun.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:50.920]   Live a little.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.960]   Live a little.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.840]   I like the way the Panasonic is doing it.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.640]   They're creating an accessory lens for their four-thirds cameras.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.640]   And so that it'll work with a lot of their four-thirds cameras.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.480]   It'll work with some of their video cameras.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.400]   So the idea is that you can buy your GF2 camera--
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:05.880]   Right.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.080]   --just as a regular still camera.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.080]   But then like next year, when you've got some reason--
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.320]   when you've got $183 that has to be spent out
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.160]   of the petty cash budget or else, you'll
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.880]   lose that money in the budget next year,
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.360]   guess what?
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.280]   You buy yourself a 3D lens.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.400]   I'm not sure if I'm ready to buy a $500 camera that looks like--
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.200]   You know, it's gotten down.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.760]   Like on Amazon, I think it was like $360 or something like that.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.760]   And what about-- you know that they're doing this AGAF100.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.160]   This is their video camera that supports micro four-thirds lenses.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:33.760]   Have you seen that?
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.160]   I have seen it.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.080]   It looks great.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.520]   I saw it in a live version at NAB.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.080]   Dvorak was all excited about that.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.840]   It looks like it's awesome.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.520]   It looks like one of those wrong--
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.280]   We'd like to--
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.200]   Well, that's the--
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.280]   No, that's not the real thing.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.200]   That's the consumer version.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.440]   That's the what they were showing at NAB.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.320]   There's another version.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.920]   If you keep on going, I think, the actual version
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.920]   has more buttons on it.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.640]   That was the concept version when they were still
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.000]   trying to get PR for it.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.680]   If you do a search for that, you'll see one--
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.840]   This is DP reviews.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.800]   But if you press release--
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.200]   If you do a search, you'll see the one with all the buttons.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.840]   And so it's awesome.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.440]   It is-- what you're getting is changeable lenses.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.240]   You're getting a short depth of field.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.320]   You're basically-- this is what Panasonic does in reaction
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:15.680]   to the red.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.080]   I have the GF1, which I can shoot video with,
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.240]   is probably the same as that, right?
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.000]   Well, it's a much bigger--
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.080]   I believe that it's--
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.040]   It's a lot bigger.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.440]   Well, it also-- you're going to get SDI out.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.520]   So it has SDI out.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.160]   I think that they're talking about--
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.200]   I can't remember whether they said
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.360]   they were going to have a 444 option or not.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.000]   I know Sony's version of this, which
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.120]   is going to be a little bit more expensive,
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.880]   is going to have a 444 option.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.360]   Why--
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.400]   Sony's doing one too.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.120]   All of these are reactions to the red.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:43.920]   So these are all like--
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.640]   This is their red.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.000]   But it's not 4K.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.800]   It's not 4K, but here's the reality.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.040]   There's a lot of people who don't need 4K.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.480]   I mean, the red is great when you want it,
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.320]   but we take all of our red footage
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.320]   and convert it back down to 1080p.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.000]   Because that's our pipeline, this 1080p.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.800]   So of course, what you're going to see here
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.520]   is a larger sensor is going to give you--
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.200]   And the problem is you have these still cameras that
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.760]   can shoot video, but they're still cameras.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:05.760]   They don't have the right control.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.600]   They don't have the buttons in the right places.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.120]   And so what you're having here-- this is a real video camera.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.880]   And it's going to give you the real power.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.520]   It's going to give you the features
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:18.360]   that you need to actually shoot solid video
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.680]   and be part of a production.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.800]   Smells like they're scarlet competitor than they're red.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.440]   Although the scarlet now is called the Epic X or S
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.640]   or something like that, and it's going to be like 12 grand.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.160]   So it's actually--
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.080]   How much is this?
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:29.760]   I think it's--
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.280]   Look at this.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.040]   $5,000?
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:31.800]   $5,000?
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.640]   This is incredible though.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.760]   I mean, the thing is, is this is filmmaking
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.800]   getting turned on its head.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.080]   And we once again, no matter how much you love this one,
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:43.000]   what you want to thank is you want to thank Jim over at Red
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.600]   because this is all a reaction to--
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.800]   and these guys did not want to do this.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.440]   They did not want to--
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.320]   Because it cannibalizes their--
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.800]   Well, yeah, their upper end, all their upper end stuff.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.280]   Why would you want a little sensor now when
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.360]   you can have something like this?
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.440]   And so for independent filmmakers, a $5,000 camera,
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.760]   you add the lenses to it, and you're
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.360]   going to end up with some really, really great stuff.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.800]   And it's not the same as shooting a 5D.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.520]   I have two of those.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.920]   And the issue is that it's great shooting video with a 5D,
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.600]   but it's not a video camera.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.040]   It doesn't act like a video camera.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.520]   It looks like a movie camera.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.240]   No, this one is like a movie camera.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.280]   And what you're seeing here is just--
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.320]   you're really-- look at that.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.280]   What is that lens?
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.640]   It looks like a Zeiss.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.560]   So they're putting--
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.680]   But Zeiss makes four-third metal lenses.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.560]   That's got an adapter on it.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.240]   It was an adapter.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.680]   Yeah, so there's an adapter on the front there.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.080]   So is this the lead cable?
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.200]   That's the SDI cable coming out.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.400]   So now you're getting uncompressed SDI coming out
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.080]   of the back of there.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.280]   So we should buy these for our new studio.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.480]   To be honest, probably not.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.200]   Here's why.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.800]   Is it-- well, thank you.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.600]   Thank you.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.400]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.000]   I've been really happy.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.800]   I've been doing lots of tests with the little cannons.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.680]   And I'm really happy little--
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.400]   840s?
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.320]   I'm really happy with those.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.880]   But anyway, but the reason you don't want to buy this
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.800]   is when you're doing an ENG style shoot, the issue
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.000]   that you're going to really run into
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   is you're going to be chasing focus all the time.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.600]   You don't want to actually have to worry about everything
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.160]   in and out of focus when you're shooting
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.280]   on a regular engineering situation.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.120]   You want to be able to do that in certain environments.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.080]   It does look great when you do it,
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.560]   but it's really hard to control.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.520]   We're going to shoot a bunch of our episodes at CES
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.600]   with a 5D.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.440]   But that's only because I have my brother shooting.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.920]   And if he's not able to come, then we'll shoot with the EX1.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.520]   Because it really is a crazy, challenging thing
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.680]   to shoot handheld.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.160]   This is the same price as in the EX1, the Sony.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.920]   Well, this is HD camcorder.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.760]   No, this is more.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.760]   This is going to be twice as much.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.800]   It's 5,000,000 instead of 2,700 for the--
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.400]   Oh, OK.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.240]   But it's going to be-- I mean, it is-- if I was shooting,
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.080]   I would be very tempted-- I have to admit,
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.680]   for what we use it for, I would be actually fairly tempted
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.440]   to use this instead of--
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.000]   I mean, if I'm going to buy something,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.600]   I'd be tempted to buy this instead of a red.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.760]   It's kind of the most of the kind of work
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.120]   that we do.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.320]   People are going to be making movies.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.480]   Everybody's going to be making movies.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.920]   Everybody's going to be the next Spielberg now.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.240]   Well, I mean, it's crazy.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:07.800]   As we've seen.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.640]   Thanks to UrbanFox.tv for that footage from--
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.920]   that was from IBC 2010.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.400]   I'm sure we'll see a lot from Panasonic at CES around this.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.040]   And 3D camera.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:18.960]   They have a 3D camera too.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.440]   Yep.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.360]   I saw that.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.880]   I had to bring this 3D back in.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.520]   Yeah, I know.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.600]   But it's a much bigger year for 4/3 than 3D,
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.840]   because I think just last year, this
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.840]   was this kind of quirky new emerging format where you didn't--
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.960]   you really had a-- it was a subtle distinction
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.840]   on why would you want to buy a micro 4/3 still camera,
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:41.320]   as opposed to a $500 SLR or $400 super premium pocket
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.000]   camera.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.560]   But now it's really demonstrating
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.160]   that if you invest in the 4/3 platform,
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.400]   the lenses that you buy for whatever camera you buy today
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.360]   will work with whatever camcorder you buy next year.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.320]   And then whatever 4/3 camera you replace your first one
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.320]   with two or three years from now,
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.000]   it's starting to look like a much, much better thing
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.720]   to put your money in.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.640]   That's what I've been saying first, Canon glass.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.720]   You'll get L lenses, because the bodies will get better.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.200]   But the glass is glass.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.040]   Now you're saying for 4/3, get--
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.040]   I'm still starting on that.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.240]   Especially because it's completely platform independent.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.240]   Right.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.760]   4/3 is a standard.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.800]   It's an open standard.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.640]   It's an open standard.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.040]   So you can buy an Olympus camera, a pen camera,
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.280]   with a 4/3 lens on it, and then just buy a Panasonic body
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.640]   next year of the year after.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.280]   Right now, I'm actually--
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.440]   I've been having so much fun with the 4/3 camera
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.360]   that I got last year, that I'm really closely
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.200]   looking at the LX2 that's from Panasonic that's coming out
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.800]   probably in February or March.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.760]   And the T's-- there's a rumor that Olympus is going to come out
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.440]   with another 4/3 camera on that same line, just really,
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.440]   really teeny, tiny body with a built-in flash
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.480]   so you don't have to always shoot, like you're shooting
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.520]   the third man or something.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.280]   I'm actually glad I got that GH1 that I got,
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.120]   the Panasonic.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.240]   So you're thinking now maybe the time--
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.200]   this is somehow turned into a photography show,
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.040]   but we'll move on in a second.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.480]   They'll work with iPhone.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.280]   Well, you've got PMA and NAB coming in,
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.280]   so you don't want to buy anything.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.120]   I mean, if you're--
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.320]   I'm not going to buy a body, but it sounds like I should
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.080]   buy more 4/3 lenses, yes?
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:10.600]   No.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.600]   Sure.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.480]   I'm really into some frame lenses.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.400]   I mean, like, no, but I mean--
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.040]   By the way, Brent is shaking his head behind you.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.160]   I don't have a shot of him going, mmm.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.400]   I'm really-- I have to--
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:25.200]   What should we be buying, Brent?
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.760]   He says can in glass.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.200]   Can in glass is not going to handle the new.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.200]   It's not going to handle the new.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:31.920]   40 megabits.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.040]   No, in fact, that's one of the issues with a lot of glass
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.960]   is the resolution's getting higher than the glass can
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.080]   resolve, which is stunning.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:38.680]   I don't care.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.320]   See, the thing is I don't need the resolution.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.920]   What I need are larger photo sites.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:45.560]   So the thing is that this is what I think Nikon gets better
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.080]   than Canon.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.920]   And I have a bunch of Canon hardware,
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.480]   so it's really frustrating for me to watch from the sidelines
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.040]   as Nikon cleans up in this area.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.200]   But what Nikon did is said, OK, we're not going to do higher
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:54.720]   resolution.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.920]   What we're going to do is larger photo sites,
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.080]   and that means you're going to get much better low light
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:34:59.640]   performance.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.680]   You're going to get 6,400 ISO that you can actually look
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:03.240]   for frame.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.240]   I love full frame.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:08.880]   And I still think that Nikon is kicking Canon's butt
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.720]   when it comes to low light performance.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.640]   And it's because they went--
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.040]   I think that once you get to 20-some megapixels,
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.640]   I really think you're in the zone of that's
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:18.640]   as big as we need it.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.800]   All right, we're going to move on,
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.600]   because we're boring RE2 series.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.840]   Sorry, guys.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.320]   We do want to talk about the Max store.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.040]   And you mentioned Ewoks, and I have something
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.800]   to say about that as well.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.600]   Can't do Ewok.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.480]   It's too small.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.520]   I don't know what that's--
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.680]   It's too small.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.880]   What can you do Darth Vader?
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.840]   The video is strong in this one.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.120]   We'll talk about that in a bit.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.960]   But before we do that, I want to mention a little bit
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.960]   about our fine sponsors, including those good people
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.440]   at Citrix who do go to meetings.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:53.560]   You know, I said this last year, now I'm thinking maybe we--
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.360]   when I looked at the bill for going to CES,
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.640]   maybe we should just do the whole thing via go to meeting.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.560]   So you go to meeting eliminates business travel.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.640]   It means you can have the equivalent of face-to-face
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.320]   meetings, but without leaving your desk.
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:09.200]   It is the online meeting service, the best in the business.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.760]   The Citrix Association is one of the reasons they really
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.000]   know remote access.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.920]   They also know how to make great products that are easy
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:21.040]   to use, fast, reliable, secure, 128-bit SSL.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.640]   Great support, too.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.920]   Citrix is really the original remote access.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.400]   They are.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.680]   I mean, that's what they originally did.
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.120]   Before all, I would go to meeting everything else.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.400]   Citrix was the one that really wrote the book.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:30.880]   You're right?
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.320]   Literally.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.920]   And in fact, if you're still using--
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:36.320]   if you use Windows Enterprise remote access,
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.160]   you'll be using Citrix.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.920]   That's what everybody uses.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.080]   I want you to try go to meeting for product reviews,
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.760]   for sales presentations, for online collaboration,
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.040]   for training.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.080]   You don't leave your desk.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.120]   It's easy to install.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.760]   And what's really important, the people
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.680]   you're meeting with don't have to jump through hoops
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.120]   to meet with you.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.880]   You send them a link, or you can send them an email
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.800]   invitation. It's all built in.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.520]   And 30 seconds later, they click the link, and it says, OK,
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:00.280]   I think it's Java.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.320]   We're going to install this.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:01.920]   Good.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.960]   30 seconds later, they're meeting with you.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.920]   So it's very easy for them.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.640]   And boy, is it engaging.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.000]   Eliminate the travel expenses.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.120]   Eliminate the trouble.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.520]   The hassles.
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.480]   Get go to meeting.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.200]   Try it for 30 days.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.400]   Right now, go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:27.240]   We thank them for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.720]   One, a couple more CES notes.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.320]   The Ewoks are coming.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.960]   We don't know what this announcement is,
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:40.600]   but we've seen an invite from Panasonic--
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.960]   Did they bring you Ewoks?
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.600]   Star Wars, the complete saga.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.480]   Darth Vader.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.160]   Darth Vader is going to be at the Panasonic booth on Thursday.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.000]   We'll be there as well to find out what he's going to announce.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.600]   We know that they're releasing Blu-ray of the complete,
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.000]   but why is Panasonic doing it?
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.600]   And what I'm thinking is 3D.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:01.480]   And only on Panasonic 3D sets, which I just bought one.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.280]   So you don't mind.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.280]   You don't care.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.240]   No, no, I will say that this whole--
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.120]   we're going to only be able to get a hold of 3D
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.920]   if you buy the right set box is going to kill 3D.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.480]   If they keep on going down the path.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.080]   But I'm really glad that I'll be able to watch Star Wars
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.640]   and 3D on my TV.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.720]   And so we'll lease it.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.560]   Anything else?
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.480]   Yeah, Lisa got a Panasonic beautiful Panasonic.
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.400]   I think I got a smaller one.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.840]   She got the biggest one.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.840]   I mean, it was huge.
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.920]   So anything else for CES for Apple?
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.760]   Apple.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.520]   Apple going once, going twice.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.160]   You know how Apple's going to deflate this all?
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.800]   Because in two days, Apple's announced
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.440]   it's going online, January 6th, with a Mac App Store.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.960]   That begins on what is that?
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.080]   Thursday.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.840]   Pretty excited to buy some apps.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.320]   I'm excited to put our apps on it.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:54.720]   Real Mac Software's blog, the CEO of Real Mac Software,
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.920]   his name, her name is--
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.360]   I can't remember.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.760]   But if you go to the realmaxsoftware.com/blog,
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.640]   you can read the posting.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.480]   This week marks a turning point for independent Mac
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.960]   developers, like Real Mac.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.080]   They, by the way, they do software for developing.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.880]   So they have a kind of a double stake in it.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:12.400]   They sell.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.480]   And they have many users who write software.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.160]   The Mac App Store opens its doors
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:18.800]   for the first time.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.240]   Over the Christmas break, we've been giving it
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:20.920]   a little more thought.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.160]   What changes will it bring to existing software developers
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.520]   like us?
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:28.760]   One, apps need to be more focused.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.440]   That's kind of what happened with iOS.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:34.120]   Each app does something simple, clear, and small,
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.480]   and inexpensive, because you can't charge too much on the App
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:37.680]   Store.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.760]   Say goodbye to upgrade pricing.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.880]   For the past two and a half years,
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.760]   this is very interesting.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.720]   iOS developers everywhere have eagerly
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.840]   awaited paid upgrades to come to the App Store.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.080]   Stop waiting.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.120]   They ain't coming.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.320]   Those are in-app purchases now.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.600]   I mean, that would be the way to do it.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.440]   You can do it in-app purchase, absolutely.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.480]   Say hello to cheaper apps.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.040]   I think this is one of the reasons that users are going
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:00.680]   to love it.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.440]   They're also going to love it that the updates will happen,
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.840]   but does this happen automatically in the background?
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.640]   You won't even-- just as they do on your iPad and your iOS
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.680]   you say, updates, update all, and you're done.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:10.480]   I hadn't done it.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.040]   I was in Africa and I got back and I looked at it
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.880]   and my iPad had 64 updates.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:15.380]   Right.
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.000]   I'm so glad I have iOS at that moment,
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:17.480]   because I hit--
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.280]   You press one button.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:18.280]   Update.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.840]   And then I went and had dinner and I came back
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.680]   and everything was updated.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.720]   Make sure you're on the Wi-Fi.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:28.120]   Any thoughts about the Mac App Store, Andrew?
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:28.640]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.720]   I'm sorry, Andy.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.600]   This whole time I pushed a button and I killed your audio.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.840]   No, that was me, because I--
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.320]   OK.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.760]   Daddy needed his second hour dosage,
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.680]   so I really quick turned that on.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:45.760]   Yeah, it's definitely going to be a great thing for users.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.480]   And it's going to be a great thing for Apple,
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:51.000]   because it'll get more eyeballs on the library of Mac apps.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.800]   It still remains to be seen how good it's
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.520]   going to be for independent developers,
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.760]   because I've seen a lot of people who are extremely
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.560]   enthusiastic about it, but there's still a lot of concerns.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.320]   Like, certain types of developers,
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.840]   they feel as though they need to have a really good thumb
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:08.320]   on who their users are, what sort of stuff they're doing,
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:11.120]   what they're using, what they're expecting from their apps.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.480]   And Apple will drop down that wall,
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.360]   it looks like, between the person who makes the app
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.440]   and that list of people who are using it.
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:22.120]   So there are a bunch of different developers
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.800]   I've talked to who they don't think it's a bad thing,
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.320]   but they think it's definitely not the right choice for them.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.040]   So I'm really curious to see how that pans out.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.520]   The other thing is that I'm hoping that--
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.800]   again, as a consumer, I love the fact
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.400]   that I can spend at $1.90.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.760]   I can drop $10 on the App Store for iPhone apps
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.440]   and walk out with two or three really good ones.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.760]   And I can afford to throw away $0.99
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.960]   of $1.99 on a gamble on an app that looks kind of nice,
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.520]   but I don't know.
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.800]   I'm on the fence with, oh, who cares?
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.520]   It's $0.99.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:51.720]   I may as well just buy it.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.680]   I just hope that there's so many great apps out there,
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:58.000]   desktop apps, that really cost $20, $30, $40, $50,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.520]   and even at $50, even at $40, even at $40.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:04.240]   I'm amazed that Scrivener costs as little money as it does,
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.800]   because clearly so much work and thought went into it.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:10.920]   I'm concerned that if it's easier to sell a really crummy word
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.680]   processor for $4.99 than it is to sell a professional one
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:19.200]   for $40 or $50, what that's going to do to Mac software.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.960]   So that's why I'm really curious to see
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.240]   how well the Apple branded apps do
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.840]   and the Apple branded packages do,
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.400]   because I think that's going to sort of set the standard
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.680]   for what people expect to spend for Mac software.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.600]   Do you worry that free software will go away
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.400]   or you will see less free software,
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:39.280]   because it's so easy to charge $5 or a buck in the app store,
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.880]   and it'll just make it easy to do that?
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.000]   I think it will, and I have to admit that I don't have a problem
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.120]   paying for software if it means that it's going
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.400]   more sustainable and more likely.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.400]   I actually get a little scared of free software,
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.440]   because I'm afraid that it won't be around a later,
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.000]   because no one's making any money on it.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.040]   And if they're charging, I'd rather have people charging a buck
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:03.120]   $99 or $299 for software and staying around and updating it
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.480]   and having it be worth their while,
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:08.120]   then have it for free and not know when it's going to go away.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.960]   Yeah, I'm just not sure if a buck or a buck $99
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:15.520]   is going to be enough money to get someone to keep updating that app.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.120]   That's true, but if it's a free app,
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.120]   it's better than what they were getting.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.800]   Exactly, and it's just the placement in the store
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.400]   where there's always going to be that one place
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.160]   where I can do that keyword search
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.640]   to try to find a list of HDR apps
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:31.720]   or find a list of alarm clocks and timers and stuff like that,
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.480]   rather than having to, as I do have to do right now,
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.000]   to hit four, five, six, seven different places,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.640]   including just bookmark libraries
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.560]   to see if anybody else has been bookmarking apps
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.920]   that do this sort of thing.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.800]   So that's the big win for users,
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.800]   it's just at least having one big depository for everything.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.480]   And we'll say that I really believe
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.040]   that reviews become more important,
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.680]   because I know that I see stuff on macworld.com, for instance,
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.040]   and I'll see something and they'll go,
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:54.880]   "Oh, this is great."
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.360]   And at $299, if Macworld, you know,
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.120]   if someone there says that, I go, "Oh, yeah, I'll buy that."
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.440]   But that demonstrates another big problem.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:06.040]   If I can command Apple to do one thing to the iTunes store,
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.480]   it's you need to have curated ratings, period,
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.800]   because I think it's been pretty much demonstrated
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.000]   that the current system doesn't work.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.080]   When you look at all those different ratings
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:20.800]   and you see out of a possible possibility of five stars,
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.720]   someone has given an application,
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.760]   the one star rating, the lowest rating
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.600]   they can possibly give it.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.560]   And you read the review and it says that,
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.040]   "I thought that this photo app would have an application
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.200]   that substituted the flash."
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.520]   It didn't have the feature.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.360]   So basically, the statement-- - It's really in the store.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.200]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.000]   And the statement that they're saying is that,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.600]   if I bought this camera app and all it did was
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.040]   look at my address book and say,
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.280]   "Haha, Gurn Ferguson, you're an idiot.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.120]   I have your money.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.760]   I'm not gonna return it, even though this app does nothing."
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.360]   It would have gotten a one star rating.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.520]   - Well, but I have to admit that,
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:56.120]   so what I'm talking about is reviews on web pages,
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.640]   like Macworld or Apple Insider or Mac News Network.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.480]   When I see the reviews there at the time when I go,
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.560]   "Oh, I'm just gonna buy that."
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.640]   - Curated reviews as opposed to the wide.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.000]   - Yeah, I see those curated reviews.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.720]   And the cost of entry is so low.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:10.400]   I have to believe that those reviews must generate
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.640]   a lot of money for those developers.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.120]   Now, I will look at it.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.480]   Like, if there's some that I'm interested in,
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.200]   I'll look at the reviews, not so much for the stars,
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.040]   but if everyone says in the last five days,
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.040]   "It's crashing, crashing, crashing, crashing, crashing."
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.480]   I just looked at an app like that.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.440]   I was like, "Yeah, I think I'm gonna wait."
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.920]   I'm gonna wait on that one because it's obviously not
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.320]   hooked yet if there's like 10 comments
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.360]   that says this crashed constantly.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.000]   - Well, that you've been prompted to.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.600]   Mark Booth says in our chatroom that he predicts,
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.560]   "I ads will come to the app store."
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.000]   That would be one way to keep free apps alive
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.080]   is having a robust app platform,
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:45.520]   ad platform not in mobile, but in desktop.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.520]   - And see, that's another concern.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.960]   I'd much rather give someone 99 cents.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.800]   - Mm-hmm, too.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.640]   - Never see an app.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.560]   - I don't wanna see ads on my desktop.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.920]   - A lot of different developers are also blogging
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.200]   about their experiences on having a paid model
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.720]   versus an ad-driven model.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.840]   And most of them are saying,
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.840]   "We've made so much more money off of this game
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:07.000]   or off of this utility as soon as we went to an ad model."
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.560]   And so if that becomes the default setting
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:12.480]   for most people who write apps for the app store,
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:15.680]   especially the tiny little like one horse operations
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.960]   that write a lot of the great software that's out there,
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.880]   if it means that it's gonna be sort of assumed
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.760]   that if you download an app for a really good app for the Mac,
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.800]   you are going to see apps.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:24.840]   You're not gonna pay any money for it,
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.280]   but you are gonna see ads.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.920]   - Oh, good, gravy.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.440]   That's gonna be a bad day.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.280]   - I wouldn't mind.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.280]   The thing is we're obviously scheming on a bunch
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.360]   of different pieces of a puzzle for Pixel Core
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.200]   and everything else.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.480]   And one of the things that we're looking at
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:40.320]   is an ad-driven model for free stuff,
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.040]   but there's always gonna be a way to pay for it
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.160]   so that you can bump up and get rid of those ads.
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:45.600]   - A pro version that doesn't have ads.
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.800]   - Yeah, and the thing is, is that if you want it for free,
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.440]   that's the, nothing's for free.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.080]   You know, we gotta pay for this somehow.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.960]   You know, and I think that that's the,
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.920]   and I think that that's the reality of that situation.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.880]   I do think it's important to let people pay through it.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.520]   You know, but I think Angry Birds now
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.720]   is making a lot more money on the ads than they are on the--
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:02.560]   - That's what they say.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.640]   In fact, interesting articles--
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.480]   - They make a lot of money.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.080]   - Not only that, but they don't like developing for Android
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:10.040]   according to a Rovio.
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.440]   They prefer to do the paid version
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.960]   and not do the ad-supported version.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.400]   That was the experiment, though.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.600]   Well, that was the experiment, though.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.480]   Was they, on Android, it's free, but there's an ad in it.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.840]   - I thought they were making a lot of money on that, though,
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.360]   on that ad-driven version.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.200]   I guess the-- - You don't want to--
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.040]   - Let me see.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.320]   It may not have to do with how much money they're making.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.320]   - I think as crazy as the date that--
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.480]   I didn't even know that they connected from their app
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:36.560]   to YouTube to watch the Angry Birds videos.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.560]   - My son figured that out.
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:38.880]   My three-year-old son.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:39.840]   And that's all he does.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.680]   He goes to Angry Birds.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:41.480]   He doesn't play Angry Birds.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.000]   He goes to Angry Birds because he knows how--
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.480]   That's how he gets to the Angry Bird videos.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:46.960]   - You know, they're launching it for the PSP
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.360]   and PS3 this week.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.200]   Sony.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.120]   (laughs)
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.360]   Let me see.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.600]   Angry Birds development leader.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.080]   So it's not the money guy.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:59.080]   It's Paul Vesterbaca who writes the software.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:03.480]   He says, "Apple will be number one for a very long time."
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.720]   He'd rather develop for them.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:05.960]   See, this isn't the money people.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:06.800]   So you're right. - Right.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.560]   They may make more money.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.600]   He says, "One, Apple got so many things right
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.240]   "when designing the platform, and it's easier
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.680]   "to make money from paid apps."
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:17.320]   Vesterbaca says, "It's just very hard to charge for apps
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:18.840]   "on Android, and it's not that open
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:22.520]   "because it's very Google-centric fragmentation is a problem."
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.760]   Not device fragmentation, but ecosystem fragmentation.
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:27.160]   Oh, this makes sense.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.520]   Carriers adding their own app stores
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.920]   and adding stuff to the system
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:33.720]   that kind of unpredictably changes what you're doing.
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:38.600]   I don't know though, if they're making more money,
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.600]   then I don't know if they've said
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.920]   whether they're making more money on ads.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.760]   Have you seen that?
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.320]   - I thought I saw, there was a article that we were,
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:48.120]   that I was looking at that talked about their income.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.560]   The income was really high,
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.120]   but it looked like they had made,
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.960]   they were making almost enough per month
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.360]   that within six months they'd make
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.200]   as much as they made selling the app.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.920]   It was like a million dollars a month or something,
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.400]   they were making on just the ads.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.240]   - Well, they didn't charge,
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.440]   y'all'll be honest, they didn't charge enough
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.520]   for Angry Birds.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.680]   (laughs)
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.840]   On the Apple platform, had they known
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.440]   how successful it was gonna be?
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.080]   Well, it was like a Buck 99, right?
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.920]   - So this is according to IHI Games,
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.360]   so I don't know, I mean, I'm not familiar with it,
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.760]   but it was one million a month in the ads.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.320]   - In ad revenue. - Yeah, that's gotta be,
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.680]   well, I don't know, they've got 21,
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.720]   what was the number of downloads?
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.840]   21 million total, it was that much?
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.040]   - Some huge number.
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.160]   - And now they've added the Eagle, the Angry Eagle,
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.000]   whatever it is, the year.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:28.840]   - What is the Eagle?
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:32.120]   - Oh, you pay a buck, it's in store, in app purchase,
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:36.080]   you pay a buck and you get one Eagle that you fire
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.240]   and it blows up all the pigs.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.240]   It's more like a satisfaction than anything else.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.680]   - You know, you gotta earn it.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:44.440]   - I think so, I don't think you should get to--
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.120]   - Oh, I love the idea that they're milking people
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:46.960]   who don't wanna earn it,
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.640]   'cause they're getting what they deserve.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.440]   - Yeah, well, but you know what it is,
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:51.640]   it's a lot of little kids.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:52.640]   - Just.
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.080]   - It's kids who don't realize,
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.520]   oh, that's actual money.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:58.160]   You know, I used to get really annoyed with the fact
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.920]   that every time you buy something from the iTunes store,
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.880]   you have to put in your password
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.720]   until my son had my iPad, no one eye.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.880]   - And now he's like constantly like ready to buy stuff
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.640]   and then he's three years old and he's hitting like,
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.760]   he gets into the app store and he starts randomly hitting stuff.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:11.600]   - Well, you know, at least--
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.720]   - And his son, whose seven or eight does,
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:17.080]   she gave him an iPad for Christmas
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.400]   and he gets right to the point where you get to the buy
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:23.680]   the Mighty Eagle and he clicks okay
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.800]   and then just runs over and says,
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.600]   there's an update mama and she types in the password.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.480]   She's learned, I think.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:33.000]   - I give my kids, my older kids have $10 a month
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:33.840]   and then they--
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.680]   - Yeah, that's what I do with the, yeah.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.280]   - That's dirty rotten.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.920]   - Oh man.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:39.760]   - Yeah.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.840]   - There'd be some serious not using the iPad
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.600]   for a couple of weeks if my kids did that with it.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.880]   - Angry Eagle stuck on a tricky level,
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:49.560]   out of levels to play, bring on the Mighty Eagle.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:50.960]   So I'm gonna click the check box.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.800]   What will happen-- - What are you doing?
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:52.880]   - What's going on with that?
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.280]   Well, they're just gonna ask me for a password, right?
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:56.280]   - Coo, coo, coo.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:58.600]   - Confirm your in-app purchase.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:01.160]   Do you want to buy one Mighty Eagle for 99 cents?
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.240]   All right, I'll do it for you.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.320]   I'm doing it for you.
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:05.560]   - Coo, coo.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:06.720]   - Get rid of the password.
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.400]   He needs an update, mommy.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.860]   - Coo, coo.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:12.720]   - And you know, they keep updating.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.520]   I have to say they're smart.
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.320]   They've got the hottest franchise out there now.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.120]   And they update it continually.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:20.160]   - For free.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.000]   - Yeah.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.480]   - I can believe that I was--
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.320]   - Go ahead.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:24.800]   - If this were Game of 1986,
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.520]   it had their own Saturday morning cartoon show
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:27.360]   for one season.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.200]   - Right.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.040]   - Well, they've been working on it.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.640]   - It's hard to see a game of this kind of success.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:34.720]   But when it becomes a joke on the Daily Show,
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.400]   you know that he got something going here.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.800]   - Okay, you want to do the honors?
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:40.880]   Do the first Mighty Eagle?
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:41.720]   - Coo.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.640]   (laughing)
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:45.880]   - Let me eagle show.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.800]   - I don't know where the eagle is.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:48.640]   - Did you get it?
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:49.480]   - Okay, so there's a,
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.440]   see there's a baleful eye there?
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.000]   You click that.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.480]   And then you can, if you say yes,
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.120]   you can use the Mighty Eagle.
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:56.960]   - Okay, I've never--
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.120]   - I think it actually cancel and pick a level
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:58.960]   that you really hate.
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:51:59.800]   - Oh, but I already hit the,
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:01.480]   see the thing is I already hit the button.
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.320]   You already hit the button.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.040]   - I don't know how many Mighty Eagles you get for a buck.
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.360]   - I think you get one.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.200]   - I think you, okay.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:07.880]   - You can use once an hour.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.080]   - You can use it once an hour.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:09.920]   - Oh, once an hour?
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:10.760]   - Okay, here we go.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.600]   - So that's not so bad.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.600]   - It blows everything up.
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.440]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.240]   - Whoa.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.640]   - It's like a, it's the nuclear,
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:19.480]   it's the nuclear option.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:20.640]   - I do admit that was kinda fun.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.160]   (laughing)
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.480]   - Especially as it was my dollar.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.360]   Now you can only use it once an hour, so stop.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:26.720]   Maybe you could use it again.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:27.760]   I know, as they're saying in the chat room,
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:28.600]   you can only use it once.
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.200]   - Let's try it again here.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.040]   I smelled--
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.240]   - No, I got another one.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.440]   - Oh, don't use up all my Mighty Eagles.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.160]   - Crispy dead bacon.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:38.000]   (laughing)
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.680]   - No, no, I did two of them.
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.680]   - Okay, let me do one.
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:42.600]   - Okay, there's some levels that are driving me crazy.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.560]   It would be very satisfying.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:46.680]   - Now you get, then you get an Eagle score.
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.080]   Eagle high score, 100%.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:51.720]   You only got 98% the second time.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.440]   - I guess you do have to place it properly to get to--
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.080]   - There is an Eagle placement involved.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:56.400]   - Yeah.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.360]   - No, I was excited, 'cause I hadn't checked it for a while,
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.360]   'cause I was working through seasons,
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.080]   'cause I had already, I have three stars on every level
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.360]   on the regular one.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:05.200]   - Right.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.040]   - And I went back to the regular one,
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:07.200]   there was a whole 'nother set of levels.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.120]   I was like, oh man.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.800]   (sighing)
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:10.640]   - Yeah, I have to get,
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.200]   hey, what happens?
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.800]   - And by the way, I don't get--
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:14.960]   - For the long part of the season,
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.160]   I don't get the Eagle on that one.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.760]   I gotta buy that one separately, I guess.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.760]   - I had to buy an Eagle for, oh, right.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:21.760]   (laughing)
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:22.920]   - Eagle purchase separately.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:25.280]   - Ah.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.120]   - Jesus is very close to it.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.600]   - So it's been frustrating,
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.040]   there's some people in Australia
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.120]   who just didn't wake up on New Year's Day,
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.480]   because once again, Apple,
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.400]   some I read a very snide,
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.040]   but very funny article in the require saying,
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.760]   "If a Chinese alarm clock developer can write code
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.320]   "that makes the alarm go off appropriately."
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.400]   What is the problem, Apple?
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.240]   - Yeah.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.080]   - What happened?
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:50.320]   - No, I ran for this problem myself on Sunday morning,
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.360]   and it really, it taught me something about my faith
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:56.720]   in Apple that I would really rather have not have known,
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:59.240]   'cause I was gonna leave the house early,
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:00.800]   I will set the alarm for six,
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.680]   I woke up naturally at 7.30 in the morning,
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:07.080]   and so check the time of my bedside clock,
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.880]   frown, picked up my iPhone,
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.520]   noticed that the alarm had been set,
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.680]   that everything been set properly,
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:15.720]   the AM, it was set to 6 a.m., it was still engaged,
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.560]   looked at the system clock in the upper corner
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.960]   of my MacBook on the nightstand,
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.600]   and I looked outside and was still kinda dark outside,
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.000]   and my first thought was,
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.920]   wow, how did both my nightstand clock
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.960]   and the system clock on my MacBook screw up like that?
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.720]   Because I was not willing,
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:33.560]   or at least in the first five minutes of being awake,
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:34.960]   I was not willing to believe
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.320]   that the iPhone had screwed something up.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:39.520]   - But it did. - But it did.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:44.600]   - So Apple says this is only on January 1st and 2nd.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.200]   - I wanna know what the code is
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:49.160]   that has it only not work on January 1st and 2nd,
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.040]   I mean that is like, how does that happen?
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:53.040]   And only for non-recurring alarms,
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.760]   only for one time only alarms on January 1st and 2nd,
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.720]   20, 11. - You know what I think is?
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:57.920]   I think Apple was doing this
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:59.560]   to protect everyone from themselves.
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:02.040]   It is the 1st and 2nd, you look guys are partying
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.040]   and you should just be sleeping in for the weekend.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:05.120]   What are you waking up for?
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.120]   What are you nuts?
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.800]   - Steve just said that people need to sleep
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.120]   and we're gonna just, you know.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.240]   - So let's do it whether they like it or not.
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:13.280]   - Someone at Apple called and all staff
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.920]   like teleconference for like January 2nd.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.040]   They said, guys, let's get together.
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.440]   There's a way we could make sure we miss the meeting
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:21.680]   and nobody's bleeding.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:22.920]   - Now, here's my question
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.280]   and I've seen little murmurs.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:26.120]   I don't know if this is true or not.
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.680]   Apple said it's only for non-recurring alarms
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.600]   and only for the first two days of the year
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:34.520]   by January 3rd, which was yesterday, it'll be better.
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:37.080]   But I'm seeing murmurs that it isn't better.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.120]   It's not better, Brent.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:42.000]   His didn't go off this morning, January 4th.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.560]   - Mine, I turned mine off
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.200]   before it was supposed to go off this morning.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.360]   So I don't know, I woke up before it and I turned it off.
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.520]   - What the hell?
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.400]   I mean, first of all, there's plenty of apps
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.760]   that you could use for alarm clocks, better alarm clock apps.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.120]   Some of them, which even play Twitch when you wake up.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:59.440]   Which I'd encourage you to purchase mega weather clock
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.960]   because when you wake up, Twitch appears.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.920]   However, so fascinated by the code.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.360]   - What the hell code could they be?
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.640]   - I know, I know, I just like, don't understand.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:12.480]   - If alarm is one time only and January,
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:13.480]   I can't think of one one one.
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:15.840]   - It's gonna be like some kind of like Monday,
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:19.480]   it has to be something like some kind of no weekend thing.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:22.600]   I think it has to do with something like Saturday and Sunday,
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:26.160]   except that they're being treated differently in,
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.200]   I don't know.
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.960]   So Ronald says, delete all alarms, restart the phone,
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.880]   add alarms again, that should fix it.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:34.480]   - And we'll know tomorrow morning.
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.800]   - After I miss my flight.
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:39.400]   - You know, they don't put an alarm clock
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.080]   or a clock of any kind on the iPad.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.120]   Maybe this is why.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:48.120]   Remember that they didn't update the remote app
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.360]   for a long time and they said, well,
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:50.680]   it's because one guy wrote it
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:52.200]   and he's busy doing something else.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.840]   I'm sure only one person wrote this alarm clock app.
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:55.840]   - Was he busy doing something else?
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:59.080]   - I hope he's not writing launch code for ICBMs.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:02.560]   I hope he's found a gainful employee
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.080]   that where it doesn't matter if he gets it wrong.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:08.840]   It's just a weird bug.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:11.080]   - And what's odd about it is that I have gotten
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.760]   to the point where it is a major correction.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:13.960]   Like that is my alarm clock.
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.240]   - Oh, you use it. - It's my iPhone.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:17.520]   That's all I use to break up in my iPhone.
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:20.520]   And I've yet to say, I've downloaded a couple
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.360]   of different alarm clock apps and none of them
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:25.360]   have really worked as well as the alarm clock app.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:27.920]   The basic idea of make it really, really easy
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:32.280]   for me to set an alarm and then play a really noisy sound
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:34.480]   at the correct time to break me up.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:38.360]   - And do it whether I have it on mute or not.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:39.480]   That's the one thing that the alarm clock
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:43.280]   on the Apple version does is it'll play that loud tone
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:45.920]   no matter what you've done it with other alarms.
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.800]   I keep mine on silent almost all the time
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.640]   'cause I just don't like people knowing
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:51.120]   when I'm getting a phone call.
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:53.040]   So I can ignore it without anyone looking at me.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.800]   - I've downloaded alarm clocks that say,
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.040]   oh, well, the phone is asleep.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.960]   So I shouldn't wake up the phone so I could wake up the user.
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:01.880]   I've seen once it had the problem that you said.
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:04.620]   I've seen ones that have a beautiful interface,
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:06.320]   wonderful, easy how to set it.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:11.320]   But the alarm tone is a peep, peep, peep, peep.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:15.680]   As opposed to the built in, the digital tone
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:18.600]   that is part of the built in iOS collection
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:23.600]   is the best one because it ramps up from doo doo doo doo doo doo.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.960]   So no matter what else is going on inside the room,
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:28.200]   no matter what it can beep drive through everything
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:29.680]   and wake you the hell up.
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.800]   I don't understand why other alarm clock manufacturers
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.640]   makers don't understand this.
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:36.840]   Like peep, peep, peep.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:40.040]   - Pardon me, excuse me, you have to wait.
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:44.040]   - Do you have the problem where you have to change it?
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:45.400]   I have to change mine or I'll sleep.
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.760]   - Oh, my, my, your brain learns.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.960]   - Yeah. I once had a dream where I was in a room
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.760]   and it was this giant, everything was going beep, beep, beep.
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:54.080]   Like I was like, I had this,
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:56.040]   and I was like, what is going on?
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.440]   I can't, and I thought I was gonna go deaf
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.720]   and then I woke up.
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.440]   - Your brain hates you, man.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.520]   (laughing)
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:02.360]   - So kidding.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.040]   If it's willing to like camouflage
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.400]   to make sure that things stay going,
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.480]   I didn't have the problem for a while.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.440]   I used to, I think my brain understood that I would punish it
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:13.560]   if it didn't obey the rule of the alarm.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.040]   I wound up writing, writing some code
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:19.240]   that writing something for my power book on the nightstand
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:23.800]   that it would generate a random number between one and 50.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.840]   It would square, or it would square that number
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.720]   and then the alarm would go hooked up to speakers
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:30.240]   and it would not shut off until I,
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:32.040]   it would display that squared number.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.040]   - And you had that with a mask?
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.880]   - Until I figured out what the square root
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.040]   of that wasn't keyed it in.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:36.880]   - Wow.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.680]   - And then it only took like three or four days
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:42.160]   and I never slept through another alarm ever again.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:44.720]   - The truth is you don't, you guys, you don't need alarms.
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.720]   - I have to tell your brain when to wake up.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:47.880]   - You know that actually works really well.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:49.120]   - Of course it works well.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:49.960]   - This is a crutch.
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.720]   - What's funny is I can't go to sleep
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:53.680]   if I don't have, if I have to get up in the morning,
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.200]   I can't go to sleep without an alarm
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.040]   because I'm worried.
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:56.880]   - 'Cause you get worried.
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:57.720]   - I'm worried that I'll sleep through it
[00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:58.560]   and you don't trust your brain.
[00:59:58.560 --> 00:59:59.560]   - You need to trust your brain.
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.600]   - I now have a three year old though who,
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.440]   he'll wake you up.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.720]   - He comes by and says, yeah, he's ready for a moment.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.760]   - This morning, that's why I turned my alarm off
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.600]   was because he fell out of the bed.
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.760]   - Already awake were you?
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.320]   - Yes, yes I was.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:15.160]   I heard I was just awake enough to hear this pluck lump
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.840]   and then a lot of upset.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.680]   - Anyway, it was Deutsche Bank that said
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.000]   that the apple was gonna have a very good holiday season.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.680]   Deutsche Bank sent buyers out into a 50 apple store.
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:30.080]   - What are we guessing the final 12 to 14 million
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:30.920]   is the number I see.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:31.760]   - For the year.
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.600]   - For the year for iPad sales.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.960]   - I can't believe I undershot by that far.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.680]   I mean, I was aggressive.
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.920]   - I thought five million.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.920]   I was a little nervous when I made that bet with the VORAC.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.600]   I thought, this is about as aggressive
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.440]   as I'm willing to go.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.800]   - I think I said 8.6.
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:44.880]   - And you were huge.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:45.720]   You were huge.
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.880]   We all laughed and mocked at you.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:47.720]   - You did.
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:48.560]   - 12 to 15 million.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.400]   - This is why I bring it up.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.000]   - You know, it's because there was some serious mochage
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.160]   going on when I was the highest by far.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.560]   - Boy, did we underestimate it.
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.840]   - I did and I undershot.
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:02.200]   - I don't think the good news is only we're alone.
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.640]   I think the entire tech industry underestimated it.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.400]   Only Steve Jobs really knew.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.240]   - Now how am I gonna do a thing?
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.480]   Okay, you know what?
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:10.040]   You know what we have to do now.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.240]   New numbers, it's a new year.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.440]   - Oh, it's gonna be double that, right?
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.560]   It'd be 25 million.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:17.800]   - Huh?
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:18.640]   - Is that your final answer?
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.160]   - That's my conservative number, yeah.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.240]   - I'm gonna say 28 million.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.400]   - Yeah, 'cause you just wanna be a little bit better.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.240]   - I wanna--
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.120]   - No, no, I think it actually could very well be 40 million.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.320]   - Okay, well, if you could say 40 million,
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.320]   I'll say 28 million.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:31.080]   - Okay, well, but I'm gonna say 25, 25, 28.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:31.920]   - Andy?
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.400]   - I'm saying without a shadow of a doubt,
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.440]   it's going to be 18 million iPads.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.280]   - Here we go.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.960]   - Old for editing, I'm gonna say beyond any doubt,
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:44.760]   it's gonna be 21 million iPads.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.000]   Old for editing.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.520]   I'm gonna say beyond any doubt,
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.720]   it's gonna be 29 million iPads at least.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.320]   - One of those has to work.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.280]   - So it was to say 25 million in one.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.840]   - 'Cause then I was getting the surprise.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.760]   - I was getting the surprise for the totally gift card
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.600]   and for you if at the perfect time you edit in
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.200]   into the archives, the right one of those.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.680]   - Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank said
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:07.440]   in a note to investors today that checks over the holidays
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:10.560]   indicated Apple saw better than expected demands
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.200]   for both the iPad and this is important.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.040]   - The Mac.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.440]   - Consumer demand for the iPhone showed no signs
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.680]   of slowing down even with the Verizon,
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.620]   rumored Verizon phone hanging over AT&T's head.
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:27.400]   He checked at 50 Apple retail and partner stores
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.920]   found lines and crowds driving robust demand
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.160]   for the iPhone.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.480]   Despite this high demand,
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.080]   these checks found Apple was well prepared
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.480]   with few out of stock events.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:40.760]   Demand for the iPad, which remains largely unchallenged
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:41.960]   tracking ahead of his model,
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.400]   he's accordingly increased sales estimates
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.600]   for the fourth quarter to 6.5 million for 2010.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.520]   And you wanna know his number for 2011?
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:53.960]   28 million.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:54.800]   - I didn't even see that.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.640]   - Yep.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.160]   - He had estimated 22 million.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.600]   28 million.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:02.560]   - We'll see if we're on the mark.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:07.400]   - The number one iPad, the 32 gig with 3G connectivity,
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.880]   kinda in the middle there, that makes sense.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:14.960]   And the $9.99 price tag of the 11 inch MacBook Air
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.200]   drove a lot of sales.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.520]   - I was wondering, I was wondering how big
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.720]   that the Mac sales were just the 11 inch 'cause
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.880]   I do have to admit I have one and I really, really like it.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.600]   - Love it, it was my pick of the year.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.360]   - I have the 13 and the 11.
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:30.920]   - And, well that's interesting 'cause you got the 13
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:32.720]   for the SD card slot but you used the yellow.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.360]   - Well we got both of them because we were using them
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.880]   as, you know remember I told you we used keynote
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.000]   for lower thirds.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.360]   I mean wanted to try to find the smallest computer
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.920]   that can feed that in and turns out they're not quite,
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.680]   like we have to figure out how we're compressing them
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:45.520]   and everything else.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:48.000]   So they weren't playing back as well as we'd like them to.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.760]   But I have to admit now that we have them,
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.680]   the I'm really trying to figure out if I could fit
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:57.160]   my life into an 11 'cause it is, it's all I'm bringing
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.840]   to Vegas and then the big test will be when I go
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.520]   on Macmania 11.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.520]   - Are you taking the 11?
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.960]   - I'm gonna take the 11 and nothing else.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.560]   - Ooh he's going crazy.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:08.680]   - He's going to Antarctica with me.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:09.960]   - And I am gonna try to put Final Cut on it
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.160]   just to see what happens.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.400]   I think I can actually do one.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.400]   - That's insane.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.200]   - You go, that's nuts.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.300]   Let me know if it works.
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:21.200]   You only get 64 gigs or did you upgrade it?
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.600]   - No I think it's 60, I think it's.
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.240]   - No no I got the 48.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.040]   - I got the 4 mega RAM but I only got 60.
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:26.880]   - No I got the 128.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.640]   - 'Cause I figured I'm gonna be doing cloud
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.960]   if I need, I do bring, I will bring a USB external hard drive
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.240]   for photos and stuff.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.560]   - I finally moved almost everything off my computer
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:37.360]   'cause it's just, I can't, I have to give up
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:38.360]   on the internal drive.
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:39.460]   - Yeah.
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:40.760]   - I don't trust you anymore internal drive.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:43.320]   You will only get the system in applications.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:47.080]   - And with an SSD it's so fast.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:47.960]   God it feels good.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:51.280]   Anyway he says, he's upping his iPhone sales protections
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:54.440]   for the holiday period to 16 million for the last quarter.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:59.320]   He says, he expects Apple will sell.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.760]   Let's ask this question before I tell you
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.880]   how many iPhones will Apple sell this year?
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.920]   - 53 million.
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.320]   - You must be reading this guy's stuff.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.880]   - No is it Andy?
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:10.960]   What do you say?
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:14.400]   - I would put it in the low 40s with additional carriers.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.160]   - Is that what he said?
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:19.880]   - Analyst Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank says
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.640]   his original prediction for iPhone sales in 2011
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:29.120]   was, I had it right here, I scrolled past it.
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.960]   55 million, he's upping it to 60 million.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:36.120]   So you're very close, yeah Alex.
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.560]   - I think it's gonna be crazy big.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.840]   - He says that's even if Verizon doesn't come along.
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.360]   And he said if it's if Verizon comes along
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.040]   he says another five to seven million units.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:45.920]   I'd say 10.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:46.760]   - Yeah.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:49.640]   My dad will be pissed.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:53.440]   - Now he remember he's global, he's considering global sales.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.760]   - Right.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.160]   - And GSM is much bigger than CDMA everywhere else in the world.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.320]   Wow.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:03.160]   - It's amazing to see like when I'm in Africa,
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.680]   it means how I can have iPhones that are all jail,
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.040]   I mean the only way to get them is the Smuggleman
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.680]   and jailbreak them.
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:09.960]   - Incidentally, yeah you mentioned that.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:10.800]   - No everybody's got them.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.160]   - And it was that way in China, but now you can buy them,
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.640]   but it was that way for watching.
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:17.480]   Apple will report its earnings for the last quarter
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:21.040]   of the calendar year, first fiscal quarter, January 18th.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.240]   So two weeks from today.
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.880]   It will be good, it will be good news.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.680]   - It's well, you know it's not gonna be bad news.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.320]   - Did you see that they broke 300 billion in market cap?
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.160]   - Yeah.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.480]   - Yeah.
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.320]   - What do they pass that?
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.960]   - No, yeah exactly.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.280]   The fact that they're now competing
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.840]   with energy companies for market caps.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.120]   - That's only one.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.520]   There's only there's the only one in front of them.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.840]   - And they're catching up.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.640]   - No.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:46.120]   I think one of the things they're gonna do
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:48.280]   with that extra campus that they bought from HP,
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:51.680]   they're gonna build a Scrooge McDuck style money crib.
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.240]   And they just, you know, that's just part
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.880]   of their fitness program, two laps,
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:58.280]   every single day between the hundreds of the $50 coins.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.040]   - You know they were, they were never bathed
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.560]   in dollar bills, you've never lived.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.600]   - Well you know, there was a lot of talk at Apple
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.040]   about building their own printing press
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.760]   and then they decided to just keep on making iPads.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:08.600]   - Yeah.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.440]   - It's more lucrative.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.560]   (laughing)
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.480]   - You could print money or you could sell iPads.
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.320]   - Yeah.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.600]   - I hope, I really hope that they use some of this
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.080]   to go on one hell of a spending spree.
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.480]   - They have, what should they buy?
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.320]   - Yeah, what should they buy?
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.040]   Wait a minute, I'll say, don't say.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.800]   - We're gonna take a break.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:26.640]   - That's called a tease.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:29.880]   - Talk about carbonite, you were talking about backup.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.960]   This couldn't have been better time.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.600]   Did you plan this Alex Lindsey?
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:33.640]   - I did not.
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.720]   - You were talking about how you don't trust
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.600]   the local backup because of disaster.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.680]   - You gotta put a note.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.200]   - Anything that's important has to be on the club.
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:42.040]   - It's gotta be in the club.
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:42.880]   - It's gotta be a copy on that.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.200]   - And you said it should be automatic?
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.040]   - Yep.
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:47.480]   - Yeah, I wouldn't say, I don't have one copy,
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.680]   one backup of anything.
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:49.520]   Two copies, not enough.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.680]   You need three copies.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.800]   - One leased, one local, one somewhere else,
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:53.640]   and one on the club.
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.480]   - Yep.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.320]   - And then you're safe.
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:59.560]   - Yeah, and actually the three to one backup formulation
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:03.320]   that Peter Krogh came up with is three copies of all data
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.280]   that can include the original and two backups.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.760]   Two different media.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.920]   So you don't wanna put all your eggs in the DVD basket.
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.080]   - You know, or all your eggs in the online basket.
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.760]   - Someone who's been slowly back in,
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.160]   re-backing up all my DVDs and CDs.
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.760]   If you have stuff on CD and DVD.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.680]   - You need to get off of there.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.760]   - Get it off.
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.800]   - I found some great, great,
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.000]   I have this great home movie I shot at my kids.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.600]   And I put it on CD at a buy movie and it's flaking.
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.840]   So I got some of it back, but I didn't get it all back.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.960]   And I was just like, I cannot believe I did that.
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:32.960]   Cannot believe it.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.120]   So now, you know, yeah, you gotta.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.840]   - Three, two, one, three copies,
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.880]   two different kinds of media.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.040]   One of them must be off-site.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.800]   And this is, now, and you mentioned earlier,
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:45.600]   the other important criterion, automatic.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:46.440]   You don't wanna have to think about it.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:48.080]   - It's gotta be in the background.
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.480]   Carbonite does all of that.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:51.800]   - Well, not all of it, but it does this,
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.600]   the copy in the cloud and it does it automatically.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:55.800]   It does it very affordably.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.520]   Mac or PC, $55 a year for all the data.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.040]   Now somebody sent me an email.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:01.880]   I can't remember what he said.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.200]   He said, like I had to terabyte a data.
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.520]   And he said, it was gonna take weeks.
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.360]   Well, of course it is.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:08.480]   It's dependent on the backup speed of your--
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.680]   - It was all election.
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:10.920]   - It's not magic.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:12.360]   (laughs)
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:15.920]   But it will, the price is the same.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.760]   - Is it any drives hooked up to your--
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.200]   - No, because if you think about it,
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.320]   and people ask me about that a lot too,
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.920]   and I defend carbonite,
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.120]   because all people would have to do
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.000]   is just keep plugging in new drives
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.840]   and you could back up an infinite amount of data for $55.
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:32.400]   So what they do is say your internal drive,
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:34.480]   personal data on your internal drive.
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:35.920]   I think that's completely fair.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.400]   - I have a really big internal drive.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.000]   - Yeah, but now here's the other side of this.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.880]   And this is why we offer the two week trial.
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.760]   It does depend on your upstream bandwidth.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.040]   So if you, you know--
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:46.880]   - The other thing--
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.720]   - It can only go as fast as your index.
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.560]   - Well, and not only that,
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.320]   you gotta remember that if you're using Comcast,
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:53.160]   there's a 250 gig per month limit.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.800]   And if you go over that,
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.600]   they don't tell you what will happen,
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:57.720]   but mostly they'll just turn you off.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:58.560]   - And that includes that.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:59.560]   - That'll put you on the trickle.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.560]   - So what I would suggest is do the trial,
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.120]   do the two week trial.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:06.240]   The first full backup could take weeks,
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:08.720]   but from then on, the incremental backups are in real time
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:09.560]   because you're not,
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:10.720]   unless you're creating a lot of data,
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.080]   I wouldn't back up your massive video files.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.080]   - No, I don't.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:14.920]   - I back up.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:16.720]   The things that I really worry about backing up
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:19.120]   are obviously my kids' photos.
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.320]   - That absolutely.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.360]   - Key sample files from the company.
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:24.080]   It's not like I try to back up everything we create
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.880]   because I create too much data.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.880]   But a lot of the stuff like that I would really feel sick
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.040]   if I lost, that's the stuff I make sure is in the club.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:33.040]   - You bet.
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.560]   $55 a year, try it free.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.400]   Here's what you do, you go to carbonite.com/
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.920]   I have it right here.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:44.240]   Macbreak, carbonite.com/macbreak.
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.280]   You try it free for two weeks,
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.240]   you don't even need a credit card.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.360]   It's very easy.
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:49.040]   If you like it, and I know you will,
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.640]   I want you to also use the offer code Macbreak
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.640]   when you check out at carbonite.com
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.680]   and you'll get two free months.
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.800]   $55 a year minus the two free months,
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.320]   so it's a very good deal.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:03.760]   Backup done right, offsiteautomaticcarbonite.com
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.040]   for PCOR, Mac.
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:13.360]   Skype, have you tried the new Skype yet, Andy?
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.480]   It apparently has video.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:19.120]   - Yep, I got it like I did before it was released.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.840]   - I ask you 'cause you hate Skype, so I'm just kidding.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.160]   (laughing)
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.160]   - You're on to check.
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.560]   - I don't hate Skype, I just hate it every time it fails
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:28.480]   to work and every time it does something stupid
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.800]   that a smarter program would not screw up.
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:31.640]   - Right.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:36.360]   - Again, all it has to do to really get into my good races
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:40.000]   is that if you Skype, if you see two cameras hooked up
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.360]   to this machine right here, and you can guess
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.440]   which one do you wanna use, why don't you go
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:45.760]   with the last one that I use?
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.400]   Or the one that I use all the time,
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.840]   not the one that I never, ever, ever use.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:50.920]   So that's the best.
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.480]   - Now this new Skype is available today.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:54.640]   Does it automatically upgrade?
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.040]   If I have Skype installed, we'll let's say,
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.800]   oh, you have a new version?
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:00.720]   - I do not know, oddly enough, I do not have Skype installed
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.320]   on my iPhone before.
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.160]   - Let me look at this.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.160]   Let me look.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:06.840]   - Audible is updated.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.080]   We rule is updated, Tango video calls.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.240]   No, it didn't say that, so maybe I either--
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.560]   - Maybe it's a new downloaded date.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.640]   It is definitely available.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:14.480]   - Yeah.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.400]   - It works, it actually works very well,
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.360]   even over a 3G.
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:22.960]   I did, my big test of it was, I just,
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:27.960]   I left my MacBooks, I side camera, pointed at HBO.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:34.360]   And then went out to Chipotle to have my iPhone
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:37.120]   at his little dinner, and watched like Carrie Fisher's
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.680]   one old show. - That's a good idea.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:40.320]   - My Skype over 3G.
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.160]   - Wow.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.720]   - And with the understanding that this is a 3G connection,
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:45.800]   it worked perfectly fine.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.520]   The audio was fine, it was keeping up with the video,
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.360]   just fine.
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.880]   The video almost always was very, very good.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:54.800]   The frame rate, when it dropped down,
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.400]   it was down to maybe five or six frames per second,
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.320]   and that was dropping down.
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.000]   And it was reliable enough that when it disconnected
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.520]   after about 52, 53 minutes, I felt as though,
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:09.800]   over an unstable 3G connection, I felt as though
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.280]   it had really done its job well.
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.600]   Over Wi-Fi, it works perfectly great.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.640]   And I also like the fact that it's extremely well integrated
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.000]   into the rest of the Skype app.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.680]   It's just, they've integrated into the Skype app,
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:24.720]   as well as Apple integrated FaceTime into the phone app.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.600]   - So would you use this in lieu of FaceTime,
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.480]   or is it in addition to FaceTime?
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:29.880]   - Well, the two very different things,
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.680]   the great thing about FaceTime is that it's part
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:34.000]   of the phone system, so that at any time,
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.040]   if you're talking to somebody,
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.800]   who's, if you get an incoming phone call,
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:37.880]   or you're gonna play with the phone rings,
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.200]   you answer the phone, and then 10 seconds later,
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.840]   you can be chatting on FaceTime.
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.840]   With Skype, it's always gonna be a case
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.240]   of leaving that application running in the background,
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.800]   and that's gonna eat up old.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:50.120]   Even when you're not chatting, that's gonna eat up power.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.720]   - When Skype is a crazy power hungry app,
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.320]   when it's in the background.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:55.160]   - I don't really-- - I don't really--
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.120]   - Oh man, it just sucks it right out of there.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.560]   - Oh, I guess you do get an update,
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.640]   'cause I didn't realize, but I am updated.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.480]   So it must have done the update, and I just didn't notice.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.560]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.840]   - Well, I talked to Skype before I was released,
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.960]   and they were saying that the power demands
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.600]   really depend on how many users,
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.000]   how many people you have in your contacts list.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.400]   - Oh wow. - Because it's the load
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.920]   is based in the background,
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.160]   somewhat based on that.
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:20.640]   - That's definitely my problem.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.600]   - Yeah, so I certainly wouldn't have a setup
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.400]   so that I'm just wandering around,
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.120]   not expecting an incoming Skype call,
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.720]   and just trusting that it would work out well for me.
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:32.240]   But most, my question says,
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:33.240]   I shouldn't speak for most people,
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:35.120]   it just seems as though most of the time,
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:38.120]   when I talk to people about how they use Skype,
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.680]   it's not they hang around waiting for a call to come in.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:44.640]   It's always, they're Facebooking each other and commenting,
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.600]   "Hey, let's do Skype, like tomorrow at seven, we'll talk."
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:51.000]   So I think it's a very, very nicely done app,
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.040]   it works really well.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:56.120]   And if it's one more reason why I can now travel
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:57.840]   without having to take my MacBook with me,
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:00.880]   'cause I can now do Mac break from my phone,
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.560]   I'll definitely take it.
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:03.400]   - Is this great?
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.840]   I just called myself, and it's working great.
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.880]   I found that over Wi-Fi,
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:09.320]   I didn't think the quality was as good as FaceTime,
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.080]   but over 3G it was much better than FaceTime,
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.560]   'cause FaceTime do 3G.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:13.640]   - No, that's why it was better,
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.120]   it was much better than FaceTime.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:16.640]   - Much better, yeah, exactly.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.720]   - So I'm gonna turn on the camera,
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:21.440]   you can use front or back, okay?
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.360]   - And you can switch it in the middle of the call,
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.760]   so that's not a problem.
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.640]   - Oh, that's nice.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.120]   So let's see here, I'm gonna bring this up on our screen,
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:34.680]   and let's just take a look at how it does here.
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:39.200]   I'm gonna have to push some buttons on our lovely TriCaster,
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:43.360]   and here I am.
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.240]   Well, that's pretty good.
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.480]   That actually is great.
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:50.240]   - I would think of it as,
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:52.800]   like I wouldn't, I guess if I was in trouble,
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.880]   I would, I would,
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:57.520]   if this was my only choice,
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:58.760]   maybe I'd try to do it with Mac break,
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:03.360]   but I just changed the angle for some reason,
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:04.600]   I don't know.
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:05.720]   - What do you mean changing the angle?
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.120]   Rotate it, does it do the FaceTime rotation?
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:08.960]   - It's like the other one.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.960]   - No, it does, yeah.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:10.800]   - Yeah.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.880]   - Now, are you on 3G or what?
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:12.720]   - That's Wi-Fi.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.560]   - That's Wi-Fi.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.680]   - Okay, so it's not a fair test.
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:16.920]   I could put it on 3G.
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.640]   Shall I do it?
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.480]   Shall I put it on 3G?
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.040]   - And I think it's a little behind.
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.600]   - Well, better than being a big behind.
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.880]   - Wait, wait, go like this.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:26.960]   - Okay, ready?
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:29.880]   - Oh, it looked pretty instant.
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:30.720]   - It's almost instant.
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.560]   - Yeah.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:38.560]   (
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.560]   That's pretty quick.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:40.800]   - Is that the taste test?
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.240]   - Yeah, when I looked at it,
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.400]   for people listening at home,
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:46.200]   there's nothing to see here, move along.
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.720]   - You missed Leo licking his iPhone on Skype,
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.040]   but it did it almost instantly.
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:53.360]   Now, let's switch off, I'm gonna hang up,
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.480]   and I'm gonna switch to,
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.680]   I presume I can't switch to 3G without losing the call,
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:58.880]   so I'll hang up and try switching.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.240]   This is pretty cool, it's free.
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.080]   - Yeah.
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.520]   - I think it works great, I was very upset.
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:07.440]   - Skype, when it's true that when FaceTime came out,
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.040]   Skype said, "We'd love to do FaceTime,"
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.240]   and Steve said, "Yeah, it's gonna be open."
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:13.440]   I guess Skype gave up waiting.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:16.320]   - Yeah, yeah, that's what a big loss for Apple,
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:19.680]   because people don't have, people don't do FaceTime.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:23.440]   They do, Skype has really embedded itself as the standard.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.560]   If people know how to do video conferencing,
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.000]   or video chat, they're doing it via Skype.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.360]   And if I'm gonna have to teach a relative of mine
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.560]   who's never done this before, how to do chat,
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.840]   I'm certainly gonna install Skype.
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:37.320]   I'm not gonna try to, I'm not gonna give them
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:38.760]   one of the three or four alternatives
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.880]   that will work for point to point,
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:43.560]   but it's not really an ongoing thing, is it?
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.880]   - And this will go to desktops,
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:47.920]   it will go to Windows PCs, it will go to,
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:50.080]   I don't know what other phones they've installed this on,
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.400]   I should look at Skype on Android.
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.040]   - They're doing, well, they're doing,
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.120]   they said that they make, rolling it out
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:58.080]   for Android devices in 2011 is a big priority,
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:01.120]   but they said that the hitch is, as you can guess,
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.840]   so many different pieces of hardware out there.
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:06.200]   This is a software that requires a lot of intimacy
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.400]   with the graphics hardware of the device.
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.880]   And so they don't wanna just roll out a version
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.920]   for one model of Android phone,
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.200]   they wanna wait until they have enough models out there
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.440]   that they feel as though, if you have an Android phone,
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:21.200]   you've got a really good shot of finding a version of Skype
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:24.160]   available for your device that will work with video.
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.880]   - So now I'm placing a 3G video call,
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:29.120]   we'll see if that, can't see your video, right?
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:30.680]   I have to turn it on, you have to turn it on each time,
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:31.840]   which I think is a good thing.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:32.680]   - Yeah.
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:34.560]   No surprises.
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:37.400]   - Yeah, you wanna try, let me see,
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.200]   I think I actually set up, like a,
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:40.440]   that looks pretty good, I got it.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.600]   This is gonna, you know, so this is,
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:46.040]   wow, this is 3G, it's not nearly the frame rate,
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:48.680]   I think the quality is the same, roughly the same,
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.520]   but the frame rate is slower.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.680]   - We'll also realize that everything in that frame
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.040]   is changing from frame to frame.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.040]   - Right, I should just make it stack.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:59.920]   - If you do, yeah, if you have the phone perched on something
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:01.360]   and it's a talking head sort of,
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.960]   - Oh yeah.
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.200]   (laughing)
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.600]   - I'll stick it right there.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.280]   - It's like you want us to scratch behind the ears
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:12.040]   and call you a good boy.
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.040]   - Who's your good host?
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:13.880]   - Your good host.
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.040]   - Your good host.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.840]   - All right, now let's try, I haven't moved.
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:17.680]   - What's your cookie?
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:19.600]   - I mean, I haven't moved, but this,
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:20.720]   it's still, you know, you could tell
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:24.040]   they've degraded the quality of the video considerably.
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:26.280]   - Yeah, it's, you know, in the frame rates lower,
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.880]   but it keeps up.
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:28.720]   - Yeah.
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.840]   - You could have a useful conversation this way.
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.400]   - Yeah, this is, yeah.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.560]   - Now, I stand by my contention that
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:39.400]   this is a very limited video calling,
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.040]   it's a very limited appeal.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:44.200]   You know, people with new babies.
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.720]   - Well, I think that, yeah, I think having kids
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.800]   and video calling me able to call your parents
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:49.800]   and stuff like that and show them videos.
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.200]   - It's a very specific market though,
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.000]   I don't think it's a general market.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.480]   - Well, I'm not gonna call my wife using Skype.
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.880]   - The one that I'm surprised someone hasn't built yet,
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:59.560]   and maybe they probably are built in.
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.920]   I don't, you know, is, I would call,
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.080]   if I was gonna build an app,
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.560]   I'd build one called First Responder,
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.440]   and I'd put them into 911 things and let people,
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:08.840]   like, you know, an app for your iPhone
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:10.280]   that you can actually attach to,
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.400]   you know, you can say, I'm seeing this right now.
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:13.240]   - No, that would be true.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:15.800]   - You know, that would be, that would be really useful.
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:16.800]   (laughing)
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.400]   With a GPS permission.
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.040]   - Police and fire, they should get on board
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.960]   the chat rule, Ben Wagon, as well as everybody else.
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.480]   - Well, the thing is, is that we know who you are,
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:26.760]   and we know exactly where you are,
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.600]   so posting something that didn't work
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.840]   would probably not be a lot of fun.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:31.840]   - Interesting.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.560]   - But I think that that would be really useful
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.640]   when it comes to, this is what's happening right now,
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.600]   and I need help.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.440]   - Yeah.
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:39.800]   - I follow it, I can't get up.
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.400]   - I put Skype way up higher though,
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.640]   on my attention list, when I realized that,
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:45.680]   I think there's a generation that is using Skype
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:48.080]   more heavily as their communications infrastructure
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:51.040]   than any other generation that came after it,
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:54.400]   because when I got a little bit more active on Facebook,
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.720]   and now I've got my nieces and my nephews,
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:57.880]   I'm sort of following them,
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:59.480]   and you see what people have been writing
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.320]   on each other's boards,
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.760]   and that phase just keeps coming up,
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.520]   hey, let's Skype tomorrow night,
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:07.080]   or let's continue this over Skype,
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.360]   like on Tuesday, when I'm out of my classes.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:12.960]   So there's a lot more video calling being done amongst
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:13.800]   the younger generation.
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.520]   - No, I do it all the time, on the desktop.
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:18.280]   - Well, I do it every day, but I mean, on the desktop,
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:20.080]   I just don't know how about on the phone,
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.200]   how useful that is.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:23.040]   I mean, my kids do a lot of video chatting,
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.880]   I never see them use a phone for it.
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.600]   - I think that it means that you can walk away.
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.520]   - Say again, Andy?
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:32.080]   - Sorry, have they ever had a good app for it before?
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:33.800]   - Well, they've had FaceTime, we'll see.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:34.640]   - But I think this is a test.
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.520]   - I do think this is a testament to the fact that,
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:40.640]   as Andy said, Apple really gave up a lot of initiative
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:43.520]   when they did not open up FaceTime more quickly,
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:45.520]   because the thing is, is that there are a lot of people
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.720]   now they're gonna create all the stuff,
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.480]   and Apple, you know, and Skype's now there,
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:51.840]   and FaceTime should have been something that they immediately,
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.240]   or within a couple of months, had an API
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.880]   that people could use to build all this stuff out,
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:59.480]   and without doing that, I don't know if FaceTime
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:00.840]   will be that successful.
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:01.680]   - Yeah.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:07.360]   Do we have any speculation that we'd like to make
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.520]   about an Apple event when it will be?
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:12.760]   Some are saying Apple and Sutter says,
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:16.040]   by Valentine's Day, I think that's pretty safe to say.
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:17.360]   - Sooner? - Yeah, I--
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:20.960]   - Yeah, I really don't know what to say.
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:22.960]   I don't, the fact is that Macworld Expo
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.880]   is now the last week in January.
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:28.360]   I think that'll push an Apple announcement into February.
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.520]   - They don't want to compete with Macworld Expo.
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:33.480]   - Well, also, yeah, I mean, well, it's not so much company.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:36.560]   It's more like they want control over the event,
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:39.600]   they want control over the news that happens out there.
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.240]   And also it'd be way, way more too convenient for me
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.840]   if I happen to be in San Francisco that week,
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:46.480]   having paid my own way coming in.
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:48.360]   If I, they make sure that I don't have to come back
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:50.720]   in a week later for their special event.
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:53.240]   So for that reason, I think that they're good.
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:55.600]   - If this is the Andy Inatco reason.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:58.200]   - But yeah, I would say first or second week in February.
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.440]   - I think it depends on whether they are,
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.280]   where there's gonna be a lot of new features.
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.680]   If Verizon does announce it this week,
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.280]   I think then we don't see another announcement
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:08.880]   until the new iPad and that'll be March.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:11.400]   - I don't think, I think they'll,
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.600]   they're gonna wanna say, they're gonna wanna answer
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.600]   all the news is coming out of CES.
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:17.720]   And they're gonna wanna say, no, no, no,
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:20.760]   I know that this Motorola tablet looks kind of vaguely
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:23.520]   iPad shaped, it will displace the exact same amount
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:27.120]   of oxygen from the atmosphere in your office as an iPad.
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.600]   However, it ain't no iPad and it certainly ain't gonna
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:32.480]   be the iPad that we're gonna be selling in three months time.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:34.600]   Let me show you what that's gonna be all about.
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.800]   So I don't think they're gonna let a lot of time go by
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:40.040]   after CES before they show off the iPad too.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.400]   - One more story in the room.
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:44.080]   Then we're gonna get your picks of the week.
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.840]   So this was an interesting story that I just picked up.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:50.320]   Sony, and I imagine others will do this,
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:55.320]   is embedding special features into the iTunes versions
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:59.200]   of its movies, if you buy, not rent.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.840]   Features that are not currently available even on DVD.
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:03.640]   For instance, you'll be able to,
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.200]   and I haven't verified this, although apparently
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.320]   the Will Ferrell movie, the other guys has this feature
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:11.600]   along with Salt, the Angelina Jolie movie.
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.600]   I just can't bring myself to spend $20
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.200]   for either of those.
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:17.560]   - No, I saw Salt on the plane.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.480]   - Should I buy it?
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:19.320]   - No.
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.160]   - I wanna test this feature.
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:21.000]   So good ride.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.120]   - Two features, ready?
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:25.200]   One, you can open a text search and you can find anywhere
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:27.240]   in the script and jump to that point in the movie.
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.080]   - That's good.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.000]   - That's pretty awesome, isn't it?
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:29.840]   - That's very cool.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:34.040]   - Yeah, and the other feature is the ability to take
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.240]   and embed clips.
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:38.240]   You could say, take this much, send a link,
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.760]   and now there's an embedded clip on my friend's blog,
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:42.080]   or my blog.
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:43.440]   - How does it--
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.320]   - It must be pulling from a server somewhere,
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.880]   'cause it's obviously not pulling from your copy.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:49.160]   I don't know, maybe it does make a copy.
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:50.440]   All right, I'm gonna spend the money.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:51.280]   I could see that.
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.440]   I could see now, but I need to spend the money.
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.400]   - You take one for the team.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.000]   - Take one for the team, I'll buy it.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.240]   Maybe before the show's over, I'll have downloaded it.
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:59.080]   I doubt it.
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:02.200]   Worth a try.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:05.520]   Let us take a break, we will get your picks of the week.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:08.080]   And just a moment, my friends, but first,
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.720]   I would like to say hello to you
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:11.920]   and all our friends across the land
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:17.360]   and talk a little bit about Audible.com.
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.640]   Audible is that great resource for anybody
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:21.800]   who spends any time in the car, at the gym,
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.520]   anywhere where you can't hold a book,
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.400]   but would like to get some reading done.
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:29.280]   I am loving, loving, loving, loving.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:32.960]   Keith Richards' biography, Life, and I'm still reading it.
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:34.640]   I know I've been talking about it for a long time,
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:37.240]   'cause it's a long book, but I just can't tell you
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:38.440]   how much I like that.
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:40.920]   And I highly recommend it, but I know Andy
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.680]   will have a recommendation as well.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:43.800]   So here's the deal.
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:45.520]   If you go to Audible.com, take a look around.
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.960]   I mean, this thing is a big site, 75,000 books.
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:52.640]   All categories, including best sellers,
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:57.080]   classics, business, master, sorry,
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:01.080]   mysteries and thrillers, romance, science, technology,
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:03.440]   self-help, I mean, on and on and on.
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:06.400]   All kinds of books, 75,000 total.
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:09.880]   In fact, that's really the challenge to come here
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.280]   and say, "Well, well."
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.880]   And I want your first book to be a great book.
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:15.040]   I want it to be one that you realize the potential
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:16.160]   of this platform.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:19.080]   Great readers, great books,
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.600]   and you can listen to them anywhere.
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:23.400]   I live for Audible.com.
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:25.560]   Now, I wanna ask you, Andy and Ico,
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:26.880]   what you're reading these days,
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:29.640]   'cause we need to find a good recommendation.
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:32.920]   - Well, I'm halfway through a really interesting book
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:35.120]   that's kind of given me extra perspective
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.000]   on how technology gets developed and marketed and used.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.640]   And it's actually, it has something to do with digital technology.
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:47.440]   It's called "The Gun" by C.J. Chivers, C-H-I-V-E-R-S.
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:50.760]   And it's a wonderful book about the development
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:55.040]   and the reality of the Kalashnikov rifle, the AK-47,
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.160]   that uses this gun,
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:01.280]   the most, I think he describes it as the most ubiquitous gun
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.720]   anywhere in warfare.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:05.240]   And traces, uses it sort of as the hub
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.640]   to tell a lot of different stories about how wars are fought,
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.800]   the sort of people who are fighting these wars,
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:13.120]   how weapon systems get made,
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.600]   why some of them are successful,
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.080]   why some of them are failures.
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:18.880]   And then some of them are just about the development
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:20.840]   of this product itself.
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:23.760]   It's a humongously successful product.
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:26.480]   If you set aside the horrible things that it does.
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:30.800]   And the lessons that it teaches about how important it is
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:33.760]   to know how a certain thing is going to be used.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:37.760]   The lesson being that it's not an elegant rifle,
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:40.320]   it's not necessarily very, very accurate,
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.920]   but it's 10 pounds, it's really, really light.
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:46.920]   You can make them extremely easily and they always work.
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:48.800]   That's the point of the AK-47.
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.320]   It always functions.
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.760]   If you take care of it, it functions.
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:53.600]   If you don't take care of it, it functions.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.960]   If you bury it in the sand for five years,
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:58.600]   come back and dig it up and rinse it out in dirty water,
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:00.080]   it will function.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:01.680]   One of the most interesting sections of it
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:04.440]   is when he compares it to the weapons
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:06.840]   that were being issued to troops in Vietnam,
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:09.520]   which were precision instruments,
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:13.120]   pride of American engineering and construction and craftsmanship,
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:16.480]   but they're very, very fussy and they required skilled people
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:19.240]   who know how to operate this weapon to keep it running.
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:22.280]   And if you didn't, if you admitted it as a certain step
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:24.440]   in its maintenance, a daily maintenance routine,
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.920]   it would jam at a very, very bad time.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:28.720]   Meanwhile, these soldiers were fighting against people
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.560]   who were exactly.
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.520]   We're fighting against people who are armed with these weapons.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:34.040]   That's simply always, always worked.
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:36.440]   So I'm only about halfway through it right now.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:40.360]   And sometimes it's, he tells every part of the story,
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:43.320]   going back a hundred years, well before the development
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.640]   of the weapon itself to just talk about
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:50.440]   how brutal the idea of finding live bodies
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.600]   to shoot weapons for your cause is
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:57.160]   and how functional the AK-47 is in that sort of struggle.
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:59.760]   Sometimes he gets into engineering,
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:02.680]   sometimes he gets into the very, very personal level of,
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:05.120]   here's what it is like, here's what it's like
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.960]   to be shot at by an AK-47.
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:09.160]   Here's what it's like being a field of battle
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:11.640]   and be able to tell that this one has,
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:16.480]   this one has, it's so easy to make this sound glib.
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:18.400]   I hope I don't make it sound that way.
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:21.960]   Just like you might have here a car drive by
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:24.480]   and you know that well, this was based on a Chevy engine,
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:26.080]   but it's actually on a different block.
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.240]   This one was manufactured in a plant and Plymouth,
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:30.200]   but this one was put together in the plant
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:33.720]   and in the Southern United States
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:36.320]   because you can sort of tell about the way it rattles
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.560]   that each AK-47, the ones that are made
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.560]   by under certain licenses, by certain plants,
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:42.480]   have a certain distinctive sound,
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:45.040]   others that are being done as a counterfeit,
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.120]   also have a distinctive sound.
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:48.240]   That will tell you where you should aim your fire
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.320]   because those guys are probably the people
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:52.600]   that we bought the guns for to fight on our sides.
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:54.520]   Those are the guys who probably are using the guns
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.120]   that we bought 10 years ago for this,
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:59.080]   and if not, was defected as now shooting at us instead.
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:01.560]   Such a, it's so fascinating on so many different levels.
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.600]   - I've got it. - And this sounds great.
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:04.760]   - Yeah. - Michael Prichard,
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.960]   one of Audible's best narrators reads it too,
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:09.280]   so it sounds like a great title.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:10.200]   - This could be yours for free,
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:11.680]   but if that's not your cup of tea,
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:13.800]   there's 75,000 other choices.
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:16.800]   Audible.com/Macbreak, when you go there,
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:19.280]   you'll sign up for the gold account.
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.880]   That gives you a book a month.
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.280]   First one's free, first month's free
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:24.720]   and yours to keep forever, you can cancel it at any time.
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:26.960]   When you're there, also look at the free for members section
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:29.640]   because members get a lot of free stuff.
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:33.040]   It's just a fantastic resource.
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:35.080]   It's kind of my library these days.
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:36.760]   I haven't been in a library in years.
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:39.720]   I spend time almost every day at Audible.com.
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:42.640]   Audible.com/Macbreak, give it a try.
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:45.160]   I think you will like a new Orcing Scott Cardbook.
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:46.560]   I just see, oopsie.
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.120]   - I get excited. - It's how I clean my house.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.640]   - Yeah. - Oh my gosh, yes.
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:52.680]   Like anything that I'm doing that,
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.480]   driving, cleaning my house,
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:57.080]   doing things that I don't really wanna do
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:59.200]   is usually when I am listening to a book
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.800]   'cause it doesn't require enough of my brain
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:01.800]   that I couldn't do that.
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:03.360]   That's why I don't wanna do it.
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.920]   But it allows me then to absorb some new cool information.
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:06.960]   - I love it.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.320]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.560]   We'll start with you, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:12.480]   - I've got two, one for my iPhone, one for my computer.
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:14.080]   - 1000s of dollars, one free.
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:15.520]   Okay. - They're both,
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:16.920]   they're both very inexpensive.
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:18.720]   - We're taking one of your, and we're borrowing.
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:20.040]   - One is free, the one for the Mac is free.
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:22.920]   We're borrowing one of your picks, the KeyPro Recorder.
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:23.760]   - Yes.
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:25.080]   - For our CES coverage, so thank you.
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.000]   - You make fun of it.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.560]   - Yeah, not making fun of it now.
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:28.400]   - Yeah. - That guy.
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.240]   - I wanna buy one.
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:30.480]   - It's awesome.
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:33.360]   It is so-- - I'm listening to your picks.
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:34.200]   - So two of them.
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:35.600]   One is, I was talking about stereo
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.440]   and I've been doing a lot of stereo stuff.
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:40.560]   This is free, it's called Stereo Splicer.
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:43.560]   And it's on, I don't know who makes it actually.
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.360]   It was one of those things that I would,
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:46.200]   so here's the problem,
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:48.800]   you get these Fuji W1s or W3s.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:52.800]   And the software that comes with the Fuji is useless.
[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:55.560]   So it's a great camera, the software is useless.
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:57.800]   Don't even install it 'cause it'll just make you angry.
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:59.040]   - It'll just make you frustrated.
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:31:59.880]   - I hate it.
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:02.000]   - I hate it, I know, I hate to bundle that crap in.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.200]   - But it's so bad, it's completely useless.
[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:07.200]   I don't mean it's bad, like kinda not working.
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:09.920]   It is like, don't even, just burn the CD.
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:11.520]   So you just-- - Do you use the Canon software
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:12.440]   or the Nikon software?
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:13.800]   - No, don't use the Canon-- - No, don't use the main
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:15.200]   but Faxxers software. - But the Fuji one
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:16.440]   is the worst of all of these.
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:18.040]   And so, so don't do that.
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:20.560]   They should just buy this guy, they should pay this guy.
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:23.040]   So this is, it's an application.
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:24.360]   Oh, and then there was a PC version,
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:26.160]   a shareware PC version.
[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:29.600]   So I had to relaunch into PC in the bootcamp
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:32.440]   every single time I wanted to convert to 3D.
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:35.240]   This one's called Stereo Splicer.
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:39.480]   And it is a free app as far as I know.
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:41.160]   And it's in beta.
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:44.840]   And I think it's on a guy's mobile media account.
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:46.080]   - Looks like it's on a media account.
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:47.800]   - Yeah, and so I really feel bad--
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:48.640]   - We'll put the URL in the show now.
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.400]   - We're about to crush it. - It's ridiculous.
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:53.760]   - So, but it's a, anyway, so it is this guy,
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:56.200]   you know, it's some smart programmer who has needed it
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:57.560]   for his W1 and W3.
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:01.360]   What happens is they create 3D AVIs and MPOs.
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.640]   Apple should support MPO for aperture.
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:05.120]   I'm not saying that they will, but they should.
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:08.080]   If they're listening, they should support MPOs.
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:10.200]   And what it lets you do is you can open them up,
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:11.960]   you can change the parallax, you can export it.
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:14.160]   It has all the features that you basically need
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:18.480]   to have some fun with your 3D camera, and it is free.
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:21.320]   So definitely, if you're thinking about playing around,
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:24.400]   I have to say, the W3 is the most fun I've had
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:25.520]   with a camera for a long time.
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:28.960]   And I do a lot of photography, $350, $400,
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:31.240]   it's really a lot of fun, but you need this application
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.080]   to make it fun.
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:34.000]   If you just get the software with it,
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.680]   you will just be, you'll hate Fuji,
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:38.080]   and you'll hate the camera, and this makes it fun.
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:42.280]   So anyway, second recommendation, so that's Stereo's Placer,
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:43.840]   is both of these are image-based.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.520]   I guess these really should have been Twi...
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:46.360]   Anyway, but...
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:48.600]   - That's okay.
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:49.760]   - This has been a camera show.
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:50.600]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:53.080]   So the second one is called Filter Storm.
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:54.600]   - Oh, I've downloaded it, I love it.
[01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:55.440]   - And here's the one of the most...
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.480]   - It's amazing!
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:58.760]   - It's got all these filters, and it's got curves, you know,
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:00.040]   so you can actually add curves.
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:01.360]   Here's my...
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:02.200]   See, look at that.
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:04.520]   - Yeah, you can actually recover a photo
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:05.800]   that's improperly exposed.
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.560]   It's the most amazing.
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:08.560]   - There's my son with a twi...
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.040]   - I found out about this on Instagram.
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:12.640]   Somebody showed a day before and after,
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:14.560]   and there was this photo that was completely underexposed,
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:15.960]   you couldn't see the kid.
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:16.960]   And he fixed it.
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:18.800]   I don't know how these things are amazing.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:21.960]   - When I finally found a good app that is responsive
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.920]   and you can actually put curves on it,
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:27.040]   I was just like, okay, these apps are starting to get interesting.
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.480]   You know, like, we're starting to really get into this.
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:31.040]   They've got a bunch of little filters,
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:32.920]   but for me, just having a curves dialogue
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:35.600]   to be able to apply to any image that I want
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.160]   was a big deal.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.640]   And it's very well implemented.
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:40.880]   And I think it's like, you know, whatever,
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:43.960]   on 99, 299, whatever it is, it's worth buying.
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:45.200]   - Very cool. - Doesn't mind.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.720]   - Curves.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.320]   I got one that's free.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:49.560]   How about that?
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:52.200]   And it's actually an open source project
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:54.000]   that has been ported to the Macintosh,
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.280]   which sometimes I know scares you Mac people,
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:59.120]   but I'm a fan of open source.
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:01.200]   And maybe, you know, maybe this is a product
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:03.520]   we don't really need 'cause we've got iTunes.
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.840]   But if you've ever used Amoroc on Linux,
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:08.400]   you probably know about the Amoroc player,
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:12.240]   which is a fantastic kind of iTunes-like player for Linux.
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:17.160]   Clementine is updated, written for not just Linux,
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:18.720]   but Mac and Windows as well.
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:21.400]   And this isn't a, hey, it's free.
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.520]   Now I gotta warn you, because it's open source,
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:26.400]   there's a lot of people who have versions of this,
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:29.440]   and I'm not sure I'd trust them, get it from the source.
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:34.160]   Clementine, like the orange, dashplayer.org.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:36.840]   And I say like the orange because the logo
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:39.240]   is a little orange slice.
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.440]   It is a really sweet player.
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:44.360]   With some very sophisticated, nice features,
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:48.280]   the kinds of things you probably don't see very much
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:52.360]   on Apple stuff.
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:55.680]   It can play a whole bunch of formats.
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:58.280]   It does a lot of interesting things.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:01.840]   I'm not necessarily saying that this is what you,
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:04.600]   you know, you definitely wanna get in replace for iTunes,
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.040]   but because it's free, it's certainly something
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:07.080]   you might wanna add.
[01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:09.880]   It will, of course, import all your music and so forth,
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:11.240]   just as you would expect.
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:15.040]   And play almost anything as well.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:19.880]   And I think just a very nice little player
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:21.480]   that does a lot of interesting things.
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:22.880]   Clementine, and it's free.
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:26.360]   Has a lot of tagging capabilities,
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:31.680]   playlist capabilities, visualizations, transcoding.
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:34.000]   It will download, by the way, this is really nice.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.840]   It will download a lot of album art and descriptions
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:40.560]   and so forth from the internet.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:43.240]   You could select a different visualization.
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:44.640]   Look at all the visualizations.
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:45.480]   I like it.
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:47.720]   I mean, if you just want visualizations,
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:50.560]   you know, this is an area where iTunes really kind of
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:52.280]   could have done a lot better, right?
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:57.040]   This has every visualization engine known to man,
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:59.760]   including all the guys' engines, which I love.
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:02.680]   So you know, you can really make your music visual,
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:03.520]   if you want.
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:05.640]   Anything else, this would be a good choice.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:10.640]   Clementine-player.org, Andy Inaco, your pick of the week.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:14.120]   Actually, we'll just have some visualizations while you speak.
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:18.320]   Turn off your mind and watch.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:19.880]   And float down street.
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:21.680]   It's time for the mellow out.
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.120]   Actually, I should probably play some music
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:23.960]   then you'd get a vision.
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:25.600]   Actually, actually how appropriate is now
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.800]   4.20 in the afternoon here in the East Coast.
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:30.360]   (laughing)
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:32.000]   Float down stream with us.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.040]   Sometimes you do feel the hand of divine prominence
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:36.880]   in your daily life.
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.640]   Oh, by the excellent radio playing capabilities,
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:43.360]   including ice-cast streams, which means you can listen to us
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:44.800]   in this, I should have mentioned that.
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.560]   Go ahead Andy.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:48.960]   Yes, but any app is enhanced if you can listen to us.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:50.200]   Always good.
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.320]   Developers, pick note.
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:54.880]   Okay, well, I of course got the memo
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:57.800]   that this was going to be a photo-centric pick of the week.
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:58.640]   Thank you.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:03.520]   I just happened to pick a plugin for aperture and Photoshop
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:04.880]   that I've been playing with for the past week
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:05.840]   and have two weeks.
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:09.400]   It's called Need Image and you can get it at neatimage.com.
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:14.400]   It's one of my, I had sort of an experience a few months ago
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:16.960]   taking pictures at the New York Comic-Con
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:20.600]   where I was just terrified of taking the ISO of my camera
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:24.920]   anywhere above 800 because I've just always known
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:26.320]   that it is anathema.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:28.520]   You can get good shots at 400 ISO.
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:31.800]   You can sometimes get okay shots at 800 ISO.
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:33.560]   Anything above that is total garbage.
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:35.120]   There'll be so much digital noise
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:37.400]   that it just won't be as useful at all.
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:38.840]   And after going through all my pictures,
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:41.200]   I got some good shots, but I really wish that I'd tried
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:44.560]   to go up to the 1200, 1600 just to see what my camera could do.
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:46.320]   So it's been sort of a background task
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:49.480]   to try to lose my fear of high ISO.
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:53.360]   Newer cameras are much, much better at high ISO photography
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:54.440]   than the previous ones.
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:57.800]   And there are better plugins like need image
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:00.800]   that are designed specifically to reduce the amount
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:04.840]   of noise and garbage that you get by shooting high ISO.
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:06.960]   It works as a plugin.
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:09.360]   I've got the aperture version of the plugin.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:13.840]   And really all you do is it's a quick two or three step process.
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:17.000]   You activate the plugin, it will open up the image
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.040]   that you selected inside the plugin.
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:23.560]   It will choose a section of the image
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:26.200]   that has no detail in it except for noise.
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:28.560]   So if you're shooting a night scene, it's nothing but it will
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:31.040]   probably choose a section of the night sky
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.840]   because there's no detail in there.
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:35.440]   It's just a sample of what the representational noise is
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:36.280]   of that image.
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:39.640]   If it's guess is wrong, you can tell it what to do manually.
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:41.720]   They click on another tab and we'll just simply say,
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:44.120]   please remove all the noise that you see in this image.
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:47.240]   And it does a really, really very good job.
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:49.560]   I was shooting pictures of my nieces and nephews
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:51.520]   at the Family Christmas party without a flash
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:53.840]   with my microfirthers, four thirds camera
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:56.560]   and got some really nice shots just illuminated
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:59.200]   just from a lamp in the living room
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:00.880]   that was much better than anything I would have gotten
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.000]   with the flash.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.720]   Just yesterday, Sunday, I was in Boston's public garden
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:11.080]   taking pictures of monuments at like pitch dark at 1600 ISO,
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:15.840]   3200 ISO, and was very, very pleased with the results I got.
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:20.360]   After the results that came out of the Nikon P7000 camera,
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:23.760]   which I'm finally getting around to running a real review of,
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.560]   straight out of the camera, they were okay.
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:27.800]   You could definitely tell that it was got beat up a lot
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:30.680]   from all that highest ISO noise,
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:33.640]   but neat image was able to cut that down to the extent
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:36.400]   where you really wouldn't be the first thing you notice.
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:39.080]   If you wanted to be critical about that image,
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:40.600]   you would definitely notice that, okay,
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:43.080]   well, clearly there was something going on where,
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:47.560]   it suffered a little bit in the low light technology,
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:50.480]   but it did turn an okay image
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:53.080]   to actually a very, very solid, very, very good one.
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:56.160]   So the right answer is still going to be either bring a flash
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:41:00.200]   or if you want to take a picture of the Thomas Ball Memorial
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:03.840]   Monument to George Washington at 8 p.m. in Boston Public Garden.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:06.200]   The best way to do that is to still get a tripod,
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:08.880]   leave it at 200 ISO and take a nice long exposure.
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:11.760]   But if you can't do that, you can take a handheld shot
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:14.680]   at 130th of a second at 1600 ISO,
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:16.280]   process it with neat image,
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:18.680]   and you will actually turn up with a very, very decent image.
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:20.400]   So I'm very, very pleased with this.
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:23.280]   - I noticed that they have a home version
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:25.040]   and a pro version for $20 more.
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:26.840]   Is there a significant difference between the two?
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:29.000]   Do you recommend one or the other?
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.720]   - Yeah, and I wish it weren't this confusing.
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:32.760]   There are only two differences
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:35.400]   and that's actually spelled out in that table.
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:39.000]   The home version only works on 8-bit images.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.200]   So that means it'll work with any JPEG that you take.
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:45.120]   It will also work with any raw image so long,
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:46.760]   but it will down convert it to 8-bits
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.960]   before it starts working its match on it.
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:51.560]   The limitation is that you can't simply give it,
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:54.840]   if you shot a hockey game, it took like 200, 300 pictures,
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:57.040]   you can't simply drag all 300 pictures and say,
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:58.840]   please process all of these in sequence
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.480]   while I go out for pancakes,
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:02.240]   'cause there's a top limit of something like,
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:06.040]   there's a 30 or 40, since 50, 50, just in one batch.
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:07.920]   The pro version has none of these limitations
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:09.720]   and it costs 20 bucks more.
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:11.360]   I don't know which one I would go for.
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:14.320]   I would probably, if I'm already in it for--
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:16.120]   - Spend the $20, yeah.
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:19.320]   - Yeah, and there's also, there's a demo mode
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:22.080]   that is not as ambitious as it could be.
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:24.400]   It will show, the demo version of it,
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:26.160]   it's a plug again, it will show you the steps
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:28.480]   and it will show you sort of the process,
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.240]   but it will only process one section of the image.
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:33.040]   Like it'll do a representational sample,
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:34.400]   which is to see what it can do.
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:37.000]   But there are gonna be a lot of photographers out there
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:41.160]   who gets stymied by shooting things like hockey,
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:43.840]   things like basketball, things that happen indoors
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:45.880]   with a lot of action where you have no choice,
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:47.440]   but to pump it to a highest ISO
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:50.280]   and give it to a low, a high shutter speed.
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:55.280]   And that's gonna be a good answer to buying a $5,000 camera
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:59.000]   that does exceptionally awesomely.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.640]   Like a Canon 5 Mark II that does so well at high ISO.
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:06.280]   So it's a nice little tool to have in your toolbox.
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:11.280]   - I noticed they do video and they also don't just do ISO noise,
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:13.000]   they also take care of JPEG artifacts.
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.680]   So it sounds like it would be probably useful.
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:16.080]   There is a video plugin as well.
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:18.400]   I have to, did you, have you tried that?
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:19.520]   - I'm trying to give you a plug in.
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:21.400]   - It's interesting, I'll have to give that a shot.
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:22.720]   Interesting.
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:25.960]   Some good recommendations there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:30.360]   Andy Inaco is the man at Chicago Sun Times,
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:34.480]   also the host of the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:36.880]   - I'm trying to, I'm trying to more of a funcular sign.
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:38.240]   - Stop like that.
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:42.880]   - Hi, I'm throwing my good wishes for a great week at two.
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:46.280]   - I don't remember kids, if you don't like the taste of the box.
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:47.480]   - No, nevermind.
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:49.680]   - Hang by your phones and write a few that work.
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:53.720]   I mean, Andy, it's great to have you.
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:56.400]   We'll look forward to, I'll imagine you and your box
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:58.400]   are short-sitting there watching us.
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:43:59.240]   - We'll see you.
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:01.880]   - Also, I'm like that member of the presidential cabinet
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:03.400]   that has to stay, that the member of Congress
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:05.840]   has to stay behind, 'cause if any of you guys need
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:09.000]   to be bailed out, you know, I'm either with the West Union money.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.600]   - Keep the credit card handy, we may need it.
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:14.440]   - Thank you, Andy and I go.
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:18.040]   Thank you also, Alex Lindsey, who is heading for Vegas win.
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.840]   - Right, wow.
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:21.320]   I couldn't get a flight on Wednesday.
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:22.840]   - Oh, well no, you know, Extra Night's always good.
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:23.840]   A lot of people are going out tonight
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:26.120]   because the CEA preview is tonight,
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:28.000]   so that's why I lean into Tom,
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.040]   or I'm not getting there until tonight.
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.600]   I mean, I get no like 10 o'clock at night.
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:33.560]   - I'm a, so you got the worst of both worlds, basically.
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:36.080]   - Yes, yes, but you'll be in Vegas.
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:37.400]   - I'll be well rested tomorrow.
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:38.320]   - You will indeed.
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:40.240]   - Yeah, that time zone shift can really kill you.
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.760]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:43.960]   - We will see you there in Vegas.
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:45.520]   He'll be reporting for us and for Pixel Core
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:50.520]   and we'll look for your homemade notes on bordersac.com.
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:51.760]   - It'll be fun.
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:52.600]   - I can't wait.
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:53.440]   - It'll be fun to experiment.
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:54.520]   - Yeah.
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:55.640]   - Thank you all for joining us.
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:59.640]   As again, I mentioned we will be covering CES.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:03.560]   We start Wednesday evening, Tom Merritt and Becky Worley
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:05.560]   at the digital experience and then from there,
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:07.520]   it just gets crazier and crazier.
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:08.920]   We've got reporters all over the place.
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:11.640]   If you can't get to CES, this is the next best thing.
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:14.240]   We'll bring you the sights, the sounds, even the smells
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:19.240]   of CES at live.twit.tv all through the rest of the week
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:21.480]   and we'll be back of course next Tuesday.
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:25.520]   Tired but unbowed with Mac break weekly.
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:27.160]   - Yeah, we'll look a little bit.
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:29.640]   I can't promise we'll be unbowed to be honest with you.
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:31.960]   We may be fully bowed.
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:34.240]   - It'll smell like sistasic or at smoke
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:35.880]   and 99th century from cocktail.
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:38.440]   - I'll come back with a big bag of swag.
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:40.160]   Like of things that I collected at CES.
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.000]   - Oh, that'd be fun.
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:41.840]   - You can go through that.
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:42.680]   You should do that too.
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:43.520]   You don't actually walk around.
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:45.000]   - I will be walking around this time.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.240]   I've tried to do this before and there isn't as much swag
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:48.080]   as it seems.
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:50.600]   - It's not swag if I, you know, I'll bring back stuff.
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:51.440]   - It's like stuff.
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:53.040]   It's like, you know, stuff.
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:53.960]   - No, but I'll bring back real things.
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:54.800]   - Bring stuff back.
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:57.240]   - I'll bring back, I'll go hunting at CES
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:00.200]   and I'll bring back some electronic deer.
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:03.000]   - Oh great.
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.240]   Just don't slaughter it here on the set.
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:08.280]   - What kind of a skat will you be looking for?
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:10.080]   - Try those, but face the electronic deer.
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:11.800]   - I'll bring it back all in jerky.
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:14.520]   - You're dehydrated.
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:16.080]   - Yes. - Bring it back for us.
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:18.040]   So gettin' a teriyaki sauce.
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:18.880]   It's good that way.
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:19.700]   - Thank you, sir.
[01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:21.640]   Thank you all for being here
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.680]   and have a great week.
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:25.560]   We'll be back next time in a little bit.
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:27.400]   Actually, you know what, if I do that,
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:29.400]   it gets rid of the bags, I don't know what I was.
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:31.160]   (laughing)
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:32.840]   Home face lifts.
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:34.640]   Next on Twitch.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:35.480]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:36.320]   We'll see you next time.
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:37.360]   Now you get back to work.
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:38.720]   Great times over.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:41.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:43.880]   (upbeat music)
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:46.460]   (upbeat music)
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:48.540]   you
