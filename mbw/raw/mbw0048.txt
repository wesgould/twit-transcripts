[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   convened around the table the virtual imaginary non-existent table
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   to talk about all things Mac with Merlin, Macintosh Man,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   of 43folders.com.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Hello, Merlin.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Oh, Lee, are you going to be disguising my voice this week?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Yes.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Yes.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   What was that?
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   This guy's already?
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Would you like to have it?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Who would you like?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Like Darth Vader, Bugs Bunny, whatever you want.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   You sound like Foghorn Leghorn.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   I'll say sorry.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   I'll say more.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   That's the Macelope.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   I hear the Macelope's voice in the background there.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   People complained.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   People complained the last time we had the Macelope.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I made his voice show "Blorkeders."
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   So now I'm making him sound like just kind of your normal
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Nebish kind of guy.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   But it's still not his real voice.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I regenerated.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   He's like the -- we were talking before the show.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   He's like the new Darren.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Well, I was -- we were thinking "Doctor Who."
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Okay, Doctor Who.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   You wanted to be Darren that's fine.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Okay, Doctor Who.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And now working for mainstream media, a regular columnist for CNET.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   So do you still do the Macelope blog or?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   You know, I haven't quite figured out what to do with that yet.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   It's not been updated since I've been posting on CNET mostly just because
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I've been ramming and jamming on CNET.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   So it may linger on and be a place where I post some more blue material.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Oh, yeah, because CNET we know is particularly straight laced.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   A little bit.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   They're the ones -- oh, no, they don't have that sex blog.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   That's Wired.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   That's Wired.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Regina Prasiato, who is my -- it wrote -- co-wrote my first book with me and did -- and left
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   all the sex out.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I don't understand it.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   What -- what -- a little did I know?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   How could they?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   She was a hot chicky and I didn't know.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   So the Macelope is at blogs.cNET.com and it's the Macelope, an Apple blog.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And that's, I guess, pretty easy to find from there.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   You know, it's not -- can you go to slash Macelope or anything?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Okay.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Blogs.cNET.com/Macelope.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Correct.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Okay.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   You know, when you get there, it's like 8,300-13509 underscore one.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Okay.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   My code number.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   They need Mod rewrite-like.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Crazy.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Andy Inacco is here for the Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Oh, no.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I'm coming from an underscore location.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And I'm going to go to the World Health Station in the Midwest.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I love how he does it.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   For my own safety, I am being disguised.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I am under precaution.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   But I'm very, very happy to be here.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   The Witness Protection Program.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   That's a vaguely familiar.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   It sounds like the Macelope.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   All right, guys, let's talk about Macintosh.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   A little later on, our Mac picks of the week.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   We were -- actually, Merlin and I -- but before we started, we're bemoaning.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I was just -- the current state of the hardware world.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I was just saying I bought on an impulse.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I bought this really cool device.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   It's called the GISTEC or GISTech photo tracker.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   It's a GPS you put in your pocket.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   You sync it to the time of your camera.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Keep taking pictures.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   And then when you import your camera photos, it imports it with a GPS stream
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   and automatically geotags your photos.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Great idea.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Doesn't work with a Mac.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   [laughter]
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Makes me crazy.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I thought there was -- I had two things that were interesting.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   First of all, exactly what you're describing, which is -- and again, we were kind of reminiscing
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   whatever the opposite of reminiscing is, the bad way of reminiscing about the days
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   when you would have to really, really read every label because, you know,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   it was very specific to have Mac support for something.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And, you know, a lot of us, a lot of you young kids today don't remember 1995,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   but those were dark days.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Dark days.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And so then, you know, so you got to where you read labels.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And then -- I don't know if something happened.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I think since OS X is something --
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   USB.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   It was USB.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Oh, you think?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Yeah, USB one probably.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   USB helped, yeah.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   But this is a USB device.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   The connectors were all different back then.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I mean, there were --
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   But it totally --
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   It was an EBE port, and then the PC world used --
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   You know where it started going wrong again is when it went from power PC to Intel.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   The Intel threw a lot of printers, scanners.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Some are still -- some multifunction printers still don't work with OS X.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   That's what you found, right?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   You got a scanner that didn't work?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I was -- I ended up returning --
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I had to return it because I had to --
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I had to return it because I had bought the Windows version.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   But the switch it makes this really cool scanner that all the kids are talking about.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   It's this great scanner for -- you just throw a bunch of documents at this thing, business cards, anything,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   and it spits it out as at PDFs.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   You know, basically, this way to turn your entire physical paper world into an online series of artifacts.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And I just went, "Hey, great.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   You know, send me one."
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And it wasn't inexpensive.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   But it was totally Windows only.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And then -- but here's the funny part.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   So the second part that's funny is there is a totally OS X only version.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   It's like a different color.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It's prettier and everything.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   But I just said, "You know what? That was a hint.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   That was the gods telling me that I should not spend multi-hundred dollars on a scanner right now."
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   So you didn't get the Mac version you used to send it back?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   I'm tempted since I didn't get a thing -- the thing that cannot be named.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Maybe the money could go toward a scanner.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   I'm going to hold off.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   So what really gets me is that when you have a really cool USB device that shouldn't require a special driver,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   like the device you're describing, Leo, it sounds like if I were the engineer or if I were the product manager,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   I'd say, "Okay, tell you what, we're just going to give it a plain USB file system.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   It's going to deposit a standard XML file so that we can basically contract this job out to anybody
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   to try to -- we know it's version of Mac version or Linux version.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   It's like they made no attempt to make it work.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Yeah, I mean, sometimes you see the pedigree of whatever devices they were building beforehand,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   where if they have this sort of fourth/four-tran-based stack algorithm
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   that they're really in love with because they bought the technology in 1979 and, hey,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   the oldest guy in the shop hasn't died yet, so why switch from something else?
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It is true, though, that GPS devices in general don't work very well with Macs.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   I think they just recently did a interface for the Magellan.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Yeah, the garments, especially, I think, just got -- there was a one of their running devices.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   One of their, you know, exercises, one of those huge ass ugly wristband deals.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   They only very recently, I think, got Macs up.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   It makes me mad.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   I mean, because a lot of people are looking at Macs these days,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   and I could have run it in parallels, I'm sure, but -- well, I mean, that was the other thing
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   wrong with this thing was that it doesn't support RAW.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   It only supports JPEG because it puts it in the ex-if, and you basically have to use their
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   photo tracker software as your photo manager.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   God.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   You know, it's just -- I mean, at that point, I was like, "Okay, never mind."
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Yes.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It's like a great idea.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   It's a great idea.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   You know, I actually --
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   You remember when you buy a camera and you have to use --
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   It's soft --
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   What was on the CD, the Canon, like, crap, photo management program?
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I was thinking that there is one good thing about GPS software in the Macintosh.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   The fact that there is nobody dominating it means that if you go to Mac's GPS or Gypsy,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   the GPS program that I normally use, if you say, "You know what I really need?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.280]   I really need an Apple script access to your program that lets me pop out the standard
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.280]   time for whatever app."
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.000]   And those -- three hours later, there'll be an update of Gypsy saying, "Well, if you don't
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.400]   like this feature, Andy, not go ask for it and we had to do it rather than go out to dinner
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   tonight.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.400]   Thank you, Andy."
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.000]   It wasn't that nice of them.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.920]   All right, the Apple announcing lower prices for full albums on iTunes.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.280]   It's the next big thing.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.920]   Boy, after the last big thing, this doesn't seem like that big a thing.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.280]   This is plenty big, Leo.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.280]   Is it 599 and 699 for albums?
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.280]   What are the albums?
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.280]   This is what the record industry's wanted, right?
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.680]   We could talk about anything.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.680]   I just as well.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.680]   You just --
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.680]   I think they wanted to go the other way.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.080]   Oh, they want to go up, not down.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.080]   What am I thinking?
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.360]   Well, maybe the other shoe hasn't dropped because what they really wanted to do is they were
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.680]   willing to go down on catalog.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.920]   They wanted to go up on the current hits.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.080]   Variable pricing, it's not a reality.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.080]   Yes.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.080]   So really, that's probably what this is.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.960]   This is the sweetener that will give us the sour note next week.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.960]   I feel like Linus talking to Charlie Brown on the Christmas special, like, "Leo, you're
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.600]   the only one that I know who could take something that's wonderful as a price drop and somehow
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.600]   turning into a problem."
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.800]   It's a problem, I'm an ami.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.000]   Oh, good grief.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.600]   Music executives were abiding in the fields.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.160]   Well, maybe it won't happen.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.840]   Maybe everything will be great.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.840]   What albums are --
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.360]   Everybody, let's go in all the people in their cars and in their offices and homes
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.360]   laughing at that statement.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.600]   Oh, yeah, sure, sure.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.600]   Prices have --
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.120]   Well, they'll only go down.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.400]   They'll never go up.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.400]   Doom and Despair, stock garland, like two giant stalking things and Erich Erwashalbe.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.840]   Mankind is born under trouble just as Shirley as the sparks fly upward.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.840]   What the hell was that?
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.440]   I always wondered if he was completing that off of a cue card or --
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.160]   I think he's got two minutes.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.680]   I think he's coming right out of his head.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.680]   It sounds familiar.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.240]   What's it from?
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.680]   It is technically it's from the book of Job.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.960]   It's actually something that Linus also said in a Sunday strip.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:01.640]   All my -- like all rational human beings, all my theology comes from the peanut strip.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.120]   Everything I know about God, I know you're --
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.240]   All your opera comes from Bugs Bunny.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.240]   That's true.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.240]   They're big O.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.400]   You know your understanding of the working through government comes from the schoolhouse
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.400]   rock.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   There you go.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.920]   Well, I think we've kind of boiled it all down right there.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.520]   So I'm just looking at the albums that are 599.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.960]   There's not a whole heck of a lot of them.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.280]   I don't really know a lot of these groups.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:28.800]   How is it working that -- these are like the first white stripes albums, something like
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.800]   that.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.800]   I mean, what is the deal?
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.800]   It's catalog obviously.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   This is supposed to be upcoming --
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.800]   Oh, they're upcoming band.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.800]   I get it.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   Well, okay.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.800]   So the next big thing.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.800]   I get it.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.600]   Oh, they're the next big thing, not the price.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   The well.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.600]   Band is the next big thing.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.000]   I believe that's the idea.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   So we can sort of expect like the groups that are at the top of the curve, we're not going
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   to get a price break.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.720]   The ones that are pasted and the ones that are coming up to it, we can get a price break.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.720]   So as long as they're somewhere on the county fair circuit, either on the way up or on the
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.720]   way down.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.880]   So Axel Rose is going to be here any day now.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.360]   These are the bands that you're going to have to pay more for later.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.360]   Ah.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.640]   So don't get used to this price now, but this is it.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.640]   Don't worry.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.680]   The RIA will come back at us for the $3 we should have spent because they charge too
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.240]   little.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.440]   It's just like stealing.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.440]   You wouldn't steal a car.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.920]   You wouldn't pay too little for an album.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.920]   Would you?
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.920]   Yeah, I would.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.920]   Actually, I would.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.920]   I'd be glad to.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.920]   I'm a freelance journalist.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.480]   What the hell else am I supposed to do to get a car?
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:40.960]   JP Morgan's already saying that there's going to be a new iPhone, a nano style iPhone.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.240]   Apple filed a patent application July 5th.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.640]   They're busy.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.920]   They didn't take the day off on 4th of July for fireworks.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.840]   No, they worked on a patent application, a multifunctional handheld device with a circular
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:59.480]   touch pad control, a scroll wheel, in other words, and a virtual handpiece that has to
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.360]   be physically picked up and held to ones.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.360]   How would you?
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.360]   I mean, that's too small.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.360]   Does that make any sound at all?
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.400]   Makes no sense with a springy cord so that you can stretch it four feet before it's
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.400]   bringing it back.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.960]   This is JP Morgan saying this.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.240]   So they plan to launch it in the fourth quarter.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.160]   She didn't know what she was talking about on Match Game.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.920]   She doesn't know what she's talking about now.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.520]   Not that.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.440]   She was always the loose woman on the Match Game.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.160]   She would work blue.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.080]   She would work blue.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.200]   The thing is, you keep hearing all these analysts predicting things.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.200]   I think they're actually totted it up for like one month period.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.720]   I think they were right about 42% of the time, 45% of the time.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.680]   I mean, they're an informed opinion, but still it's just an opinion.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.280]   I mean, it's better than the...
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.600]   I think it's definitely a step up from the legendary...
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.600]   This dude I know who manages an AT&T phone store who totally showed me the secret document.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   Right.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.520]   I mean, it's a step up from there, but you still have anything with Apple.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.760]   You believe it when you see it until you do.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:56.760]   Save your shackles.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.680]   Well, I don't understand why in the long run they would want to do this, but it seems
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   like in the short term they would focus on being able to fulfill the demand for what's
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.680]   out there.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   Exactly.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.680]   Why would they need to put something like this out anytime before, like, a year, year and
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.680]   a half from now?
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.520]   I mean, that doesn't make sense to me.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.400]   I haven't seen it.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.400]   I haven't seen it.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.400]   I mean, the scroll wheel interface?
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.920]   Yeah, basically it looks like an old rotary dial.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.280]   It certainly looks like a little line drawing kind of those charming little line drawings
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.280]   that you have.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.440]   What looks like an old schooled outfit.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.560]   Finally we'll have a piece of technology that nobody under the age of 30 will be able
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.560]   to operate.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.560]   It's all of us who will be like, "Ah ha!
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.160]   You don't know how to use a cell phone!"
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.160]   It's called a turn signal.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.720]   Daddy, what's it like to dial a phone?
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.280]   Well, okay, so it's a bad idea.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.280]   We're not going to do it.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.280]   Did anybody go to the...
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.280]   I think it's a finite idea.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.280]   I thought it's not a bad idea.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.280]   I think it's a thing.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.280]   I think it's a thing.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.280]   I know.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.280]   It's holding other people's smaller iPhones.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.120]   It's a great idea, but I don't think the...
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.520]   A cheaper smaller iPhone, maybe.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.520]   I mean, cheaper really would be the kind of a smaller, but...
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.160]   A battery had some half to it.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.160]   I mean, that thing's...
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.160]   They've got to wait to reduce that size and make it a little bit less tall.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.040]   I think it's a good idea, but I can't imagine why they would...
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.720]   Well, which doesn't make sense.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   Well, I would...
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.520]   I would doubt that there's going to be an iPhone Nano for the same reasons why there
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.760]   had to be an iPod Nano.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.520]   It doesn't do everything that the big-sized iPod needs to do, but realize that in a year
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.080]   and a half, two years time, there are going to be iPhone-like devices on the market, and
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.160]   the iPhone is not going to have that category all to itself.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.320]   So you need to have a reason for somebody who does not want to spend 500 bucks on a phone
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.120]   to be able to get in at 150 bucks, 200 bucks, even if they're not willing to...
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.920]   Just pay extra for all the bells and whistles.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.040]   It's the brand that really needs to be promoted and just really needs to stick it at this
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.040]   time.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:50.040]   Steve Jobs spotted the London Region Street Apple Store yesterday.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:56.400]   Maybe the thinking is he's getting ready for negotiating for an iPhone in the UK.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.480]   Maybe just needed a power adapter.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.440]   You know, that's why I go to the Apple Store.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.560]   I had a rattle.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.080]   I had a weird thing today.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.080]   I bought an EMI.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:13.200]   It said it was an EMI record off of the iTunes Store, and it was not available at the higher
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.200]   resolution.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.200]   Yeah, it was not available.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.200]   Not all of the...
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   Wow, that's interesting.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.200]   It's not the whole catalog yet.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:29.520]   Well, so if it's available, it gets some kind of little email that says go pick up your
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.520]   high-res public assiles over here.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.920]   Hey, do you know if it's possible to upgrade if you've already bought the DRM version
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.360]   to upgrade to the non-DRM-tier resolution version?
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.360]   I haven't tried that yet.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.360]   I like that new album upgrades.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.760]   Yeah, the way it did it was you had to do your collection.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.760]   But that would be included, and would you get the...
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.080]   Okay, so you do all or nothing.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.080]   And is that still available?
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.000]   Oh, I think so.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.240]   I can't tell now.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.240]   I haven't...
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:01.400]   When I've gone to that page, the page that initially gave you the offer, I haven't had
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.400]   new stuff added.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.800]   So I'm not sure how that works.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:09.000]   I would keep kind of expecting the new stuff will get rolled in or new records will be
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.080]   added, but I haven't seen any.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.840]   Boy, you know, I'm really trying hard not to mention the iPhone.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.120]   It is just not easy.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.840]   I didn't want to do an all-iPhone show.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.840]   I didn't want...
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.840]   I was kind of having...
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.920]   I had some hopes of doing a no-iPhone show, but are there any other non-iPhone stories we
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.000]   can talk about?
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   I think...
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.600]   Well, I mean, I don't know if it's news exactly.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.320]   I saw a post today that I really liked.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.040]   I've gone on the record as saying that I'm not a huge fan of Dashboard, but Neil Kennedy
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.040]   had an e-post on...
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:45.840]   I think it was on Engadget talking about his 10 favorite Apple Dashboard widget.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.200]   It's an up-temporarily rescinded, "I hate diggable headlines."
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.840]   The 10 favorite, top 10, the five best.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.800]   So over that, that really needs to end.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.960]   These are actually really good.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.960]   Especially if you live in the Bay Area, they have the wonderful Bart widget, which I think
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.960]   is really good.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.200]   Just well-named, if nothing else.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   I think everyone should have a Bart widget.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.720]   I got Ramba!
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.720]   So it's Bart is the...
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.040]   It's one of those since I worked as a roofer that far.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.400]   Saved my life three times, I'm telling you.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.400]   The Bart widget?
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.280]   I'll tell you, if we wear the longer tail T-shirts, you don't get the Bart widget as
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.280]   bad.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.600]   The Bart is the Bay Area Rapid Transit.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.720]   It's the underground subway that runs around to the Bay Area.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.440]   So this would be a schedule...
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.360]   Well, it's not just a straight-up train schedule.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.600]   It's a visual representation where you say, "I need to go from here to there," and it shows
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.040]   you your options staggered graphically.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.000]   This is on MBW ideas.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.040]   It's a nice little widget.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.080]   Other ones I hadn't seen, there's a nice Google Analytics widget.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.080]   That would be handy.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.840]   Because I always look at my Analytics.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.840]   So that would be nice.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.520]   You go in and tell each of your sites you want it to look up, and it's really cool.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:56.400]   The other one lately that I've really got into is that package delivery one.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.400]   You guys use that one?
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:03.360]   Does it tell you when you're non-Mac working scanners on the way?
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.360]   Is that what it's for?
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.360]   What does it tell you?
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.360]   What does it do?
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:11.560]   Well, I think the name is Mike Piontec, M-I-K-E-P-I-O-N-E-K.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.960]   And you put the tracking number in there.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.640]   Yeah, but it's not just UPS.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:21.800]   It does Amazon, Adobe, Apple, DHL, Google Checkout, Nintendo, and so on.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.360]   And it's really pretty.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.360]   And it has all the icons.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.920]   I'm starting to come around to what I might use Dashboard for.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.480]   I've got one from my in-front raid.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.280]   It tells me the temperature of the raid and how my controls are.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.280]   That's cool.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.280]   I've got to get that.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.880]   So I think as the glanceable as the glanceable truly dashboard.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.120]   I hate having to hit F12 though every time.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.120]   I just really hate that.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.480]   Yeah, that remains my problem with Dashboard.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.600]   I have to go to Dashboard land to visit these widgets.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.600]   Now I know there's a workaround that you can drag widgets on.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   It's not designed to do that.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.600]   It's not designed to do that.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.600]   Totally with you.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.240]   Even if you do it that way, it's like, well, then why do we have Dashboard to begin with?
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.840]   Now, I'm not going to say that we're not supposed to say that if you had a really high-tech
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.760]   phone, let's say, something you just spent a lot of money for, this is exactly the sort
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.320]   of situation where I would love to have the FedEx tracking widget.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.480]   I would love to have all these remote widgets.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.480]   I mean, when you see all those blank spaces on the front of this hypothetical expensive
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.880]   phone, you think, oh, I just want to tap one button to get a little bit of magic.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.400]   It'll match the list of everything I've subscribed to for FedEx and for UPS.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.560]   I've been playing with the iPhone Dev Camp this past weekend in San Francisco and really
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.200]   amazing some of the stuff.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.600]   I mean, there's a bejeweled clone that really plays very well.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.520]   It has to all play through Safari, though.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.880]   You make the exact point, which is that why do I have to-- it's like Dashboard land.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.200]   I have to go to Safari land to play these things or use these things.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.200]   If we're going to discuss the hated iPhone, we don't have to do it now, but we should
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.440]   talk about telekinesis.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.840]   Telekinesis is very cool.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.640]   It's where people are doing the most interesting stuff, I think, in some ways.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.760]   But with not really a GUI, though, that's the problem, right?
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.240]   Well, I think it's still a very proof of concept.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.080]   I got a quick little preview of this from our Flippert friend last week.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.040]   This is a Google project.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.240]   Google project run by none other than Apple.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.640]   Oh, it's public now.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.640]   We can mention this.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.640]   Yeah, he's a flippert one.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.880]   Yeah, a group are lettered out of the bag, but yeah, they say something else.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   And we don't need to.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.880]   So it's too late.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.600]   His name's associated with it.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:22.400]   But it's a really nice little-- what you basically do-- some apps, like OmniFocus does this now,
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:29.480]   you can basically open a port on your Mac and enables you to basically be on your iPhone
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:34.960]   and to do things back on your home machine if you've got either a static IP or something
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.960]   like dynamic DNS.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:40.600]   And by opening a port and putting a password on it, this becomes this way to basically interact
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.400]   with stuff that's happening back on your computer.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.000]   So your Mac does all the heavy lifting functionally.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.720]   And then this thing acts as a remote.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.480]   Your iPhone just acts as a remote to interact with that and have information sent to your
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.160]   phone, which is a brilliant idea.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.080]   I mean, it kind of takes applications out of the-- for the short term, kind of takes
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.840]   applications out of the picture and puts them right back on your Mac.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.400]   So this-- you can stream music.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.920]   You can use it as an iTunes remote.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.600]   It's a very proof of concept.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.360]   But once you get your head around that idea of having things like AppleScript do the work
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.360]   on your Mac and then just send results to your phone, it's kind of mind-blowing.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.760]   Back to client server land.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.760]   Yeah, I don't--
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.160]   it's actually exactly what I've been sort of begging for for the past three, four years
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.040]   that I want-- whether it's through a PDA, whether it's through an iPod, whether it's
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:28.280]   through an iPhone, the ability to basically carry a presence to my computers around with
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.280]   me.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.520]   There's no reason why if a new mail comes in, I don't necessarily even have to check my
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.520]   mail on my iPhone.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.080]   I should be able to say, oh, by the way, let me know what's going on back on my desktop.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:43.360]   I don't even need like a virtual networking or to virtual remote desktop clients.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.280]   I just want to be able to say, look, if there's anything interesting happening back at that
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.680]   little keyboard, if the printer runs out of paper, if I get a phone call coming in, just
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:56.080]   routed to my iPhone, just so I know to get up off the sofa, pause the remote on the iTunes
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.400]   scratchy DVDs and just come back and go back to the keyboard.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.000]   So almost like really-- so one use for this would be great would be something like have
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.120]   a growl client that can send notifications to your iPhone.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.440]   I mean, I wouldn't want to use it over edge.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.560]   Although I guess they could be tiny and so--
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.120]   I guess they could send SMSs.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.120]   I mean, that's the thing.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.120]   It's all happening.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.040]   Whatever your Mac can do, that's what I think it's so brilliant about it.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.960]   And save me from having to buy an Apple TV.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.960]   Really?
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.600]   I mean, I had an old power book that I was-- had a bunch of media on and I just connected
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.320]   that to my HDTV.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.120]   And you control it with your iPhone?
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.800]   Wow, that's a hack.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.560]   That's very cool.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.640]   So what does the interface look like on the iPhone?
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.560]   It's just a circle.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.560]   It's like it looks like a shuffle.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:48.480]   So you have-- but it's like the remote control for the Apple TV, really?
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.480]   Yeah, right.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.480]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.480]   It's at 600 bucks.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.480]   Yeah, right.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.480]   600 bucks remote control.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.040]   You could have bought the Apple TV and--
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.040]   --a shuffle.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.040]   The money I saved.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.840]   So just for the record, it sounds like the Mac-a-lope and Andy both have iPhones.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   Is that accurate?
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.840]   I do.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.840]   Oh, yes.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.840]   So yeah, I know he does.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.840]   Andy has to.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:13.440]   By the way, now how much of the book did you write before it came out?
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.520]   The outline was 70% done because there's a whole bunch of blank land in there.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.040]   I wrote about the 20 or 21 chapters.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:25.640]   Three of them were written beforehand because three of them were website-specific and just
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.640]   technology-specific.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.760]   I've got an entire chapter just on how to make four gigs look like 40 gigs, that sort
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.760]   of thing.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.960]   And then so you didn't have to revise any of it when you actually got one and you played
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.680]   with it that all made sense.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:42.360]   Well, it's a lot like the way that I designed the first iPod book where I intentionally
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:47.320]   try to make lots of it free-floating so that I wouldn't necessarily have to anchor it in
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.360]   any one model or any one technology.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:54.480]   The biggest difficulty was just counting on something like, oh, they would be silly not
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.480]   to have disk mode on this.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:59.120]   So I'm going to count on-- unfortunately, I didn't actually write any of those chapters
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.120]   yet.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.120]   Just have an outline entry.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.120]   You have to delete.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:06.440]   Yeah, it was like-- well, because also the problem is publishing companies, they
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.440]   like to have details beforehand.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.080]   They were-- while it was wonderful, they basically handed me a contract saying, we trust you
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.800]   to at some point give us an outline on this.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.960]   And it was only about three, four days ago that I actually gave them the dang near final
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.040]   outline because there were so many things I just did not know were going to work or
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.760]   were not going to work or opportunities that are unique to the iPhone that, of course,
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.120]   I couldn't really guess that until I actually had one in my hands.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.040]   I think the wing thing I'd be worried about is that the phone itself is going to change
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.160]   substantially before the book comes out.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.480]   I mean, I just keep feeling like Apple's got to address some of these deficiencies we've
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.480]   been talking about.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:45.200]   Well, it's not so much deficiency, so much as a different kind of style.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.480]   For-- before we--
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.600]   It's already an iPhone show.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.600]   There's nothing we get to do.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.600]   OK.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.240]   Well, see, I'm happy turning this into Andy's iPhone book show because it costs a lot less
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.640]   for me to sit there here and talk to them by advertising.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.760]   Now, my book is different because, again, I was intentionally-- the first iPod book
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.520]   that I wrote, it's not a book on iPods.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.680]   It's a book, importantly, on how to convert anything you've got into a format that the
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.480]   iPod can deal with, which is why I was sort of begging the marketing department a while
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.160]   and he's saying, "Get some stickers ready to say this book is completely compatible with
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.640]   iPhone because I was intentionally making sure that everything in here would work and
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.360]   although language was vague enough so that if someone tried to buy an iPhone, I wanted
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:32.400]   to use this for techniques that could use it."
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.200]   But yeah, it's the people who are actually trying to write real iPhone books, you know,
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.200]   getting the most maximizing your iPhone, bamboozling your boss into thinking that it's actually
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.640]   a PDA when it's actually just a movie player for you.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.880]   It's those people who are like, "OK, now I've got three weeks to get all this technology
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.960]   in and write three chapters that are going to be invalidated by a brand new widget that's
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.960]   going to solve all the problems that I'm trying to teach people to work around."
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.720]   It's those people that I don't know how they're going to do it.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.240]   I feel so sorry for Chris Breen.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.480]   He's an incredibly talented writer and he's one of the guys that Apple should definitely
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:05.200]   be saying, "Look, we know you have children.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.320]   God would never put the trust of a child into someone who would file it an NDA agreement
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.320]   for God's sake.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.240]   He or haven't I bought two months in advance and we trust you not to screw things up for
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.240]   us?"
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.240]   Apparently not.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.920]   "Hey, I just found a really cool lava lamp widget for my dashboard.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.720]   Now I can see the value of the dashboard.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.640]   This was going to be my pick, but what the hell?
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.240]   Islayer.com.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.400]   I love lamp.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.400]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.080]   But you have to press F12 to get it.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.280]   They also make also these are the same people who do the I-Step.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.280]   I-Step Pro.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.840]   And many other fine products.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:45.520]   I finally had to turn off the auto updating on that because every time I got into dashboard
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.920]   I was saying there was a new version.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.920]   I know.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:48.920]   They've been updating a lot.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.920]   I agree.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.400]   Yeah, Clicksilver went through that phase too for a while where it's just a new version.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.520]   You've got to just accept them automatically.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.960]   You know what I like about this lava lamp is that it takes a while to warm up just like
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.720]   a real lava lamp.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.280]   Yeah, let's not avoid the boring parts of having the real thing.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:07.800]   But I improve it when you can actually not only have it just as in convenience but also
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.800]   make it expensive.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.360]   It's a perfect simulation.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.680]   I love an nostalgic annoyance.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.680]   That's good.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.680]   Right.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.760]   I actually wrote an A-Track tape player skin for iTunes that would...
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.680]   The only button is just a track list.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:26.240]   It would take you not only to a random track that he couldn't select but also would start
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.280]   at a random point during the song.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:38.200]   I seem to remember I had I think a rock for Campucheia and I remember every...
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:43.400]   They found a way to put a break, a fade out and a break right in the middle of like every
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.880]   like huge jamming song.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.720]   If every search I had a queen record that actually broke right in the middle of we are
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.720]   the champions.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.720]   I did.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:57.480]   Yeah, I don't know why they do that.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.480]   It's really yeah.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.480]   Boom, boom.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.480]   Ch.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.960]   No, but we're all...
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:09.280]   They didn't envision a world where digital players would take over from vinyl.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.280]   That was a problem.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:15.400]   Well, the downside of the CDs is all the long winded performers now.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.560]   I mean, I remember Gosh, what happened?
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.160]   You remember when you would have the 46 minute tapes?
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.960]   Because I record was always like 45, 46 minutes.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.960]   A minute.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.920]   And now they're always easy to put out a 70 minute record now, which is terrible.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.320]   Make them longer and longer.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.920]   No, that was my first job as a music critic internally.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.280]   I can 12 or 13 years old knowing that I've got a two sided 90 minute cassette.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:40.080]   Which one song of this album or this tape do I not want?
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.080]   Oh, interesting.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.080]   Ah.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.080]   Yep.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.680]   How am I going to cut it?
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.880]   Do we believe the rumors about the new MacBooks, the new MacBook Pros, whatever these skinny
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.160]   little things are?
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.160]   How about you, Mac-a-lope.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.640]   You got your finger on the pulse of rumor land.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:01.600]   Sound of crickets chirping.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.640]   Yeah, nothing, huh?
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.640]   Nothing.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.640]   Nothing.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.640]   They say a skinny...
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.880]   I've heard the rumor, but I like all of them.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.400]   I don't pick them.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.280]   And Gadget says the new iMacs will get the MacBook like keyboards.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.080]   That's also a rumor of that.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.080]   I got to.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.080]   Chiclet style.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.080]   Why would they do that?
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:23.040]   Yeah, I mean, part of the reasons why I have a desktop is because I don't have to suffer
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.040]   all the limitations of having a notebook.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.720]   I mean, I actually have the real...
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:36.120]   He's demonstrating something far away.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.080]   This is radio we can't see.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.760]   He left the room.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.760]   He actually went offline.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.520]   Andy, when you do mine, we can't see what you're doing.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.000]   I think he's fallen over dead.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   I don't know what happened.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   You know what happened?
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   I know he did.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.800]   He pressed command queue by accident.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:57.640]   He was banging on his keyboard and he quit Skype.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.640]   That's what happened.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.640]   I guarantee you.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.640]   Oh my gosh.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.480]   That's how emphatic he is about not wanting a MacBook keyboard.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.040]   Yeah, I guess not.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.080]   He said, "Well, we'll get him back in a little bit."
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.080]   Yes, he's gone.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.720]   Yeah, he's actually off Skype and I think it's probably because he quit it.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.960]   Right now he's wondering what the heck happened.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.960]   Hello?
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.960]   Hello?
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.760]   Next gen brushed aluminum iMac in August.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.920]   True or false?
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.920]   You can't really...
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:26.920]   I don't really want something that I'm going to shock myself on.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.920]   Brush aluminum.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.920]   Not a good idea.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.920]   I already do that on my laptop.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:34.160]   I don't need to do it on my tower as well.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:39.160]   Is that phony rumor?
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.160]   It does not.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.160]   Or does it?
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:46.240]   I think Apple and Fider had a phony Photoshop.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.320]   I guess we're just getting jaded about Apple rumors.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.520]   We realize there's nothing there.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.880]   Well, you know what?
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:57.320]   The only thing I've heard is that, yeah, I mean like August, September is whatever.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.560]   Well, I think we're due.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.520]   I mean, there's no question we're due, but we've been due for a new iPod for six months
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.680]   too and that hasn't happened.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.880]   So I don't know if there's a schedule that any...
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.600]   Can you really say there's a schedule in Apple land?
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.600]   I don't think so.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.760]   Well, I think the iPod got messed up because of the iPhone.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.600]   As far as stuff we think we're due for, we haven't looked at our...
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.240]   Is it time to buy a page in a while?
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.400]   But what are the stuff we're looking for right now?
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.760]   We're looking for the iLife to have some kind of update.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.760]   Whom leopard do you think?
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.120]   It'll just wait till October and it'll all come out at once.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.640]   iLife 0.9 or whatever it is.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.360]   Before school, you think.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.360]   It's totally bound to leopard so they can't put it up for our numbers.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.360]   No, it's the...
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.360]   And unless...
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.760]   Again, this comes back to that argument we had before.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:42.560]   Does Apple's so skinny on resources that they can only do one thing at a time?
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.240]   I mean, it seems like it.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.520]   So we're due for an iPod.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.280]   We're due for an iMac.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.000]   Yeah, I mean, it's interesting.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   I mean, just look, I mean, gosh, I got to tell you the truth.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.240]   In my vexing frustration with iPhone coverage, I finally have some unsubscribed from about...
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.240]   Almost a dozen.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.240]   Almost a dozen.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.880]   You know, I think we lost probably half of our listeners on both Mac break weekly.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.200]   Actually, less so Mac break weekly, but I think on Twitch, I have never received so much
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.720]   hate mail for coverage.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.720]   I mean, I don't feel like I need to justify it.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.720]   It's a big story.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.720]   I understand people are saying it.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.720]   It's huge story.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.160]   It's a huge story and it's a great product, which makes it even more nuanced and grown
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.480]   up for me because it's very...
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.960]   It isn't that I exactly precisely hate the iPhone.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.960]   It's just that...
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.240]   But the funny part is that there's been such...
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:32.000]   You could any of the major Mac sites and I would venture to say that over the last three
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.720]   weeks that comprised well over 80% of the stories, if not more.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:41.760]   It's interesting because I've definitely gone off the ball as a Mac fan base for most
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.760]   of us.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:47.640]   Well, and that's what one person said, which I thought was really telling was, "When are
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.640]   you going to get...
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.880]   I can't wait to get back to talking about the Macintosh."
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.160]   And I almost want to say that to Apple.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.560]   I can't wait to get back to working on the Macintosh.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.560]   What happened?
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.800]   Well, and also, I mean, we saw some little incremental changes with the MacBook and the
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:07.000]   MacBook Pro, but I don't know about any kind of crazy, you know, 4-inch screen Mac or anything
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   like that.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.520]   But I stand by my personal hobby horse of thinking that I would still like to see long
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.560]   battery life super portable come along at some point.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.080]   Do you guys think that's something to make me feel better?
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.520]   No, but the good news is Sony has cut the PlayStation 3 price by a hundred bucks.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.400]   So there's some consolation there.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.400]   I don't think I agree with that.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:33.280]   Sony would be a good case study to look at because I don't know personally how well...
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:37.040]   I mean, it seems like the BIOS fell pretty well.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.880]   They made those 505s are great.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.200]   Those little sellers, I love those.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.800]   And on the PC side, there are lots of really tiny laptops.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.080]   Again, I don't know how well they sell, but they're enough of them.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.360]   How well they sell relative to the bigger machine.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.360]   Right.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.360]   There's certainly demand for it.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.360]   Apple doesn't have to worry, right?
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.360]   Because no one else can...
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.480]   They don't have to worry about somebody else coming up with one.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.120]   There's no hurry.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:02.320]   We may demand it, but if they don't see enough business, it's not like anybody else is going
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.960]   to get that business.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:08.000]   So that's the disadvantage of a monopoly from the point of view of a consumer.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   There's no incentive for them to do that.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.480]   As long as people keep going out and buying MacBooks, they don't care.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:16.080]   So Andy, our thesis was that when you mash the keyboard, you mash command Q and you quit
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.080]   out of Skype.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:23.880]   No, what happened was I fractionally dislodged the microphone, my headphone from the headphone
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:29.360]   jack here, and Skype said, "Oh, I must crash now."
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.240]   And then basically, fortunately, I have three power books here, so I was able to simply make
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.800]   my displeasure to it known with a bottle of gasoline and a small match out in the port.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.160]   And now I'm on the third power book in the house.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.160]   Yes.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.160]   And there's a little...
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.160]   Well, most of this is a lesson to the other computers.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:45.160]   The barbecue in the back, folks.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.160]   Wow.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.160]   Wow.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.160]   How did it sound?
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.320]   Does it sound really cool?
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.240]   No, unfortunately, it sounded like nothing.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.240]   You just disappeared and we thought...
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.800]   Well, it felt like you maybe fell asleep or something.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.520]   So none of my cursing made it on air.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.520]   Excellent.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.520]   Hey, good news.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.400]   The image well has been updated to 322 and now supports Flickr as well as Smug Mug and
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.400]   Image Shack automatically.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:10.160]   Ooh, making that little tool, which I think somebody made their pick of the week one.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.520]   I think that was Scott might have made that, had that as a pick.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.120]   And I thought it looked pretty good too.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.120]   It's very cool.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:19.200]   Well, they've updated now to a 3.2.2, I think.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:26.440]   I have become, as I've mentioned before, quite a nerd of a similar program, which I think
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.640]   you're using, Leo, which is...
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.080]   Oh, why is the name flaking on me right now?
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.080]   The...
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.440]   We'll fix all this in post.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.440]   Skitch.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.800]   Skitch just went to a, I think, a broader beta, I give that some in.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.400]   Skitch is one of those hot invites.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.400]   Everybody wants a Skitch invite.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.400]   Tell us what...
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.400]   Yeah, but you picked a Skitch.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.920]   You picked Skitch a while ago, but tell us a little more about it.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:52.360]   And I'll tell you, something that I do...
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.360]   It's funny.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.800]   I've always taken screenshots of stuff.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:59.120]   And I've always, you know, that's always been a great thing for doing documentation or
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:04.520]   whatever, but it's funny how with Flickr and community sites, how the ability to take
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.360]   a quick screenshot and even annotate it has become something that's just something you
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.360]   need all the time.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.000]   And then to be able to upload that without having to go through a lot of trouble.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.680]   And Skitch just turns that into this completely idiot-proof process that I find amazing.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:23.600]   It's got built-in ability to support multiple ways to upload to various sites.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.400]   It's got built-in Flickr support.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:29.680]   I have this kind of junk drawer online on one of my sites where I throw stuff.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.320]   And it basically gives you a little pop-down menu so you can like capture anything, doodle
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:39.120]   on it, whatever, and then just hit one button to upload it to Flickr or wherever.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.960]   And it's amazing.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:45.320]   Once you have that ability and it doesn't become like a five-step, you know, confusing
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.560]   process, it's amazing how often you will use that.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.600]   I use it for putting stuff on 43 folders.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.640]   I use it for putting stuff up on Flickr.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:56.040]   And I think it's going to be a huge hit.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.480]   Skitch, any word about when they're going to...
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.480]   It's from Plask, because people who do...
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.480]   It's from Plask.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.480]   They do the comic.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.480]   I'm a comic copy.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.480]   Do you guys need...
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.480]   I'm sketching.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.480]   I'm already sketching.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.480]   You guys good?
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.480]   Thanks to Rick at Mac Mercky.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.480]   He's sketching me.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.480]   I am sketchless.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.480]   Well...
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.480]   I will sketch you up.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.040]   I'm not a world that will be my last invite.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.040]   I don't have any more.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.680]   How about you, Mr. Lope?
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.680]   Are you sketchified?
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:19.680]   I'm sketchless.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.680]   Well, maybe I can...
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:21.680]   Aww.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.680]   Maybe I can sketch you.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.680]   I have to see.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.680]   I didn't realize I got some more invites.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.080]   I bet Chris would sketch you up.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.080]   He's a...
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.080]   Oh, baby.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.280]   Let me sketch you from "Das chill doll."
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.400]   Oh, I want to sketch you up.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.400]   That would be a good...
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.400]   That would be a good...
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.400]   You're never going to sketch you up!
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.400]   I'm going to grab you down!
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.400]   You've never got to scream each other!
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.400]   Sorry.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.640]   He's still alive.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.640]   Not after you heard that.
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.840]   He's growing his grade and he's not.
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.720]   Either he or his estate is going to come after you.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.720]   Sketch.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.720]   Let me see.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.120]   At the first 18 cents that song is earned in what?
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.120]   Eight years?
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.120]   No, we don't pay royalties.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.120]   Sorry.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.120]   Don't come to me.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.120]   Awesome!
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.120]   Yes!
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.120]   Don't come to me if you want money.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.120]   Rick, go to...
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.120]   What's his name?
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.120]   I think...
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.120]   In that go.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.760]   I think sketch is a slight rattle though.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.280]   I think sketch is such an interesting kind of class of application though.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:14.040]   Because when I was coming up on the Mac, you had these certain kinds of specific apps.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.480]   You had your writing apps and you had your drawing apps and that kind of stuff.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:24.840]   I think it's neat that they came in and saw this need for a super lightweight internet-friendly
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.640]   app for doing nothing but capturing like that.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:31.240]   I think it's going to be interesting as social media gets more casual and more of us get
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.920]   on these different services and want to be able to communicate through multimedia.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.640]   I think it's going to be interesting to see where that goes.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.040]   You can see the same thing happening with something like video, where it can make it
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:46.320]   incredibly easy for you to just upload a little bit of video, almost like a blog comment.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.280]   I think that's going to be an interesting area to watch.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.280]   I don't get it.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.760]   I'm not sure I understand what you do with this.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.080]   I mean, and I've played with it.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.560]   You're saying it's more of a social thing.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.880]   Well, if you're somebody like a lot of my Flickr friends, often to a fault, are just forever
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.480]   uploading different screenshots of things.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.480]   Right.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.560]   I totally see what you're saying because so many blog posts are about what I'm doing,
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.040]   what I'm looking at right now, and a lot of what you're doing and what you're looking
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.120]   at right now is through a screen.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.320]   Yeah, I totally get this.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.240]   So you're seeing a screen grab application more than anything else.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.240]   Right.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.360]   And just thinking as part of what I would see as an emerging class, I'm sure there's apps
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.360]   out there that do something like this right now.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:29.040]   But something like right now, if I want to capture video, it's not difficult.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.760]   I mean, I can use broadcast or I can use whatever.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.600]   I can just open something and upload it.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.440]   But to see something where increasingly these things are going to become so lightweight
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.720]   that it becomes like a key combination and a click to make it go somewhere.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.080]   Do you have it open right now?
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.080]   I'm opening it right now.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:46.520]   I just have to remember my password because I haven't used it in a while.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.520]   Okay.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.520]   All right.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.520]   I've got my squish, my squish.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.520]   Oh, it's a tick command shift.
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.160]   I think that should work for you.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.480]   So again, press command shift five.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.480]   I think it's command shift five.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.480]   Is that right?
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.480]   Yes, it did.
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.480]   Something.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.480]   Take a screen snap.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.480]   Okay.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.480]   Let's take a screen.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.480]   So you can you see how you can grab the lower left or right.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.360]   But it's too changed.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.400]   And then hits.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.960]   And now one of the things I like is as you resize the image in the window, it also resizes
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.240]   the image itself, right?
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.240]   That's kind of cool.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.360]   You have a little web post button down in the lower right.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.080]   So I could put that up on my blog or Doc Mac.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.760]   And depending on which version you have, you may have the one I've got that's got a
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.280]   little arrow to the right of that where you can click and see all of your different
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.280]   ones.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.280]   I can put it on my Mac.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:31.440]   So you're saying sharing your screen is a social thing these days that people do.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.980]   I think I think so.
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.280]   It could be something like, oh, here's this new.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.720]   Here's the somebody like Christmas, Cina.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.000]   Christmas, Cina does nothing post nothing but screenshots.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Right.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   He's very in showing.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.560]   Flock mine screenshots and everything.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:49.440]   But his whole thing is he's creating what amounts to a library of patterns, like UI
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.600]   patterns, just say, well, here's how I handle login buttons.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.600]   Sure.
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.600]   So there's him.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.400]   Then there's just kind of garden variety, Macner or two out there going, oh, check out
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:03.640]   the new preference pane in this app or, you know, here's a goofy error message I got
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.200]   that's really funny and so on.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.200]   And I don't know.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.200]   Just making that really easy to grab.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:13.560]   I mean, something like Snap, Snap's Pro, it's good, but you know, I still need to go over
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:18.320]   to transmit and then drag it over, you know, this kind of makes it such a seamless process.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.320]   All right.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.320]   Well, ImageWell is kind of like that too.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.880]   ImageWell has the built in FTP and upload and now it goes to Flickr too.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:27.360]   So these would be two different kinds of ways of looking at the same thing.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.960]   ImageWell does not have the screenshots capabilities though.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:30.960]   It's interesting.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.960]   I think they solve similar problems.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.720]   Again, things like you look at some of the XML RPC apps, think about something like Ecto
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.240]   and Mars edit, similar kind of thing.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.240]   Yep.
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.320]   You know, getting you out of those stupid web fields and making it really easy for your
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:48.000]   Mac to become the center for your, you know, multimedia communication.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Sexy.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   Sexy.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.360]   Well, I have to see, I don't know how to find out if I have more invitations, but
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.400]   Macalope, don't feel left out.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.600]   I will try to find some invitations and send it.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.800]   Well, it's actually a contender request to get one.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.320]   Oh, yeah, that'll work.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.320]   Join the crowd.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.120]   Of course, you could say I am the Macalope.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.280]   Well, I was hoping.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.280]   I am.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   Look upon my works at despair.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.720]   That's the hackloaf.com, mate.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:14.960]   Well, they're listening right now.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.280]   They're sending you one right now.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.640]   After that big, long, sketch plug, they ought to, baby.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.880]   But this has been in beta for some time.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:25.520]   I wonder when Plask plans to put it out.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.520]   I don't know.
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:27.520]   He's been making little improvements to it.
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.360]   When I first got it, it's one of those apps where, as you may know, Leo, I've been kind
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:36.080]   of on an ongoing, like, two-year-long rant about, weirdly enough, how I want more and
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:39.320]   more OS 10 apps to kind of look and operate the same.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.440]   And this is very much its own app.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:45.440]   Yeah, it does not fit the user interface guidelines.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.440]   That's for sure.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.680]   It's in a really weird mystery meat window, but it's grown on me.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.680]   That's similar, by the way.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.240]   Also, did you get the tearing?
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.520]   Did you get the drag me function?
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.520]   Did you see that?
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.520]   Yeah, what does that do?
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.520]   I see it, but I don't understand.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.520]   Well, grab it.
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.880]   And then, so click on drag me and then tear it over to your desktop.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.960]   I could tear it to image well.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:02.960]   Let's see what happens.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.280]   Oh, there it goes to image well.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:07.640]   Or you can add watermarks or shadows or--
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.440]   You can drop it into an email.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.400]   There's an email, this image functionality.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.080]   God, this is such an infomercial.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.240]   I'm really embarrassed.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.200]   But that's what it's about.
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.200]   I'm trying to say that.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.920]   This show is about enthusiasm for Macintosh.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.360]   People often say, you plug a lot of stuff.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.800]   And I said, no, really, my job is not to plug stuff, but to find good stuff and tell
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.120]   you about it, and when stuff's bad to tell you about it.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.640]   So it sounds like we're always plugging things.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.080]   But what we're doing is trying to find the good stuff and tell you about it.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.880]   It's been more time ragging on Mac apps.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.840]   We should get back to our ragging on a high-cal.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.840]   I think every week or so we should spend a lot of that.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.320]   We could make everybody happy and rag on the iPhone.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.440]   I could do an iPhone rant every week.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.200]   To quote my favorite band Sloan.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.200]   It's not the band I hate.
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.200]   It's their fans.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.200]   It's like, oh my God.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.200]   It's getting better.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.200]   It's getting better.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.200]   Yeah, I'm still using it.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.200]   I'm still happy with it.
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.200]   Edge is terrible.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.000]   And all the things that we said were terrible are still terrible.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   We'll see what happens.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Edge isn't terrible.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   It's just not as good as that.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.640]   It might be better where you might be better in Boston than it is.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.400]   It's worse than Edge on T-Mobile.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:17.800]   I mean, it's just maybe there's a lot of iPhone users in the Bay Area and all of a sudden
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:18.800]   it's being challenged.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.640]   I don't know what it is, but it's just been unusable.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.320]   Yeah, I mean, that's been difficult a lot.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.320]   Really?
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.320]   Okay.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:29.560]   One thing that'd be interesting is as long as we've got the Macalope here, I've been
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:34.280]   just started reading Gruber again in the last couple of days.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:39.640]   He has been following a lot of the iPhone battery talk.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:44.680]   Do you have any thoughts on all of the mainstream coverage on these so-called battery problems?
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:50.400]   Well, I think what he's been getting on is that there's been a number of reports saying
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:54.760]   to the effect that the iPhone battery dies after 400 charges.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.760]   And it's not true.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.800]   I mean, the battery does not die.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:01.040]   It actually just goes below 80%.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.040]   Right.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.040]   Yeah, it still holds about eight-cent of a-
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.040]   That's not a storage.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.840]   The stories are what you would call a full charge anymore.
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:13.600]   And so these guys are all these reports are all saying, "Oh, how would people buy this?"
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.760]   You have a $500 phone when it's only going to hold 400 charges.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.960]   I mean, the battery is going to go bad in a year and then you're going to have to send
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.120]   it into Apple for three days and it's 89 dollars.
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.400]   Yeah, that doesn't bother me.
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.480]   That actually, believe it or not, that does not bother.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.920]   I'm more bothered by the functionality on it.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:32.680]   Although Gruber might be happy to hear that according to Think Secret, or actually this
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.280]   is a correspondent, Steven, who sent me a note.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.400]   He's looking at a Think Secret page.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.480]   The Leopard Mail has a notes feature.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.400]   And so maybe notes will finally sync with something.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.160]   But yeah, he had speculated on that too.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.160]   Did he say that?
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.160]   All right.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.160]   Good credit to John.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:50.160]   That would be nice.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.040]   Of course, I have to wait till October until my notes do anything.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.200]   That's all right.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.200]   I can live with that.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.440]   I don't use notes that much.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.640]   I want to do an Audible ad and then we'll get to our software picks of the week.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.960]   We want to thank Audible as always for sponsoring this podcast and many of the podcasts on the
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:08.960]   Twit Network.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.400]   Anybody have a book?
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.080]   It's kind of a battle between Andy and Merlin.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:17.240]   You both of you always seem to have some good Audible selections.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.000]   If you don't, I can come up with one.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.600]   But I always like to give you the chance to recommend something.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:29.920]   I wish to recommend the greatest novel in English published in the last 100 years.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.000]   If that's all right.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.840]   I'm trying to think what that could be.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:33.840]   That too.
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.680]   The greatest novel published in English.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.840]   Originally written in English?
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:39.600]   Originally written in English.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:43.480]   Of course, I don't know what language you're not going to say you listen to.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.760]   I'm going to say James Joyce.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.760]   I know.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.560]   You're not going to say Ulysses or Finnegan's Wake, are you?
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.880]   Oh, wrong and wrong.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.160]   The author is, of course, PG Woodhouse.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:54.560]   The book is, of course, the code of the Woosters.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.640]   There are two versions of it available on Audible.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.920]   One is the, you're not, let's see, you're laughing over it.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:04.160]   I've read many of those books, but I don't think I've read the code of the Woosters.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.160]   It is.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:09.480]   I think one of the ultimate books I've ever read because there is such a gotcha three
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.880]   quarters of the way into it because this was the first.
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:15.280]   Now, PG Woodhouse is the guy who came up with Jeeves.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:20.120]   Every time you see a butler that looks like Jeeves or sounds like Jeeves, it's like Superman.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.880]   He didn't just like grow out of the ground.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.360]   This one guy thought him up.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.920]   He wrote hundreds and hundreds of short stories.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.920]   Very funny.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:27.920]   He's being in this category.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:28.920]   Extremely funny.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:29.920]   This was the first.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:33.840]   And Bertie Wooster is the, is Jeeves's master.
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:37.760]   Would be one, there would be some discussion as to who the master is in this relationship.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:42.960]   The Jeeves stories are always brilliant because he's the person who has the clever solution
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.440]   to every single problem.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:49.680]   Bertie Wooster has not only an odd life on his own, but he has relatives and friends
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.840]   who keep getting into difficulties that only Jeeves can extract them from.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:56.200]   And it's been an idea that's been recycled and recycled.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:01.800]   Ever since he invented this, Woodhouse created this idea, but nobody writes as well.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.200]   No one writes better than PG Woodhouse.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:09.360]   No one can create a story that's so intricate and yet shows none of the labor that goes
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.160]   into the complexity of the story.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:16.400]   What I love so much about this particular book is that if you happen to be a fan of
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.440]   Woodhouse, you happen to know that this was the first novel, novel length story he decided
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.080]   to tell with these characters.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:27.560]   And it takes the form of like an episode of the loveboat where, yes, it's all happening.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:30.480]   All these little stories are happening in the same place, but you know that, okay, they
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.480]   wrote this story, then the story with Adrian's.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.960]   You said not only you invented Jeezy invented the loveboat.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.040]   He invented us all really.
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.040]   We all owe our lives.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.320]   This microphone I'm speaking into.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.360]   PG Woodhouse originally thought about it.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.440]   He just, you know, he found a funny story, funny anecdote.
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.440]   Now there's two of these.
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.760]   There's there's there's Jeeves to the rescue and the code of the Worcester's.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:48.760]   Which one do you recommend?
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:49.760]   Does it matter?
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:53.480]   The code, I believe that I don't have the audible page in front of me because I've been
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:54.480]   talking for the past five minutes.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.480]   But there's three of them.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.480]   There's three of them.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.880]   There's there's there's one version that's the unexpiated version that's just the an
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.160]   off someone narrating the entire book.
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:07.640]   There's another that's a dramatization done by BBC radio that I think is absolutely wonderful.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:11.680]   I think to get the whole the whole book, you really need to buy the book and read it because,
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.600]   again, it's so well written and so funny paragraph after paragraph.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:20.360]   He keeps coming up with these sims, similes like, day, day, day, day, man, Judith, settled
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:23.960]   into my largest armchair is so it would have been built by, built around her by carpenter
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:27.480]   who knew that they were wearing armchairs tight around the hips.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.480]   That's.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:35.560]   So definitely get the read the full version as a book, but the dramatized version is shorter.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:39.160]   It's a lot more lively, especially if you're listening to something in the car.
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:42.760]   But again, one of my favorite authors and probably the favorite book by my favorite author,
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:46.280]   I was about to try to describe exactly why it's so good, but that's always useless.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.280]   Just read it.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.280]   Just read it.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.280]   Exactly.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.280]   It's wonderful.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.800]   I have never I've read so many of these and I don't know why I don't think I've read
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:52.800]   this one.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:53.800]   So I'm putting this on my list.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.800]   The code of the boosters.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.080]   I've seen the fry and lorry version.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.880]   How do you feel about their portrayal?
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:03.200]   I think they well visually and they they act to the parts perfectly.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.800]   They look the parts perfectly.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:10.040]   The only dissident the only thing that I didn't like about the series is that what makes
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:14.680]   Jeeves such a wonderful character is that he is the master of subtlety and making it
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:19.200]   making it exactly finding the exact right solution that didn't exist before he suggested it.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.760]   And then you realize that this is the only way out of this tricky social situation is
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.880]   to do exactly what Jeeves did.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.640]   And sometimes for the purposes of having a one hour long episode, they had to really,
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.400]   really simplify things down.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:35.080]   Also in the books, Bertie Wooster has a saying saying, well, you know, people say I rely
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.120]   too much on Jeeves.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.040]   It's all done in the first person.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.640]   People say I rely too much on Jeeves.
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:42.880]   What I say is that, well, look, if you have someone as smart as Jeeves, why would you
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.960]   think too much for yourself?
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.640]   Rest in the in the in the TV show, he's a little bit more arrogant, a little bit more
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:52.040]   Oh, Jeeves just, you know, know your place, Jeeves know your place and Jeeves of course
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:56.640]   has to haul them out of the soup despite the master's worst intentions.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:00.320]   So there are you can you can read the book on abridged@audible.com, but you want the
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.360]   dramatized code of the Wooster's.
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.760]   I'm recommending the dramatized version.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.520]   Yes, by PG Woodhouse.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.120]   And that is a great recommendation.
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:13.960]   I'm going to I'm putting that in our on our list of books that must be read.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:16.840]   And if you want to get it free, if you're not already a member of Audible, if you are,
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.880]   just add it to your list, put it on your wish list, your my next lesson and pop up.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.680]   But if you are not yet an audible member, and I know there are a few of you left who
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:28.560]   haven't joined, you can join and get this book for free if you decide not to stick around.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:36.680]   All you have to do is go to audible.com/macbreak, audible.com/macbreak for a free audio book.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:41.080]   And this week, we're recommending the code of the Wooster's dramatized by PG Woodhouse.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.600]   Good recommendation, Annie.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.760]   Did you have something Merlin that you had prepared?
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:49.200]   Oh, no, I think that's I think I'd like to get that's a good start.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.680]   I think that's great.
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:55.080]   They have two different readers versions of this, and I like the Simon Preble version
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.760]   of the if you're going to read the book, Simon Preble's really good.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:51:59.760]   But just a thought.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.760]   Audible.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:01.760]   Do you get your favorites?
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.760]   I'm sorry, I mean I interrupt you.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:04.680]   But do you do you get favorite people reading books?
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.680]   Oh, you bet.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.680]   And I get people I don't like.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.360]   I mean, when I somebody I don't like, I stop listening to their, you know, I don't
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:14.960]   read that book on Audible, but it's like when George got the textbook read for him on
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:18.800]   Seinfeld, and he can't stand the guy because it sounds like his voice.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.280]   That's pretty funny.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:21.960]   I didn't, I must have missed that episode.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:22.960]   That's very funny.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:23.960]   Yeah, it's probably people.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:24.960]   It's a good job.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:28.920]   But if you're if you can pretend like you're blind, you can get entire books read for you.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:31.320]   Free, absolutely free.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:35.400]   This is audible.com/macbreak, and we thank them for their support of the program.
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:40.160]   It's time now for what many consider the best part of the program are picks.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.520]   And let me start because I don't want anybody to steal this pick.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:47.160]   I just got an email yesterday from the folks at Nisys.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.280]   You old timers remember Nisys, of course.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:51.120]   It's a nice writer.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.200]   They're a nice writer.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:56.440]   What a wonderful old word processor, but it was very OS 9 specific.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.920]   One of the advantages of Nisys was it saved files in a text format.
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:03.280]   But the so you could always read it, but but the formatting was in a set was in I guess
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.400]   it was in the resource fork.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:09.360]   So you could you never lost the text, but you could, but you got formatting to that
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.960]   nice feature, I think is long gone.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:15.200]   They do save an RTF format now, but it is really if you don't want to use Microsoft
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:21.640]   Word, you want an affordable word processor yesterday, Nisys writer pro finally came back
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:22.640]   to the Mac.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:26.840]   I've been using Nisys writer express for a while, but missing some of the really powerful
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:31.840]   features of a Nisys writer, the old Nisys writer, it's back Pearl macros.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:36.760]   I mean, if you know Pearl, this is the most powerful text processor in the world.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:41.000]   It has, you know, things like searching by attributes.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.960]   So you can search for all bold text that begins with queue.
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:45.240]   I mean, it's very smart.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.760]   This is one of the features that made Nisys writers so great.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.200]   The search and replace on Nisys writer was was the reason why you bought it.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:55.360]   You could, you know, if you needed to translate an entire book from Italian to Portuguese,
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.480]   you could do it as like a three line search.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:59.400]   It was it was that powerful.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:04.760]   I'm only exaggerating a little bit line numbering text wrap around images with all it's all
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:09.880]   back table of contents indexing cross referencing glossaries.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:12.440]   It is it is back and it's beautiful.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:15.160]   It's $9 if you don't have, but you can download free to try it.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:19.480]   I'm just really I'm glad to give them a plug because I just think these guys have been
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:23.640]   around for so long and they've and I tell you, I've been using it all day and it's great.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.200]   It's so great to have this old friend back.
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.200]   It looks a lot prettier than the old one too.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.200]   Oh, it's yeah.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.280]   The old ones may be a little funky.
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.760]   This is a real yeah quirky.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.760]   This is a real cocoa ish.
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.760]   I don't know if it's cocoa.
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:36.480]   I bet it is application.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:42.400]   They've done a very nice job of of bringing back the features people really wanted.
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:46.280]   But making it a real Mac app, you know, there's no reason now to use Microsoft Word.
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.080]   It saves and writes.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.840]   It reads and writes word format files too.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.840]   So you're not you're not left out of the word world.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.520]   And foreign language was the specialty too, wasn't it?
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:59.960]   I remember correctly you could actually even like in Hebrew, you could write from right
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:00.960]   to left.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:05.320]   Almost all the Mac Word, but it must be a feature now of the text input routines because also
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:08.600]   I think almost like Mel and Mariner.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:12.840]   I'm almost all the Mac Word processors now do left, right as well as right, left.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:14.120]   But yes, that's right.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.120]   Nice.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.120]   This was the first to do it.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:19.560]   I just really happy that you know, it's just a great word processor gets out of the way
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.760]   and lets you work.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:27.040]   So that's my pick of the week, not free, but you can try it for free and I S U S dot com.
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.640]   Why don't we let the Macelope go next?
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:30.360]   You got a pick for us today, Mr. Love?
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.360]   I do.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.520]   It's just a small one, but it's one that I wanted to mention because I was actually
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:38.000]   looking for it a couple of weeks ago when I was traveling and I couldn't find it.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.720]   And then suddenly I found it again today.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:56:05.360]   It's called Aurora and maybe it's been mentioned on Mac
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.360]   the alarm clocks that they put in hotel rooms.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:16.080]   It's either some horrendous buzzing sound or it's you know, Merlin's A-Track playing.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:22.760]   So I always want to be able to wake up to one of my iTunes playlists and Aurora is free
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:24.600]   and allows you to do that.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:28.640]   So basically you just go in and you just set yourself an alarm and you tell it which playlist
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:34.280]   you want to play and you can set the volume and a bunch of other features that you can
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:35.280]   do too.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.040]   You can set it to whether you want to shuffle, you can set the date of the week that you
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.440]   want the alarm to go off on.
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.320]   There's a bunch of different features.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:45.080]   There's also you can set it to fall asleep at a certain time.
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:50.440]   So if you're watching a movie or if you're typing away and you're listening to music,
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:57.480]   you can just set it to your you can set iTunes to go off or you're actually your Mac to
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.480]   go off.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:02.920]   So even if the Mac is sleeping, it'll wake it up.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.920]   I think it'll do that too.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:06.920]   But this is going the other way.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:07.920]   This is that night when you're...
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.040]   Oh, I'm going off me to go to sleep.
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:11.040]   Exactly.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:15.320]   You can set it to sleep or you can make it restart or shut down.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:17.960]   And then if you're working in bed and it's on your lap, you can roll over and it'll fall
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:18.960]   off onto the floor and...
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.720]   I do that all the time.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.920]   I can't buy yourself a new one.
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:25.160]   But let me see who it's from here.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.600]   It's metacork.de.
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:32.120]   M-E-T-A-Q-U-A-R-K dot de.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.920]   Who's more savvy about sleep than the Danes, I ask?
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.680]   I think it's Germany.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:39.080]   It's like a Swiss watch.
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.080]   Oh, well.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.080]   Slash Aurora.
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:42.080]   A-U-R-O-R-A.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.080]   A-U-R-O-R-A.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:45.440]   Sounds like a cheer.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.240]   A U-O-R-R-A.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.240]   Aurora.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.240]   Good pick.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.240]   Thank you, Mac-A-Lope.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:53.280]   We now know how Mac-A-Lope arises each day.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.480]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.240]   And Mr. Merlin-Man, you got a pick for us?
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.280]   I absolutely do.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:02.920]   I would encourage you, all of you, right now, to go to flyingmeat.com.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.000]   I knew you were doing this one.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   You knew this.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   I did.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   I did.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   I did.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   I looked at that and I thought, no, I'm not going to do that one.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   Flyingmeat.com/flygesture.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.480]   Gus Mueller is one of the smartest boys in the Mac world.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:20.440]   And he puts out wonderful stuff like Voodoo Pad and FlySketch.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:22.640]   And he's a really cool developer.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.080]   He just put out this application.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:27.080]   I don't know if it's been out before, but I know it's now free.
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:28.720]   And I just became aware of it very recently.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:30.880]   It's called Flygesture.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.880]   And it's really cool and it's really weird.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:37.880]   It's an application that basically-- how can I describe this?
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:42.160]   It allows you to use gestures to do different kinds of things on your Mac.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.160]   So you flip off your Mac and--
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:44.160]   Mouse gestures, right?
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:45.160]   Mouse gestures.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.160]   Mouse gestures.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:47.160]   That's right.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.160]   You can like--
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.160]   Arthur St.H.E.R.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:50.160]   Directing.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:56.880]   No, you get this notional basically 25-point grid, a 5x5.grid.
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:03.400]   And you basically say-- so example, if I move over, you get this to pop up by using some
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.240]   kind of a meta key, like F1, I think is the default.
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:11.000]   And you say, OK, if I go two to the right and one down, that changes my iTunes track
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.400]   or what have you.
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:15.440]   You kind of got to see it to understand it and play with it to get it.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.960]   How easy is it to make the gesture?
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:20.600]   I mean, do you have to train yourself to learn the gesture?
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:25.520]   Well, you know, if I remember my first exposure to gestures, I think was on Firefox.
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:31.400]   And I remember it took me one really annoying day and one really less annoying day before
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:34.960]   they became like, you know, really kind of baked in.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:40.320]   I think it works a lot like Quicksilver when you get into stuff like this where you think
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:43.080]   to yourself, OK, what gesture would I think of to do this?
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:45.040]   And then have it remember that.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:47.760]   And so you know, you can choose to learn the ones the gusses put in or you can come up
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.920]   with your own.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:52.840]   But I mean, I think it's mostly interesting as just another neat thing you can do with
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:53.840]   your Mac.
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.240]   I don't know if it's something that people are going to use every day.
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:59.160]   I could see, though, if you, for instance, you kind of got memorized a closed window gesture,
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.720]   it might be easier to do that than it is.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:06.000]   You know, I'll tell you where I think it would be really helpful is if you have if you're
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.480]   somebody who's like like Andy, who's cooked up a lot of really cool Apple scripts for
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:14.120]   doing different kinds of stuff, you do periodically, I could see that being really possible.
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.880]   There used to be something for Quicksilver.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:19.400]   If you know this Mac Club jump in, I want to say it was called Abra Cadaabra.
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.400]   Was that right there?
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.400]   But there was either used to be.
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.720]   I don't know if that might add.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:28.280]   I'm probably getting this wrong, but I know there used to be in addition to mouse and keyboard
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.280]   triggers.
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:32.920]   There used to have also has been in the past gestures.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:36.880]   So it's just interesting because it depends on everybody thinks about this stuff differently.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.560]   Some people will always use the menus to go places.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.840]   Other people will always learn the keys.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.560]   Other people will do everything from the terminal.
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.840]   If you're the kind of person who thinks more in this kind of almost 3D way about the way
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:47.840]   you use your Mac.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:48.840]   Yeah, I think that's terrific.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.440]   It's for people who think this way.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.920]   But even if you don't end up using this, just go have a look at it.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:58.840]   It's a really cool application just to play with.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:02.880]   He's a great developer and you should buy a stuff.
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:06.680]   And just in case you're worried that you won't be accurate enough for your drawing, you said
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.640]   this, but I didn't get it until I played with it.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.880]   When you press F1, a grid does pop up, so you know what you're doing.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:14.680]   Yeah, it looks like one of those little electronics boards.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.920]   That's the part I like.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:16.920]   It's kind of fun.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:17.920]   You want to draw on the grid.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.200]   And it's "Oh, look at making play, ding, ding, ding, dong.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:27.800]   It's something that I think is more common in Linux to have these kinds of things.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:30.160]   But I'm kind of surprised there isn't more stuff like this on the Mac.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.600]   First time I saw gestures was on the palm.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.600]   Oh, sure.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.160]   Oh my gosh, we're short cuts.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.160]   That's right.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.640]   Those little shortcuts.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.640]   I forgot about that.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.500]   I think that's probably the genesis because if you're working with a stylist, this is a very
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.000]   natural way to work.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.200]   So yeah, if you've got a what do I call it?
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.200]   A whackum?
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.200]   It would be great.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.200]   It's something that might make a lot of sense.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.200]   Anyway, there you go.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.360]   If somebody uses Photoshop all the time and you just don't want to kind of get back to
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.360]   the mousing thing.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.360]   Exactly.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:00.240]   So it's flyingmeat.com/flygesture from the makers of Voodoo Pad, Fly Sketch and many
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.560]   other wonderful goods.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:05.200]   It is free as in beer and fly gesture.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.200]   I love it.
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.120]   Andy and I co last but not least.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.140]   Well, you're going to feel a little better about your recommendation, Leo, because I'm
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:16.480]   recommending a commercial piece of software that costs three bucks more than yours.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.840]   But let me tell you why it's so great.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.600]   It really has changed the way that I take pictures.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.080]   I am a bit of a photo nut.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.360]   I'm also a bit of a diner fan.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.280]   So I went to Worcester, Massachusetts just about an hour outside of Boston to take a
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.800]   picture of the legendary Miss Worcester diner.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.400]   And it's a great, it's a beautiful old classic diner.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:40.560]   The problem is that it's right next door to a huge, like rusted steel railroad bridge
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.840]   that where just no light can possibly get through this thing.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:47.360]   And so if you just stood there on the sidewalk and took the picture, you could either have
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:53.320]   a well exposed diner and this big shadow of, you know, dark city is next to it, or you
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:58.080]   could sort of, you know, just try to balance for both of them and get a washed out diner
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.480]   and it's too shadow-riffic bridge.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:05.200]   What you can do if you want to really take a good picture is use this technique called
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.680]   high dynamic range photography.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:12.240]   All that means is that all that means is that you instead of just letting the auto
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:16.160]   exposure on your camera just make its best guess, you lock it down to a tripod and you
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:21.600]   take a series of three, four, five pictures under expose and over expose and two or three
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.600]   steps in between.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.960]   And then when you get it home, you use this wonderful piece of software that's built into
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.200]   Photoshop, but that's a $2000 program.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:33.320]   You can download for free and try for free this program called Photomatics.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.360]   And what it will do is you just hand it the stack of five pictures.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:40.240]   And when you take a look at the pictures themselves, you'll see, oh my God, that's like almost
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.240]   completely white.
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.240]   It's unusable.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.680]   Oh my God, this one's almost completely black.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:49.080]   All of them are wrong, but they will have parts of them that are exposed perfectly.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:53.520]   It's the purpose of this software Photomatics to figure out which bits of this are properly
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:58.800]   exposed to basically get the widest possible range of exposures and combine them into one
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.840]   picture that looks amazing.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:06.360]   Like you went in there with $50,000 worth of floodlights and 10 years worth of experience.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:10.160]   It's the difference between taking a picture that looks like a snapshot and taking a picture
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.520]   that looks like a belongs on a postcard.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.840]   You do have to fiddle with the controls a little bit to get a really realistic looking
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:16.840]   picture.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.720]   It's very, very easy to do something with really cartoonish colors.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.880]   A lot of people kind of like that.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:26.520]   If you go to flicker.com and do a search for HDR, you'll see lots of pictures that use
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.920]   this sort of technique, but it's wonderful.
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:34.640]   Now, almost any time that I'm out in the field and there's a really interesting landscape
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.880]   or really interesting building, even if it's not, you know, again, really bright light next
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.160]   to really, really dark light, I'm going to put the camera on a tripod and take a few different
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:47.040]   exposures because again, it costs me nothing there at the scene to take three pictures.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.760]   And then later on when I get home, I have the opportunity to maybe make something that's
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.160]   incredibly whole.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:56.280]   We should emphasize you would need a tripod for this because the images have to be exactly
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.280]   the same.
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:01.360]   Yeah, unfortunately, the problem is you can't have any motion because again, you're taking
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.680]   multiple exposures of the exact same scene.
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:07.960]   So if you have a, if a guy decides to walk down the sidewalk in front of the diner, it
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:12.040]   took me like eight minutes to take the series of five pictures because a car would go through
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:15.320]   and then a guy would start walking through and all that sort of stuff.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.120]   But the results are really, really worth it.
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:20.200]   The best way to really explain it is it's sort of like if you're at the Grand Canyon
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.360]   and you can't get the entire width all at once.
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.880]   So instead of taking one picture, you just take one picture, the ultimate, ultimate right
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.920]   side, then move it a little bit to the right, then move it a little bit to the left, move
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.880]   it, move it, move it, and then stitch it all together.
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:33.080]   This does the exact same thing only with exposure.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:37.360]   Well, I'm in Canyon to be in great place because it's dark in the bottom, but you've got a bright
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:41.840]   sky and this way you get the full dynamic range of all the detail in the dark and all
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:42.840]   the detail in the sky.
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:46.040]   Neither one has blown out or obscured.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.480]   And best of all, it's free to try.
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.840]   It's 99 bucks if you want to buy it.
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:53.560]   If you try it out, you can download it from hdrsoft.com.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:59.280]   The only gotcha is that when it exports the picture, it will like just little, put little
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.200]   photo stamps of photomatics on it.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.720]   So but it's perfectly good for seeing what you can do with it.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:04.720]   So the reason why.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.720]   So the reason why.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:10.640]   It works best with raw images because you're already getting the best quality image with
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:11.640]   no compression.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:16.160]   But even if you just have a dinky little pocket camera with that does nothing but jpegs,
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:20.440]   even the little $200 camera that I usually have in my pocket will let you adjust the
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.920]   exposure up and down however much you want.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:25.600]   And even on jpeg, it does a really wonderful job.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:30.200]   I bought a totally bottom of the line, like the cheapest DSLR that you can get from Canon,
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:31.280]   a Rebel.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.920]   And I didn't even realize it has this built in.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:37.760]   You probably know this, Andy and Leo, but this thing called the auto exposure bracketing.
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:42.600]   You can actually go in and I guess it's made for this purpose.
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.960]   If you go in and set the AEB, you can say, "Okay, get me a medium shot and something
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.920]   two stops left and two stops right."
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:52.160]   So it's really easy to automatically.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.160]   It's really easy.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:56.800]   If you're going to do that, it's nice that you can go in and if you've got a tripod and
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.760]   a little remote, it's super fast to do this.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:06.260]   And it's actually, you can actually make all three exposures in like half a second under
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:07.260]   best circumstances.
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:11.480]   So it's not like you have to be like Ansel Adams with a big field camera, you know, getting
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.960]   permits or stuff.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.880]   But again, on so many pictures, it's the difference between something that you'll put
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.880]   on your fridge and something you'll put on your wall.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:18.880]   Really neat.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:21.400]   Well, there's a, right on the front page of hdrsoft.com, there's a picture of the Eiffel
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.400]   Tower.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.480]   This is dramatic.
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:25.080]   And they show you exactly how they do it.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.360]   So do you do tweak it a little bit as you're using it?
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.360]   Yeah.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:34.440]   I found that over the past month of using it, it doesn't give you perfect results automatically.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:38.560]   Again, if you just trust it to do its job, you're probably going to get results that
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.640]   are a little bit odd.
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.920]   It looks great, but it doesn't look realistic.
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:47.000]   So figure on 15 minutes, 15 minutes of just playing with the sliders to get something that
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.280]   looks really, really good.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:53.120]   And even then, chances are you'll want to go into, when you import the results into aperture
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:58.840]   and it'll spit out a 32 bit or 16 bit image, like a really huge high quality image.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:03.520]   And then, for instance, the version of the bridge shot that I generated, I still thought
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:07.560]   the bridge was a, believe it or not, a little bit too light compared to the diner.
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.160]   I wanted the focus to be on the diner and not on the bridge.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:14.280]   So I just simply went into Photoshop and just darkened the bridge a little bit manually.
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:18.080]   But that would have been to do this without a tool like that, it would have taken me days
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.920]   and I would have needed to have a year with the Photoshop classes to be able to combine
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.880]   all these individual exposures into one really good looking image.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:30.840]   If you go to my Flickr feed, it's Flickr.com, if you look for Andy I on Flickr, you'll be
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.960]   able to see this Miss Worcester diner picture and I'm so happy with the way it came out.
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:37.080]   I think most people are going to have the same reaction that I did.
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:41.600]   You download the freebie and then when you see how good the results were, you say, I
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.560]   wanted some of the money so I can print out a really an un-avertized copy of this for
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.560]   my wall.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.120]   It's really wonderful.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:52.080]   I'm looking at your pictures here, but it's not right at the top, so I'll have to.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.080]   It's in the sidebar.
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.080]   There's a whole photo album.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.080]   I see.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.080]   I see.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.080]   No, I can't miss Worcester.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:58.080]   No, I can't miss Worcester.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.080]   I see.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.080]   What kind of camera to use?
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.080]   You're a great photographer.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.080]   Oh, thank you very much.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:10.040]   I owe so much of it to the Nikon D80, which was one of those horrible things as a technology
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:13.760]   columnist where they send you stuff to try, you know, you have to send it back in a month
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:18.000]   and they sent me the Nikon sent me the D80 a week before I was going to on one of the geek
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.920]   cruises to Belize and Central America and by the end of the week I'm like, you're not
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:23.920]   getting this back.
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:26.360]   I'm sending you a check instead of the camera.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:30.920]   It is so per is such the perfect camera for someone who wants to take really good pictures
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:36.000]   who has some ambition to be a better photographer, but who just isn't willing to spend $1,500
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.640]   for a pro camera.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:41.920]   I can't afford a rocket ship to Mars, but this is close enough for me.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.920]   You're right.
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.840]   It does give it because you're not used to this dynamic range.
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:50.200]   It does give it a surreal look because your eye doesn't see this dynamic range.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:52.720]   Well, actually, that's kind of the opposite.
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:56.360]   The eye has much wider dynamic range than any camera does.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.160]   So that's why, for instance, if you stand outside and you look at a building, it's not
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.760]   again, it's not just these extreme things of a brightly lit diner to the side of a bridge.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:08.400]   It's things like the shadows that are right underneath the roof line of something.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.720]   Your eye sees all kinds of shades of gray and detail in that shadow.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.840]   If you take a picture with your camera, it's probably going to just all match down into
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.400]   gray or black.
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.480]   So this is why it's almost hyper real.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:21.000]   It's almost identical to actually being there.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.520]   Yeah, it's wild.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.520]   Good pick.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.520]   I can't wait to try it.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.720]   Thanks to all of you for joining us at GreatShow.
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:30.320]   We remind you we've got a great book from PG Woodhouse.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.640]   It is available at audible.com absolutely free if you're not already a member.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:36.880]   I believe you have to be in the US, although I've heard from some that you don't.
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:41.280]   So try it and see audible.com/macbreak to know more.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:46.760]   The Mac-a-lope is now on cnet blogs.cnet.com/macalope.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:51.400]   That's where you can catch him and we don't have to change his voice next time because
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:55.880]   he'll be so famous.
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.880]   Did the cnet make any stipulations about an anonymity or anything?
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.880]   No, they didn't.
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.880]   You don't have to make personal appearances.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:04.960]   They didn't bet an eyelash at that.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.800]   No, the fact that you are half man, half antelope didn't bother.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.000]   Well, yeah, and that helped.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.920]   They might have afraid you might bite them.
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.800]   It would have said a DNA sample, but other than that.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:19.480]   Merlin Manz at themerlinshow.com and 43folders.com and a new Merlin show on the way.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.040]   Yeah, I've been following behind.
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:27.200]   I got another excellent episode with Jesse Thorn and I didn't get anything up today,
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:33.400]   but on 43 Folders I'm still doing a series on declutteringmylife@clutter.43folders.com.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:36.840]   Yes, you're the declutter.
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:40.080]   I gave away 100 gallons of clothing last week.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.080]   I just stuff them in gallon drums.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:48.800]   I just say if you do not have contractor bags, 42 gallon contractor bags in your life, you
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:53.200]   get them in your life because they'll save your life.
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.200]   So decluttering.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.760]   That was our pick last week.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:56.760]   It was.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.240]   Yeah, good book.
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.680]   And Annie and I goes at the Chicago Sun.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.520]   Times look for his book on the iPhone sometime.
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.440]   Well, how are you coming out in October?
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.000]   You come on my iPod book today though.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   I need the money.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   What's the name of that?
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000]   What?
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   Fully loaded.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   Oh, this is the fully loaded series.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   Yes.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   It is.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   It's not a series.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   It is not a series.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   This will be the second.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   That's great.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   That's awesome.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.400]   Get in on the ground floor of the fully loaded empire.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.400]   Thank you gentlemen.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.400]   We'll see.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:27.560]   By the way, Scott Born, the part of Scott Born was played by an inert object today,
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.080]   but he'll be back next week.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:31.080]   And I don't know what happened, Alex.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.080]   Let's see.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.080]   I never heard back from him.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.920]   So we'll get them both on next week.
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:35.920]   Another Mac break.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:36.420]   Done broke.
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:51.060]   Well, a lot of the things that we were originally designed for that are local newspapers got
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.060]   one.
[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:55.660]   And it's specifically designed so that when that person who writes it normally is out
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:57.660]   of town, they can put someone else in front of them.
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:58.660]   And Landers.
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:02.300]   I heard we're actually, we should say this for the show, but I heard we're actually
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.780]   on the fourth Scott Born.
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:04.780]   Yeah.
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:08.420]   Like he keeps exploding and flames every few years.
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:09.940]   They have to replace it.
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:10.940]   Yeah.
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:11.940]   It's like it's like Docker who it is.
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:12.940]   That's right.
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:13.940]   Regenerate.
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:15.420]   Pay no attention to the fact that he looks completely different.
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:17.980]   It sounds like that's why my voice is different.
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:19.500]   It regenerated.
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:24.060]   Having never seen it, but not even a single doctor who I really go left that one.
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.060]   Really?
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:28.140]   I thought you were like a hyper huge nerd, Leo.
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:29.140]   I guess not.
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:30.140]   I fooled you.
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:32.140]   That was the other that was the other Leo.
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:33.140]   You know what?
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:36.700]   This is another way you're going to hugely let people down.
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:41.340]   Well, I'm not going to ever let this really be released to the public.
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:43.100]   The public must never know.
[01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:44.100]   No one must know.
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.100]   No one must know.
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.100]   The hip squad is on the way to your house.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:54.100]   [Music]
