[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.000]   that's coming out of Cooper, Tina, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.680]   My good friend Alex Lindsey who held down the fort for me.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.800]   Actually, you both did, didn't you?
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.880]   While I was gone, thank you, Alex, from the Pixel Core.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.600]   Yeah, we took turns.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.040]   It was good.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.560]   It was very nice.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.480]   Also here, we're just the core group today, Andy Inaco.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.720]   From the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.960]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.160]   Hello, gentlemen.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.960]   Thanks to both of you for--
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.520]   Yeoman-- that's not--
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.080]   No, Yeoman implies that it was only pedestrian for a stellar job.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.160]   In my absence, in fact, I was getting tweets saying,
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.760]   don't come back.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.320]   Well, all I can say is that we just had a great time doing it
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.560]   and we're so glad that you're back.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.400]   No, no.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.880]   No, no.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.480]   There's at least a dozen people who are not.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.080]   Yeah, well, there's a dozen people who are not.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.800]   And if we continue to do it, there'd be 100 that--
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.640]   Somebody said--
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.000]   --would be like, when is Leo coming back?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.480]   Not that I'm taking this personally, but somebody said,
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.680]   thank you, Leo, for abandoning the show.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.000]   To people who actually love the Mac.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.320]   Tom Merritt, also, Philan?
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.040]   I know he's Philan on Twitter and a lot of other shows.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.240]   I don't know what happened while I was gone, by the way.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.520]   I was a stupor.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.920]   I think he was either Andy or I.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.960]   He was in a piece of "Sour's" stupor for three weeks.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.160]   I think everybody should do this.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.760]   We were like all like traipsing the globe because I was
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.720]   in Spain last week for Mobile World Congress when I was out.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.000]   Alex, you were out to be before that, weren't you?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.080]   Because you were someplace.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.360]   Yeah, we were all over the place.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.240]   We were a trial and crew.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.360]   I was in Patagonia.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.200]   I was wearing the sweater in half before,
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.960]   but I got too warm.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.920]   I put the hat back on.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.480]   This is from Montevideo, Uruguay.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.520]   I just want to have a--
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.440]   I want a house in Patagonia.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.520]   Just the name, Patagonia.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.640]   It's because the Dread Pirate Roberts has a house in Patagonia.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.720]   Well, Patagonia is a lot of room there.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.440]   I mean, there's everything from desert to rainforest
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.800]   and deen mountains.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.880]   I just want to say I've been retired for five years
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.280]   and have a house in Patagonia.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.800]   To beaches.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.640]   Need to have one.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.560]   For tax purposes.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.280]   Yes, exactly.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.200]   So I'm being informed now that Pisco Sours are not
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.760]   on my diet.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.360]   I don't care.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.480]   It was basically an induced coma for three weeks.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.560]   I really don't believe that hard alcohol has any carbohydrates
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.680]   for calories in it.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.560]   Some are worse than others.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.080]   But anyway, I did allow myself a glass of wine at meals.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.560]   Because you know, South American wine,
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.240]   I was drinking Argentinian Malbec, Chilean, Chilean,
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.680]   reds, really good wine.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.480]   I like Malbec.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.360]   Maloved Malbec.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.600]   But I mean, I was having a fantastic wine.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.920]   I met a lot of people among the people that I met.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.200]   Loique Le Mer, who of course, as you know,
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   is a guy at Seismix sent me an email saying,
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.000]   you have to meet my friend, Amartino.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.680]   Mariano Amartino is a blogger in Buenos Aires
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.280]   and an entrepreneur and a really great guy.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.000]   And so we went to lunch at La Dorita.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.560]   I had a kind of spontaneous meetup.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.120]   I just said, I'm at the cafe.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.280]   And people showed up.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.480]   And then I had lunch with Mariano
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.120]   and a bunch of Argentinian entrepreneurs.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.440]   It was a great conversation.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.040]   Of course, it's a little difficult to be an entrepreneur
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.640]   in Argentina.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.760]   But I said, you know, you have such a great opportunity
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.520]   to say compared to Europe, where there's
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.840]   multiple languages, at least in most of South America,
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.200]   Spanish has spoken.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.400]   So you have a fairly large market.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.360]   And they invited me to an Argentinian startup.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.360]   And we're going to take advantage of it today.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.320]   Maybe this is something we'll do on a regular basis.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.040]   It's a Twitter poll system called Pollowers.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.240]   Oops.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.720]   There it is.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.680]   Pollowers with a P-P-O-L-L-O-W-E-R-S.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.080]   I'm not so closed beta right now,
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.800]   but I'm pushing them to open it up.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.040]   Because what it allows you to do is post a poll question.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.840]   Now, last week, actually two weeks ago, when the daily came out,
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.960]   I posed the question, will you pay for the daily?
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.680]   Rupert Murdoch's iPad magazine, 67.5% of the votes.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.040]   And this was in an one hour period, by the way.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.480]   67% of the people said, no way.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.880]   6% said, yeah.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.480]   About 25% said, well, we'll see.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.040]   So I thought that was kind of interesting.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.200]   We're going to do a poll today.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.080]   And we'll do it for the next 24 hours.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.120]   They have kind of a statute of limitations.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.280]   Here's how it works.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.280]   I've just tweeted the poll question.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.360]   Will Steve Jobs ever come back to run Apple?
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.880]   Five minutes ago, and you got almost 400--
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.400]   It's a huge response already.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.840]   Reply one for yes to for none.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.840]   Let me explain how it works.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.800]   I'm going to work with them on this, because I think this is a mistake.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.680]   But right now, you just put atleo report, and then one or two.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.760]   Nothing else is allowed.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.560]   Otherwise, it goes to the invalid replies bucket.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.960]   There's a lot of invalid replies.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.400]   1.5 is not a valid reply.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.160]   Even saying one, but I hope two or two, but I hope one is not a--
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.480]   it's just one or two.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.840]   So we'll keep taking those votes.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.080]   But right now, I just posted it.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.600]   246 votes, 61% for--
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.600]   So does it count?
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.960]   Does it count the invalid ones?
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.960]   Here's my question.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.680]   So when it says 246, it's 246 people who did it right.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.520]   You only get it to put a number in there.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.520]   I'm going to suggest that what they do is change that,
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.240]   because one of the limits of that is that because Twitter doesn't
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.120]   allow duplicate tweets within a 24-hour period--
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.880]   If you didn't multiply--
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.440]   You could only do one poll a day.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.320]   So I'm just going to say, look, just take the first number--
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.080]   the first number you see, and then that's the vote.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.360]   And then ignore everything else that way people can comment.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.680]   And I think that would be a better way to do it.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.840]   But anyway, to give that a try, it's
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.120]   it's a poll-owers.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.280]   But actually, what you do is it's on my Twitter feed, Leola
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.920]   Port--
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.080]   Antleola Port.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.600]   One for Steve-- we'll come back to run Apple 2.4.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.320]   No, this is it, Steve.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.200]   This is Steve's last time.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.840]   Somebody posted a very interesting picture.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.720]   Let me see if I can scroll back of Steve leaving treatment.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.040]   Now, it's been three weeks.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.600]   I was with was on the cruise, by the way.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.000]   And I just didn't have the heart to ask was, how's your buddy,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.320]   Steve?
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.080]   I couldn't do it.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.320]   We can speculate like crazy on the show.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.760]   But when it comes down to real people who know, Steve,
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.440]   it's like I didn't want him true.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.160]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.760]   It's easy to do what's anonymous.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.800]   That's the decent response, I think.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.120]   I mean, if there are some people that
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.960]   are very, very comfortable discussing such a--
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.680]   Oh, he froze up.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.120]   So let me just say this.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.880]   Let's not then play that video of Steve leaving treatment.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.440]   Because that's nobody's business.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.240]   Yeah, let's leave it alone.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.880]   Let's just hope that Steve makes it work.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.280]   Absolutely.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.880]   No question about it.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.520]   That's a problem in publics.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.080]   And there he goes.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.200]   Push.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.160]   Andy's having a little trouble with Skype today.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.600]   Is there anything new?
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.160]   He has this super fast fires, but I don't really--
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.240]   Does he have fires?
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:00.920]   He has fires.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.720]   There's something going on.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.440]   It never works.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.440]   Anyway, I want to thank Neil Bowman and the Insight
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.600]   Cruises people, because we had a great time as Mac mania.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.840]   I've got to get on one of those.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.920]   You can get on one.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.440]   There's one coming up September.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.760]   You probably don't want to go on this one,
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.760]   because it starts in Victoria, British Columbia,
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.360]   goes through San Francisco and ends up in San Diego.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.000]   So you've kind of been there.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.120]   Been there, done that.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.320]   Andy loves him, I know.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:24.840]   Yep.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.320]   They're really perfect.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.920]   It's just a lot of fun to be with a bunch of Mac people.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.200]   It's not the whole boat, by the way.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.160]   There's 1,500, 2,000 people on the boat.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160]   We're only, in this case, we were about--
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.000]   I think there were 78 conference attendees,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.240]   and spouses and stuff went up to about 150.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.160]   But first of all, 50% of returnees, everybody comes back.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:47.840]   You do one of these.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.720]   You do it for life.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.760]   So you know everybody.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.120]   Everybody's got this great convivial feeling.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.880]   You all sit together, but you rotate around.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.600]   So it's just dinner.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.200]   I mean, so it's just really fun.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.360]   It really went from the sort of--
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.840]   I would never, ever, ever have wanted to go on a cruise
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.240]   until I went on my first Mac geek cruise.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.800]   And then I think it's the perfect situation,
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.760]   because you're there with a group of 100 people.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.560]   You're probably going to meet people that are very, very
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.120]   some patty-goes.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.760]   So it's not like it's you, your spouse,
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.360]   and then a table of 10 people you've never met don't care about.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.840]   And he's frozen again.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.920]   I don't know.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.560]   It must be Skype.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.000]   Skype is--
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.320]   Were you having this trouble?
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.360]   So we did twin this morning, and Skype was wonky.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.120]   Getting hooked up.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.680]   It's at 28 million, 28.5 million right now.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.080]   And I was having trouble.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.600]   I was having--
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.760]   I was going to switch as soon as we can to video.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.260]   Yeah.
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:43.360]   The part of the new studio build is video.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.160]   Are you getting the hardware appliances?
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.440]   We're going to put the server and the basement.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.800]   And you can use it too.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.920]   Yay.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.120]   Let me open this up again.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.040]   Let's see.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.200]   I'm thinking of actually building a physical studio in there,
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.880]   too.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.240]   You shouldn't?
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.840]   That little cubby hole that's in the back there.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.920]   I'm thinking of building it right in there.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.280]   Like a radio studio coming?
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.360]   No, no, like a little mini TV studio that's kind of fun
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.680]   and we can use our jib and steady-cam in.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.280]   Anyway, thank you, Neil and Teresa and the Macmania crew.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.880]   And if you are at all interested in these,
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.480]   I just want to give them a free plug,
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.280]   insightcruises.com.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.800]   Macmania 12 is this fall.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.400]   But then there's Macmania 13, which
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.760]   is going to be-- here's Andy.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.440]   I don't know what's going on with you, Andy.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.600]   I feel better.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.440]   All other internet apps are working fine.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.400]   It's Skype, as usual.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.760]   Yeah, as usual.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.160]   We're going to be--
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.000]   I'm using copper files really--
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.520]   No.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:33.800]   --gigabit here.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.000]   There's no excuse.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.680]   OK, so it's Skype.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.480]   No excuse.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.080]   Jug.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.680]   Not that you're bitter.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.440]   No, well, why should I be upset that something that's
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.960]   supposed to work has dropped three times now?
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.320]   Well, it is 3.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.000]   I was-- well, no, last night I was doing my food shopping
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.120]   and I was using the self-serve line that you have to use.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.440]   And once again, the most infuriating thing
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.320]   happened, where it just stops scanning.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.240]   I scan the last of a dozen different things.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.800]   And suddenly, the conveyor belt stopped, then rewounds
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.400]   at removing item from--
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.480]   [DOG BARKING]
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.200]   Please wait.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.440]   Our manager is coming.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.680]   You know, OK, look, there is no problem here.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.400]   You have not communicated a difficulty.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.320]   You've simply decided to stop processing.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.960]   And I have to stand here for 10 minutes
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.080]   to wait for somebody to recognize something's gone wrong.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.280]   And so what I did was I actually left probably
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.720]   on $50 for the frozen food--
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.120]   Yeah, I do that all the time.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.120]   No.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.120]   I--
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.320]   That's what I did.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.120]   Absolutely.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.120]   That's not like the dice and backing carbon.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.080]   I just think that things should work properly.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.800]   That's all.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.320]   OK, I'm done.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.760]   The Walgreens next to us doesn't have a single cashier.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.440]   It's all out of it.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.160]   And that's what's wrong with America.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.400]   You know, that's a jobless recovery there.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.360]   That's the jobless recovery right in front of your base.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.040]   When I was in China and they were building a fence,
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.800]   every single posthole had its own digger.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.400]   Three of them.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.360]   Three of them.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.360]   That's what's wrong with America, my friends.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.320]   You know, Tiananmen Square, they repaved it in three seconds.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.720]   1.8 billion people, each holding one brick,
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.440]   they just simply dropped it down.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.240]   Boom, resurface the entire thing.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.240]   I don't want to get political, but--
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.480]   man, here I am.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.080]   I am cruising through the Chilean fjords,
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.520]   the most beautiful glaciers and mountains.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.280]   And it's gorgeous.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.880]   I'm looking out out the window.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.840]   It's beautiful.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.560]   And I am glued to CNN watching this Egyptian revolution.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.520]   It was just amazing.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.480]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.600]   And our hearts and minds and prayers go out to our friends,
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.440]   not only in Egypt who have a very tough road to ho now
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.480]   on their way to democracy, but especially to our friends
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.080]   in Libya.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.600]   And I know we have listeners in Libya who are going through
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.280]   very tough times.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.040]   They shut down the internet.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.240]   They shut down cell phones.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.240]   It's just horrible what's going on there.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.280]   It is a testament to the media.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.120]   You know, and specifically--
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.080]   The power of Facebook.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.480]   Well, and the power of Balder's era.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.440]   I mean, the funny thing is, is that the--
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.320]   Well, that's true.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.560]   Because you really are there.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.760]   You've got to get the word out.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.760]   It's what's happening is a lot of people
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.760]   who have been tired of this are smelling blood.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.480]   You know, they're like, we could do this.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.720]   You know, and they're getting that because--
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.280]   Al Jazeera?
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:04.920]   Al Jazeera.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.480]   And so the station that we bombed in 1991,
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.360]   it turned out to be the number one factor of pushing democracy
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.000]   forward is because they keep on covering it
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.240]   and is making these governments crazy.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.600]   Our so are our prayers and best wishes
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.280]   to our friends in New Zealand who have had a terrible
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.480]   earthquake.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.920]   And people were asking about Lisa Tikal Pink,
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.000]   our friend from New Zealand.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.360]   She is in a different part of New Zealand.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:28.920]   She's fine.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.680]   She's in Wellington, right?
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.400]   All right, back to Apple News.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.840]   Boy, there's a lot to talk about.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.800]   You guys-- was it busy over the last three weeks?
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.640]   Well, I have some.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.040]   It's really-- boy, Apple's been just busy, busy, busy.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.560]   The latest rumor for Apple Insider
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.280]   is that Steve Jobs' birthday, which is Thursday the 24th,
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.200]   Apple will announce new MacBook Pros.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.760]   And of course, Intel today added the Sandy Bridge mobile parts
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.440]   to its price list, which would kind of indicate
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.520]   that's going to happen.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.280]   In fact, Lenovo has already announced a thin thinkpad
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.480]   based on the mobile Sandy Bridge parts.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.720]   Does that seem credible?
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.680]   Andy, you think that there'll be a MacBook Pro on Thursday?
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.520]   I think so.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.360]   Well, I don't know if necessarily Thursday or next week.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.920]   The thing that I've been sort of pondering
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:18.080]   is that some of the strongest supposition
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.280]   is that this is going to be one of the most significant updates
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.840]   we've had in a couple of years, where it very well might
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.120]   include at least two really big game-changing technologies.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:26.920]   Oh, really?
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.360]   Lightpeak?
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.400]   Lightpeak maybe.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.400]   Woo-hoo!
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:36.400]   Maybe hybrid boot drive so that essentially the OS will live,
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.520]   at least partly on DRAM.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.560]   And so the idea is that it will give you
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.000]   that sort of instant wake that you get on the iPad right now.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.960]   And if those are those--
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.120]   And MacBook Air.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.120]   Right.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.840]   And also on the MacBook Air.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:55.440]   Also, if these new versions of the Sandy Bridge processors
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.040]   can make the sort of changes that Intel is promising,
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.120]   that also has sort of a knock-on effect on now saying,
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.880]   well, what if we get rid of the graphics Pro processor now?
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.640]   What if we get rid of this co-processorship?
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.640]   And now opens up new possibilities
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.920]   for the lowest end in the MacBook line.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.360]   So that's why there have been so many rumors
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.400]   flying around this morning about iPad 2 announcements,
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.320]   about new MacBook announcements.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.600]   Some of them have hinted around at a special training day
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.480]   coming on Sunday, and a possible Apple event next week.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.000]   And unfortunately, that doesn't really betray anything
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.760]   yet, because if these changes to the MacBook
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.360]   are as big as some people are speculating--
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.240]   I tend to agree with a lot of that speculation--
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.880]   this would be the sort of thing that would merit
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.840]   its own special event and would require special training
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.160]   for retailers to make sure they understand exactly how
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.240]   to explain these new features.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.200]   It's really exciting.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.160]   Well, this piggyback's on the all things
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.240]   de-enouncement, Cara Swisher writing for all things
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.960]   D, saying, March 2nd, her sources tell her for an iPad 2
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.200]   announcement.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.560]   So you think it'll all happen on March 2nd, Andy?
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.360]   I really don't know.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.080]   This is the sort of thing where I have to have the--
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.920]   I think I have to have--
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.280]   He has to have Skype.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.600]   And I turned to Alex Lindsey for a comment.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.240]   Well, I think that I'm really interested
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.320]   to see if they incorporate the data pipe into the power,
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.600]   where we could end up with a computer with theoretically
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.640]   one connection.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.480]   What is the game?
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.480]   The comparison, right?
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.480]   I would say that anything could be--
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.480]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.400]   Please.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.080]   I'm excited.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.960]   So let's break down the three different technologies
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.360]   that Andy mentioned.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.000]   Starting with Sandy Bridge Mobile.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.080]   Sandy Bridge is a new Intel chip set--
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.880]   part rather, we saw, based on the core, the i5i7--
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.120]   I guess i32-- at CES.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.520]   This is a mobile version of it.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.720]   It incorporates the GPU, the graphics processing,
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.760]   into the CPU, supposedly has a pretty good graphics processing
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.800]   unit.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.840]   And because it's a mobile part, it's--
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.360]   Lower power.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.080]   It was 35 nanometers, I think.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.840]   So it'd be very low power.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.320]   So it'll be interesting to see if that moves through,
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.200]   of course, light part.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.760]   We've got to have something--
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.680]   some better connectivity into these computers.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.920]   I don't think I wouldn't be compelled to buy another one
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.040]   if I don't see some serious upgrades.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.320]   Well, I'm very happy that's--
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:07.480]   Just really, that's--
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.480]   I'd be happy.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.040]   You know what I mean?
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.960]   That's the problem I love to my MacBook Air,
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.880]   which is very recent.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.440]   I have an i7 15-inch MacBook Pro, which is about a year old.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.480]   I'm almost nervous to see what they're going to release,
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.600]   because if it is light peak--
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.080]   So let's talk about light peak.
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:26.960]   Light peak is 10 gigabits.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.880]   That's almost as fast as I need it.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.960]   10 gigabits.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:39.200]   This is an Intel Apple joint product, I think.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.040]   Intel has been pushing back the launch.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.400]   I don't think we've seen a light peak hardware--
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.600]   Nothing's been pushed yet.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.600]   Which would tell us that Apple may do it.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.120]   I mean, that's the kind of thing that Apple would want to get
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:50.680]   out in front of.
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.200]   They were going to be fiber optic
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.040]   Intel's David Perlmutter.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.200]   I'm reading from an article in the "Electronista."
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.560]   David Perlmutter says they're going to do it,
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.680]   but with copper, not fiber, because they couldn't--
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.000]   I guess they were having difficulty
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.360]   getting the fiber to work.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.720]   So this is twice as fast as USB 3.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.040]   Twice as fast.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.520]   I have to say, I really felt the pain of only having USB
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.080]   on the MacBook Air when I was traveling,
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.000]   not because I was going to store photos on the air,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.160]   but I want to be import.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.120]   And our biggest issue is really just interface devices.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.840]   There's a couple companies that have taken just
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.920]   incredible interface devices that are going to USB 3 only.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.080]   And I think they bet that Apple was going to do this a little bit
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.080]   faster than they did.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.080]   And now we're looking at them just like, oh, I could just
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:36.760]   plug these in.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.000]   Well, wouldn't this be typical Apple not to do USB 3 at all?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.560]   No, no, it would be.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:46.600]   What I think would make sense is the light peak type thing
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.600]   set up so that it'll interface with USB 3.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.120]   So you'd have a little connector on the other end.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.080]   Because it sounds like you're going
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.600]   to be able to pipe your everything,
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.920]   everything whether it's a monitor.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.240]   No more USB, no more fire wire.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.000]   It all goes to light.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.320]   Again, I think what you end up with
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.840]   is you end up with no connectors other than one port.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.400]   You have the power port, you pop it in,
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.000]   and it interconnects to everything else.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.600]   I mean, that would be oddly enough.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.480]   That'd be one of the big wins, I think,
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.680]   from Apple's perspective.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.600]   Not just having this really new unified high speed connector,
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.760]   but the fact that now we can design things that only
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.920]   have one connector on them.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.280]   And we have to call those holes in it
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.280]   or make it any thicker than it needs to be.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:26.160]   But if it would never be all in sort of proposition like that,
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.800]   it would be a new connector in addition
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.160]   to all the USB connection.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.160]   Initial.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.160]   Initial.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.040]   They would be smart enough to at least give us
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:34.720]   a transition period.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.280]   They don't think a dongle.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:36.880]   No, oh, God.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.560]   If they were a dongle that I had to carry everywhere I go,
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.600]   just a hookup, a printer or a scan or something like that,
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.600]   no, no, no, no.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.080]   But if you have air print--
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.000]   If you have--
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.240]   If you're able to print--
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.560]   if you're able to do a lot of the stuff networked,
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.160]   I don't connect.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.520]   I mean, I do connect a fair bit of stuff
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.640]   when I'm transferring files.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.720]   Alex, you've got to stop using yourself as an example
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.440]   for anything.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.080]   To be honest, in fact, all three of us
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.440]   probably shouldn't measure how things get done
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.880]   by how we do them.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.840]   Except me, because I'm normal.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.280]   Yeah, no.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.480]   This is me putting my iPhone on a tripod.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.080]   No, no, FaceTime.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.080]   In case we have to do the rest of this by FaceTime.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:18.840]   I'm prepared.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.720]   But I look at--
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.360]   I think my wife is closer to normal.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.680]   We got the back up.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.120]   Thank God.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.320]   See, thank God the microphone cut out like--
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.360]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.120]   I can see it.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.120]   I can see--
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.960]   There are squirrels out there right now whose face are like,
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.440]   oh, my word, such language.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.080]   I think actually, you just had to scare it.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.240]   You had to scare Skype with it.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.680]   So now that that phone's off, his connection's going to be great.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.080]   You just had the Skype ladies hiding underneath your desk
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:45.520]   right now.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.200]   She's terrified.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.160]   She doesn't want anything to do with Andy.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:49.880]   But I'm better now.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.520]   I'm over it.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.520]   I'm happy.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:56.040]   So and then I love this idea of having an SSD plus a bigger
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:56.880]   drive for storage.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.440]   That's what a hybrid drive essentially does.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.440]   It gives you a boot part that's flash
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.240]   and then a big spinning part that's for capacity.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.240]   Best of both worlds.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.160]   So now we're talking about a laptop
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.000]   because a Sandy Bridge that has fast graphics but maybe
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   a 10-hour battery life has light peaks.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.360]   So it's very thin.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.720]   3G?
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.960]   No, no, no.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.720]   Don't mess with thick.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.240]   No.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.720]   No, no.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.160]   I think Apple's learned its phone company lesson
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.560]   at this point, don't you?
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.400]   Oh, man.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.040]   I just find that that's like this really--
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.360]   my iPad.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.640]   Now, I know I know I'm not supposed to be the example.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.760]   10 second boot time.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.240]   10 second.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.240]   I just want to finish this thought.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.120]   10 second boot time.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.440]   I mean, this is the killer.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.800]   This is-- you're exactly right, Andy.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.960]   Otherwise, there's no pressure to upgrade
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.840]   because we've got fast.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.560]   I've got an I7.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.280]   There's lots of memory.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.280]   There's lots of hard--
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.320]   there's no pressure to upgrade.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.680]   Apple has to do something if they're
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.600]   going to get people to buy a new MacBook Pro that
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.800]   makes people go--
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.440]   people like you, Alex, and you, Andy, and me go--
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.240]   because we're the only ones left buying them.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.760]   I mean, because everyone's-- no, I was saying,
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.400]   because everyone's buying the airs.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.400]   I mean, the thing is, is that--
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.240]   everybody had the air on this cruise.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.440]   It was air or iPad.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.920]   There were very few '15s or '17s.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.160]   OK, but that's a disproportionate sample.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.240]   You're talking about people who are going to South America
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.240]   if we're cruised to Argentina.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:16.920]   OK, you're right.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.520]   Stand arctic up.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.680]   They're a little bit of an octobering--
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.120]   they're a little bit of a 17-inch MacBook that--
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.480]   By the way, it never made it to Antarctica.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.600]   The weather was bad.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.200]   What a surprise.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.320]   You know, if I'd really thought about it--
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.600]   so I asked the excursions director, Martin.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.960]   Said, Martin, how many times has this excursion made it to Antarctica?
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.960]   Any kind of fun for it around?
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.880]   He finally said none.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.400]   Zero.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.880]   So they put it on-- they put it on--
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.520]   $3,300.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.840]   And they think about it.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.200]   And you get to the-- OK, so I'm all dressed up in a snow suit.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.840]   I mean, I was prepared for freezing weather, right?
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.200]   Argentina's 80 degrees and muggy.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.920]   So I had basically a trunk full of garbage
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.360]   that would cover any possibility.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.800]   I've got ski pants on, biking boots.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.760]   I've got waterproof cortex all over me.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.760]   I've got silk long underwear if you forgive the image.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.680]   And I'm really-- I am loaded for bear.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.280]   We get to the auditorium.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.560]   There's 40 of us, including Woz, including many Mac maniacs,
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.960]   because these are the kind of people want to go to Antarctica.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.480]   We get there.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.120]   They say, we go to the airport.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.840]   They bring out an actor, because we never
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.360]   saw this guy again.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:30.280]   And the guy says, this is the best pilot in all of Chile.
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.640]   If these men says we can go, we can go.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.880]   But if he says we cannot, we cannot.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.320]   And the guy has a sheaf of papers this thick.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.640]   And he really looks the part.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.800]   I think he must be a highly paid actor.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.680]   And he looks-- and he's got the-- it's totally an act.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.760]   He's got the thing-- somebody in the crew had said,
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.920]   I saw the 8th stamp on this.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.880]   It was like 3 AM.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.240]   This guy knows what's going to-- he's
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.000]   looking at the papers.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.960]   I am sorry to report.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.240]   We will not be going to Antarctica today.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.440]   And I got a picture-- I put it on Twitter of Woz's
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.840]   and front everybody's like, we're very sad.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.720]   And we're a little hot.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:12.760]   So here's their-- and it says in the fine print,
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.600]   and if you can't get to Antarctica, which we've never done,
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.160]   we'll send you to Tori Stelpines, which
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.360]   is a beautiful national park.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.120]   And you can only get to by plane.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:21.920]   So we had the plane.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.480]   We were stuck with the plane because you can't cancel
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.000]   a plane at the last minute.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.840]   The pilots there.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.840]   His point just--
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:27.840]   Just pile a new--
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.320]   They've paid for the actor pilot.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.960]   They can't-- so the actor pilot now has said his lunch.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.520]   He leaves.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.600]   We never see him again.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.760]   Because he's not a pilot.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.880]   I am the best bush pilot in all of Chile.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.600]   So he leaves.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.520]   He's done his job.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.680]   It's probably the same papers every time.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.440]   And then we get on the plane.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.080]   They fly to Tori Stelpines and drive us around
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:51.480]   a bus for nine hours in our snow suits.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.920]   You know the only one who's comfortable-- you know
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.160]   who's comfortable?
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:54.760]   Was.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.840]   You know why?
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.560]   He's wearing a t-shirt and shorts to go to Antarctica.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.440]   I think, evidently, he had talked to somebody.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.800]   And they'd said, you know, they actually
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.080]   don't ever go to Antarctica.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:04.480]   No.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.080]   No, no, was says, I run hot.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.680]   He's like, fine.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.640]   And was says, no, that was great.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.480]   I loved it.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.200]   And Janet, his wife, is on the--
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.680]   we're all like-- and we're Janet and his bus.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.480]   And we can't move.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.440]   It's like, you know, Cartman in our snow suits anyway.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.320]   But not that I'm bitter.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.960]   So OK, so I'm bitter about Skye Blio's
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.200]   bitter about the Antarctica equidation.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.400]   Alex, what are you bitter about Alex?
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.000]   You know, I actually often show the shows here.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.960]   I am very bitter.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.000]   I'm a bitter man.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.520]   Today, I just can't think of anything
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.200]   that I'm particularly bitter about.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.120]   We'll find something.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.880]   I have an excursion to Antarctica.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.520]   You might enjoy in that case.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.040]   There we go.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:46.880]   We could fix that.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.160]   You know, I almost went because I was like,
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:48.840]   I'm really, really honest.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.440]   I should say, they gave us a refund
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.560]   because we didn't go to Antarctica.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.440]   So the plane ride in an iron bus trip only cost $1,000.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.720]   I wrote on the-- you know, they give you a comment for me.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.440]   I wrote on-- I would have paid $1,000 not to ride around
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.960]   in a bus in a snow suit for nine hours.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.240]   Thank you.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.960]   But I have good pictures.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.640]   Was, was, was in the shorts.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.080]   We get out.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:09.640]   It's beautiful.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:14.160]   And there's these towers that are the namesake of the National
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.000]   Park.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:15.960]   And we're standing there.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.840]   And it's beautiful.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:17.360]   I've got shots.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.120]   I'll post them.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.480]   And Waz whips out his $2 bill pad
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.000]   and is showing people he handed out business cards.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:23.600]   He's great.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.560]   He is such a sweet guy.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.520]   He cheered everybody up.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.120]   He really did.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:28.760]   He really sweet.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.360]   All right.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.600]   We're going to take a break.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.640]   When we come back, apparently, while I was gone for an
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.160]   announced an iPhone, I'm just curious how that went.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:38.880]   How did that go?
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.680]   I forgot.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.520]   I forgot you.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.920]   I've been gone for a long time.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.080]   I was stunned.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.240]   That almost fell overboard.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.240]   I went, what?
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.560]   We had the chisel-- we had the chisel Leo out of the ice.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.360]   And he suddenly realized that there was a lot of things
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.920]   that happened in the thousand years that he was--
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.800]   That's felt like 1,000 years.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.520]   Let me tell you, three weeks in a piece of Sauer coma.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.120]   It could be a million years.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.760]   You wake up and it's like, I'm a caveman.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.080]   I don't know.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.160]   Did anything happen while I was away?
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.120]   Before we continue, though, I do want to say hi to our
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:05.680]   good friends.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.280]   And I love these guys.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.760]   And I could tell you, if I could have gotten internet on
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.520]   the boat, I would have used GoToMeeting.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.840]   But internet on the boat is kind of slow.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.800]   Kind of slow.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.640]   24 cents a minute slow.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.440]   But this is a great solution for anywhere where you can get
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:24.880]   online.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.120]   It's called GoToMeeting.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.920]   They have a Mac as well as a PC version.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.480]   In fact, one of the great things about GoToMeeting is
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.080]   completely cross-platform.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.800]   So when you're holding a meeting-- and by the way, this is
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.760]   the way to have that next conference call--
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.640]   doesn't matter.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.760]   Mac or PC, you can launch a meeting with either.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.080]   You can attend a meeting with either.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.680]   Completely cross-platform.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.680]   I know Alex uses them.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.520]   It really takes a conference call and keeps people on track,
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.920]   keeps people focused, gives them something to look at.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.080]   It is so much better.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.680]   I mean, the thing is, we've talked about this over and over
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.480]   again when we talk about this.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.520]   But we're a global company.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.640]   We have typically 30 to 40 contractors spread all over
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.440]   the world, like really all over the world.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.960]   And the only way to get together and to talk about
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.200]   issues that we have or GoToMeeting.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.640]   I mean, that's just how it really works.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.960]   For sales presentations, product demos, training sessions,
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.320]   collaboration-- because all of you can work on the same
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.400]   document, weekly update calls, any kind of conference call.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.920]   Don't just keep people on the phone.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.160]   You know they're going to be checking their email.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.480]   I got a new game, by the way.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.320]   We rule basically died while I was gone.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.760]   Because I wasn't attending to it.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.720]   I came back and there's all these sad faces.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.320]   We're starving you.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.160]   So I said, I'll hell with you and I killed it.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.720]   And I started a new game.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.000]   Hey, I'm a harsh task master.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.960]   I would be a--
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.360]   You're an Old Testament sort of game.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.480]   I'm an Old Testament god.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.040]   You got it.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.080]   You got it.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.360]   Enough of this piece love taking care of each other.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:56.880]   Yay!
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.240]   I'm not going to kill your first son.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:58.880]   Where's my gold?
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.120]   Well, regret that you didn't.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.560]   What if God got back?
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.080]   Kind of God went on a vacation.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.680]   And he got back three weeks later.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.800]   And there's war and famine and pestilence.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.040]   And he said, I'll screw you.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.040]   I'm going to a different planet.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.400]   I thought that was the dark ages.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.400]   Maybe that was.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.320]   Was God's vacation.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.760]   God, I'm leaving for a while.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.320]   I mean, it would be a reverend here.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.160]   But that's kind of what happened.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.320]   I let my people down.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.280]   I figured I'm pushing out an OS update that wipes out
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.280]   all my saved states.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.520]   Wait, I had four children.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.200]   I had a house.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:26.800]   Aw, there!
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.440]   Feel my wrath and not go.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.200]   I don't even have a high school diploma anymore.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.400]   Oh, I got started all over.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.360]   Oh, this sucks.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.680]   There is no saved state in life.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.400]   Go to meaning.com/macbreak if you want to try this free
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.120]   for 30 days.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:44.320]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.880]   Our friends from Citrix put it together.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.240]   We'll see them at South by Southwest.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.280]   We're going on a lot of fun with them.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.160]   So this iPhone, Verizon iPhone.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.640]   First of all, I see Bob Levite's Dr. Max review
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.640]   in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:58.560]   He said, drops calls at the same rate as the AT&T version.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.880]   Is that what we're finding?
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.480]   I haven't found anything I have to admit.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.040]   I don't have one yet.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:03.880]   So I haven't done any--
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.560]   Andy, have you reviewed it?
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.000]   Yeah, I reviewed it last week.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.520]   And I think that we're going to have
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.240]   to wait a good solid two or three weeks
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.520]   before we get any sort of hard data on it,
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.160]   on the actual network performance.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.760]   And even then, it's really going to be irrelevant
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.000]   because it's only relevant to people who
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.640]   are using the phone in the exact same place as Bright tested
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.760]   or the other reviewer tested it.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.200]   The only things that I could tell for sure
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.600]   that I'm willing to stand by is that I went to about three
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.360]   different metro New England areas, all three places,
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.880]   the AT&T network was faster.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.200]   In terms of uploads, it was just incredibly faster.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.920]   There were fewer--
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.360]   I didn't find any dead zones between AT&T and Verizon.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.680]   I did find more places where Verizon signal was stronger
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.720]   than AT&T.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.080]   But honestly, just if I were looking at these two things
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.200]   as a consumer, it would really be a push.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.960]   It would still come down to, let me take these two phones
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:55.480]   to my house.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.000]   Let me take these two phones to my office,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.960]   whichever one gets better signal in those two specific places
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.400]   would be the one to go on.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.680]   We yet to see any really good evidence that the Verizon--
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.480]   the Verizon will be authoritatively a better phone
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.880]   to get than the AT&T one.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.200]   I hear we did live--
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.600]   sorry, I mean, it is on T&T.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.600]   It's OK.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.440]   It was suddenly with us--
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.920]   it was sort of like 10 minutes ago when you had the white shut
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.440]   off.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.720]   Sorry, I'm still getting used to the switcher.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.040]   It's been a long time.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:31.120]   I did notice that we did live coverage of the launch.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.240]   I hear there wasn't really--
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.480]   there were no lines.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.720]   Yeah, no, there was--
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.800]   there was nothing.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.800]   It was like, OK, and then we bought the phone.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.320]   Well, I think part of it is that they did this kind of tiered
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.960]   online purchase, which I--
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.160]   and then they said, OK, well, we sold those out.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.440]   And then we don't know how many they were.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.600]   There could have been 100.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.600]   But they did that on February 3rd,
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.480]   and then they did on February 10th.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.720]   It was kind of broken up.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.800]   And then I saw Marco--
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.600]   I think it was Marco Amant who wrote InstaPaper.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.040]   And he put an interesting blog post from Marco,
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.840]   because he said InstaPaper's sales are very consistent.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.840]   It's consistently in the top 10 of productivity apps on iOS,
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.680]   both iPad and iPhone.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.760]   And he said, we get some spikes.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.800]   We get spikes when a new product comes out.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.000]   We got a spike on Christmas day.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.520]   Our biggest spike was Christmas day.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.800]   Figures, a lot of new phones, a lot of activations,
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.040]   probably a lot of new iPads.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.520]   And then he showed the graph of Verizon iPhone release day.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.880]   Nothing.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.720]   Well, I don't think--
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.600]   Well, his thesis was.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.000]   And I thought-- I'd like to know what you guys think.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.120]   His thesis was-- it's not that they didn't sell a bunch.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.680]   It's that the people who bought them already had iPhones.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.800]   It wasn't new iPhone people.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.960]   It was people who already had the app, if they wanted the app.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:53.080]   And I think his point is kind of valid, which is that the people
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:57.160]   on Verizon who don't have iPhones are the kind of people who
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.800]   aren't going to-- or waiting till their two years are up.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.560]   They're not the kind of people go out and get phones.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.280]   There's a very small number of people who were not
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.600]   buying an iPhone because they couldn't go to AT&T.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:12.440]   It was mostly that if you really want an iPhone, they changed.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.840]   But mostly it's people who just were waiting every two years.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.800]   And so they're going to wait.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   Well, and I think that the issue is,
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.200]   and this has been a secret to Apple's-- part of the secret
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:24.760]   to Apple's success is that Mac users are crazy.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.400]   Like iPhone users and Mac users, where the idea--
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.520]   I was talking to somebody last night about the fact
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.560]   that I was going to-- when the new iPad comes out,
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.840]   I'm going to get it.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.400]   He was like, and what are you going to do with the iPad that
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.120]   looks brand new?
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.040]   And I was like, my wife will take that one.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.160]   And I'll get another one.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.200]   But that's a very common thing, I think, for iPhone users.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.440]   It's the type of person who jumped on the iPhone.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.120]   But I don't think-- I think the other issue is,
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.520]   I don't think it's that compelling.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.960]   I didn't feel any temptation to do it in--
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.880]   Well, this is not the time to buy.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.800]   Well, the presumption was--
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.960]   Oh, Andy's dropped again.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.720]   Let me call him back.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.040]   The presumption was that there was
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:04.040]   huge pen up demand from those Verizon folks who wanted an iPhone,
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.320]   but were unwilling to go to AT&T.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.520]   And I think we just didn't see that demand.
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.600]   But I realized, or maybe-- and this is what Marco also said--
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.360]   their geek friend said, wait, there's
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.760]   going to be an iPhone 5.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.440]   Just wait.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.120]   Well, that's my thought was, is that--
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.480]   why would I get one right now?
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.480]   I mean, if I have an iPhone 5--
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.720]   Well, anybody's paying attention,
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.680]   we'll realize that.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.520]   And those are the people who would jump right on.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.000]   The person whom you're trying to reach
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.880]   is currently unavailable.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.400]   Please leave a message after the beep.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.040]   I guess the Skype lady came out from under a desk.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.480]   She says, I will return him after I've tortured him.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:43.480]   So let me try FaceTime.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.680]   Josh Johnson is in the studio.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:49.120]   He's the-- yes, that Josh Johnson, the Instagram man.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.160]   Not even starting Instagram.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.280]   He's just made it his--
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.280]   his basically his personal training facility for photography.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.640]   He's a wedding photographer.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.320]   He's traveling around the country.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.920]   10 stops by a train.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.320]   I love that.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.680]   It's his whistle stop tour doing Instagram photo shoots,
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.120]   things like that, photo walks.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.520]   And he's-- so you've got a Verizon iPhone.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.600]   They can't hear you.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.160]   So I'm going to translate as you're talking.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:10.640]   Come on, you want to--
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.280]   No, that's all right.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.400]   But yeah, Josh, just stand over.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.160]   You just have to lean over Alex's shoulder.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.160]   That's good.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.560]   So tell me what your experience is.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.080]   So this is the Verizon iPhone you're holding.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.400]   I have both, the AT&T Verizon.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.400]   Now this is the best test of all.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.480]   And I wish that I was all the time on Verizon.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.360]   It's that much better.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.040]   It's that much better.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:33.360]   I would have Edge 1 bar real slow.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:39.640]   And then Verizon would have 3G 5 bars very often.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.560]   Interesting.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:46.680]   From Atlanta, New Orleans, Chicago, LA.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.480]   But as we've learned, bars aren't necessarily meaningful.
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.400]   Did you make calls?
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.840]   Were they-- did your drop calls?
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.840]   Did the calls work?
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.280]   That's the kind of thing we want to--
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.320]   Yeah, see, well, they're good.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.280]   Another-- like you're like Alex.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.840]   No, the internet connectivity, much quicker, much more
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.240]   reliable on the Verizon.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:09.560]   Even though I would have 3G, it would be slower.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.440]   Right.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.960]   All right, well, good.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:19.040]   There's a pretty good testimony to the value of the Verizon.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.240]   Well, and I think it may be very valuable.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:26.040]   I think that the issue is that a lot of us are in contracts.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.080]   The other people know that if we buy one now,
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.240]   most likely it'll be outdated in five months.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.280]   And then we also don't know if everyone bought in.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.800]   The fear is that Verizon will have the same problems
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.640]   that AT&T has.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.200]   So there's a whole lot of things that I
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.760]   think a lot of people are just kind of hanging out.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.120]   I think that the--
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.000]   it might be a lot of iPhone users bouncing over,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.280]   but I think that also there's probably not a lot of sales.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.000]   I mean, not in the kind of numbers
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.880]   that we've seen in the past with iPhone launches.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.440]   There's nothing new about this iPhone.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.160]   Can I tell you what a pain in the asset
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.560]   is to set up FaceTime?
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.800]   Have I mentioned that?
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.040]   I'm trying to get Andy back.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.440]   I'm going to take him at his word that he wanted to use FaceTime.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.560]   Let's see.
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:05.520]   Andy, I'm Leo at-- well, you know my email address.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.080]   Use that.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.480]   I wonder what Andy's address is.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:18.720]   Yeah, hey.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:22.560]   OK.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.640]   I don't know what to do.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.680]   He's no there.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.560]   Well, you know, we got the Skype lady.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.680]   She's got him.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.000]   Skype lady has got him right.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.640]   She's ducked to take him into his chair
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.880]   and is right now trying to feed him Pepsi.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.920]   Hey, there's Mr. Niles.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.880]   Did you want to FaceTime, my friend?
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.560]   If you want, I'm starting to lose faith in Skype at this point.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.000]   Let's see.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   It turns out I'm one version behind on the updates.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.800]   Maybe that's what I did do a complete restart.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.240]   I shut down the whole machine and I started--
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.840]   I think that's going to be good enough.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.640]   That's the chicken dancing with the voodoo thing
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.920]   that usually works pretty well.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.280]   But before I get out of this chair again,
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.200]   I'll install the update.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.480]   It's only one behind, but who knows?
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.440]   Happy, happy, happy, happy.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.680]   You're doing good.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.800]   You're holding up there.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.000]   You haven't thrown anything yet, at least as far as we know.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.520]   You haven't complimented me on my new tactical jumpsuit.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.320]   Oh, you got the jumpsuit?
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.320]   Exactly.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:23.120]   My new 511 internet tactical jumpsuits got pockets everywhere.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:23.520]   Stand up.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:23.960]   Let's see it.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.920]   Do a little turn on the runway.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.160]   I don't have enough--
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.240]   I have 260 for the phone with--
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.640]   I get too sexy for my jumpsuit, too sexy.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.200]   So we've got pockets here, got pockets here,
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.520]   got gunmeg pocket here, gunmeg pocket here.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.440]   Does it say FBI on the back or anything like that?
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:45.240]   No, because my operations are so covert and so hush-hush
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.280]   that they don't even want to know what three-letter agency
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.360]   I'm built with.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.800]   I got a question for you.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.640]   What kind of guns do you put in your gunpuck?
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.640]   I've got a baby Ruth in the left one
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.400]   and a payday in the right one.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.320]   Well, Alex, I'll tell you.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.480]   It depends on the contract.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.680]   It depends on the nature of the business.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.400]   Now, some-- I really want to have distance on one cover.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.000]   The other times, you really want to send a message
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.640]   with every single bullet you send.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.560]   And that's when I go for the old TL441 now.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.080]   It has-- the mag clip only holds six in the clip, one in the round.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.800]   Can I just say the last time we had a gun discussion?
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.160]   Because of that book about the M16--
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.520]   or note about the collision of cough that you did?
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.120]   We got-- we got an email from people who were like, well,
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:27.040]   as you-- as you might know, the collision of cough.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.840]   It was like the M16 was never intended for anyway.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.560]   Let's not go there.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.400]   I'd love your jumpsuit.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.320]   Thank you, very much.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:40.000]   It doesn't look anything like the kind of jumpsuits
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.360]   that little old men wear.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.040]   Exactly.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.240]   It's not the cruise wear that Mr. Costanza would have put up.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.240]   No.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.920]   Baby blue, it might.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.840]   But in black, it says to me, tax squad.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.240]   How much-- I might say, if I get like a twit patch,
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.440]   this would be like my fish-wet--
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:56.940]   It's good.
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:57.920]   --twit commando jumpsuit.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.520]   It's good, the official.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.840]   Like, keep it exactly.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.840]   You are--
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.320]   Twit Force Alpha.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.040]   Stand back.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:04.540]   When--
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:07.120]   --cuter-handy, leading the Twit commandos.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.640]   Send away $4 plus three box tops for your Twit commandos.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.560]   Secret Dakota rings.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.320]   I'll never understand why they discontinued the tactical jumpsuit.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.760]   That's what gets me.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.080]   I think this one store was just overstocked.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.040]   That's why they--
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.040]   It was just overstocked.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.840]   Or it's just like with apples.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.000]   Like, the fact that they're trying
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.280]   to get rid of all the old stock means there must be new--
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.760]   the 2011s are about to come out.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.280]   We've got your patch, by the way, right here.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.280]   You just--
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.280]   We'll send it right out.
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.720]   It's an iron-on, no sewing necessary.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.320]   Oh, well, I know people who can sew.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.360]   I'll put that right in the crest there.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.240]   US flag over here.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.560]   Babylon 5, crew and signal over here.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.360]   This piece is really going to come together.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.840]   How long before he's invited to Raffle Con?
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.840]   That's the question.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.600]   I was there in Raffle Con 1.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.040]   But I was not alerted to the presence of Raffle Con 2,
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.160]   however.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.720]   Yeah, there'll just be tactical jumpsuit man.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.400]   Let's take a break.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.440]   There's a lot more to talk about, including a very controversial
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:09.720]   move by Apple to co-opt 30% from all subscription payments.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.720]   This one ruffled a few feathers.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.680]   We'll talk about it in just a second before we do, though.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.320]   I'd like to mention my friends at Carbonite, the backup
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.800]   solution that's done just right if God's about to take your saved
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.440]   games away.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.800]   Carbonite will back him up.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.040]   Actually, I don't know if carbonite--
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:30.160]   it works for acts of God, but fire, flood, earthquake.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.080]   But if God actually reaches into your computer
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.640]   and takes away your saved data, I think you're probably
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:38.800]   out of luck, because he probably has means and ways.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.320]   Carbonite is a great backup solution.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:41.760]   Look at it.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.240]   We have a Kupo code.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:47.320]   Let me just-- that would be a typo in the lower third there.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:47.840]   Let's just add--
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.200]   I like to use a lot of Kupo codes myself.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.480]   I'd like to add an end to that Kupo code.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.600]   I think Kupo is actually a much better word.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.280]   It is.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.120]   Well, it makes me feel like I'm getting more than group ball.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.120]   Carbonite is a backup solution that
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:01.760]   uses the cloud.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.440]   It's automatic, which is, I think, really important backup--
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.400]   PC or Mac, by the way.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.760]   It backs up all the data on your internal drive
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.760]   for one flat rate.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.120]   So you don't have to worry if you've
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.520]   got a 500 gigabyte or a two terabyte drive.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.200]   It doesn't matter.
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.240]   It will back it all up.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.760]   Now, it does use your internet connection.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:22.360]   So you probably don't want to back up to terabytes' worth
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.120]   of data--
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.680]   Unless you're at Starbucks.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.920]   Use their bandwidth.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:31.080]   Use their bandwidth, given the caps that various people have.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:31.920]   But it's great.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:32.800]   I don't use it that way.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.480]   I back up my critical data, and that's what I back up.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.320]   And that's what I would recommend carbonite for.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:37.840]   It's safe.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.240]   Your files are encrypted using SSL,
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.880]   even if you're at a Starbucks, it's safe.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.520]   You could further encrypt it using triple desk or blowfish
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.160]   so that nobody can see the data except you.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.320]   It's easy to use for a novice or a full fledged geek,
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.880]   like somebody in this room.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.920]   It's automatic, so you don't have to remember to back up
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:57.640]   any solution.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:01.120]   I can tell you right now that you have to remember anything.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.200]   It's not going to work.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.960]   Because what if you're in a Pisco Sour Coma?
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.080]   Then what?
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.240]   And the best part is it really is kind of remote access
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.080]   for your files.
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.120]   Because the stuff's in the cloud.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.280]   You can access it anytime.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.560]   You don't have to wait for a disaster from any computer
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.480]   using-- you just log on to your carbonite account
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.000]   or on your iPhone or Blackberry.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.800]   They've got free apps.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.120]   So your data is going with you at all times.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.320]   Carbonite, it's like-- it's cloud.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.320]   It's backup, but it's also cloud access to your data.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.480]   Carbonite.com, try it free.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.200]   For two weeks, use the offer code Mac break.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.800]   If you decide to buy, use the offer code Mac break.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.680]   And you'll get two extra months, just $55 a year
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.960]   for unlimited backup for you for 14 months.
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:43.720]   Carbonite.com, use the offer code Mac break.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.360]   We love it, and I know you'll love it too.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.840]   I got a lot of questions about it.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.320]   Now that MOSI has decided that they can't do flat rate
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.240]   pricing, a lot of people are turning to carbonite,
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.600]   and I think a very, very good choice.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.240]   All right, so can you summarize what
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.880]   happened with this subscription thing, Alex Lindsey,
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.560]   Apple announced?
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.640]   So a lot of people have wanted a subscription.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.800]   So they've been talking about it.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.960]   This is an in-app subscription.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.000]   In-app subscription.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.080]   So right now, I get the New Yorker application,
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.240]   and I can buy an issue.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.480]   But what I'd like to do is tie it to my New Yorker's
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:18.120]   subscription, which you will be able to do.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.920]   So that's not an actual--
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.280]   It's four publishers.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.960]   This is a subscription, and so you will be able to--
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.480]   now, there have been subscriptions already.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.480]   I mean, we're getting-- we're not subscriptions,
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.040]   but services like the Kindle.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.400]   Like I can buy stuff on Amazon, and I can use it on my iPad.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.400]   I can subscribe to magazines.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.840]   I can do-- these are all--
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.800]   And Kindle does.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.920]   Yeah, and they charge 30% just like Apple's proposing, right?
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.760]   Well, I'm not sure what they're charging for.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.280]   Actually, Amazon may not do that.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.640]   I don't know what Amazon's going to do.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.000]   Well, but they're reselling that.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.280]   So the issue is what Apple started--
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.160]   Apple was very lax about this, and now they're
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.400]   tightening it all up with the subscription plan, which is--
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:58.880]   Apple's saying, here's the deal.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.880]   If you bring your own subscribers,
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.040]   you keep all the money.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.440]   So if they're buying it from Amazon.com,
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:11.520]   if they're buying it from New Yorker.com or New York Times.com,
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.240]   that money belongs to you, and they can still use the app.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.560]   But you have to provide the same access to that subscription
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:22.880]   inside of the app or the app store.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.400]   So if they-- and it has to be the same price or better.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.560]   So basically the same price.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.960]   That's the sticking point.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.040]   Well, it wouldn't work otherwise.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.120]   So the thing is is that--
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.280]   Why wouldn't it work?
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.840]   Well, if they were charging 30% more--
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.040]   What if it cost more in the Apple store than no one would do it?
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.560]   And that's the--
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.840]   I mean, the-- here's the app--
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:42.720]   I mean, I guess you're right.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.400]   Nobody would do it.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:43.920]   No one would do it.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:47.720]   And here's Apple's argument is you walk into Borders Bookstore.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.520]   Well, you used to walk into Borders Bookstore, right?
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.600]   But you walk into a bookstore--
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.200]   Sorry.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.800]   In case you missed it, they declared bankruptcy.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.080]   And you won't be able to do it for much longer.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.960]   But do it right now because it's cheap.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:01.120]   But if you go in there and you buy a magazine at Borders Bookstore,
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.320]   that the storefront that they built for you,
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.080]   they're going to take 20%, 30%, maybe 50% of that.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.040]   Usually 50%.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:12.160]   When you write a book, I know, as a book author,
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.760]   that the bookstore takes half, right, Annie?
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.800]   Takes half of the money.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:19.360]   So my royalty is based on the 50% that the publisher gets.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.600]   So Apple's saying, basically, we're providing that storefront.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:26.120]   We are providing this access to our customers,
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.000]   and we want our 30%.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:28.480]   OK.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:33.160]   And basically, like-- and so the issue is--
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.440]   I mean, the publishers are kind of-- some of the publishers
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.440]   are a little upset, but that's not really the big issue.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:37.960]   The big issue is--
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.440]   For the most part, the publishers like this.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:40.280]   They understand the model.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.280]   They've seen this model before.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.200]   And they're happy they could finally do this.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:43.680]   Exactly.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:46.200]   Now, there was one sticking point, which is that publishers
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.920]   weren't going to get subscriber information.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.800]   Has that been changed, or is that still the case?
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.720]   I don't believe they're going to get subscriber information.
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:55.520]   But that's also-- that would be Apple's argument for that
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:58.000]   is that when someone buys a book at the bookstore,
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.440]   you get that information now.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:00.800]   We don't have to give it to you.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.280]   OK.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.360]   So that's fair.
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.000]   So the issue is that the people that are really upset
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.240]   are people who provide subscription services.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.200]   So Last FM, people who are doing--
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.960]   what they call SAS, software as a service.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:19.560]   So what they're concerned about is that you're able to--
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:22.200]   that they are taking 30%.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.240]   Like, that's their 30% of the--
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.640]   I'll give you an example from the blog of a little program,
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:30.120]   great little program on the Mac called Tiny Grab.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:35.640]   And they're very concerned because they offer--
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.920]   it's like Dropbox.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.240]   They offer a screen capture and sharing service.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:44.040]   Dropbox would be affected as well because Dropbox whole model
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.160]   requires that you subscribe outside.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:48.040]   And then now you have software as a service, which
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.280]   is concluded on your iPad.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.960]   And they're all very concerned that this
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.560]   is going to knock them off the iPad.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.160]   Now, here's the question, though, is that--
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.800]   now, I think the big question--
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.960]   and what I think as someone who is--
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.200]   I have a membership service.
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.920]   And so I'm looking at this very carefully.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:02.840]   This would affect you.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.640]   Well, I don't know if it's going to affect us yet.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:10.080]   But it only affects us if we provide membership directly
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.800]   into the application, which is--
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:12.960]   I may not do because of this.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:19.040]   But the point is, is that is Apple going
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:23.720]   to bring you that many more customers that it makes sense
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.080]   for you to pay that 30%?
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:29.720]   Now, if you can't change the way that you're
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.800]   paying the people that you have to pay,
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.560]   and that 30% is your only margin,
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.320]   then you're in trouble.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.280]   But if you're able to tell them, well,
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:40.320]   we're going to take our 30% after Apple takes its 30%,
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:44.120]   then everyone gets a little less money, except for Apple.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:46.480]   Readability also was a little upset
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.120]   because they actually got blocked, right?
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:50.120]   Well, Sony got blocked.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.720]   So Sony got blocked.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:57.400]   And when readability got blocked, the information
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:05.360]   that they got from Apple was that they were violating
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.480]   this subscription deal.
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:12.040]   They were offering lower cost subscriptions outside of the app.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.080]   And it looks like Apple's going to be pretty--
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.800]   there are going to be sticklers about this.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.800]   They're really going to be--
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:21.520]   as far as they're concerned, we built this.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.920]   But it's the city.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:26.240]   I guess you could say readability is a publisher.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:29.960]   But so somebody wrote--
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:34.760]   a Mac rumors reader wrote Steve Jobs saying, well, Steve,
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:38.040]   clarification, please, is this going to prohibit
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:41.120]   SaaS companies from doing business on the App Store?
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:43.000]   Interesting that Steve responded.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.160]   We created this typically succinctly sent it from his iPhone.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.240]   Quote, according, if this is to be believed.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:51.240]   I always have to say this because who knows who these really
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.040]   go from?
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:56.720]   We created subscriptions for publishing apps, not SaaS apps.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:58.920]   Period.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:05.120]   So he says Tiny Grab, Dropbox, Pandora, Rhapsody, nothing to fear.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:08.600]   Yeah, but we're skipping over a really, really big thing here.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.920]   You have so many digital publishing services
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:14.640]   that do not have 30% of profit built into their business
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.480]   model already.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:18.120]   They cannot work under these conditions.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.000]   So essentially what Apple is saying--
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.240]   That's what Tiny Grab was saying.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.080]   So we can't do that.
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:22.680]   We can't afford it.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:23.120]   Well, no.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:29.000]   Also Amazon's saying it also wraps the streaming music
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.480]   services saying it.
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.360]   What they're basically saying is that the upshot of this
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:37.760]   is that either Amazon and Rhapsody and these other services
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.760]   can either have lose a huge amount of money on every single
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:44.760]   sale they do and comply with everything that Apple wants
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.920]   to do and serve their customers as well as they possibly can,
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:51.080]   or they have to remove an incredibly useful feature
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.880]   that every user will appreciate.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.400]   So what's going to happen is that we're
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.160]   going to see companies like Rhapsody just simply remove
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:00.280]   itself from the iPad and the iOS market.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.240]   And we're going to see, absolutely, the Kindle reader
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.360]   suddenly become that much more difficult to use
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.840]   because the only way that they can avoid paying $0.30
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:12.640]   out of every dollar to Apple for really very little good reason,
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:16.320]   as far as I can tell, is to just remove every single ability
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:19.400]   that takes the reader from the Kindle app
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.120]   to the Kindle store.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.760]   And so there's really going to be a terrible knock on effect.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.360]   And what a horrible, horrible time to be doing this
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.200]   because 2011 is going to be the year
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:32.440]   that we see the first truly credible Android-based tablets.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.640]   Not just Android, they're three different companies
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.320]   with three different operating systems
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.120]   making some very credible products.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.200]   They're not as good as the iPad.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.840]   But if all the, really, all the biggest gift
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.200]   that Apple could hand them, and I'm not sure
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.640]   if they've done it yet, but they could,
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:50.000]   the biggest gift that Apple could hand HP and blend,
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.920]   with their Blackberry and Google and Motorola,
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:56.280]   is to say, by the way, you will not be able to get books
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.360]   on our device, you will not be able to get third party
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:01.240]   newspapers or magazines because we offered such a horrible
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.760]   deal that Google said, hey, we can pretty much own
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:08.280]   subscription publishing on our devices by simply giving people
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.600]   a more reasonable deal than Apple's giving them.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:13.280]   This could be the first really bad decision Apple
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.480]   has made in 10 years.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.280]   Of course, the decision that they have to make right now,
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.360]   because they don't have a dominant position.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:21.920]   If you're looking from a antitrust position,
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.040]   having these credible iPads come out,
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.280]   having the Android platform doing well,
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:28.680]   that's the time if Apple's going to do something like this,
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.560]   this is the time that they have to make these rules,
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:31.680]   because they don't have a,
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.120]   as soon as they have a dominant position,
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:36.200]   as soon as they, if they are able to do that,
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:37.240]   they can't do it. - But this risk yield,
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:39.520]   knowledge that. - But the thing is,
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.200]   they're not dumb, they know how much profit
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.200]   Amazon is making on every single title.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:46.440]   How do they think, what do they think is going to happen?
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:48.840]   Do they think that the mobile will just make these rules
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.840]   and the money's going to start rolling in,
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.440]   catching, catching for Apple?
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:54.720]   Or do they think, or do they have an appreciation
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.640]   that we're really rolling the dice here?
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.280]   We're really, we're really, they're really backing
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:02.040]   these companies into a corner where they have to either say,
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.920]   it's not just a case of the money.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:07.440]   It's also a case of, even if Amazon
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.440]   and all these other companies decided that,
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.480]   well, you know what, it's still the dominant platform,
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.200]   it's still a platform with a great future.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.120]   We feel as though we can modify our apps
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.880]   and find a way to make money and still do business under iOS.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.720]   But isn't there going to be that one hand
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.520]   in the back of the conference room that says,
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.560]   well, we had a great system for the past year
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:28.200]   with the iPad and then Apple suddenly changed everything
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.800]   and ordered us to make all these changes
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:32.000]   that are really, really making our lives difficult
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.040]   and unprofitable, why should we continue to invest
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:37.520]   in Apple technology if we have no assurance
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:38.400]   that they're going to do,
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.120]   they're not going to do the exact same thing next year?
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:41.200]   We're going to stop them from saying,
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:44.240]   we want 50% or saying that we want a $20 spiff
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.480]   every single time a new user comes to your service
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.720]   through an iOS app.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.640]   - Well, wait a minute, I mean, if they do that,
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.760]   then you can jump ship.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.960]   I mean, that doesn't mean--
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.720]   - No, no, I'm saying that this is a year's worth of,
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.840]   there's so much lead time and so much investment
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:59.760]   that goes into all these products.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.400]   And right now, from Jump from Zero,
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.240]   you have the option of writing this app
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.040]   that will run on anything that you want.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:08.120]   And on the one hand, you have these companies
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.800]   that are saying that, excuse me,
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:11.560]   their track record over the past couple of years
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:13.520]   has been pretty much less a fair.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.080]   Whatever you want to publish, we will let you publish it.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.000]   And there might be terms under which we will let you access,
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.320]   added access to our users and added access
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.760]   to credit card transactions,
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.600]   but there'll be a discussion about that.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.840]   Either way, we don't have a reputation
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.400]   for beating up our developers.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.320]   Apple is steadily getting reputation
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:34.000]   for being the unpredictable loose cannon
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.960]   that if I'm going to invest $150,000
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.280]   in trying to develop this brand new business,
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.480]   they'll be profitable this year,
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.200]   but next year there might be a rule change
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.480]   that means that I'm suddenly pounding the payments,
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.320]   trying to find a work at KFC.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.360]   I think this is bad.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.840]   I think that number one is I think Apple
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.120]   will release a music service this year
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.000]   and it will wipe everything else out
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   from a music service perspective.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.360]   I think that's what Ping was the beginning of.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.360]   I think they couldn't get their agreements sorted out.
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:03.040]   And I don't think they care about music services
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.480]   because I think that this subscription service
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.360]   is the beginning of that process.
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:09.840]   I think that they, for the most, so that whole segment to them,
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.280]   I don't think means anything to Apple's
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.120]   from their perspective.
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.040]   I think that they know that publishers in general
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.120]   are going to be happy with their terms.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.320]   They're going to be, you know, not happy,
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.000]   but they'll, I mean, I don't think the new times
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:20.840]   is not going to publish.
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:21.680]   - I don't know.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:22.760]   I don't know major publishers that are happy.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.920]   - I'm not talking about book publishers.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:27.000]   I'm talking about, I'm talking about magazine publishers too.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.120]   - Well, I don't think many that are really happy with this.
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:30.040]   - I don't think they're going to be really happy,
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.280]   but they're not going to not publish on the iPad
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.120]   because of this.
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:34.320]   And I also think that they're going to,
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:36.480]   I think people on, androids are going to,
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:38.120]   they're going to find that the Android platform
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:38.960]   is hard to make money.
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.440]   Everybody's having trouble making money
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.600]   on the Android platform, except for the people selling the phones.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:46.480]   You know, so the, so the thing is, is that the,
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.760]   you know, I think that Apple is, you know,
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:50.080]   going down that path.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.680]   And I think that there, you know, it is,
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:55.000]   you know, as someone who does publishing,
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.280]   and I haven't done iPad publishing yet,
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.120]   but I gotta tell you, I'm really interested
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.480]   because the thing is, is if I,
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:01.760]   if these guys start all pulling out,
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.560]   it just provides this huge opportunity
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.560]   for lots of new publishers to go into the iPad.
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:06.960]   And that's what they should worry about.
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.000]   'Cause they open it up, and this is 90 million people
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.600]   with, they have their credit cards.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.520]   They have, you know, they're looking for content.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:14.960]   And I think that they're going to have a hard time.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:15.960]   If they go to the Android app,
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:18.960]   the risk that publishers have is that they're going to create a void
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:23.640]   in a very, very fertile ground that is going to give rise
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.960]   to a whole bunch of new publishers, which I think would be awesome.
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.440]   You know, that, that aren't trying to,
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:30.040]   they're not trying to support an old publishing system.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.040]   They are, they are simply building,
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.840]   like what Murdoch's doing, like what Branson's doing,
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.840]   where it's only built for the iPad.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:38.720]   It is not something that's new,
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:40.360]   and I think that that's, that's going to be, you know,
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:43.880]   I think Apple's more interested in that in general.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.720]   I think that, again, I think,
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.240]   if Apple's going to pick these fights,
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:49.480]   they have to do it now because they cannot do it later.
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.360]   They cannot, you know, and I, you know,
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:54.280]   I think it is, I think it's a big risk.
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.640]   I've been thinking about, obviously,
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:56.640]   I've been thinking about it a lot.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:57.480]   But I think that--
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.360]   - Well, you're, this you of all of us have--
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.440]   - I mean, I lose here.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:02.840]   We're a developer, we have subscription services,
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:04.560]   we have, you know, like we do all these things.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.960]   And so, and so as we, you know, as we look at it,
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:09.760]   you know, I, as a developer and as a publisher
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.280]   that does subscription services, I see, you know,
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.560]   I see it as an opportunity.
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:15.800]   The thing is, is when you look at,
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.480]   there are so many people who have developed,
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:18.920]   like small companies that have made
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:20.080]   an enormous amount of money,
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:22.280]   none of them are making money.
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:26.080]   But, you know, in the IOS environment.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.000]   - Well, that's what's compelling.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.960]   I mean, that's why Apple can get away with this stuff,
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:33.560]   is because if you can work within, this is the big if.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:36.840]   If you can work within the system, the opportunity is great.
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:39.080]   But there are going to be people like readability,
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:42.440]   like Tiny Grab, maybe like Instapaper,
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:45.480]   who are in the, you know, the cliff effect's gonna hit them.
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:47.200]   They can't quite make it in the system.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.640]   So we're losing, we're gonna lose them from the ecosystem.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:51.880]   - But I, and that's bad for us as users.
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.680]   - Well, and I think that, but I strongly believe
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:56.760]   that Apple is what I call a 90, 90 company.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:58.760]   It's 90, what 90% of the people want,
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:57:59.600]   90% of the time.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.160]   - It's 80, 20.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.000]   - That could be.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.840]   - It's that 10% that makes a big difference.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:06.840]   - But I think that it's, but I think that that is the,
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:09.160]   I think that Apple, that's what Apple concerns itself with.
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:11.600]   I think it concerns these things as fringe issues.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:13.360]   And it's going, what it's going to worry about
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:16.040]   is the core experience for everybody.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.280]   And I have to say that as a user,
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:22.280]   again, I know I'm not allowed to use me as an example.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:25.880]   But I will say that from my perspective,
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:28.360]   I have become, I just don't want to think about this stuff
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:29.200]   anymore.
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.400]   I don't want to go to every website and subscribe.
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.480]   I don't want to, you know, half the reason, you know,
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.320]   like I buy everything from Amazon and Apple
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:36.080]   because I, because they already have all my credit card
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.320]   information and I can click on it.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:39.840]   - Well, that's why, that's why Amazon.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:41.840]   And the, no, but I mean, and that's why Apple.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.800]   - But the thing is is that I don't want a point of access.
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:45.200]   - I don't want to deal with that anymore.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.280]   You know, like, you know, I go and find stuff on the web
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.600]   and then I go back to Amazon to make sure
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:49.800]   that they don't have it on prime.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.800]   You know, you know, and, or, or that I can order it on there
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:52.880]   because I don't want to deal with,
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.600]   I can just hit click, click, click one, one click
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:57.720]   and I'm done and I think that there's not, I'm not alone
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:58.560]   in that area.
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:01.440]   And so when it comes to the Mac App Store,
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:04.160]   when it comes to the iOS stuff, the problem is I think
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.440]   that most people are going to run into is this ease
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.120]   of use is heroin.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:09.880]   You know, you know, you know, you know, and that's,
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.880]   - No, but they're, no, heroin is access to content.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:16.320]   Now, iBooks is a much easier app to transact through
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:19.960]   than the Amazon Kindle store, but I have never,
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.480]   I have not bought a single book from the iBooks store
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.560]   since I stopped testing iBooks.
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.480]   Because the Kindle store has way, way more content.
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:30.720]   It's worth going through that extra 12 seconds
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:33.400]   worth of trouble to make sure that I get every single book
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.240]   that I ever want.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:36.600]   - I stopped even looking at the iBook store for that reason.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:39.240]   And that's bad for Apple, 'cause I don't even look there.
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:41.680]   - If Apple does anything to restrict the amount of content
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:43.960]   that's gonna be available on the iPad, game over,
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:46.000]   they lose it, not today, but a year from now,
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.080]   maybe two years from now.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:49.920]   - I think the question is also those, you know,
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.480]   the user that has the iPad, what are they betting on
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:54.120]   as far as their book usage?
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:56.160]   Because I know I bought a bunch of stuff on the Kindle,
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:58.920]   but I find myself not actually reading it that often.
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:01.000]   You know, and so the issue is,
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.080]   and then I stop not only buying paper books,
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.880]   but I've kind of just stopped buying books.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.720]   - You know, you know, and by audio on the iPad,
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.440]   you can read it on the iPhone.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.280]   I don't understand why. - No, I do.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.680]   I just find that I just don't do it.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.840]   I think on the new format, I just find myself not.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.000]   - You don't read iBooks either though.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.640]   - No, no, no, the only thing I put on my iBooks
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.480]   is you better?
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.480]   - I have to admit, the only thing I read constantly
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.280]   on my iBooks is PDFs that are manual.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.120]   - Well, you should recuse yourself.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:23.960]   - You should recuse yourself, right?
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:26.640]   - 'Cause you're not reading books on your devices.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.200]   - But what I'm saying is, is that I have lots of books
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.600]   and I read lots of books, or I have read lots of books.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.680]   The issue is, is that I find myself on that,
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.520]   on the device, not as interested in reading books.
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:40.080]   Just not, you know, and maybe that it's the iPad
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.960]   isn't as good a reader as the Kindle.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:42.800]   - The Kindle better, frankly.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.760]   - And so the thing is, is that as an experience,
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:48.440]   I just find myself losing interest in that,
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.320]   you know, in that process.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.520]   - So that's a totally different thing though.
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.240]   I mean, I think that where Apple,
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.600]   where Apple on the iPad will start to lose ground,
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:01.400]   is those moments when the typical airplane rose scenario
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.800]   where the person sitting next to you is reading Mad Magazine
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.160]   or they're reading People Magazine
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.280]   or they're reading some comic book that you like.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.680]   And you don't know anything about this
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.840]   and you ask them, oh, well, yeah,
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.440]   I've got this brand new Motorola Zoom tablet
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.440]   and it allows me to access pretty much everything you can get
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.920]   in Barnes and Noble Newsstand.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.240]   And I can get them via subscription.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.560]   Wow, can I get that on an, I hear Apple has a tablet.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.800]   If I get them to Apple too,
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.040]   no, I'm afraid that's all this stuff
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.640]   is only available on the Zoom.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.440]   Well, great, where can I get one of these Zoom tablets?
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.080]   That's the disconnection.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:30.920]   - Maybe.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.400]   I still think, I would argue that still in that 10%,
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:36.000]   not in the 90%, 90% of the people just.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:36.840]   - I think you're completely wrong.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:37.680]   - Okay.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.760]   - I, you know, we'll stay,
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:43.040]   'cause I just don't, I think the people who want all that.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.520]   My wife has that. - Let me say this.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:49.960]   That's the problem is that 90% are gonna love it.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.560]   And it's the same problem I have with the OS X app store.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.920]   It, by the way, I talked with a number of people
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.840]   on this cruise and people associated with Apple,
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.040]   I won't say their names.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.360]   And they kind of agreed with me that the apps,
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:04.360]   the stuff is appealing.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.320]   This stuff is like crack cocaine.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.440]   Developers love it, publishers love it, users love it.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.360]   But it's not good for the ecosystem
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.880]   because of this, you know, this 10 or I think 20%
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.440]   of people were left out in the corner.
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.520]   - Well, I have to, I, I.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.200]   - So loving it is not the problem.
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.560]   - Of course we love it.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:22.400]   - Right.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.680]   And I think that, and the issue is,
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.400]   is that what I'm saying is not whether we should love it
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.480]   or not love it, but I'm saying that the trajectory is,
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.120]   is that Apple will be very successful with it
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:31.960]   in the same way that--
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.800]   - There's no question about that.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.520]   That's why it's a problem.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.680]   - I'm not saying that this,
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.720]   I'm not saying there isn't any logic to what Apple's doing.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.280]   I think that it's, I think--
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.800]   - There's a ton of logic to it.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.600]   It's a good business. - I would, I would,
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.360]   I would think that inter, I don't know,
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.680]   I don't have any insight information
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.280]   on how this decision was made.
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.680]   I would guess that there is an exception,
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.520]   there is an appreciation
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.080]   that there is a certain amount of uncertainty
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.160]   and gamble in there.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.360]   But if they win, they run the table.
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.360]   They own probably-- - They run the table.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.560]   - And they get 30 cents out of every dollar.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.400]   - They're sure.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.720]   - But are they shooting the moon?
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.000]   - I think that they're gonna be successful with this
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.240]   for a year or two, but by the time that Android tablets
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.360]   creep up to the point where most people can't really
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.880]   tell the difference between an iOS tablet
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.600]   and an Android tablet, that's when they start to,
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.960]   that's when the roller coaster starts going like this,
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.000]   and two years later we wonder, wow, what happened to Apple?
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.400]   How did they screw up this tablet?
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.880]   It used to be the number one thing in the world
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.040]   and now there's like a 5% group of people
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:29.400]   and now there's a rumor that Apple's gonna start licensing
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.960]   iOS to run on Windows tablets.
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.720]   - I'm gonna, by the way, I'll go on record saying
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.200]   that will happen and it will happen at least
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.600]   in two years if not next year.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.560]   It will happen.
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.000]   And this is what Steve would say, you have a choice.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   You want porno?
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.600]   Get Android.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.680]   You have a choice.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.520]   - The choice is not to buy an Apple product.
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:51.520]   - To me, to me, okay, exactly, that is a choice,
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.400]   but I think that this is the point at which they really,
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.320]   instead of nudging towards a line,
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.760]   this is where I think they've nudged towards
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.440]   the bad side of the line, where there's the fact
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:05.560]   that you can't still have just a button inside the app
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:08.800]   that says go to our website and sign up for a subscription
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:11.000]   or go to our website and buy this, make this purchase.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.840]   The idea that I can't have my subscriber,
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.320]   I can't have a page on my site that simply says that
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.960]   I will sell you a, we are still a paper publisher,
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.520]   we will sell you a weekly subscription.
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.680]   Oh, and by the way, we will also give you access
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.480]   to all of our content, to the digital content
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.800]   that's available to us.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.320]   The fact that now there are limitations
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.160]   on how I can do that, that's weird.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:34.320]   That's mirror, it's a lot of discussion and a lot of--
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.760]   - It's just that when I think of my kids,
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.200]   my parents and my wife who are very normal
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.120]   when it comes to this stuff,
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.560]   I just don't think any of these issues
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.400]   are things that they care about.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.040]   - No, but that's why we have to care about that.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.520]   - I understand, but I'm saying that there is a,
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.800]   I mean, the issue is, is for Apple,
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.440]   is a lot of people have talked about the closed system
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:51.080]   being a danger to Apple, but I will argue that,
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.200]   they-- - 'Cause they're gonna get
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.920]   90% of the market, so who cares?
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.360]   - No, no, I'm saying that it is,
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:00.240]   they, Apple lost its lead in the 80s
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.360]   because Steve wasn't there,
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.920]   and because they tried to be like Windows
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.320]   when they started catching up
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.320]   and they tried to make lots of different versions.
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.440]   - Steve told me when he was at Pixar,
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:14.400]   and he still talked to me, that Apple lost a 10-year lead
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.920]   by not doing anything.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:16.760]   - Right.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.920]   - And that when Windows 3.0 is what he said,
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:22.240]   when 3 and it was 3.0 came out, that was it.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.240]   They'd lost their 10-year Mac lead.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.520]   - Right, and I think that, you know,
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.040]   they have been taking advantage of--
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.480]   - So you're saying they're playing cutthroat,
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.320]   they're playing-- - No, no, no, no,
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.040]   I'm saying that they have, they, for 10 years,
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.440]   they did not take advantage of the fact
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.280]   that they were a vertical.
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.120]   - So they're doing it now.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.000]   - They owned the hardware and the software.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.200]   Since Steve came back, they've been taking advantage of that,
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.800]   and they have had a growing quarter almost every year,
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.640]   almost every quarter, since they said,
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.360]   you know what, the one thing-- - We want the chain.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:48.800]   - The one thing that no one can do that we can do
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.760]   is that we develop the hardware and the software.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.600]   - All the way through.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.320]   - We can integrate that, and we're gonna make them play
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.400]   in our Briar Patch, we're not gonna play in their Briar Patch.
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:58.280]   - Until the Department of Justice gets ahold of it.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.640]   - But right, but they'll have to get a lot of lead,
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:03.280]   and the thing is is when more androids are being sold
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.360]   than iPhones, which is happening right now.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:06.200]   - They love it, they love that.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.720]   - This is the best thing that could happen now.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:08.560]   - You're absolutely right.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.280]   - You know, because the thing is is that
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.440]   it is a very, very difficult legal decision.
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.120]   - Microsoft said this for years.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:15.720]   - Oh, we're not a monopoly, there's Apple.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.560]   - Right.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:19.160]   - Microsoft kept Apple alive during the horrible
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.960]   spindler and amelio years, just so they could say,
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.640]   oh no, you have a choice.
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:26.920]   - And the thing is is that it would be as if
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.480]   Apple had 55% in Microsoft said.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.880]   - You know, because they're,
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.960]   because androids are selling Apple will never be a majority.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.120]   - They'll never be an monopoly decision.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.920]   - And yet there is in fact, I mean,
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:42.480]   I think that they loosen those restrictions.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.520]   I think the reason you saw Google Voice, for instance,
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:47.080]   on iOS was because they were on their investigation.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.080]   It's not that they're not,
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.960]   FTC's not looking at them.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.560]   - Well, and I think Apple's gonna pick fights
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:52.480]   where it wants to pick fights.
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.120]   If it feels like it can ease up,
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.000]   and I think we're gonna probably see some easy on this.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.520]   - Is this one of the things that President Obama talked
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.520]   about when he talked with Steve Jobs last week?
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.800]   - No, he said, can you give me some money?
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:04.880]   That's what he said.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:08.520]   I'd like a little cash, please.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.400]   All right, we're gonna take a break.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.080]   When we come back, our poll results,
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.400]   at least the first hour of our poll,
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.720]   and our picks of the week.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:18.160]   Oh, but one more thing, Andy.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:21.560]   Andy wants to know, where's my Apple wristwatch?
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.720]   Great article in Mac user,
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:27.440]   actually the Mac user column in Macworld.com.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.440]   That's confusing.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.760]   - Is there a magazine named Mac user?
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.280]   - It's a damn good trademark.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.200]   It's a good idea to skip that a lot,
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.120]   and keep that associated with the...
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.240]   They might eat Macworld.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.120]   - So I have to tell ya, Steve Wozniak, Janet Wozniak,
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:46.200]   and about a dozen other people are wearing iPod Nanos
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.360]   with rubber wristbands.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:51.160]   It was a very big fashion trend on Macmania.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:55.760]   - Yeah, it's like, I love that idea,
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.800]   and I saw that really awesome Kickstarter project.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.520]   It was really great, like metal one.
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:00.880]   - But Griffin's make one,
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.000]   making everybody's doing it now.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.520]   - I'll tell you something though,
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.640]   for I kid you not, for like two and a half years,
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:09.480]   I wore a series of wrist watches
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.040]   that could not be operated,
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.480]   would not tell you the time until you touched them.
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.560]   One was a Millennium Falcon.
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:15.880]   - And this is wonderful, by the way.
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:16.960]   - Yeah, there you go.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.720]   It was like the Millennium Falcon,
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.000]   and you had to tap this to get the top of the Millennium Falcon
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.720]   to pop open so you can see the dial.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:26.880]   There was a wrist PC that had like an Oreo cookie stack
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.200]   of lithium batteries to run on
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.640]   as you had to actually push a button.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.240]   And you know what, I went through too many airports,
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.760]   trying to have to do like rub my watch on my chin
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.240]   to find out if I would find out,
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.960]   if I'd be making my flight to ever, ever be interested
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.080]   in a watch that I have to touch
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.320]   in order to find out what time it is.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.840]   - Dr. Mom says her favorite is a company called
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:46.520]   wristjockey.com.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.440]   You can get any kind of watch band you want,
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:50.600]   including, look at these,
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:54.200]   you know, the expandable metal ones, the leather.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.920]   Everybody I saw was wearing rubber.
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:59.000]   I didn't see any lunatics,
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.600]   that was the one that was on the Kickstarter.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.960]   I don't know, I think that unfortunately,
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.800]   companies like Griffin jumped on the bandwagon
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.240]   before Lunatic could get out there.
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.400]   But you're kind of stuck with the clock
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.280]   that they gave you, right?
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.400]   I mean, you're not really,
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:12.320]   that's the only issue.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.880]   - You got to push the button.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:15.040]   - I'd be more touchy.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.920]   - But Andy, isn't it true nowadays
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.000]   that we all really mostly rely on exactly what you just said,
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.080]   which is a watch that we have to press a button,
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.320]   it's called our cell phone.
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:28.080]   - Well, the weird thing is like the weird thing is,
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.560]   like the market for these has not gone down
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.560]   with the development of PDAs and cell phones
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.520]   and all these other cool things.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:37.680]   There was a time when I was really, really frustrated
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:40.800]   that I could not, after finally decided
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.200]   that I wanted to have a normal wristwatch again,
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.200]   I had not bought digital watches in like three or four years
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.040]   and said, well, this is great.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.920]   I've been out of, I haven't even been looking at this
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:49.840]   for three or four years.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.840]   I bet now there's like a hologram model
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:54.360]   and it will actually like run like four different operating
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.880]   systems, it'll play 12 games.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:56.760]   And when I went back,
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.480]   the most exciting feature was that now,
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.200]   instead of storing 50 phone numbers,
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.920]   it stores a hundred phone numbers.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.440]   And that's when I switched back to,
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.520]   I'm just gonna get the simplest analog watch
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.840]   I can possibly get.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.280]   And so oddly enough,
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:11.000]   when I'm looking, whenever I'm at these trade shows,
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.760]   or even at like developer shows,
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:15.400]   what's the most geeky people on the planet,
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.880]   A, they almost all wear watches,
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.280]   B, they are almost never digital.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:22.120]   They are just, what time is it?
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.600]   Great, I'm done.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:26.240]   So I think that, yeah, I don't think that's a factor really.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.840]   Yeah, yeah, I do.
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:28.680]   I do, I do.
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:29.800]   The high face, you mean like,
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:31.200]   this one even has Roman numerals
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.160]   to make it even less intelligible.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.000]   So you just,
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.960]   so this one's the hybrid.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:38.200]   Oh God, you just,
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.720]   of course Alex would have a watch.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.560]   I don't know this one.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:41.920]   Digital and analog.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.000]   And they can be separate.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.800]   And you can change the times in.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.760]   And that's a nice watch, I like that one.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.440]   Oh, this one, this one is the Swiss Railway watch,
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.720]   which I bought specifically because it has like
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.480]   the clearest hands, the clearest dial.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.640]   That's a nice watch.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.560]   Don't it, mankind.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:57.840]   And it's actually based on the actual clocks
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.000]   that you get on the Swiss rail system.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.600]   So it's always correct.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.240]   And it's not terribly expensive either.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.800]   It's like a, like a hundred dollar watch.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.400]   It's not like really super fancy.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.240]   One taste, one taste.
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:08.080]   It's like the taste.
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:08.920]   That's watch I ever had.
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:09.760]   Chocolate.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.520]   Yum.
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.840]   All right, so.
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.360]   By the way, we completely bypassed the point of your article.
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.200]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.000]   The point of the piece was that
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   I really want Apple to like just be goofy again
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   and stop being, and not necessarily make something
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.640]   that is strategic, that integrates with everything else.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:31.240]   I want them to have a team that has their own
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.640]   special little office, that little pirate office.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.560]   And they've been tasked with only one goal.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.360]   Build us something cool that we can retail
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.200]   for no more than $49.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.680]   And whatever you want to make it do, that's fine.
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:44.200]   But making sure it's cool and $49.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.480]   And so the idea of even the most cool designed $49 wristwatch
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.800]   doesn't have to integrate with iTunes,
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.320]   doesn't have to play with your phone call.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.480]   It's coming in. Just the idea that we had this idea
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:57.200]   of this really, really cool manufacturing technology
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.560]   where you could build the entire thing out of glass.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.640]   The special titanium infused glass
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:07.200]   with magnetic beads inside like a square on the front of it.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.920]   That electrically moved from one side to the other
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.320]   to tell you what time it is.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.920]   $49 done.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.080]   You know what they need is instead of a genius bar,
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:19.200]   what Apple needs is a propeller head bar.
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:22.520]   Or some kind of or the geek bar that is just like
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.520]   these little products that are $49.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.000]   You can just go over and decide if you want to buy them or not.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.160]   It's like a little section saying, you know,
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.680]   we don't really condone this,
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.080]   but a lot of our engineers have had some fun with it.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.080]   And if we sell enough of them,
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.400]   maybe it'll move into the rest of the site.
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.760]   Like iPod socks.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.200]   (laughing)
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:40.160]   Actually, I think Apple should test its mighty marketing cloud
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.760]   by announcing and selling a product
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.400]   that does nothing at all, but looks great
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.560]   on your coffee table.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.520]   (laughing)
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.360]   Yeah, that's why the example I started,
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.120]   like the coolest in many ways,
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:53.720]   the ultimate Apple product was the Apple Design Award,
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:56.640]   because all it is, it's a box with the Apple logo
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:57.640]   on it that glows white.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.160]   It has no function to promote the Apple logo.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.160]   - Remember, I thought that was the cube.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.640]   The cube was the cube.
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.480]   I had one of those.
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.200]   - I had one too.
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.440]   - Somebody, some years ago sold a,
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.440]   it was a white glowing globe,
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.120]   and he would tie it into RSS feeds.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.320]   And if this, you could say weather or stock market
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:16.160]   or whatever.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.120]   And if the stock market was down,
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.400]   it would be red.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.240]   If it was up, it would be green.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.120]   That's all it did.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.640]   It was just a glowing globe.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:23.240]   - That's an Arduino project.
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.800]   You can put it together pretty cheaply yourself.
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.280]   You just, a $20 Arduino board,
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.080]   like a really short bit of code,
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.120]   has a Wi-Fi stamp built into it.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.480]   Then you just put a white ping pong ball
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.120]   over a tricolor LED.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:34.960]   (laughing)
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:37.320]   It's like, it's basically,
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.760]   if you wanna show people how cool an Arduino board is,
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:42.800]   it's like, it's the glowing ping pong ball
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.120]   of my Twitter destiny.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.920]   - Actually, somebody in the chat room knows
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.320]   this name and this company was ambient.
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.680]   It was ambient design.
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.720]   Ambient devices, I guess it was.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:54.560]   Here it is.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:55.400]   Here it is.
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.480]   Wow, they're still around.
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.120]   Oh, now they have like, you know,
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.440]   they've added information.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.800]   But I liked it better when it was just a glowing globe.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:02.800]   (laughing)
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.800]   That was so much better.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.800]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:06.640]   When we come back to your picks of the week,
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.680]   and our followers poll, the results are in.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:14.160]   But first, it's time to tell you about squarespace.com.
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:17.280]   That's the place to make your next website.
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.880]   No, I did a talk about new media on the cruise.
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.880]   That was one of my picked subjects.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:24.400]   And of course it was good timing we talked about.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.480]   Remember Malcolm Gladwell's article in New Yorker?
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:27.400]   Two months ago where he said,
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.600]   "Oh, Twitter would never start a revolution
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.640]   because it's just about preserving the status.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.360]   Why was he wrong?"
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.720]   Time about getting proven wrong like that.
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:39.360]   So it was a very, with the Egyptian revolution going on,
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:40.760]   it was a very timely time to talk about
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.480]   the power of new media and so forth.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:47.360]   But I said, and I think this, I would say this to everybody,
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.920]   the most important thing you do on the web
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:52.440]   should be your website.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.400]   It's fine to have a Facebook.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.440]   You should have a Facebook page.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:55.400]   You should have a Twitter presence.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:56.680]   You should do all of that.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:57.740]   You don't have to have a blog,
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:59.560]   but you should have a website.
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:01.600]   Somewhere that's yours, you control,
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.040]   that people can go to and find out more about you.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:07.000]   It is the single most important thing you can do on the web,
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.600]   and that's where squarespace just excels.
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:12.800]   You can go there right now for free and create a website.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.160]   Just go to squarespace.com/macbreak
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.000]   and see that green button.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.160]   You don't need a credit card or anything.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:22.160]   Just fill out four little fields there, the site name.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.560]   - Leo's new site, password.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:27.040]   - Sexy.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:30.640]   Email address, Leo@Sexy.com.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.600]   - And it's a little capture to keep robots
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.560]   from creating random sites.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.360]   Now you got a site for two months, two weeks,
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.760]   whether you've done this, Alex.
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:38.880]   I could tell this story all the time,
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.440]   but you didn't even know it for the restaurant
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:41.360]   but they never have a website.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:44.600]   - Yeah, well, before dinner was over, they had a site.
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.000]   - Well, and all of our sites right now are on,
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.960]   so DV Garage, Pixelcore, and Bortisac are all Squarespace sites.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.120]   - So you like it, I would guess.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:52.960]   - We do like it.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.680]   And they range from being really simple.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:59.680]   My own blog is just, there's no custom code in it at all.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:02.240]   To DV Garage, it's got e-commerce and Pixelcore.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.160]   It's got all kinds of special stuff.
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:04.280]   Yeah, so all that stuff is,
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.880]   we injected all that code into it.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.520]   - Well, it fully supports JavaScript.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.080]   It fully supports CSS.
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.400]   So you can do a lot more, but you don't have to.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.640]   You're not required.
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:17.720]   - No, what was great was I'd be on Skype with Carolyn,
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:19.880]   who was working on the site with me.
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.440]   And the two of us would just sit there and make adjustments.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.640]   Like she'd make an adjustment hit save,
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:23.680]   and then I hit an adjustment and save,
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.680]   and we don't like this.
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:25.680]   And so we're just playing with it.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:26.800]   We're not typing code.
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:27.640]   You know, it's all WYSIWYG,
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.440]   we're kind of moving things around.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:30.720]   And then we got to where we liked it.
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:32.440]   And then there's like, oh, we need to add a couple extra things.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.520]   So we hired somebody to write the code for that
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.280]   and make it work.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:38.160]   - squarespace.com/macbreak.
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.240]   Try it free for two weeks.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:41.560]   If you decide to buy, use the coupon code Macbreak.
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.760]   You'll save 10%.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:46.800]   Oh, I'm sorry, you won't know.
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.240]   You should have jumped when you had a chance.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.160]   - No. - It doesn't matter.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.760]   It's $12 a month. - Yeah.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:52.800]   - So it's, I mean.
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.880]   And look at you're getting hosting and software,
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.600]   and that's kind of key to all of this.
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.720]   This isn't just--
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.240]   - One thing is, this is not just hosting on a,
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.560]   like one server hosting.
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.600]   It's like, this is a cloud host.
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.400]   So no matter how hard you get hit,
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.240]   it doesn't just look around.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:11.240]   It's a pretty sophisticated Java virtual hosting system
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:14.240]   that just turns on bandwidth as needed.
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.200]   - Right.
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.200]   - Try it free squarespace.com.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.560]   You gotta have a website.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.440]   You know, it's fine to have that Facebook page
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.160]   and all that other stuff.
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.360]   Google profile, but I told everybody in the class,
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:27.080]   I said, look, Facebook could take it down,
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.680]   Flickr could take you down, Twitter could, you know,
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.360]   you gotta have something you own
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.480]   that you can send people to,
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.400]   and ultimately that means your own website.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.400]   For a blog or anything else, photographers too,
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.640]   squarespace.com/macbreak.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.320]   Give it a try today, we love them.
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.440]   - All right, let's see.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:48.480]   Who wants to start here, a show of hands, Alex, Andy?
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:51.800]   - Wait a minute, Alex is pulling out something hard,
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.560]   and oh, I have one of these.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.400]   - I like it.
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:56.240]   - You like it?
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.080]   - I like it.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.080]   - It's an iPad case.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.720]   - Yes, it's an iPad case.
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:00.560]   This is boy.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.400]   - This is my modular.
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.960]   - Nobody's ever brought us one of those before.
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.800]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:08.240]   This is modular, and they gave me one to play around
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.240]   with a little bit, and so I've been using it
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.280]   for the last couple of weeks, and I really like it.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.000]   So here's how this works.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.520]   Do you wanna have--
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.800]   - Oh, I could show it on my special close-up cam.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.120]   - Probably, you can just watch it here or here.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.120]   - Yeah, you hold it up there.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.200]   'Cause it's, yeah, yeah.
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.480]   - So, and I'll describe it for our radio audience.
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:25.720]   - First of all, it's a nice hard case,
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.400]   and so you feel like you can, you know,
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.240]   it's pretty protective, you can pull the front off.
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.680]   - See, I couldn't figure out how to snap
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:33.920]   the front off, I could fall, falling off.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.280]   So I guess I was doing it wrong.
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.320]   So it does, it just popped.
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.240]   - Now it's completely encased in hard plastic.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.360]   - Yeah, it's completely protected.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.680]   - It's protected, and so then--
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:43.080]   - I wish I were easier to carry, though.
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:44.440]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:45.960]   So here's the thing, you got these,
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.840]   you got your little hooks in the back,
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:48.680]   and I forgot to bring--
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:49.840]   - For nubbies, I brought this,
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:51.120]   and I forgot to bring anything that goes with it,
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.760]   but what you can do is I, when I'm in the kitchen,
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:56.160]   I have this little L, yeah, there's a,
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:58.400]   so this is one of the, so the reason it's called modular,
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.440]   of course, is because you can do lots of different things.
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:01.920]   It's modular, so you can pop this on.
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.760]   - Or you can buy the whole thing as a kit.
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.280]   - Right, you'll get a little kit with it.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.840]   So here's the, so here you can see
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:08.680]   that now what I've done is--
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:10.320]   - That's the strap, now he's got a shoulder strap.
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.320]   - Now you've got a shoulder strap,
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:15.040]   but then you can have, I have,
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.680]   they have a little, like a little L,
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:19.040]   that just pops into here.
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.240]   So I was making crepes on Sunday morning for the kids.
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:23.080]   - You can make crepes with it?
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.600]   - No, you can't make crepes with the thing,
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.000]   but I had-- - That's amazing!
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.320]   - But I had to have Epicurious up,
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.640]   so I could remember what the recipe was.
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.120]   And so I had it just sitting,
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.640]   and it was nice because it was just sitting
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.560]   at just the right angle, but I just popped that in.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.800]   I popped the strap off, popped that in.
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:41.800]   Then we, my wife actually let me put one on the fridge.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.080]   So you can put the magnets on the fridge,
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:44.560]   and then you can hang it on the fridge.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.160]   - So it comes with magnets for the fridge?
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.360]   - You can get ones that have magnets for the fridge,
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.320]   and then I'm putting one into one of the walls,
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.920]   so that I can set my iPad on the wall,
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.440]   and lock it in, but the point is,
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.560]   is that you're not getting whole cases for everything.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.320]   What you're doing is simply getting the little things
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.800]   that you just slide this in, slide it in,
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:03.800]   so it's one modular case that works for
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:07.160]   lots of different uses, rather than lots of different cases
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.560]   that are doing it, so I think it's a--
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:10.880]   - I like it, I like it.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.880]   - I bookery in our chatroom has a question.
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:14.520]   Is it microwave safe?
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:15.640]   - Is it microwave safe?
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:18.560]   You know, without the iPad, I think it's microwave safe.
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:21.640]   - Do not microwave it.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:24.240]   - I do not think I would put it in the microwave.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:26.200]   - We were joking.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.480]   - How much is it?
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:30.600]   - I think it is $39.99 for the base.
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.440]   - And then you get more stuff.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:32.280]   - And then you can get little things.
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.360]   But they're all like 20 bucks and--
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.680]   - 10 bucks and five bucks.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:38.040]   You know, it depends on how much you're getting,
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.880]   but it's a great little case and it really feels protected.
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:42.080]   - And the website again?
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:47.080]   - Modular, it is M-O-D-U-L-R, I believe that's the name.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.400]   - On the same order.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.200]   - No way.com, right?
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:52.360]   Let's try it, let me see.
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.360]   I'm gonna enter it into the magic.
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:55.200]   - Watch.
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:56.040]   - Nope.
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:57.640]   - The NVNU-DAL-Majula.
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:58.480]   - Hold on.
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.920]   - Let me just Google it.
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:00.760]   - I ruined everything.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:01.580]   - I will Google it.
[01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:03.280]   No, you've just ruined the show.
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:04.120]   - I've ruined everything.
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:04.960]   - Every day.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.440]   - Some singular case.com.
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:07.280]   - Yeah, modular.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.440]   - You spelled it right.
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:09.280]   - It is.
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.320]   - Case.com, there it is.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.760]   - Yeah, we talked about this on iPad today.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.400]   I think it's actually pretty cool.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:14.800]   - Yeah.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:17.760]   - And I not go, you were holding up earlier.
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.120]   You're pick of the week.
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:20.440]   - I was just adjusting the lighting
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:23.440]   so I could show you this wonderful new iPad app.
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:26.080]   Now there are those of you who care much less
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:29.080]   about the Super Bowl, the NBA All-Star game
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:29.920]   or anything else.
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:32.320]   As we do about this most wonderful time of year,
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.840]   yes, it's Oscar's season.
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.840]   I was bummed because for a good three days
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:38.600]   I thought that I was going to be in Barcelona
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:40.000]   on Oscar night because to me,
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   this is my Super Bowl night.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.160]   This is the, I'm gonna have a full pool of popcorn.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.480]   I'm gonna have three screens so I can,
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:46.960]   I can chat with all my friends.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:47.880]   I'm gonna have a little party
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.640]   and I can work with my Oscar pics.
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:51.360]   - Yes, I am.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.960]   Yes, I am, that's their person.
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.800]   And the Academy of Ocean Picture Arts and Sciences
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:58.560]   is released at Oscar app for the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:59.920]   Now I guess now your,
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.520]   Alex's pic would do really, really well
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.720]   because what I really wanna do is like have the iPad
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:08.240]   magnetized to my fridge so that I always have the countdown
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:11.880]   to the Oscar cast countdown clock at all times.
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:13.960]   But what, pretty much what it is before,
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:14.960]   it's only the way that I send it.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:17.600]   - This app is gonna be completely useless in five days,
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.800]   three hours, three minutes and 54 seconds.
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.560]   I just wanna point that out.
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.160]   - It's all, okay, so the guy,
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.640]   the guy who spent a thousand bucks
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:27.480]   to sweat to death on a bus is complaining about a 90,
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.840]   90 set app you can only use for a week.
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.520]   Okay, that's fine.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.040]   - Actually, who knows, it might turn over again
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:36.200]   and say the next Oscar telecast isn't 365 days.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.520]   - Exactly.
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.560]   But it's not, obviously it's not just a countdown clock.
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.400]   What it is is it really is a front end
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.680]   to all kinds of video.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:44.040]   The week before the telecast,
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:46.400]   it will load up all kinds of different videos
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.680]   and they keep adding to them on a day to day basis.
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:50.640]   On Oscar night, I haven't,
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.040]   obviously haven't had the chance to try this out,
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:54.480]   but they promise that there are going to be a whole bunch
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.440]   of additional cameras that are set up
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.680]   all throughout the complex.
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.680]   So that if you're watching the Oscar cast,
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:00.960]   you wanna find out, okay,
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.880]   is who's smoking outside the theater?
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.080]   You can actually bring up a map
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.720]   and tap on the camera that's set up,
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:08.080]   just outside the theater,
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.080]   or you can set up a click on a camera
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.480]   that's right here backstage.
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:12.560]   You can click on another camera,
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.040]   there's always gonna be interviews going on in the press room.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.400]   So I think that it's gonna be yet another chance for me
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:20.960]   to become a little bit too obsessive and darling about.
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.920]   What is essentially a love letter to people
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:25.640]   who make millions and millions and millions of dollars
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:27.080]   or just massaging their own egos,
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.160]   but still, that in the next--
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:31.600]   - They make us happy, Andy.
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:36.600]   - Well, they take our boring pedestrian little lives
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.480]   and they turn them into something fun, exciting.
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:42.520]   - The humble crafts, the humble artisans back there
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:45.120]   at the glitter factory, we have much to owe them.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.440]   I mean, I'll be serious,
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:50.440]   I do enjoy the Oscars because I'm the sort of person
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:53.720]   who'll be like, if the cake space doesn't win best picture,
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:55.560]   I'm just gonna freakin' kill myself.
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:56.760]   I'm never gonna watch the Oscar.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:59.600]   - Is that 'cause you're picked for best picture King speech?
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.920]   - It's so close between King speech and True Rit.
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:03.240]   - I love True Rit too.
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:05.080]   - Those are two films that I could have seen
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:05.920]   10 times in our own.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.560]   I actually saw them each like at least twice.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.520]   - Wouldn't it be cool if the dude got a second Oscar
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.720]   in a robe?
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:14.240]   - It'd be cool if Jeff Bridges accepted it in the robe
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.680]   and is Tron Helmut.
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:17.840]   (laughing)
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:18.680]   And does it screw you?
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:19.960]   I've already won one.
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:21.560]   Now I'm gonna go for cool points.
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:24.320]   - So the name of the app again?
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:27.480]   - I believe it's called, I don't know, it's called,
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:30.760]   it's called, if you do search on iTunes
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.120]   for Oscars you'll find it.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:36.240]   - I had the name loaded up on my little page of notes
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.560]   and I had to restart for Skype
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.360]   and I didn't reopen my page of notes
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:40.200]   so I don't know what it is.
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.800]   It is in the show notes that I just,
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.640]   that I gave you earlier.
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:48.320]   - It's called, it's called simply enough, the Oscars.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.680]   - Well, what else do you have to say?
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:50.520]   - Is that it?
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.360]   Is that the official one?
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.640]   Now this is the official one, this isn't it.
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:54.480]   - Yeah, right?
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.560]   - That is the app we're talking about.
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:57.400]   - Oh, okay.
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:59.120]   So this is the official Oscar.
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:01.000]   Hey, can everyone vote, that's what they should have.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.400]   Everyone like right when it's happening,
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:04.040]   everyone vote on who they think should win
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:04.880]   before they--
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:05.720]   - Wave them off.
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.200]   - No, that's called American Idol.
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.560]   - It's called, it's called, no, no, no,
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.360]   it wouldn't be a real vote, it would just be,
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:13.200]   you would see what the public trend would be.
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:14.920]   - The app itself is called backstage.
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:17.080]   - Oscar backstage pass by ABC.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:17.920]   - ABC.
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:21.320]   - See, I knew if they use the word Oscar,
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:23.040]   they have to be a licensee.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:26.080]   - Yeah, well, in addition to getting actual use
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.160]   of the statuette.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:29.480]   - Right, so that's for reals, man.
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:30.320]   - Really, really cool.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.840]   Also, it's a really well, it's a well done iPad style app.
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:36.640]   It's not just some dude who've studied a little bit,
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:39.400]   HTML5 and just put links to videos.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.560]   It's actually very well done.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:43.200]   - In the Kodak Theater, thank you, Cam.
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:45.240]   - Wow.
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:49.400]   - I cannot wait, I'm sitting in front of the TV with this.
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.200]   - Yeah, no, see, I already see,
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:52.760]   I'm planning on staying now.
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:54.760]   I'm definitely gonna have a live blog window.
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:56.800]   I won't tweet that much because of the two.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:59.640]   Should I do a use stream channel just so I could be
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:02.080]   just like talking and sharing my excitement?
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:06.520]   - I wonder if this is in some way the future of television
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.840]   is this kind of hybrid thing where you participate
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:11.760]   with an iPad device that gives you extra camera angles
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:15.320]   and stuff, so that there's still the TV for the 80%
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:16.880]   that just wanna sit and watch the TV,
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.560]   but for the rest of us, this is a great opportunity.
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:21.240]   - For live events, I think it makes a lot of sense.
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.080]   - Really cool.
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.840]   - It also gets people unhooked from their DVR
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:26.960]   because the only way to experience it is to experience it.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:28.280]   - Well, and these companies already know,
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.440]   they said last year that that's what's propelling
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.440]   the increased viewership for the Grammys,
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:34.560]   the Oscars, the Emmys, the Super Bowl,
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:37.600]   is social media, it's people tweeting about it.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.840]   People say, "Hey, something's going on, I'm gonna run out.
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:42.720]   "I love it, I'm gonna download this immediately," Andy, great pick.
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:46.520]   My pick is also a iPad app, it's actually one I discovered
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:49.040]   on the Mac, well, discovered 'cause I stole it from somebody,
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:53.800]   on the Mac, Mac mania cruise, it's called Weather Plus.
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:58.200]   Now, I foolishly, you know, I did a bit on the lecture
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:02.720]   on the trip on apps, I did 60 iPhone apps
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.800]   and I picked Weather Bug Elite being an old fashioned fart.
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.080]   Then somebody said, "Well, wait a minute,
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:09.080]   "what about Weather Plus?"
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:11.480]   And I went, "Oh, this is better."
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.720]   It's got a little flip clock, it's got pictures,
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:16.360]   it's got a background, you know, we loved Weather HD,
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:20.120]   which gave you the pictures of the different,
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.160]   you know, weather conditions as they're going on.
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.600]   This does that in the background,
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:27.080]   with a lot of weather information,
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:30.360]   you can click different days
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.680]   and you'll get the pictures that go with that.
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.680]   It's just pretty.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.680]   - That looks great.
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:40.240]   - It's just pretty, it doesn't really do, diddly do,
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:43.160]   but it's pretty and that's what I like.
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:46.280]   And by the way, I can just tell you right now,
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:49.480]   it's 60 degrees and partly cloudy in Austin, Texas.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:51.240]   - How about St. Martin?
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:52.240]   Is that where you're going?
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:53.080]   - Tomorrow.
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:54.240]   - Jerk. - Tonight.
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:56.080]   - You jerky jerk jerk.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:56.920]   I love St. Martin.
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:57.920]   - I've never been there.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:58.880]   - Oh, you're gonna love it.
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:00.200]   Are you going to the Dutch side of the French side?
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.820]   - Dutch.
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:03.440]   - Yeah, I think it's a little safer
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:04.920]   to eat the food on the Dutch side.
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:07.120]   (laughing)
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:09.200]   - I had a bad clam on the French side.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.040]   - Oh, there we go.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:12.420]   - But you're going to see Martin
[01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:14.360]   and I think the Dutch are a little more scrupulous
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.680]   about the cleanliness of their kitchens.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.520]   I just thought that.
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:18.880]   But anyway, you may ask, in fact, I wish you would.
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:22.560]   Why, Leo, do you have Austin's weather forecast?
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.040]   - Oh.
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:24.880]   - Oh.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.200]   - Oh, oh, oh.
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.840]   - You have St. Martin's 'cause you're going to St. Martin.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:30.600]   I have Austin because we're going to South by Southwest.
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:34.440]   March 12th and 13th, we will be broadcasting live
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:35.840]   once again from South by.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.560]   That's the place that I've very foolishly crowd-surfed
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:40.400]   last year.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.240]   (laughing)
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:43.840]   - That was classic internetness.
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:44.840]   - Internet media.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.760]   - That's like one of the things that we're going to look back on
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:48.720]   and then there was the first live crowds.
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:51.800]   - It's the kids says it was epic.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.840]   - But this year I probably won't be doing that.
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:54.720]   We are going to be there.
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:55.840]   We'll cover the party's live.
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:58.040]   We do have the live view backpacks.
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.120]   We're going to have two of them.
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:01.200]   Tom Merritt will be there, Sarah Lane and I
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.160]   and Brian Brushwood will be giving you live coverage.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:05.800]   It's going to be so much fun.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:07.840]   And I will be, we're going to do,
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:11.640]   for the first time ever, a live Twitch in Austin
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:13.200]   on Sunday, March 13th.
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:14.040]   So here's the deal.
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:17.000]   We're going to be at Momos, which is a great club in Austin.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:17.840]   It's not on six.
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:20.840]   It's a little bit of a walk, but you can get there.
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:21.720]   It's absolutely free.
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:22.760]   Starts at one o'clock.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:24.120]   The tech guy from Momos.
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.040]   I'll do the radio show.
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.240]   TNT with Tom Merritt at four o'clock.
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:29.280]   And then at five o'clock, we've got a Twitch
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.600]   and some of the greatest people who've ever been on Twitch
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:32.440]   will be there.
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:34.080]   It's one of those giant panel things.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.680]   And then at seven o'clock, a Twitch meetup.
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:37.120]   All at Momos.
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:39.480]   And then we'll continue with the South by coverage.
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:43.440]   Tom, Sarah, Brian, me,
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:47.080]   Brian, I mean, Gina Trapani and Jeff Jarvis will also be there.
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:48.080]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:51.440]   I hope you will join us for our live coverage of South by.
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:56.720]   And just rapidly becoming one of the most fun conferences of all.
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:57.960]   I really enjoy South by South.
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:58.920]   It's a great conference.
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.080]   If I didn't have to work, I'd be there.
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:01.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:02.920]   You were going to be where?
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:04.040]   I'm going to be in Half Moon Bay.
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:08.240]   Oh, you know, watch out for the food in Half Moon Bay
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:11.360]   because I had a bad clam there.
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.280]   Hey, thank you all for being here.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:14.360]   It was great to be back.
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:17.720]   But thanks very much to Andy and Alex for filling in while I was gone.
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:20.560]   Thanks to Tom Merritt for filling in on many of the other shows too.
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:23.640]   And for a very dedicated crew of people here at the Twitcottage
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:25.600]   who worked really extra hard while I was gone
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.120]   because all they would get from me is twice a day
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:31.800]   because I had very little access message, incomprehensible messages saying,
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:32.640]   do this, do that.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.480]   They were trying to figure it out.
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:36.800]   And really, I'm sure it was very difficult.
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:38.840]   So thank you all for holding down the fort.
[01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.000]   Thank you for being here.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.240]   Don't forget we do this show live, the pre-show.
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:46.240]   The pre-show begins at 11 AM.
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:48.240]   Red carpet coverage begins.
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:52.240]   It's pretty much, it might as well be Joan Rivers and her daughter, frankly.
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.240]   11 AM.
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.240]   It's AM wearing 5/11 tactical.
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:58.240]   Shoe upfront.
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:03.240]   11 AM Pacific 2PM Eastern time at live.twit.tv.
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:09.240]   And now let's go to followers.com and get our poll results.
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:12.240]   Our question, as you may remember, is will Steve Jobs ever come back
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:14.240]   to run Apple?
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:23.240]   And I'm glad to say that a large majority said, "Yes, 58.41%, 486 votes said,
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:26.240]   yes, 41% 346 votes said no."
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:28.240]   That is a great number.
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:30.240]   The voting continues through the rest of the day.
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.240]   We'll try doing this again.
[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:35.240]   I think this is kind of a fun way to get your opinion on stuff.
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:37.240]   The followers poll of the week.
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:38.240]   Isn't that cool?
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:40.240]   Argentinian entrepreneurs.
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:42.240]   And I wanted to kind of give you a minute.
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:43.240]   When are they going to open up?
[01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:46.240]   I have a feeling the crowds are at the doors now saying, "Please."
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:48.240]   I'm not really asking when they can open up.
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:49.240]   When can I use it?
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:50.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.240]   That's what I'm really asking.
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:52.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:53.240]   It's fun.
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:54.240]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:55.240]   We'll see you next time.
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:56.240]   Now you get back to work.
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:57.240]   Right time's over.
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:02.240]   It's not like you're suddenly saying what that works.
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:05.240]   I say, I say, get back to work there soon.
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:13.240]   [Music]
