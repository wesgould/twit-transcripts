[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.160]   Great to see I'm not traveling. It's a miracle. Yeah, I you know, I think you like to travel
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160]   I'm I I
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.160]   Know this business leave I was in three sites in three cities in three weeks
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.040]   And I had two days notice for like all weeks notice for one but two days notice for the other one
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.400]   That's because you cover Apple my friend. They don't plan ahead
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.320]   No, it's no we can talk with that on it
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.160]   It's gotta be frustrating because they know they're gonna release a red iPhone and there's no reason why they don't know that it's gonna happen
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.800]   I April whatever
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   But they and it's with Samsung
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.360]   With Samsung they would tell you two weeks in advance
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.120]   They'd fly you out a week in advance and let you do everything you wanted and then when they had their event
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.080]   You put your stuff up at the same time of the events of the biggest problem was who do you watch first right?
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.440]   Yeah, well, you know what you chose it, baby
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.760]   You chose your beat. It's better than the blackberry beat right now. Yeah true true true
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.360]   Andy and I coz also with us from a not co comm great to see you welcome
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.400]   Hello
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.680]   Yeah, Andy and I have been holding down the fort while Renee's been jet setting around the world
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.960]   Little tip for those of you in the United States trying to file
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.120]   Your taxes last minute the IRS digital data system is mostly down
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.520]   Oh
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.360]   It has failed for reasons unknown and
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.000]   The agency's been attempting to solve the problem for nearly eight hours with little success
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.240]   This is this is not good
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.960]   Why are all you most suddenly using it we went planning on this is a spike you did well
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.760]   I have to I'm gonna say I have to think that this
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.560]   Does not have to do with I bet you there's some malefactor
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.760]   Foot right don't you think terrible?
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.920]   Not necessarily I think that could just be a heavy traffic heavy traffic also given the downsizing of government
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.920]   That's been happening over the past couple of years
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.440]   You know who who needs system administrators who needs people who do stress testing? It's just we got we got a guy
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.960]   We got a guy lieutenant governor of Nebraska
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:02.040]   His he knows all about the AOL. Let's just make him in charge of the computers at the IRS. I have to think that
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.000]   Well, here's the IR I would have thought maybe the IRS would have said something like well, okay, you get an extra day, but no
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.320]   Note that your tax payment is due
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.280]   Although IRS direct pay may not be available. So you still got a mail it I guess
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.040]   Wow
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.360]   Yeah, I one forgets you can go to the post office effect many post offices all over the land make this a special day
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:38.160]   They stay open late they offer donuts and coffee as you drive by throw your tax return out the window as you wish by
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.320]   So take advantage of this and get to know your local mail carrier
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:50.280]   We had we had a good weekend
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.880]   It was it was a good weekend for people who don't have didn't have a chance to win the Boston Marathon to totally win the Boston Marathon
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.180]   That not awesome Wow that was it's hey all all it takes is like 34 degree weather
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.540]   freezing rain sleet and headwinds to make a lot of elite runners
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.600]   Simply say yeah
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.360]   You can keep your parents be I really feel like I'm going to die right now
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.080]   Is that the elite runners just not run or just just not make good? No, no
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.200]   There's the there's a big big list of like elite runners who are just DNF DNF DNF
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.760]   Okay started, but they just at some point they said I'm out. Yeah. Yeah, and which is not to denigrate the people who won
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:39.960]   But these are typically people who are good at like consistent consistently really really fast races as opposed to
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.640]   Once or twice being able to do like a two oh you know a two oh eight two oh seven two whatever the the winning time is
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.800]   but it's exciting to see people who are
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:56.480]   Surprised and overjoyed to find out that they've actually won money. That was reading an article today about how
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.520]   Someone's planning to go back to work on Wednesday did not know that they have 25. They've won $25,000
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.600]   There's one there's one person who?
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.160]   landed in the money, but the problem is she was
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.240]   They don't know where the fifth place went to an elite runner
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.380]   It's that's a runner that actually has like their name instead of a number or a regular regular qualifier who has like a
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:25.680]   You know a 18 digit number the difference being that the elite runner got to start like in a special pack the
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:32.720]   other runner had to start like in the huge huge scrum of general people and they kind of both came in
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.800]   Fifth depending on how you look at it. So they're trying to figure out how to settle that one because it's just never come up
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.360]   Before it's it just shows you why the Boston Marathon is one of these international elite wonderful
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.280]   Wonderful events that it's a dream for a lot of people and a lot of people's extra dreams came true on Monday
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.000]   It was really it was it was a
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   spiraling
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.120]   I'm not a marathoner, but I went outside this morning and this is what the pavement looked like which is basically pure ice
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.720]   So I very quickly went back inside. I'm so glad I live in California
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.560]   I looked out my window and there's half a boat
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.160]   There's just half a boat like in the in the water
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.960]   And I don't know if it blew away and then half sunk or got frozen or I'm not sure
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.320]   So the Mark Gurman rumor du jour
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:27.480]   He's the man has not stopped this a leak about leaks is that oh you want to do that one first?
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.400]   Let's do that one first the leak that is so meta. It's about
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.040]   So Apple put out a memo to its employees saying stop leaking and in fact
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.160]   pointed out the 29 leakers were caught last year and
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.640]   of them 12 were arrested
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:50.280]   They also said and this is a shot right at journalism that even though
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.200]   bloggers and journalists
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.520]   Will be reaching out in many keys. Let me let me read the actual paragraph
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:06.320]   It because by the way this memo was leaked immediately. Yes in many cases leakers don't set out to leak
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.760]   Instead people who work for Apple are often targeted by press
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:17.680]   Analysts and bloggers who befriend them on professional and social networks like linked in Twitter and Facebook and begin to pry for
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:23.040]   Information while it may seem flattering to be approached. It's important to remember
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.280]   You're getting played
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.560]   Bum bum bum just like a good friendship and love
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.840]   Apple is your only true family
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:42.000]   You're getting played and by the way if just in case you needed any more reinforcement you could go to jail
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.440]   If you could even be charged with a felony the way this works
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.480]   Again another paragraph leakers do not simply lose their jobs at Apple
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:03.640]   Oh, no my friend in some cases they face jail time and massive fines for network intrusion and theft of trade secrets
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.640]   Both classified as federal crimes
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:13.480]   12 were arrested doesn't say if the 12 were arrested got hot got to go home an hour later or or are still in jail
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.960]   Among those Apple employees
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.320]   Contractors some partners in Apple supply chain these people's not only lose their jobs
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:29.520]   They face they can face extreme difficulty finding employment elsewhere. This is this is the genteel version of you'll never work in this town again
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.760]   Nice career be ashamed when something happened to
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.680]   Remember here at Apple you're like family, but like many family members were also vengeful
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:45.880]   Okay, what do you guys think I mean there's so much I grew her point of this out right away is that like
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:52.280]   The what the leaks that they mentioned specifically are all the mark German leaks who then leaks the memo about the leaks
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.720]   That were leaked to him
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.320]   Well, they got they they have to be aware of that kind of irony
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:03.720]   It's not impossible to send out something like this, but nonetheless it really does it does point out that
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:10.440]   Either they are legitimately getting dinged a lot left and right at least a lot more than they used to or they at least want to create
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.480]   The impression that they're getting dinged left and right so that's
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:20.040]   I don't I I don't know how many iterations that text went through though that
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.640]   It is kind of dramatic to say that remember they're playing you they're trying
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.800]   I'm sure that some I'm sure that many people are but it's also true that
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:38.120]   There is in every I have I've had relationships with people that so many different companies since way before they're working at those companies
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.080]   and
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:45.840]   Sometimes when I'm in San Francisco, I'm we're just hanging out as friends and it's hard and I there's always that little
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:53.040]   Little dance that we have to have to do where I have to say so hard things going and then preface it by saying
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.840]   I don't mean and I don't mean with your actual professional work that you're not allowed to talk to me about
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.960]   I mean like I know that you had we're buying a boat and we had some problems with it
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:08.320]   I really want to know about the boat not the secret project that we both know that you're on it's it's difficult
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.800]   It's it has to be said it has to be said
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.040]   I don't know about I don't know how to solve that
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:21.440]   I have like a couple thoughts on this one is that like there's different kinds of leaks to me like a lot of the leaks that Apple
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.640]   Experiences are leaks about products
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:30.760]   Which is sort of like the end of the next Star Trek Star Wars movie gets leaked or Avengers Infinity Wars gets leaked and people report on it
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:36.040]   And that's fine. I mean like it can ruin the surprise for people as you call them spoilers if they call those spoilers
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.120]   Nobody would get upset about it, right? Well, no, that's and well
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:39.520]   That's the thing
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.800]   But I think like if you go and read the spoiler and then go to the movie and write that the movie was boring
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.920]   You're a jerk because you didn't have to read the spoiler like so there's that at play
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:55.320]   But then there's leaks that that show like genuine malfeasance or malpractice or damaging things about a company and those are super important
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:01.640]   And I don't so I don't like to lump them all together like if a company is legitimately ripping you off or destroying your data or poisoning you
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:08.480]   Or doing something that's like that's like that's not spoiler alert. That's whistleblower. There's the third category of leaks
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:17.620]   Which I think journalists have a right and an interest in pursuing which is the kind of leaks that help consumers make product buying
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.160]   decisions a leak like
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:27.840]   You know the iMac Pro is coming out in a month and a half. You might want to wait to buy that iMac
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:33.340]   Those things it's it's I think it's our almost our job to pursue those. I don't know
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:38.300]   It absolutely is we we work for the consumers. We work for the readers. We don't work for Apple
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:45.840]   That's why things like access journalism. I think that's it's sometimes that phrase gets banded about like fake news
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.160]   It's a harmful phrase you want to use when you want to delegitimize what someone else is doing
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:58.500]   But sometimes you some people get too cozy with a company such that they really are part of their an extension of the marketing program
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.500]   And so it's important to know that
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:08.260]   You know your that your relationship with Apple your relationship with Google anybody is there to get information that will help you tell a better story to
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:15.380]   a user and I think I'm sure Renee has been in this situation as well where you're getting stonewalled and so
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:23.500]   Okay, guess what I now go to address book B of people who have direct knowledge of this stuff and simply ask them if they are
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.580]   willing to talk to me on background on a certain issue just and with the
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:33.100]   Letting them know exactly what I'm looking for and what what I'm trying to understand and Apple also is there big
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.980]   They're big boys and girls. They understand this is going to happen as well
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:42.820]   So it's really really important that if you're a journalist or a columnist you have to do your job no matter what that entails
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.740]   Sometimes that will entail again approaching people who don't have authority to speak about something
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:53.960]   But who have information that you and by extension your reader needs so nothing should if Apple's perfectly free to
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.340]   Titan controls on their own people. There's certainly free to
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.780]   Pursue legal action against people who break certain confidence
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:06.800]   But it's our job to find the answers no matter how we can within within certain ethical boundaries
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:13.080]   But it's our job to find that to find information and not just limit ourselves to what a company is willing to give us
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.080]   might also point out that
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:23.560]   To the Wall Street Journal reporters when Apple's executives call you on on the record off the record for deep background to give you a story
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.920]   You're being played
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.480]   Apple does the other way too
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:34.200]   Yeah, yes, there's like you can back you can background on both like if you hear a story
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.120]   I will often check around to see if it's legitimate and sometimes it's not sometimes it's someone with an axe to grind and
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.920]   Then maybe you can see their point of view, but it's really not a bigger picture saying Apple
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.520]   He's on its own on its own behalf sometimes well
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:46.880]   No, I yeah
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.600]   No, and sometimes it'll be like to set expectations just like yeah
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.920]   A lot of people are expecting that new Mac Pearl at WWDC and that's probably not
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:59.000]   Exactly the fact Jason Heiner from Tech Republic and Lindsay Turrentime
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.960]   We're on Twitter from both editors in chief Tech Republic had seen it and Lindsay said you know
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.960]   I wouldn't be surprised if Apple leaked this memo to mark Gerbin
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:14.400]   I know I think it's way more rare than people think it is and to mark I don't think
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:19.240]   Yeah, they probably would mark this email. It's an email that's sent out to all hands
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:25.560]   Okay, I think that at some point someone is gonna forward something to somebody or so or at least hold up an iPhone to somebody
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.120]   They're having a bunch of breakfast with and see what they're having to see what they think about it
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:37.040]   But I also don't doubt that I also don't doubt that sometimes Apple uses leaks to get information out that they then don't have to
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.720]   Stand by later on so there is it's part of the game. It's just part of the game
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.080]   Yeah, but I would like all the companies I've worked with I think Apple
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.320]   I've seen that the absolutely it's like I could probably count on half the fingers of a hand
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.960]   Sometimes when I thought they would do that and other companies do it all the time
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:58.720]   It's because I think their culture is so is so they're so culturally its secrecy like surprise and delight is so much
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.360]   They're mantra that they would rather just not say anything even when it would help them
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.960]   There are a lot of cases where it would absolutely help them to get ahead of a story
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.880]   Whether it's on background or on the record and they just don't do it and it's so frustrating
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.960]   Oh go ahead finish
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.560]   No, the second thing I was gonna say is there's also a difference like in the cases where people have been arrested and
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.800]   Prosecuted for leaks is when they did it in exchange for money
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.880]   Which is a very different thing than just talking to a journalist if you either offer to buy and or sell
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:33.760]   Internal information it is very different than just the typical journalistic practices that go on. I wish actually Apple had been
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.840]   more
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.280]   Explicit with details about these 12 who got arrested
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:45.080]   Were they prosecuted did they face jail time? What were their crimes?
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:50.280]   Yeah, and I hope some journalist will actually do some work and find out because
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.760]   To be honest, that's a little scary. It's absolutely Apple's right to fire people. I
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.840]   It's a little scary and the only reason I say it's scary is because Apple is
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.480]   Well, I think of the gizmodo case where the iPhone 4 was left in a bar
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:11.440]   Somebody found it sold it to gizmodo Brian lamb and Apple
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:19.600]   Was not at all hesitant to use the Silicon Valley task force to to take to come to Lamb's house
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:27.920]   Take every bit of electronic equipment he had to effectively punish him and so I think that Apple especially in in in
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:35.360]   Cupertino law enforcement is you know, you know tips the hat to Apple and I would hope that they don't misuse
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:43.780]   Law enforcement in an over aggressive attempt to prevent leaks. That's that's all I'm saying. I would assume that when they're talking about people who
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.960]   leaked information and were arrested or
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:53.280]   Were made to feel the punishment feel the the influence of actual law enforcement about it
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:58.400]   We're probably talking about people who were paid by industry analysts or paid by people who are consulting
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.000]   It doesn't say that I'm saying that I'm saying that that's that's my assumption
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:11.640]   And as for that other thing. Yeah, that was there's definitely a difference between the friendly people if you ever visit the the Apple campus
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:17.800]   There's a difference between the friendly people in like the colorful Apple polo shirts and t-shirts and the
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.400]   People with the men with the high and tight haircuts and the black golf shirts that sometimes will show up if they think you're doing something that
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:32.280]   They don't they don't understand what you're doing. I've had all like taking pictures of toy cows in front of the campus. Let's say
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:38.180]   Yes, there's there's there's there's there has but that's just one that's just one example of they do have a very very serious
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.760]   Security force they do take the stuff very very seriously it's a face
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:47.120]   You do not see but it's something that they can unleash if they feel as though it is necessary for them to do so and
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:52.040]   They're gonna have and if they ever do that improperly then they're gonna have to face consequences for it
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:57.480]   But if it when it comes to calling the cops, I don't think that someone they would call the cops on somebody who simply told
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:04.800]   Leak the date of the other red phone to some blogger that they went to school with and they're good friends with and they
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:12.160]   They play games with I think that would be something where they Apple is gonna be Apple themselves are gonna be facing huge consequences
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.240]   If that information were to get out and that's why it becomes an actual legal matter
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:24.400]   No, and there's a range to like there are civil remedies for people who break NDAs those typically have you know finds and things imposed on it
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.760]   That's not at least you know
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:31.680]   I'm not a lawyer, but that's different than a police matter an actual crime has been committed and also Apple's traditionally been really good about
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.320]   The like that guy who left the phone in the bar. It was an accident. It wasn't a mistake
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.720]   He was working for Apple for years after that
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:43.160]   And there have been people right no and there are people who accidentally have like put a file where it shouldn't have been filed and
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.120]   And they didn't get fired if people tried to cover it up
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.840]   Maybe they got fired or if people you know deliberately gave stuff away
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:55.680]   They've been fired but in terms of an accident Apple historically has gone you bent over backwards to try to help you fix it
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:02.560]   It's when they believe that you're working counter to the best interests of your team and the company that they engage what Andy just
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:09.840]   Also technically Gizmodo was trading in stolen property, which there was a crime there
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:15.720]   There was a crime there. Yeah, that's that was a that was a thing that always makes me think that that was a really really bad
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:24.560]   for Gizmodo because there are there are ways to there are ways that they could have had access to that without compromising
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:29.040]   Well, I believe themselves legally vulnerable and that's why I think
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.220]   Maybe I'm wrong, but none of us here would have paid for that stolen phone
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:39.720]   Absolutely not I was I was in a similar ish situation where
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.400]   This is why this is why you have a lawyer
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:49.320]   On that so and you can I am not joking. This is why you have someone you can call for advice
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.800]   Yeah, where there's something I won't get into any details or even refer to the company
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:59.040]   But there was something very very interesting that I was offered a chance to look at that had that wasn't
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:07.000]   being approved by the company and it was big enough that it might have been important for users to know about this and
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.920]   The way the the solution it was very very similar with somebody
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:17.640]   May or may not have had the right to take this thing out of the campus to show it to me
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:24.240]   And so the you can easily insulate yourself by no, you're not you're not gonna pay someone five thousand dollars for this
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.400]   Whatever it is you're going to say I'm going to I am going to pay you a
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.000]   $5,000
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.320]   Consulting fee yeah to let me to meet me in a hotel room where we will videotape everything and you will let me examine this
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.360]   And then I'm not taking possession of it. It's not mine
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:42.720]   I'm just a journalist who is paying you a fee to do something even that sort of
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.520]   Would you have any scruples if they offered it to you for free?
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:52.080]   If they offered it to give it to me for free. Yeah, Eddie. I found this iPhone 9 on
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.560]   The bar would you like it?
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:01.640]   That's again. That's a call to a lawyer if it's if it's because this is still something a lost piece of property
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.640]   It's it's I bull
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.040]   Again something that's vaguely similar
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:12.120]   I think that I would be but my first thing when I would have to contact the person who I think owns it and say hey
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:17.400]   I have this thing that you own then there would be a since we're talking about a hypothetical with Apple
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.800]   I would then say I of course I have it and I'm taking pictures of it
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:27.640]   and I have the right to absolutely do whatever I want with this because I require this thing absolutely legally and I could if I
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.040]   If they were in the best interest of the users
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:35.320]   Use that to trade for better information that they could control at a later date again
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:41.480]   It would depend on what I needed from them and if it were just this is literally clearly an iPhone 9
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.480]   When I act when I turned it on just to see if there's a phone number I could call to see who owns it
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.920]   It looked like there was absolutely nothing different about it. There's nothing unusual
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.760]   Again, what's in the best interest of the readers? But again in terms of legally, this is not my phone
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.000]   I cannot take possession of it. It is my response
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.240]   My responsibility as to find if I find something to say I believe you own this I want to return this to you
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:09.320]   Recently there have been a number of cases where people have used hacked emails to write articles and stories
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.560]   emails
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.720]   Not you know gained legally
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.560]   But handed over to them for free and I would really have to quit
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:23.480]   I would really have to think long and hard before I would do this. What about you Renee? Is there a design or have a policy?
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:27.640]   I don't know that we've ever been in that situation
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.880]   I mean for me a lot of the stuff with apple is easy because every year there's going to be a new iPhone
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.520]   It's it's going to be extraordinary if there wasn't right
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.840]   So just knowing that there's going to be another iPhone to me is not particularly news where they all do everything to say
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:45.400]   You probably shouldn't buy an iPhone between June and September no matter what the news cycle is because that's just traditionally when it happens
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:52.120]   But I I have a huge fear factor in terms of dealing with anything that might come from from stolen
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.880]   Stolen property and also I had a great conversation with Jim dallerable about this
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.480]   It's like I don't know if I ever want have the personal responsibility for getting someone fired
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.280]   Like they're all grown yeah human beings and they
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:09.960]   Mark downplayed the fact that the guy who leaked the meeting information got fired to mark german got fired
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:15.480]   He didn't really for me particularly apple has hired several people that I worked closely with for years
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.360]   And they all work at apple now and even though I never talked about this thing
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.200]   I don't want like to cast suspicion upon anybody that I might know in a company
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.040]   So I I try to like I think there's apple is a logical enough company
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:32.120]   And he do things in a predictable enough manner that I can have a whole swaths of coverage done without me compromising anybody to do it
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.320]   Yeah
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:39.800]   Everybody has to make that choice and it's not merely low law. It's also the ethics and and what you're what your moral code
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.520]   uh dictates
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.760]   Also, I'm not like mark's a beat reporter. I'm not I have the luxury of not being a beat that's true too commentate
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.360]   You know, I'm I'm a commentator and analyst. I don't have to do that for a living
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.840]   So I I'm not going to judge anybody who does do it. I'm just thankful
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.960]   Well, and I think it's to some degree all three of us and most of people on the twit network chose
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.480]   To be a little bit in the backseat for that very reason
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.640]   I don't want to be out there on the pavement trying to get somebody to leak and get you know the inside
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.560]   It's not my that's not my bag man. I'd much rather let mark do all the hard work
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.560]   And comment on it after the he's good at it. I mean, he's so good
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.720]   Yeah
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:21.880]   Uh all all props to him although I'm under I mean he looks so young and innocent and sweet and then he just gets all the stories
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.120]   That's part of it. Isn't it? He's
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:28.280]   But do you think he feels guilt when an employee loses his job because they leaked him
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.400]   Probably not. I mean the guy knew what he was doing
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:37.560]   I can't speak for mark. Uh, I can see I could I can speak for myself and say that
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.040]   uh, I wouldn't feel
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.880]   terribly guilty
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:47.400]   Because what I do when I use when I use those kinds of sources. I
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.960]   Basically, it's it's almost like
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:56.440]   I I'm almost like the devil putting a contract in front of you and a pen saying you're the terms of this that i'm going to
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:03.000]   I'm asking for information that i'm going to use on background because I want to understand how this particular technology works
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.520]   I won't quote you. I won't even say that in this case
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.000]   In this hypothetical case, I don't even need to say I talked to so-one
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.680]   To someone in this position at this company to get this information
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:19.640]   I just want to make sure that I understand what's happening and official channels are not telling me how this thing works
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.520]   Uh and essentially making sure that this person knows fully well what they're doing. This isn't a
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:29.720]   Uh, there there have been times where I have stopped somebody like we're just i'm at i'm
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:35.640]   I'm at wwdc or something and we're just hanging out and someone is telling me something and I have to stop them
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.360]   And say we're having lunch here realize that anything you say to me
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:46.120]   Anything you say to me could conceivably be used to develop a story in the future
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:51.320]   So don't tell me something unless you tell me in in advance that I can't share this information
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:56.440]   I have to basically the blacklists entire conversation. It's also an interesting point
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:02.680]   Which guru points out that it's very possible that every single leak mentioned in this memo was a leak to mark german
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:09.480]   It's almost seems certain and he says and he says it seems possible every single specific example
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.560]   This is uh john groover writing cited by apple in this memo is someone leaking to mark german
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.680]   Makes you wonder who had the balls to send this memo to him
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:23.640]   We'll be getting into inception territory if the leaker of the memo and leaker is getting fired for leaking to german gets fired for leaking it to german
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:28.280]   Uh, you know
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.440]   It feels a little heavy-handed to be honest, especially the part about getting arrested
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:38.040]   It's really clear that the point of the memo is we will catch you and you will not only lose your job
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.480]   You'll risk going to jail that is that is pretty draconian
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:47.480]   So sometimes people have sometimes people aren't that sophisticated and they're not they're pretty young
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.720]   They don't understand that when you tell people things it stops becoming a secret
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.800]   They're not they don't feel as though they're leaking something but nonetheless they're the source of
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.600]   a piece of private information getting out there. They also don't understand that
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:07.640]   Again, like if if someone someone that they've been reading were listening to for a long long time, you know, bumps into them at ww
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.400]   DC and says hey wow
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.720]   Wow, you work a you work on the on the heli gyro project i've been really really curious about that
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.800]   Let's go squat to lunch and i'll take out the lunch on that must be really really cool the stuff you're doing
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:23.800]   And that this young engineer he or she thinks that they're just having a they're just excited about the project
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.040]   And they're just getting information there's an element of that
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:33.960]   So at some point you have to tell a teenager that it's you have to you have to shower and wear deodorant
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.960]   It's not shower or wear deodorant
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.880]   You can't assume that it's at any point they've all learned this sort of stuff
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.960]   So at some point sometimes you have to say, okay
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.920]   I guess we do have to tell people that we wear we wear
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:50.840]   Things on our feet inside the office for a reason and no you're not going to be walking barefoot
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:59.000]   Through campus all day long unless you unless you answer directly to tim in which case tim will say what the hell is wrong with you man
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.120]   Well, I think the
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:07.480]   Black polo shirted guys from apple might be visiting the fcc sometime soon because apparently the fcc has
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.440]   published photos of a gold iphone 10
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:18.760]   That this unreleased a gold finish on the iphone 10, but I guess it was submitted to the fcc
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.600]   Even though it says apple proprietary and confidential on the images
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:28.280]   Submitted to the fcc for a testing and the fcc seems to have published these photos
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.640]   Probably part of their normal process. I would guess but
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:37.640]   Well, we saw we saw something similar to that with google which looks like they're going to be introducing
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.520]   Android tv dongle soon
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:46.200]   And they all the paperwork was fcc did essentially what they were supposed to do
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:53.400]   Which is to do what the company tells them to there was not a document attached to the the package of fcc approval stuff
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.720]   That said oh by the way the following elements of this package are confidential and should not be
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.320]   I don't think you can do that. I think that's one of the reasons steve jobs announced the iphone
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:08.120]   Uh six months before it was released because I think that they want to announce it before they send it to the fcc for approval
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.560]   So if you don't release something can you go take it? We're not releasing this we want to back
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.120]   Give us everything back
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:19.240]   It's pretty. I don't know when it'll be out. Uh it is from fcc filing bc g3
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.680]   e3
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:25.960]   161 a I mean it's it's legit and even though it says apple proprietary and confidential this
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:31.800]   Come in. I think this was submitted along with the black and though and the silver one and it just didn't come out
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.440]   Right. I don't know if that's going to change, but right
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:40.440]   So I think that's good for if somebody says boy if only they'd make a gold iphone 10
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.880]   But I guess they're not so i'll buy a black one saw this they go. Oh good. I'll be waiting
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.680]   You know this maybe a long time
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.920]   Well, that's the problem. Yeah, you don't know right
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.920]   Yeah
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:58.120]   Um, I have to there's no product red black. There's no product red iphone 10 either. Why is that me sink?
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.800]   So you can anodie so I went and looked you can anodize
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.760]   Um
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:07.320]   The aluminum that they use for the iphone 8 and 8 plus fairly easily apple's gotten really good at getting the color
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:11.800]   They want but you you can't anodize stainless steel you have to use vapor deposition
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:18.840]   Which is what they use for dlc like on the apple watch and what they use for the black coating on the stainless steel antenna band on the iphone 10
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:23.880]   And the reds that I saw for companies that do do this does not look do not look anything like product red
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:31.320]   They're very metallic brownish red and I think it's the same reason why even on the product red iphone 8 and 7 the screws
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:36.120]   And the inside of the lightning port aren't are still metallic color. They're not red
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.920]   It's just that it doesn't produce the red that apple wants and if they can't get like the proper product red red
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:45.960]   They're just not going to do it. That makes sense. Do you think they might release a redish iphone 10
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:51.480]   I don't know like people some people say just give us the the glass because you can obviously do the glass and leave the band
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.640]   Silver black or something right
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.440]   Um
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.520]   I asked would be you want all red or nothing this gold iphone has a gold band though around it
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.120]   But that's easier. I guess in stainless steel the red gold is the eze smart
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:06.920]   I and I know very little but it's but gold is apparently the easiest color because all you do is you put iron in the process or something
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.000]   right
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:16.120]   I love serenity's review of the new ipad. She did it all so good on an ipad and they filmed it
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:21.400]   I guess you worked with her on this so that's no I said you're what you're gonna do what that's amazing
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.040]   What can I do to give you all the time in the world necessary to finish this?
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.080]   That's a good editor, right?
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.040]   The new ipad review is here
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.880]   She you know the music she composed the music and grower the music
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.480]   That's her that's her music. Yeah, nice
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:44.600]   Aw, I love her pictures of herself
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.480]   And she's got a steve job sketch in there. That's just amazing. Oh really?
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:56.760]   Computers can radically revolutionize the education around the world. Is it really? That was her?
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.640]   Yeah, that was so cool
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.200]   This is part idea. She took screenshots and then it's been recorded her annotating the screenshots
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.520]   Yeah, so this is what an iMovie or something
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.880]   I have many views of what a computer is
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.400]   My particular view is that a computer is in a way
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:17.480]   This is a great way to review the product is to use it and to see what you could do with it and to show what you could do with it
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.880]   as she has
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.880]   Kind of behind the scenes. I think that's great
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.640]   And all the different things that I think she used procreate and linear
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.920]   And the sketch app and the auto annotation. How long did she take to do this?
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.200]   I think it took her a week and a half
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.840]   That was really heavy. Oh remember glider
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.160]   I missed glider
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.720]   And looked at it in terms of simple economics rather than the revolutionary
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:49.480]   Well, we know that it's really really I can tell that she did it fairly recently because she has the new spring apple watch band on
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.240]   Those were really
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.520]   Less events
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:57.720]   She wanted to see how far because the whole thing a lot of people are dismissing the iPad in education
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:01.320]   Because it doesn't have their remote device management features or the google accounts
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:07.560]   And standardies point I think is that with apple pencil apples creating a like a think different version of education where it's not
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.760]   The traditional sit behind a desk showing standardized test
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:17.160]   But it's it's really go out and do something and use the camera and use AR and use the pencil and learn don't just
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.360]   You know repeat back testing things but learn yeah, yeah
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.920]   Well, and I think maybe
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:27.000]   The best use for it is not in the classroom but for a smart kid
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.080]   Who has some money and some access to high speed internet to use it to do their thing, right?
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.920]   That's a great sketch of steve that is great
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.200]   Oh, that is neat
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.200]   Totalis it yeah
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.480]   Damn her and a great roller skater right andy
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:55.160]   She can she she posted a she posted a training video that she was doing where she hip-checked somebody who had to leap like
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:01.560]   Three feet in the air to try to get out of her way and still did not escape the block. She's I love
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:07.240]   She's multi she's multi talented. She really is this is baby wren with her original iMac. Oh
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:16.200]   That's really neat highly recommended. We won't show the whole thing. I want people to go to imore.com and
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:23.160]   And uh, she actually has a colophon how she how she did it and she talks about all the apps she used quite a few
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:28.440]   Um, and she's gonna do a video showing you how to do videos like this which I think is oh neat
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:31.800]   Yeah boy. She has found a new a new
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:38.360]   Beat for herself a new niche niche niche for herself really nice
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:42.680]   Good job so much fun. Uh
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.720]   Let's take a break and then we'll get to the bad news
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.880]   Okay

[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.560]   As long as they're there ask them questions
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.880]   Wordpress does have e-commerce you bet they've got everything from a simple buy button
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:20.360]   To a complete online store and is it affordable? Oh man now i've run a word press site for years
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.200]   I self-hosted for a long time until I realized it would cost me less
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:28.520]   To go to wordpress.com and they do all the technical stuff behind the scenes
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.920]   Plan started as $4 a month
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:34.680]   Not to mention the fact that when you're on wordpress.com you're part of a larger community
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:39.960]   You can have that wordpress.com follow button on your site and people follow you they publish your stuff
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:46.520]   They share it on their social networks. It's a great way to really build an audience wordpress.com
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:53.240]   Of course built-in seo means you're going to show up on the on the on the search engines higher
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:57.240]   They also do htbs automatically. That's another good reason
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:03.560]   Uh and there are lots of plugins. I use the google amp plug-in so that might be site loads super fast on mobile
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:09.720]   But that's just one of hundreds available to you get your own dome. This is what I would suggest get your own domain name
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:17.720]   Get you stuff set up and get 15 percent off wordpress.com slash mac break on your brand new site wordpress.com
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.280]   slash mac break
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.680]   Love them
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.040]   Seriously
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.040]   It's a love thing
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.160]   Uh the bad news another mark german link
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.520]   Homepod not selling all that well now he's quoting slice intelligence
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:38.040]   I don't know. How do you guys feel about slice slice is an app
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:42.040]   uh many people use I use it um that
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:46.680]   Tails you when something's on its way so it it mines your email
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:53.880]   And so they have some information from some many many users about how many people are getting home pods, but I don't know how
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:57.400]   useful that is
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:05.560]   Uh, I that's a lovely actor to turns out for apple watch. Yeah for me for me. It's a trust but verify
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.320]   Source
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:12.120]   I think it's very it's been very accurate on some things where the times where it didn't scan right to my eyes
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.160]   And then I asked somebody else I said, oh, no, no, no, that's
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:21.080]   That's totally not to me is credible. He also did go to the store employees and so forth and say
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:25.080]   Uh, you know, how's it selling and they're saying we've our inventory is building up
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:31.240]   We only sell one or two a day. This kind of makes sense to me the pre pre orders were very hot
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.080]   but um
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:39.320]   And thinking was maybe there would be another spike when people could go in the store and hear the home pod given how good it sounds
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.920]   Yeah
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.840]   Also, it's not necessarily something that people need is something that people have to want
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:50.840]   So I can I can I can imagine it building slowly and just becoming more like a mac tv
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.400]   Uh than an iphone or even an air pod
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:59.400]   Uh, this this is from slice intelligence, uh, again consider the source
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.960]   It's not from apple or any of the manufacturers
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:07.240]   According to slice 73 of the speaker market the smart speaker market
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.680]   That's the those speakers you can talk to is owned by amazon's echo
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.080]   14 percent by home
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:16.600]   10 percent by home pod which ain't bad considering home has been out for a while
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:19.080]   2 percent by the sonos one
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.680]   And everything else
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:26.840]   So it's particularly it's particularly impressive given that google the google home wedge also includes the 29 dollar
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:34.040]   Google google as google mini which was practically given away to everybody who bought a book of stamps in december
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:40.120]   So that's a pretty good result for apple. I think a lot of people probably waiting till syria gets more capable till they have stereo pairing till they
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.960]   Also, I mean multi-room sound it was said
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:48.200]   It was said better by analysts who are not me but you know the way that these things are reported are very convoluted
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:52.680]   And I remember back with the ipad it's like the ipad is doing well, but we're not going to include it in the pc thing
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:56.120]   We're not going to include it in the tablet name when I make a new category called media tablets
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.680]   And like this thing too is like when apple
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:03.480]   It's it's natural to assume that this is a home speaker and that's a perfectly valid thing to do it
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:08.280]   But you when you put it in a category with a 50 dollar amazon echo or a 29 dollar google home
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.760]   It's a very different product than those things
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:16.520]   This is a speaker that happens to have syria control and was always conceptualized and thought about as a speaker that
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:22.760]   The only way that makes sense to control it is with syria, which is a very different product than companies who wanted to make a voice controlled
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.880]   Assistant for your house that also happens to be a speaker because you have to have a speaker to respond
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.520]   And you can argue that apple made the wrong product that you know
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.760]   Nobody really wants a high-end speaker that happens to be voice controlled and that's totally fair
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:39.480]   But it was designed from the start and they've been working on this for six years long before there was an echo
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.800]   Long before there was a home
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:46.600]   But on this product and it is it is different in kind from these other things and I think that's part of
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:51.480]   There's a little various ways you can slice this I forget who it was maybe Neil cyber somebody else said it may
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.880]   Is Benedict Evans maybe there's only a market
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:58.360]   For 50 dollar like people don't want to spend more than 50 dollars on a home assistant
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:02.440]   And that's the ceiling and we don't know any of this stuff yet because it's only been out for a few months
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:06.200]   Yeah
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:09.560]   I can I can kind of understand
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.360]   If
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:21.080]   Sales are slow now and I think that apples patient so yes, it makes sense. I mean it is now a fairly limited product
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.080]   There's a lot of competition
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:27.720]   I you know you can rave about the sound as many have but
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.240]   Honestly, it's not so much better than anything else that's out there that
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:35.560]   It's the kind of thing you beat a path to its door. I think in fact many blind
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:40.120]   Tests have said the google home max, which is a little more expensive might even sound as good or better
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.160]   So
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:46.200]   The difference is there's a horse that max is aimed at you in the home is yes the home pod goes all around yeah
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:50.200]   There's there's a another difference is that there's a there are a lot more
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:55.480]   Receptors for microphones. It's a lot easier to for it to find you and isolate you when you give it a command
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:01.400]   uh compared to the google home, but with every my with every apple product the thing is apple products
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.040]   For the most part are only competing against
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:10.520]   Other apple products, right? It's hard to say that the apple watch is competing directly with android wear or fitness watch
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:15.000]   It's hard to say that the apple tv is competing directly to with a roku
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.840]   because the people who are likely to buy it or the people who are likely to
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.000]   appreciate
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.600]   a connectivity to apple music or whatever apple service that they're already using
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.200]   Here or there others a google home speaker and a
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:36.520]   Alexa speaker those are people where they have the opportunity to buy whatever they want and they can price comparison
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:40.680]   They can go for I like the I think the voice is friendlier on this one instead of the other one
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:47.240]   So they there's the I believe that the home pod line is in profit. So I think that's that's all
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:50.360]   You don't need this
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:56.440]   No, and I think as what Annie said earlier is very apt too is that apple has what they call like stool
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:02.440]   Legs on their stool, which is like iphone and ipad and mac but they also have these products that support those things like apple tv
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:06.360]   It may eventually be one. It's it's still most an accessory air pods or an accessory
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:12.040]   These are things where when you have a product the size of the iphone and it's very hard to get another two billion customers on it
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:16.920]   That you create products that increase the value of that product both for you and for the customer
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:23.000]   So if you have an iphone you can get air pods you can get home pods and it makes that iphone experience better and in my exchange
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.320]   They give you slightly more money than they would have given you if they if you just had an iphone on the market
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.960]   Patterson and our chatroom
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:32.280]   Characterizes it as a placeholder
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:39.880]   Is that is that fair to say it's a placeholder? It's a gen one. I mean yeah iphone gen one wasn't great ipad gen one wasn't great apple
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:45.080]   Watch gen one wasn't they were all limited but you know and apple watch didn't even have a good vision at first and now
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.560]   It's a stellar product. So I mean it's so early right
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.280]   It's also I mean the other guys are advertising directly against the home pod
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:58.920]   I think it was so no sad that said and these are all the services you can use with us and apple's home pod basically is an apple music
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.920]   Device so that's it's it's limited
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:05.720]   By that alone really I mean, you know, you're not gonna buy it unless you're an apple music subscriber
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:09.560]   Not that there aren't 30 million of those but you know
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:16.760]   Yeah, but not not all of them are in the position of not all of them understand the idea of I want to spend as much as 350
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:22.360]   On a grapefruit sized speaker that is in one room. My kids are apple music subscribers
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.480]   There's no way they would buy a home pod. Yeah, it's it's gonna be more
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:31.240]   It's gonna be more interesting to look at these numbers a year from now when they add features like multi room when they add support when they
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:37.080]   Turn on a bluetooth or they do some way to make it do more than what it did out of the box on day one
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:41.720]   Uh, and I'm I mean I'm going through that right now with my google home stuff where
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:47.480]   As soon as I as soon as I realize it when I see a sale on like the regular google home
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:51.000]   I realize that oh well it'd be nice to like extend like the multi room reach
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.520]   I'm when i'm doing just things that are going to be taking me throughout the entire house
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:46:00.920]   It's nice to be able to have this podcast going everywhere at once or this music going everywhere at once and then you like the
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.480]   it sort of justifies the
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:08.600]   And leverages the expense of the $400 speaker later on or the second $400 speaker later on
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.880]   I'm whereas it took me a while to add my second
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.680]   uh, amazon echo because
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:19.160]   When it when it first came out it just did this one thing it wasn't ubiquitous
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:26.360]   So apple is still it's just like it is just like the apple watch in that apple realizes that they if they get the hardware
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:29.800]   Right, they can always build software and services later on
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:37.240]   Uh, just like my my original apple watch which was a very very I think a very very sad and not well thought out
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:42.280]   uh product when it first released all they had to do was a couple of years later figure out that okay
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:47.960]   Let's stop the demo of opening a garage door and watching the video of your garage door opening on your watch
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:52.280]   Let's let's leverage this as a fitness device a fitness device a fitness device
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.360]   And so the hardware was still the hardware was still very very good. I still have the generation watch
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:00.600]   And now it is just like I paid $200 for a brand new thing
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.840]   That's the same thing. I think it's going to happen with home pot
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:07.240]   That's when people are really going to come forward. Yeah, there other way. It's like the apple watch at least it for me
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:13.160]   It was the once apple watch had a killer app that I really wanted that mate put it over the top and you know
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:17.640]   We for the watch it was drafts and uh, yeah
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:21.960]   Uh, I just found out I didn't even know this that drafts and I had turned this on
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.640]   But I didn't really realize it drafts will look at apple reminders
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:29.320]   And if there's a drafts list on apple reminders, it'll import into drafts
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.480]   Which means I can now use my home pod
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:35.640]   To remind me or to do things or to to add to my drafts
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:40.760]   Which makes it actually like a hundred times more useful because I can say schlomo
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:45.400]   Uh remind me to buy tooth add buy toothpaste to my
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.720]   Drafts list
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:52.280]   And when it does that it will automatically import into drafts and now I can put it in places that I really care about
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:56.840]   So that's huge. So it's little things like that that can put you over the top with something
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.840]   Um speaking of
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:03.320]   Now what he said now has has he told you when he's going to put out drafts five?
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:08.280]   I pre-ordered immediately of course. I can't comment. I can only confirm nor deny that I know the date
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.320]   But oh I can't confirm that it's awesome
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:17.880]   Uh, we're talking about agile tortoise is really great app that I discovered from rene's vector podcast with mr
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.880]   Lin man and what's what's the guy who wrote it? What's his?
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:23.240]   Oh, yeah, greg pierce greg pierce. That's it
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:25.160]   Um, and I heard greg and mr
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:31.160]   And rene talking about it and I immediately use it and it's it's kind of a weird app that just like is so hideously useful
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:35.800]   That but you have to figure it out first and I guess what he's going to do
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:40.440]   This is currently fourth generation and he's going to keep this one going but he's now going to have a
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.720]   subscription based fifth generation that will do
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.480]   I don't know more stuff. I don't care. I'm giving him my money
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:52.440]   Um, and then he hinted and you probably know the answer to this too
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:58.760]   That one of the things he's going to do with his subscription money is make a mac app mac os app
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:06.920]   Which is all that's missing frankly from drafts is the ability to use mac os and i'm very interested in drafts five's new
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:08.280]   um
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:13.320]   Programming capabilities because you can I guess it has more ability to create your own actions and things like that
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:17.960]   Just drafts everywhere and do everything. I think is the model for days avoiding any
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:23.480]   I'd be a terrible guy to get somebody to leak. I need to buy you a drink rene
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:27.480]   We'll talk later. That's not mine. I mean, I haven't tell you anything that's about me
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.480]   No, you're absolutely right. Absolutely. You know, you know, rene
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:37.560]   My my wife has a condo in the san francisco area that she usually rents it out for just $50 a night
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:40.840]   Anytime that you're in san francisco rather than it's a it's a
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.160]   It's a range
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:46.680]   We could arrange you could be staying in my hotel every time you come to watch
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.800]   I'm not going to be showing up in any jimmy kimmel model logan anytime soon
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:52.520]   Anyway, uh
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:57.640]   Absolutely worth getting drafts for but keep your eye peeled because dr- I pre-ordered immediately drafts five is coming out
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:02.520]   At some point must be fairly soon or he wouldn't have a pre-order up on the the apple store
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:07.960]   And that is a very very useful thing with your home pod and everything else. I the fact that I can now
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.480]   Dictate
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:13.960]   Remind not just it's hard to explain what you do with drafts, but you bay it captures text
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.280]   And uh, you can do it with your keyboard
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:19.160]   But I've always used the voice stuff and especially on the apple watch
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.120]   I have a drafts complication on the watch and I can just say hey
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:22.840]   I told rene
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.920]   I was gonna give him something don't don't let me forget
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:30.280]   And then that at the end of the day I could process all of those into varieties of different things
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.400]   Uh, the fact that I can now do that to my home pod
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.960]   is huge
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:40.840]   That's huge speaking of features that put it over the top audible a sponsor
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.720]   Now works with sonos
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:47.720]   Now they did for a while and they took that feature as been missing for a couple of years
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.960]   But I can now when i'm on my audible app
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:54.520]   Send it to my sonos, which means I can have my book reading to me everywhere in the house
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.200]   And sonos itself ties into your audible account
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.040]   Hallelujah
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:03.000]   Hallelujah, I was listening to ready player one
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.080]   Really loud throughout the entire house yesterday
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.880]   Driving everybody crazy
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:14.120]   Another sponsor i'll mention texture, which is the magazine subscription service
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:18.840]   That apple purchased apple is now starting to make some moves according to german
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:22.040]   I didn't know this but he says that they fired about 20
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:27.960]   People from the texture staff soon after the acquisition and the plan is to launch a news
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:31.560]   subscription service again. This is a a german
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:36.440]   leak or rumor not necessarily anything announced by apple
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:41.000]   Kind of underscores apples
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.920]   Clear
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:48.200]   Goal now to be a content company, which is fairly new for it. I think q did say that like right away
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:55.160]   When you announced it at south by south west he said we acquired texture and then the interviewer said you're going to integrate this into apple news and eddie
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:55.880]   Just said yeah
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:52:01.240]   Is like and I never knew for sure if that's what they were really going to do or just the phrasing of the question was awkward and apples
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:03.400]   Like we haven't made any firm decisions yet
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.800]   But it sounds like that was the plan all along and again
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:11.720]   It's one of those things where you've you've got a market that's so mature with iphone and so mature with mac and ipad
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.040]   What can you do to add value to those devices?
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:18.600]   But also increase the amount of money that you can take from every customer because there's very few customers left
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:25.240]   And apple music is one of those things nine dollars and i'm ten dollars a month and you get unlimited access to music for ten dollars a month
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:30.040]   You can get unlimited access to magazines and we I got one from my mom over the holidays and she loves it
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:34.200]   She didn't think she would like it at all and she loves it and i've been using it and it's great
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.760]   And it's one of those things where people
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:41.000]   It's the same steve jobs thing where if you make the song cheap enough and easy enough to get people don't even bother
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.800]   Looking on the web for the free version or trying to pirate it
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.360]   And yeah, you can get a lot of this stuff like if you want to go to youtube
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:50.280]   You can get the music or if you want to scour the internet and go from site to site and wait a while
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:51.240]   You can get all the articles
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:55.640]   But just having them there all the time immediately accessible is such a great service that I think
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:59.960]   There's a percentage of people that'll pay for it and that further bolsters apple subscription business
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:08.120]   Yeah, they currently texture is 999 a month, which is I think a good price for 200 magazines 200 plus magazines
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:11.320]   But apple could say hey, we'll make it actually
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:16.680]   They didn't lower the cost of beats when they turned it in apple music. Did they it was still the same price
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:20.120]   I think they tend to hold price and increase value
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:24.280]   So for example, they could fold all the original apple tv and movie programming into apple music
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.920]   Which makes it more valuable, but keep the same price
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:29.720]   And maybe they could get newspapers interested in the texture business
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.920]   And then I started offering some newspapers as well and that creates it more valuable
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.680]   That seems more likely doesn't it? Yeah
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:38.680]   It definitely reflects the reality that it's hard for it's hard to
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:43.400]   convince consumers that your piece of software your piece of hardware is
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:49.160]   Uniquely better than lots of other products that are out there and even apple is bumping our heads against this problem
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:53.880]   They could say if you could only see the side of the fence that you can't see how nicely we painted it
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:55.720]   But unfortunately you can't see it
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:59.000]   It's so it comes down to what things that are very very user
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.160]   User facing can you add that gives value that they can really perceive?
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:08.200]   So if it really is as simple as hey, guess what apple music will also can also includes
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:15.800]   magazine subscriptions or apple news also includes all this content from all these other places that you can't get anywhere else because we're the people who are smart enough
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.120]   To buy that service before anybody else
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.920]   and it's I hope it's not a foreshadowing of
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:26.440]   the need now to maintain subscriptions on three or four different music libraries because
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:31.800]   If apple if apple were to do something as as smart as buying sony music
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.480]   Just to have just to control who gets access to the sony music catalog
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:41.880]   And other companies were to do similar things to restrict access to company property they own
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:45.960]   We could be back in that horrible place where remember when the iTunes first started
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:50.760]   And you don't know has this band signed on has this music record label signed on
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:53.800]   What do I have to subscribe to in order to get access to this album
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:56.040]   title
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.040]   Yeah
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:02.520]   Up up he updated his website drafts coming april 18th
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.240]   Okay, good
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:10.600]   Wow, I wonder if he was listening
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:16.680]   If I could post this before relay breaks down under leo's intense questioning
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:21.560]   To Andy's point though like I pay for iCloud data story subscription. I pay for
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:25.400]   Apple music subscription. I do pay for texture and i'll be paying for that later
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:31.400]   I want an apple prime or an apple unlimited where I could pay a certain amount and just get everything at this point because it's
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:36.920]   You know that's up after a while. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I really I really do have to audit like
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:42.920]   I'll do it through checking out what I've what I've authorized auto pay for and their times where I realize that okay
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:49.720]   So I am essentially paying for 21 terabytes of monthly storage from eight different services because I keep forgetting that
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:56.120]   This is this works well with this service but can work with dropbox or can work with google drive. Yeah, it's it's
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:59.080]   Even
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:01.560]   People someone was asking me about like court cutting
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:05.160]   And say well, how about how about youtube tv?
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.200]   And i'm saying things I have to tell them that well
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:15.160]   It's nice, but now instead of spending like 30 to 50 dollars a month to your cable company you're spending 40 dollars a month to google
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:19.720]   For again for lots of channels that maybe you don't really have an interest in
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:27.640]   It's they find they find a way to make sure that never becomes more convenient and it never becomes less expensive. It just becomes more complicated
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:30.280]   uh
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:39.160]   Let's see. This is the bad news. I was talking about there is a box from a company called gray shift called gray key
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:46.280]   That is designed to unlock iphones and apparently law enforcement just
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:49.080]   loves the gray key
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.400]   motherboard has the story
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:54.360]   it is a relatively cheap tool
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.440]   it is
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:00.360]   Something that they have to have the iphone and plug it into
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:04.840]   According to
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:10.360]   motherboard it works with iOS 11 on an iphone 10 and that's a little bit of a shocker
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:16.920]   We've know there have been backdoors and older versions of iOS, but this is the current iphone
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:21.080]   Secret service is planning to buy at least half a dozen gray key phones
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:29.080]   uh phone boxes to unlock iphones state department has bought drug enforcement and administration interested the fbi
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:37.800]   Interested many local police forces like the maryland state police the indiana state police the indianapolis metropolent police deportant department
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:42.600]   Um actually the indianapolis metro has received quotes
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:47.080]   From gray shift, but not yet bought the gray key according to mother board
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:50.920]   Uh, it's a four by three inches box
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.920]   And that thing is a paperweight. Yeah, right
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:55.960]   Uh, it's not cheap $15,000
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:01.480]   Uh, if you want one that has that is uh gives you 300 unlocks
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:07.960]   Uh, and it has an online connection or if you're willing to pay twice as much 30 000 you can get the unlimited
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:11.000]   Friggy
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:16.280]   Uh, imagine everyone's using the freeware models like you want the good stuff. Yeah, yeah
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:20.280]   Now you see matthew greens tweet leo know what he say
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:26.280]   Uh, this is his estimate of how fast it is for digit passcode 13 minutes worst average
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:31.880]   Uh six minutes six digit passcode 22 hours worst average 11 hours eight digit passcode
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:38.680]   92 days worst 46 days average 10 digit nine a thousand days worst about 5000 days on average
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:45.400]   Sorry 10 000 days worst about 5000 days on average. That's why i have a 17 character
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:52.440]   Passphrase on my iphone now. So it's a yeah, we believe it's a brute force device that it doesn't have any secret backdoor
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:57.560]   It just brute forces somehow stopping the step from counting the amount of times that it's done in forcing the delays
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:01.480]   And then doing the deletion after 10 attempts right?
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:07.800]   Right. Yeah, see that this is this is why i'm with renead like it's the the success of this box is
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:12.440]   predicated on apples inability to raise 15 000 to buy one of their own
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:21.320]   And as soon as they see how it works phone, it just stops working and even so there is no magic c cam astronomy
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:26.840]   Back door password to unlock a phone. It really is has it really has to be one of these brute force things
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:35.320]   And that's easily negated by someone being being very willing to inconvenience themselves once every two days by typing in a 12 digit password
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:36.520]   Yeah
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:40.120]   Yeah, so if you're really worried about this have a longer password
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:44.760]   Um, I have a 17 alpha numeric that's a pain in the butt
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:50.040]   But fortunately, I don't have to use it very often thanks to face face id
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:53.160]   and uh, and I that what did he say?
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:56.680]   That would be a long time to brute force. Yeah
[00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:01.080]   Was the entropy level of the universe a long time
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:05.640]   In fact, you know, you might make the case that this gray key thing is really hype
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:09.960]   That's taking the money out of law enforcement's pockets more than the other thing is
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:14.440]   I mean like you can you can contest the legality of those kinds of brute force attacks
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:20.120]   But all the ability for law enforcement to put your finger on a device out in the field or to hold it up. I mean
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:25.800]   There are lots of ways to get into a device and this this is just one of several that should concern us
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:32.360]   Yeah, it's also makes underscores why it's important to understand things like the difference between an officer saying
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.280]   I need to see your phone
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:39.480]   And I order you to give me your phone because that's it's a change of length if they say I need to see your phone
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.480]   That is you're you're thinking that they're saying because you are required at this
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:46.360]   If this juncture to give it to me and I can arrest you if you don't
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.480]   Whereas from their point of view is if when they hand it to you
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.920]   They they've just ticked off the box where the suspect
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.080]   volunteered his phone
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.680]   When I was at when I asked to examine it
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:01.640]   You don't know that he's going to take it back to the car plug it into a box or give it back to you in a day or two
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:06.680]   But that could be what happens. It's something we're all going to have to be very very aware of that's that's that's why
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:10.120]   I'm like you Leo that last year I switched from
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:16.760]   Swipe passwords and like four to six digit passwords to now alpha numerics that are very long
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:21.320]   Uh that again are pain in the but when I unexpectedly
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.560]   When i'm like at the grocery checkout and I don't know why my phone wants
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:32.520]   I think i'm just going to trap my phone on the on the key on the pad and then be paying instead of having to type in like this long
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:38.280]   Long long password, but that's way way that's that's going to pay back whenever I feel as though
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:44.520]   Someone has my phone who should not and they feel as though they're gonna they're not going to try to figure out
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:49.960]   17 months to crack this password. I showed it. I brought to you by fresh books
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:55.160]   Uh boy was at a revelation when I found fresh books some years ago now
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.040]   By the way since I started using it in 2004
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:01.320]   10 million people use fresh books to send invoices
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:05.000]   To track time to capture expenses really it is
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.240]   Essentially easy to use cloud accounting software for small business owners fresh books
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:16.840]   Starts by making it easy for you to make invoices you'll get paid faster effective on average twice as fast because those invoices
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:22.600]   Mean you can accept credit cards. You don't have to apply for a merchant account. That's all part of the fresh books deal
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:28.040]   You can accept credit card payments directly from your invoice see which invoices have been sent viewed and paid
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.440]   See which invoices are overdue
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.680]   Outstanding invoice totals
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:38.360]   That means you will always know what your accounts receivable what your accounts payable are because you can use the quickbooks app
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:44.040]   To take pictures of receipts and get expenses into your invoices or just track them. You'll always know what your expenses are
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.280]   Let me think here
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:51.400]   Income minus expenses equals profit. You'll always know whether you're making money with fresh books
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:56.280]   That's huge for small businesses often it's not until tax time that we know did we do okay
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:03.560]   They're always improving fresh books too. They've added proposals which means you can make a proposal to a new client with rich text content images
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:07.880]   Customizable sections you can build for time and they keep track of hours
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:12.040]   Then you can build for time by client, but even have different prices for different projects
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:18.840]   Fresh books recently added Spanish Dutch German and Portuguese as options for invoices estimates and proposals
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:24.920]   And the invoices have always handled every kind of currency seamlessly. I really liked that because I was invoicing Canada
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.560]   And I needed to put it in Canadian dollars
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:33.720]   Fresh books new features include team member rates, which can now be managed from the my team page
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.720]   So you can charge different amounts for different staff
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.440]   add new team members is
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:44.360]   In different roles like business partner or basic employee or contractor, which gives them different permissions. That's nice
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:51.720]   From payment reminders to late fees you can automate as much or as little as you'd like and get back to doing what you love don't waste time
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:55.080]   sending out invoices
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:04:00.440]   Get paid faster with fresh books fresh books is free for 30 days when you go to fresh books dot com slash mac break
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:06.760]   And enter mac break weekly in the how did you hear about a section a nice bunch of guys from Canada and guys and gals
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:11.080]   I like them fresh books dot com slash mac break. They save my life
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.160]   honestly
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:17.480]   Let them save yours fresh books dot com slash mac break to try it free for 30 days
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:24.120]   Duncan sinfeld who is one of the guys who flies drones over apple park makes those great 4k drone videos
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.800]   says yeah, I think apple is tightening up
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:35.720]   He says there he believes they're using a product like d drone, which is a drone tracking platform
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.040]   he says
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:42.600]   It literally within 10 minutes of me launching a drone from anywhere around apple park
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.240]   two white preuses
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:47.880]   Respond to my precise takeoff location
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:53.240]   While this is speculation my instincts tell me apples tracking all drones in the vicinity of the campus
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.520]   was sophisticated radio frequency technology
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:02.120]   And of course it would make sense that is as tim and and the rest move in
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:05.880]   They get the ip guess that they are going to want to have better security
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:10.440]   They they it's interesting that apple didn't stop them from doing over flights during construction
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.440]   But it would make sense that they would now
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:15.240]   Start to do that so
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:18.280]   Yeah
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:23.560]   Probably because they didn't have anything to protect back then probably also because they didn't have this really set up first
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:29.480]   Uh, there that's it's a growth industry disabling drones from remotely
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:34.760]   Uh, and it's interesting that they have the they have the solution that involves sending people out in preuses
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:38.680]   Because there are other solutions that basically jams the signal whatsoever
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:44.920]   Putting the drone into either i'm just going to stay here and wait for further instructions mode or i'm going to go back to base mode
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:49.000]   Uh everybody's covering james comies new book
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:54.200]   Higher loyalty and yes he talks about apple and other tech companies
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:58.440]   In the book i i don't know why msnbc's not reporting this
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:02.040]   Uh
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:17.640]   Um combi writes in the book
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.680]   Yoke with the fbi going dark team assigned to seek solutions
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:27.000]   Of course silicon valley types don't see the darkness they live where it's sunny all the time and everybody is rich and smart
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.040]   He's right about the smart part. Yeah
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:34.920]   Okay, uh, he also said
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:41.880]   Uh actually no, this is uh, uh, this is actually old stuff. This is not in the book
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.520]   But that part was in the book, uh higher loyalty
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:51.560]   And, um, so he does write about the encryption thing and and and once again beats the drum for some sort of backdoor for
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:55.480]   Law enforcement and i think that that battle will rage on
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:01.160]   No doubt at all iMovie for iphone 10 has been upgraded to use metal
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:05.880]   Yeah, and it finally fits the iphone 10 finally
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.760]   Okay, no notch, huh?
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:14.360]   No, i mean like before it would just letterbox that and now that it's actually adapted for it is not it's still not great because it has a
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:17.960]   Not safe area and then not like there's something you have to deal with you know
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:21.960]   It's always there in your periphery, um, but the metal thing is great because it's better performance
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:27.320]   I don't mind the notch anymore. It's just part of the overall issue, which is the iphone 10 screen just isn't that big
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:31.080]   Compared to other iphones and i look forward to seeing what they do at the end of the year
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:36.920]   Uh, no the funnest part about the notch now is watching like the android community deal with phone after phone being announced with it
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:41.320]   Like the lg1 today. Oh, look the wallpaper is dark, but if we lighten the wallpaper you can see there's a notch
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.440]   Well, the really upset big upset as in the android community is that apparently sam sung has
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:54.440]   Uh taken some patents showing new screens with notches and of course sam sung and zte has two notches one on the top and one on the bottom
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.600]   It's it's watch escalation now leo
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.720]   Like one notch is not enough. It's not your fault
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:02.680]   Not your fault
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:05.880]   Not your friday
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:11.160]   apple will repair your swollen apple watch series two battery for free wall duh
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:16.840]   Swollen batteries are bad. Nice. Yes or it explodes on your it starts a fire on your wrist
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:22.760]   Even if it's out of war anything happening with apple watch one sure, uh, sorry the original anytime a battery swells
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:27.240]   It's risky, but it could explode. So yeah, if you're wearing an interest, it's even more important
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:31.480]   They fix it and to be fair of risk is a you're always passionate against things
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.600]   It's not a it's it doesn't stay in a pocket. It stays exposed
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:40.920]   So I could that's not a big fault as long as they're installing their acknowledge that it's not the user's problem
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.320]   it's their problem a hint a hint in the uh
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:48.200]   apple source code
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:55.080]   The code found in watch os 4.3 point one hinting at third party watch face compatibility
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:09:04.280]   Well, that would be nice if you click through they sort of so that's giermo rambo gee rambo from nine to five mac who found that and then steve
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:08.840]   trot and smith very very nicely tweeted backwing. I think that's been there for years. Oh
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.440]   It's a log message that he saw in trot and smith said, you know
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:15.720]   Yeah, this is that log message is not new
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.520]   So don't get too excited
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:24.120]   It's uh, you can see it you can see it right here in the in the in the code r3 equals quote
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:28.440]   This is where the third party face config bundle generation would happen and quote
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:32.280]   Except that it just needs to change it to actual code
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:38.280]   Yeah, all all is it all is in is that's where we'd put it if we ever had to put it, but we don't put it there right now
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:39.560]   so
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:45.160]   It's it's such an obvious feature for it to happen that it's it's impossible to imagine that they would put that in
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:51.080]   Even with no direct plan to actually make it happen. Yeah, if you're code if you're coding you're gonna put that stub there and just say hey
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:58.760]   You know, we'll I still think I still think they're worried about what happens to battery life once they allow unlimited unlimited watch design
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:03.960]   Uh watch face design. So I'm hoping that at some point just like just like apple
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:09.640]   After lots of bad press decided to make the user decide whether or not the cp
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.040]   You should throttle down when the battery is about to go
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:18.280]   Uh, it's I would love it if we had the opportunity to say, you know what? I I want this little kitty cat
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:23.560]   Shape watch face so much that i'm willing to deal with eight hours of battery life versus 10 or 12
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:26.520]   Uh because it's my watch and I like kitty cats
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:30.600]   As long as it's held wags back and forth
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:34.360]   It was interesting too is watching the reaction when the story came out and there were a bunch of people
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:39.720]   And just like how would apple deploy this and some were like oh god, please don't let it become like the android market or like the the
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:44.760]   I forget the the other watch market others were like, yeah, maybe they could have a curated boutique
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:46.360]   Maybe there could be templates
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:51.880]   Maybe they're like just what would it be completely open season on watch faces like get out your own gl and start writing
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:55.080]   Or would it be like you can have these constraints or would it be?
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:59.960]   Uh, well, sorry. You can't do lights like you you have to actually own hello kitty to make the elo kitty
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.960]   Apple released a little uh software tool a watch kit maker
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:11.160]   For xcode and and it would enforce its own rules. It would keep it, you know safe and battery life would be good
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.320]   And then that's how you would do it that would work
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:16.280]   God forbid we let you own the ip
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:22.040]   God forbid we let people be creative without rules that would be horrible
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.280]   Thank god
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:29.720]   That's the way to solve it let anybody let me design my own watch face. Yeah, I mean, it's it's absolutely true
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:34.440]   There are watch repositories not only people who write native watch apps for android
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:37.800]   But also there are like watch kits like apps that will
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:43.960]   It's easy you can sort of script a watch face as opposed to developing as an as a native app
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.880]   And then write it on this watch app platform
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.920]   And yeah, so many of them are just stupid and terrible and horrible
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:53.880]   But that is also makes room for people to make things that are awesome and unexpected and wonderful
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.760]   and like I said, you don't don't
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:03.720]   I don't think great ideas start with you know, the thing is I think creativity needs supervision
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:09.560]   It's they're like designers are like children if they don't have rules to go by why for heaven's sakes
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:14.120]   The next thing you'll have people splattering paint on canvas and calling that hard
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:17.880]   Andy, you're a good gatekeeper
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:22.360]   Well, they also have the option like they they've they let you do a photo now and you can see for a few
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:26.280]   In the future you can upload your own photo upload your own like choose which complications you want
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.720]   Maybe choose from a variety of
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.040]   And sort of let you don't even have to be developer anymore
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:35.000]   It's democratized to the point where any user can make their own watch face
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.920]   I you know, it's not a watch face
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:37.720]   It's not a
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:43.960]   I mean the watch faces are really interesting things like what if you have words that are spelling out and make really cool transitions
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:48.360]   And again, what if what if you have a kitty cat who and this it sounds like i'm making fun of it
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.080]   But this this is why we have multiple watches
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:54.440]   Sometimes you really like checking the time and as soon as you turn your wrist
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:58.360]   You see a kitty cat who's napping suddenly wake up and look look at you with a really really cute
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:02.280]   Express on their face while while looking while you look at the time you can't do this again
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.440]   It's nice
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:12.680]   Well, I know what you all be doing on sunday you overachievers you'll be exercising because apple watch has a new
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:18.360]   Earth day challenge 30 minutes 30 big minutes of exercise will get you the new
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.760]   Earth day badge how many badges do you have rene you keep getting badges?
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.800]   I don't know. I lost a ton of mine because I switched phones that my apple watch was on
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:32.120]   Well, no because apple watch in Canada only works on bell and my main phone is rogers
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.800]   And I was keeping a step like a phone just have the apple watch and where I just I couldn't
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:41.080]   Well because I wanted the LTE feature because I was testing it and I was doing things so I got a bell sim and I just ran it
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:45.720]   But it was never my main phone. So now I've now I've synchronized everything and I think I lost a lot of stuff
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.920]   You shouldn't lose your badges. They should be tied to your iCloud account
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:53.400]   It's so painful. Let's see. No, it was once once flexible ole
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:57.480]   I just like a thing you can actually like have a sash that has your bat
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:00.040]   Like a like in the girl's coach of the voice
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:03.240]   Wow, they're more colorful in Canada. Those are pretty
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:06.840]   Maybe I just haven't seen all the badges available. Those are beautiful
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:11.240]   What what a great idea. What are your metals mean soldier
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:16.760]   Uh, thanksgiving day challenge is one of them and what's some of the other ones?
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:21.640]   Just 30 minutes of exercise. I guess they don't want anybody to have a heart attack
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:27.160]   Some you have to do like a week you have to make your goals for a week the veterans day challenge was 11 minutes
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.560]   I guess because no van ver 11. Yeah
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:34.280]   International women's day challenge was doubling your move ring on march 8th. Oh, that's neat
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:39.000]   The ring in the new year was to close your rings for every day for a full week
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:46.600]   Well, uh sunday. Let me see. I don't know where i'm gonna be. Uh, I will be uh somewhere in japan on sunday
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:51.640]   Oh, i'll be in uh osaka. I'll make sure to turn on my watch uh walk monitor
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.760]   And i'll take a walk. I will be walking actually i'll be walking a lot
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:58.440]   Well account it does not count shincons in time leo so if you're on the bullet train
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:03.320]   You have to actually do your own luck. No, we're doing a walking tour of osaka on the earth day
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:10.040]   So that's pretty and it's supposed to be 80 degrees. So I will be i'll probably be racking up the miles about five miles
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.400]   What are you gonna be?
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:13.960]   What camera are you taking leo? I am really
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.960]   in a quandary in a conundrum
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:24.680]   Uh, which I hope I will resolve before I leave I have you know this beautiful camera that lisa gave me my soni
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.200]   A9
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.480]   And I uh, which doesn't have a huge metal lenses, but I have three really good
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.800]   lenses that I could take so that would be a kit, but it's heavy
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:39.160]   Every time I carry it I carry it on my hip and I get sciatica and i'm i'm such an old man
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.960]   So then I also have a very lightweight. I have it right here
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:49.080]   And I really like this. It's very lightweight. It's small. It doesn't it looks like a tourist camera, but it's a nice like a
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.600]   Q
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:52.600]   But it's but it's only
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.600]   28 millimeters doesn't zoom or anything
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.880]   Hmm, but it's it takes really lovely images
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:04.920]   But this I could carry you know, I would look like a tourist's like like dad with with his old brownie around his neck
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:08.920]   I'll have to tape over the red dot. That's kind of old apart sign new tourists
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:14.040]   And then i'm trying to decide well, do I really need a laptop because really everything I want to do I
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.440]   Have the dongle to import photos
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:19.480]   It'll import raw onto the ipad pro
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:24.360]   I've got light room on there, which means it'll back up because light room cc back up to the light room cloud
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.240]   So I'll have a backup. I can do the triage
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:34.200]   Really quickly on the ipad. I can even do photo editing that the later gets copied to my desktop and to light room in the raw
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:40.520]   So all in all it's a I could pretty much do everything I need to do photo photography wise with just an ipad
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.040]   Yeah, I'm so I'm so tempted and yet
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:49.320]   You know, they don't have computers in japan so if I I don't know
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:53.480]   You know, you got to take your iMac pro in the satchel
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:57.720]   Yeah, you've got to take a red camera at least one red camera
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:01.960]   You know what I did get though and because I was told you know, don't expect Wi-Fi everywhere
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:06.840]   I got one of these little skyrim lte devices $8 a day unlimited
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:09.800]   internet
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:12.360]   Vi lte for five different devices
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:15.880]   So we'll i'll have a report back on that
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:22.280]   I was a japan was like korea where I thought so too. I thought oh internet it's gonna be easy
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:27.640]   No, apparently it's pricey and most coffee shops don't do it and you know why because they have fast you'll finish internet
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:29.800]   They have such good lte
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:33.640]   Nobody needs Wi-Fi as my guess but I don't know
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:40.360]   I will find out this works in japan and we're gonna 140 so do you have to get an entity dot como sim or is it just roams for you
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:46.840]   Rome's 120 countries as is out of the box and that's it that's you just pick you
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:51.080]   Activate a day or charges you eight dollars a day to buy day passes
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:57.080]   So when I bought it, I bought 15 day passes for eight bucks and then more day passes. I think are nine dollars
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:02.760]   But you don't there's no subscription fee. So that's what I really need is something I don't pay for until I need it
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:07.080]   That's awesome by day and I need a little today. I need a look at that
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:11.320]   Yeah, actually I just did my pick of the week unfortunately. That's the sky rum soulless
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:17.560]   But at clock on it and where does a necklace? That's what I would do. Yeah like this. Oh, that's actually not a bad idea
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.120]   I'll look like a flavor flave
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.440]   Yes, totally
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:29.080]   Is it flavor flavored that weighs the giant clique? Yes. Oh absolutely a flavor flavor. My hip hop is not as good as it used to be
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.640]   Oh dear. Yeah
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:36.920]   It would it would I'll just pretend this is that a new american style
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:42.920]   The ball or their think you're you're under some sort of like a
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.760]   So
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:48.280]   Limited limited prison release. Oh that's that can work on your favorite too
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:52.120]   Let me just see if I could no I can't quite know
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.200]   I
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.920]   It's big because it's got a this the other thing I was looking for
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:00.520]   I had a my fight before but they died after six hours
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:03.800]   This gets 16 hours because that's why it's so big it's got a big battery
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:07.560]   You can even charge your phone if you need to but i'll just carry it my jacket pocket like that
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:10.200]   I just just getting your pierced dangle it up for that

[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:00.520]   Although it's not really fair to call this a pick of the week because I haven't used it
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:03.000]   Well, I used it for a little bit to set it up
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.680]   um
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:06.680]   But I will have a much better
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:12.200]   Appreciation of this after I get back from Japan. So I'll give you a teaser. We got a teaser. What do you got Renee?
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:17.400]   So, yeah, like I said before scratch my surface and you find more surface
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:24.280]   I am just this superficial they have you can get the space black versions of apple accessories now
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:29.560]   A la carte. Yes. I did you know I got the mouse in the keyboard with that my my Mac Pro
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:33.080]   So I don't have a gray trackpad so me too
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:36.360]   So I went out and I bought as soon as it came into stock
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:43.400]   And it is lovely and yes, it even comes with a space black lightning cable. I mean, oh you get the cable
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:49.240]   If you wait a minute, do you get the black apple logos stickers? I don't I don't think I didn't look
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:55.080]   Oh my god, you're nuts. That's the most valuable part of all. Oh, I know now. Oh, I feel like a complete noob now
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:58.280]   But I mean there's there's a there is a tax there's like 10 bucks more
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:01.400]   I was like a hundred bucks more Canadian that's not really true, but it feels like it
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:04.360]   But there is there is a there is like the same as the old black book tax
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:08.040]   Where you do pay it, but I have a black macbook pro and I have a black
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:11.720]   iMac pro and I really don't like apples mouses. I don't think
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:15.160]   Aside from the original lease. I don't think I've ever had a mouse from apple that I liked
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:21.560]   Um, and so I really prefer the track pads. It does all the gestures and you can actually use it while you're charging it
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:25.960]   Which is great. I kind of got used to it from the laptop and I do now
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:32.440]   Even when I'm a Mac pro. I want to be able to like the three fingers swipe to go to the next screen and stuff like that is really handy
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:35.720]   And I'm a designer. I use it for Photoshop. I use it for illustrator
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:38.600]   I use it for final cut. I use it for everything. I've never found anything that I really need
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:42.040]   Oh, oh my god. Where's my mouth never happened? So I'm super happy with it. Right?
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:43.640]   Right
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:49.160]   Also not a gamer. So if you're a gamer, maybe you think I'm full of you know nonsense, but for me it works really well super happy with it
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:52.200]   All right
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:54.760]   It's now out. How about you, Ani and Akko. What do you got?
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.200]   Uh
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:04.040]   This little it's this little to do sort of timer reminder for Mac OS that lands in the menu bar and the reason why I love it is that number one
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:09.880]   It's really really simple but be the interface for it. You just grab onto the icon for jesterner
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:14.200]   Oh look in the menu bar pull it down and the first thing you can talk or string
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:18.840]   Exactly and the longer the longer you pull it down is the longer the the reminder will go
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:22.920]   Then when you let it go you can type in a description if you want or if you do nothing
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:28.040]   I'll just simply time out after a few seconds and then you just get a reminder for an hour and 30 minutes
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:31.640]   Now we're 27 minutes whatever you can have multiple reminders going
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:36.360]   Uh, it's just such a cool interface and it's it's exactly for the reason
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:39.160]   It's it's so well tailored for how I use
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:43.480]   These sort of like timers and reminders where I don't want to like open up
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:46.120]   Oh, do a key sequence and open up a window
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:50.840]   All I want to know all I want to do is make sure I don't get so lost in writing
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.600]   That I forget that in an hour and 20 minutes. I need to leave for this thing
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:59.640]   I don't have just a window like what do you want to recur? Do you want this reminder to recur? Do you want?
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:02.600]   Where should I be also text you it's like no no no just
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:08.760]   A ding back pops up on my screen saying hey moron remember that you've got a dental appointment
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:14.200]   You've got to go and this such a simple analog way of setting that as four damn dollars
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.440]   I would have I would have given them five
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:21.960]   Just to thank just as a appreciation for this really cool user interface thing that is just so nifty
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:26.520]   It does one thing, but it does it so well. You just sort of really enjoy using it
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:33.720]   Now I just love that interface. That's exactly cool. It's it's almost like pull to pull to refresh
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:38.600]   Where it's like why did nobody ever think about this before because it is exactly the way that they should work
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:44.120]   And I guess I should do a second pick or at least a reminder pull my just timer. Thank you
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:46.600]   a reminder that
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.280]   Tomorrow you'll be able to get drafts five
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:56.360]   This actually what he's done is very smart because this drafts had a barrier to entry
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.920]   Which was you had to buy it. It was what it was at 10 bucks. It's not cheap
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:04.120]   And drafts five is free so you could try it for free and then he's going to have a subscription
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:08.360]   To drafts pro which will be two bucks a month or 20 dollars a year if you want the full
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:12.360]   Pro features lots of new features including seria integration
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:16.920]   So I don't have to use that seria reminders hack anymore. I could just go directly the serie
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:25.000]   We've talked about this ad infinitum. It's my favorite app for the iPhone and the apple watch
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.120]   If you haven't tried it and you were maybe saying well, I don't know if I'll like it because I don't and I don't want to have to buy it
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:33.080]   Now to start tomorrow you'll be able to get drafts five
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.720]   for free
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:39.800]   And see if you like it see if it's worth it drafts for apparently it's going to continue
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.640]   Uh, he just he I guess he wants to just have two versions. I'm not sure
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:51.000]   Uh, it's still be supported and available. I guess because people bought it and so he feels obligated to uh just continue to support it since you
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.080]   Spent money to buy it, but it is the I don't mind giving him all my money
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.600]   he's
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.680]   He deserves it agile tortoise is
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:06.040]   Has made a crazy useful app and what I like about is it helps me keep my promises basically
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.440]   I feel like everything I agree to do
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:13.400]   I just do it by putting it into drafts. So that way I just remember that I said, oh, yeah
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:17.640]   I said I do that I said I do that and like it's not just to do is just everything and that way you really can
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:19.800]   Kind of you know
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:22.360]   Get your integrity up in your life. I like it a lot
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.800]   And not to pretend i'm georgia down at all
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.760]   But the minute you put something you take it out of your brain and you put it down
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:29.160]   You know that you've written it down all your anxiety goes away
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.920]   It's like you don't have to keep it in cash anymore
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:34.440]   You've written it to the system and you can just relax because you know it's there and safe
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:39.880]   It's it's really for the gtt you could do the gtd methodology and it's that in box
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:43.400]   That you just dump everything into and you always have it. I really like it
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.080]   39
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.560]   Expensive for drafts for 399 boy
