[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.000]   No, it's no longer be camp. It's always gonna be known as chris hatfields, Canada
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.880]   We were watching before the show began. We were watching commander hatfield who was of course
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.760]   on the iss and really did a lot of good for
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.640]   Space and for canada. I mean he was just great up there did it in fact he even did his version of ground control to me
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.640]   It was awesome up in the iss
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.240]   Yes, that is the way to me. He and his brother have made a new video for Canada
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.240]   They made it for Canada day about three weeks ago
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.680]   And we were just watching it before the show and all getting teary eyed
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.480]   Planet
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.840]   Alex and I used to go up there a lot once a month. I yeah, I did a week every month doing well five days every month doing
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.880]   Then I came up on Thursday. You'd come up friday and then i'll be with the show. I was hanging out on saturday
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.160]   Wonder around for a while or something. I should come back. Hey, I really enjoyed that
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.760]   I might didn't enjoy all the all the travel, but I enjoyed it. Hey, there's Andy and not co
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.960]   Of the uh, cicago suntimes and the celestial ways to ban with and behind him the young
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.840]   Monty Python
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.520]   Yeah, I was looking if I was looking for it
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.880]   I was grumbling before the show because there's I seem to have a computer-shaped object next to me
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.000]   It's an art installation meant to comment on the futility of comp computing in general
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.920]   Uh, leavenly craft is like a jeffrey coons piece where they've got every single contour of a balloon animal only
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.000]   It's not actually a balloon animal as I as I find out when I try to actually make it do something that a mac book would do
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.640]   Uh, and so instead of getting the picture that I wanted put up there
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.760]   It started it all it did was curse for a while and say, okay. Here's a python picture
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.560]   What did you want up there something that you you you shot yourself?
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.280]   No, there's there was a there was a uh
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.080]   They they released a bunch of like press new press photos for their for the o2 tour
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.480]   And a bunch of them are just you just see
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.120]   you just see this group photo of these men in their early 70s looking like
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.280]   that
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.880]   grandpa that
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.600]   The kids love but that their parents will never ever let them stay overnight or more than a weekend with because if they
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.400]   They'll come back making messes of the walls and telling stories about how oh grandpa
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.480]   Like I told him how much I like bears and so we went into the zoo and climbed all over the enclosure
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.960]   Oh, yeah, that's what I was looking at
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.600]   So just people who like have lived good lives and allowed them to be 71 year old very very fun man
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:21.920]   Uh, I we're here to talk to apple, but of course the big story of the day will happen this afternoon in about two hours
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.000]   uh apple's a
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.400]   Third quarter results. We're gonna find out how how well the printing presses. We're working. Yeah
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.440]   Well, the third quarter is not the most important quarter. No, it's not the least important quarter
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.640]   It's kind of in the middle right? Yeah, you know, it's up there with a second
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.920]   But not as important as the fourth there's no new products and no holiday quarter right in this one
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.880]   Predictions and analysts seem to think it'll be still a good quarter course
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.360]   This is the first time the new apple cfo will be presumably leading the the analyst call
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.800]   Look at my history. Is that how you say I didn't say his name because I didn't know
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.920]   Luca I could do but it's my history. I think it's my history nice Italian boy
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.560]   uh
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.560]   and uh and he uh he
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.560]   Uh presumed tim cook will join him and we'll be listening very carefully to see what luka and tim in you know kind of intat
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.080]   For the fourth quarter because that's really waiting for jean munster's television question. I every time I can't wait
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.320]   What does he what like what does he ask?
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.000]   Yes, and just ask he asked the same question almost every time and with but with a new you know
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.560]   New variation and it's just interesting to watch how fast tim cook can slap that ball back at him
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.040]   Come a thing
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:38.880]   Uh, uh, the thing they'll be listening for is tim cook who will say we've got some wonderfully exciting new categories new categories new categories
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.200]   I think he's close to being able to just say new categories now, but
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.680]   um
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.680]   Will they they're not gonna?
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.400]   veteran apple watchers. Let me ask you are they gonna say anything important
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.480]   Do
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.800]   I mean the most that will happen is next one they might say when o s 10 is coming out or something
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.200]   No, the next was that once in a while not this one. No this one not almost never do they say anything
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.000]   This is the fun of android a little bit, but that's about the pile. Yeah, they little toxic else too
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.600]   Uh, let's just with bread
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.600]   actually and
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.760]   Globally android is kicking apples, but
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.160]   I don't know if i'm really market share market share if market shares your metric
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.640]   Yeah, right and it's it you could almost say that android is a totally different product than ios is
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.080]   So it's hard to really compare apples to apple star oranges that way
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.280]   And in the us, uh, I think uh iphone is still at least half the market if not, yeah
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.880]   There see when we talk about down earnings and the
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.320]   That third quarter is a not a verter round of every quarter
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.920]   You mean that
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.040]   To get the money from where they're making it to where they need to put it
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:49.200]   They don't need to call their employees and say does anybody know somebody who has a pickup truck because we don't have enough cargo capacity
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.800]   It means that they can actually just lease the tractor trailers. They normally lease and do that
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.200]   So that's what we're talking about in terms of profitability
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:01.360]   I suppose they'll spend some time talking about the enterprise story and the the fact that they're teaming with uh, ibm to create
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.920]   Uh mobile apps for ios
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.280]   Yeah, but of course it will always it will always be here's how this is going here's how we're
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.040]   We're gonna expect the next quarter to go or the next the rest of the year to go
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.920]   Also given that as we've as we're saying there's not been a big product rollout or a big
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:22.080]   Ball drop for uh, though that will take anything up. There's plenty of dead air in there to say that yes
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.200]   We're good where maybe down 2 percent from last year. We're up only two only 2 percent from last year
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.280]   But we also anticipate that with our new strategic partnership with a with ibm that blah blah blah
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.400]   So this is it's every when you look i've been reading rereading transcripts to sort of refresh myself
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.240]   Uh, and yeah, they almost never say anything that has anything other than to do with here is how much money
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.560]   We're making here's how much money we expect to make next year
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.120]   And here's why we didn't make as much money in a certain category
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.840]   Why why you here is anticipating why you're gonna ask us why we didn't make as much money on ipad
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.200]   This quarter as we did the same quarter of last year. So very very boring. Yeah, the only thing i'm really interested in to see is
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.960]   how if the amount of glee in
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:06.800]   Tim coke's voice will come through when he does mention we anticipate an
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.440]   Exciting new product category in the fall
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.640]   Uh, because that's something that they could mention but you wouldn't hear them saying he details a question
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.440]   Of course, but sometimes it's something about the tone of their voice and how they put it that you say oh
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.400]   They've got the five they've got a final hardware and there's a
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.920]   Is there an interesting tan line on tim's wrist that doesn't match the shape of any known walker business band?
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:36.080]   That's that's all i'm looking forward to somebody adventure beat got drunk and wrote an article saying that maybe syrian watson would
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.960]   unite
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.880]   You'd have to be pretty out of it to think that that's even like possible
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:51.840]   Lots of courses a series of programs running on a massive make frame computer. Yeah, because it's not it's not like a it's not like a browser plugin
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   They don't just pass the job a script
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.000]   Mike win a jeopardy. Yeah
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.960]   But nonetheless, I mean, it's a it's a nice it's a nice fantasy piece when you start to think about
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.760]   I mean if these if this partnership works out and ibm starts to say you know what?
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.280]   I mean will give you very attractive terms on this on this code if you want to figure out how to hook up
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.360]   so but of course, I think that just the car the cartoons and
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:22.240]   In enjoy attack about series shacking up with watson. I don't think that we want to see that. Yeah, no
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:28.160]   One of the authors is divindra harter where he was actually really smart
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.320]   So I don't I I think this is really more of a measure of how desperate
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.960]   The press is to say something about apple and by the way, we share your desperation
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.720]   This is our whole show you you just have a bylaw. Yeah, you know, you have a five file of one piece
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.640]   We got to do two hours on this diem use I think was interesting though if no for nothing else
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.080]   You got to hear tim coxpeak enterprise language again. Oh, I think it's very big
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.080]   Yeah, some have said this might be the most important deal apple's ever made
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.400]   Putting apple in the enterprise could be huge and it is a shot across the bow for both google and microsoft
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.120]   I love it. I love it. Yeah
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.920]   What I love about it is that it really is the sort of it's such a natural fit for both companies that
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.320]   I'm amazed that no one has
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:17.360]   Positive before that. Hey, I wonder if they'll if apple and ibm will ever get together because you really do talk about how apple sucks at
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.840]   At appealing to enterprise all apple all ibm does is appeal to enterprise
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.520]   ibm's
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.520]   ibm is not good at
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.880]   It does nothing but deploy hardware apple does nothing but sell hardware
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.400]   It's just like man. Why did why did these people not get together before it's such a beautiful thing
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.520]   And it also it also reminds us that we're going to have to redefine what we think about apple in the future
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.960]   If I think for the past couple years, I think everybody has been talking about how apple is big in business
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.000]   They're big in enterprise, but they really are a consumer focused company
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.120]   This is I think another tick tick park in the argument that they don't want to be any one kind of company
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.600]   They really want to be apple and it really adds a massive sales force to
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.360]   Out there, you know area that apple doesn't have much of a sales force
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.080]   ibm is really that's what ibm is nowadays it's a sales really interesting too because
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.560]   Everyone's always looking for where like iphone is still the biggest business that makes the most money and everyone's always interested
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.400]   What's the next bit of lower lowest hanging fruit and that for a long time was china mobile?
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.360]   One of them gonna get china mobile. They've got that now everyone wants to know what's next and while apple has I think 98
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:26.480]   Percent penetration in global 500 fortune 500. That's breadth. That's not depth and apple obviously sees a tremendous opportunity
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.400]   To not you know sell into enterprise but to sell a whole lot more into enterprise
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.560]   But they're ill-equipped to do that. It's not their culture
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.880]   It's not their sales force and ibm is a really good fit and I think for the timing part of it
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:42.400]   There's a lot of things interesting things going into ios 8. There's a lot better mobile device management, which you know has some dimesides
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.880]   I'm sure we'll talk about later, but also things like um
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.400]   There's an extension so apple has iCloud drive now in ios 8
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:56.560]   But there's also document a storage provider extension so that whatever enterprise solution microsoft provides can live alongside or instead of iCloud drive
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.520]   And it'll be just as easy to get to all your corporate stuff as it is to get you know a normal person to get to their iCloud stuff
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.800]   So to Andy's point it's an incredibly good relationship for them
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:10.640]   One and I think that ibm is the most natural one that isn't a competitor. I mean, I don't think there's any other enterprise
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.480]   uh
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.360]   Company that wouldn't look like a competitor to apple. Yeah for them to partner. There's so little
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.080]   Yeah, they're just not it's just complete two different worlds that that they need they each need each other
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.640]   But there's not you know everyone else that's in the enterprise world. I think apple might see as a
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.360]   uh competitor or they might see apple as a competitor
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.200]   Yeah, it's like uh, it's like when we were talking about the beach deal we have to talk about
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.440]   Okay, so beach but beach is in the a lot of the same second of the same business as apple
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.440]   Does this mean that beats will no longer exist?
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.280]   Does that means their team is gonna be working on other people with this partnership? It's no
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:50.720]   Again, there's nobody at ibm who's in the business of making designing and selling hardware like this at apple like branay said
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.680]   They just don't understand enterprise. They have they are pleased and happy that they have managed to fall
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:01.680]   As backward into a huge market even though this is not something that they have a lot of expertise with and it's just no
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.400]   Oh, there's almost no overlap as tim has said this himself said it's like two puzzle pieces clicking together
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:12.480]   And yeah, it's interesting because there's uh the the thing with the partnerships is apple feels burned by microsoft over the max still
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:18.000]   That's part of their historic culture. They feel burned by google and samsung who they had his partners but who became competitors
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.400]   It is incredibly unlikely ibm is working on a lotus notes phone or anything of that nature
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.200]   So that's like wide open for apple at the same time
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.400]   It's not obvious
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.600]   Talix's point where other people could go like if google wanted to make this relationship
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.560]   Their relationship with oracles not very good oracles can be probably not a good candidate for them to approach our partnership
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.600]   Sap is not terribly exciting. There's not a lot of players ibm size and of those players
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.680]   I think ibm is absolutely the most interesting one for apple golf stud in a chat room also says this could be huge in health care
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.240]   uh, when we say enterprise, I always think of you know fortune 500 companies, but there are a lot of
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:56.960]   Enterprises like uh the medical industry where apple could really have a strong position
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.680]   If to up with ibm and given the right kind of soft
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.880]   I think in health care and in almost every business out there
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.800]   There's all these efficiency problems that you know ibm is trying to fix
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.960]   I think that apple's trying to fix and there's a huge opportunity for all these companies whether it's microsoft or google or
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:16.000]   Salesforce or or any of these other companies to make these systems more efficient
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.200]   I mean, you know, I look at we're doing a huge overhaul on our company right now
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:24.160]   To automate a lot of stuff. Um just to allow us to do more with the people that we have and
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.520]   Uh, I think that you're seeing every company has to look at that and I think ibm has the
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.400]   The ears of all those companies and apple has the hardware and software to do it and or an ibm has a lot of that
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:41.040]   Analysts uh are estimating the consensus estimate is that apple will earn and so you want to know what this estimate is because
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.960]   Apple will probably usually comes in does better because they sandbag
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.080]   Consular
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.000]   There was there was a there was a storm in the sun. Yeah, I think that's gonna affect things
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.240]   But the analysts are thinking a dollar 23 is shared so you want to watch that that's kind of the
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.600]   They beat that that they if they did then the stock market will love them
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.160]   I think this is the first post split earnings report. So what it means for sure is probably different. Yeah, yeah, well
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:10.160]   It's a seven for one stock split the same period a year ago apple was seven dollars and 47 cents a share
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.240]   So about 23 would be an increase a year over year
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.120]   Uh sales
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.880]   Analysts say apple should report revenue of somewhere around 37
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:26.560]   Or 38 billion dollars in the last year they did 35 billion dollars. So
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.560]   Oh much here and by the way, it's their slowest quarter touching so
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.120]   Uh, i'm waiting for my company to get to a point where the slowest quarter is 37
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.120]   Billion apple stock is up 18 percent this year
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.200]   Uh, on july 16th a little less than a week ago reached a
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.560]   52 week high of 97 dollars and 10 cents
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.280]   A share now they will also as you mentioned as we talked they will talk about ibm certainly
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.360]   Uh, they they might talk about beats that would be interesting. I you know
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.840]   They've been dead silent ever since the acquisition. Of course, it's not uh, it hasn't cleared yet
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.480]   Um, when does that happen? I don't know if they're in a quiet period before it does or not
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.520]   It was their biggest acquisition in history. So from a pure financial point of view it does
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.840]   Impact the quarter 3.1 billion dollars kind of we'll train
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:19.040]   Got some money a little money in the side. Well, something going on
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:24.720]   Um, but I wonder you know, we haven't really heard much about it. Do you think that the that went, you know
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:30.400]   Okay, i'm gonna get on my hobby horse here. But do you but do you think that when the the
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.360]   sale does clear?
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.000]   Anything at all will have changed
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.880]   I think we hear more about it in September think i think that's the right time for apple star car
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.040]   Who beats headphones
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.240]   20 i'm i'm hoping for 24 bit
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.840]   canceling whole different beats
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.400]   But again
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.880]   Whatever the analysts are looking for or listening for
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.440]   Uh, we normal people will be look looking and listening for just something from tim
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.280]   Can you give us some color on apples plants for a living right color? Yeah, exactly
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.400]   Something
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.800]   Um, so that's the two p.m. Pacific
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.040]   So two and a half hours
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.040]   From right now we will probably not be covering that live but we'll have certainly a wrap up on
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.440]   Technos tonight, which is shortly thereafter
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.200]   Who knows if it's a slow day. Maybe we'll just join the conference call
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:26.640]   Listen in yeah, you could do that right. Yeah, it's public. Mm-hmm. I have a big dial in
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.040]   Hi, my name is leo le port from mac break week
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.240]   I have a question for tim it's on three parts
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.840]   It's a three parts. That's what it is
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.960]   It's a three-part question if you wouldn't mind coming back to me again and again so I can continue
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:48.800]   Yes, it's a song that's in an iTunes playlist, but it keeps telling you can't think to my device
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.480]   But it's not an iCloud
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.200]   Hey, you know, I choose this here the new iTunes is here
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.840]   Have you as anybody played with the new iTunes? Yeah
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.880]   Beta 12 12 beta. Yep or for our British listeners beta
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.080]   Beta what is uh, they say new and shiny
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:15.520]   Yeah, it's got the Yosemite makeover. It's a Yosemite. So this could does this come with Yosemite preview or preview for? Yeah, no preview for okay
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.840]   Um
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.280]   Based on screenshots that I have seen posted publicly online
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.720]   Uh, it's it looks like a big step forward one of the things that really caught my eye is that now it's
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:33.760]   They've basically put rolled back a little bit on this one window interface so that it's now easier to manage multiple playlists
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.800]   Without having to expose your playlist list by doing it as a pop-up now you can have it as a permanent sidebar
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:45.600]   Uh, there's a little more clarity between the difference between what's actually on your mac and what you have stored in the cloud and what's in the store
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.240]   It's not nearly as modal as it wants to be a lot one was uh, there's a lot of fun
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.680]   I'm sorry. Go ahead. I'm sorry
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.400]   You speaking I see the language of the people now the Canadian hat
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.440]   I'm switching. I'm switching. I'm on seltzer water. Okay. There's no
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:08.000]   No, there's no false fork acid and I'm double caffeinated in a so and no wonder. That's why I jumped on you. Sorry
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.240]   Basically, there's there seems there's it will be familiar to existing users of iTunes
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.600]   But it will seem like a very good upgrade of it again particularly if you met for me
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.160]   particularly if you manage a lot of playlists because to me
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.760]   That's the biggest failing. I think of the redesign for me personally because I used to have a lot of fun building playlists
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.680]   And now it's just becomes so difficult to do that it's like, okay
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:35.120]   I'll just I'll just pick songs and put them on my phone manually and then deal with whatever I have
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.440]   I just don't know you never do I don't do it recreational anymore
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.720]   Do you build a lot of playlists on iTunes these days?
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.840]   At all I mean or have I have to admit that once I started using Spotify, I kind of stopped
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.160]   Yeah, I don't either well I never well I never I never really made the switch to Spotify
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.240]   Or any of the even though I do have a google music all access account
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.960]   partly because I don't
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.680]   Partly because I don't like being locked into one player
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.840]   Also, and this is not something that I can unilaterally defend
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:10.080]   I'm very very worried about what the switch to in all subscription music world will do to artists because
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.480]   I don't think they're going to get paid what they deserve to be paid for an album
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.720]   That is essentially part of your permanent library and you listen to all the time you keep
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:25.680]   Every time that even a big popular artist talks about how much money they get off of streaming off of Spotify
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:31.120]   It becomes basically the amount of money that they would tip a bellhop at one of the hotels that they check into
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:38.000]   It's like literally like less than a hundred dollars or four hundred dollars five hundred dollars depend. It's half a cent per play
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.400]   Not much what's half a cent per play and and the issue is guilty
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.840]   I don't feel guilty. It's just a different business model. I mean, I think
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.360]   I went 3-6 guilty also
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:54.240]   Also, I like I like the fact that my music library is something that I permanently have
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:58.400]   That this is not something that's going to change if I decide to switch from Spotify to another service
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:03.200]   It's not something that's going to change if someone buys Spotify and decides that they're going to charge so much for the service
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.880]   I don't want to pay it anymore
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.840]   I think there's a lot of factors to it, but that is what I have to admit that is one factor
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.560]   No, it's a good fact
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.880]   I mean because I was very much in that zone for a long time
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.480]   And I and I still do that with movies for some reason I still buy movies because I just want to download them
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.640]   I just just have them downloaded it, but the
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:22.480]   Uh, but I find that with the music it it's one of those things that I always feel like I'll just build the playlist on a new
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.880]   Service if I need to you know because the same all the services are gonna have whatever set of music
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.800]   I mean it doesn't mean songs is all the same
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.040]   It's all it's it's the same 20. I mean, I'm not I'm not that I don't have that much obscure stuff that I'm interested in
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.880]   The only thing I'm worried about is get you know, I have one playlist of like 400 songs
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.680]   So figuring that out would be problematic, but the um
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.760]   What is that playlist for?
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.760]   That is the playlist I listen to all day. That's your that's like it's like the best
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.720]   Ever you know like like you know and it's like 400
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.800]   You know you can share on Spotify
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.320]   I'm a little hesitant. That's a that's an example of something you can do on Spotify
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:00.000]   So great that apples is life's work trying to do with ping but they that fail and apples never really
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.280]   Achieves that oh ping. I'm gonna release some more playlist soon. I've got an idea
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.120]   I've got an idea. I like to hear your workday playlist
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.840]   Well, I'm what I was gonna do is I was gonna actually start doing playlists
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.680]   People should let me know if they think this is a good idea or not
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:17.120]   But um that I was gonna start doing a playlist where I actually annotate some of the songs like tell you like like great
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.640]   Lost lost alternative rock, you know like and make it like a little radio
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.120]   So sure
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.120]   to be a music director in the
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:28.720]   Songs that I heard that that we heard when we were in radio you hear all these hours coming up that never made it
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.760]   You say now let me tell you a little bit about this deep track. I'm basically rebuilding rock over london
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.800]   Hello, this is gram dean and you want to see
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.160]   Remember that? Do you remember that? Well, I think you need to use this new medium and do something like I'm working
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.400]   I've been writing them that'd be great. This is how to record Alex
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:49.520]   Before you record them. So my whole my whole my whole plan is I'm gonna be part of the playlist
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.880]   See
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:56.240]   Can you do that with Spotify? Can you put a an arbitrary track in and the playlist? Well, not through Spotify. You have to do it through it
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.080]   something else yeah
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.080]   So that's that's my big plan
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.880]   We'll see I'll
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:09.280]   Guilty. I mean I use Pandora. I use Google music. Here's my thing though is that is that I so I paid like so I bought you know in
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:14.560]   1986 I bought English settlement by xdc bought it songs per
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:21.520]   The payment per time I listened to no thugs in our house is definitely would definitely equal
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.360]   half a cent each because I
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.960]   You know I paid I paid for the album ones but I listened to the song like you know every day
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.720]   You know you're getting paid every single time someone's playing it rather than just when they bought
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.400]   So I think that the comparison sometimes I don't think is is completely accurate
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.640]   Of and I also think that the issue with with with subscription is is that yeah
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.440]   It's makes a certain amount of money for the artist at 10 million subscribers
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:49.120]   But what if someone like apple comes in or or or or spotify is incredibly successful and you move to a hundred million or 200 million or 300 million subscribers
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.480]   at that time if you're a popular artist at least you're gonna make
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:59.520]   Deoretically a lot more money because you're still getting paid the the half a cent you know point point oh oh five or point oh oh six dollars
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.480]   a
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.000]   Play and it's just a lot more people playing it
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.040]   But I think that right now is as a niche market of course it's not making as much money
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.040]   But the bottom line is is there's no
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.960]   I think most artists have given up the thought that that selling their music per song or per album is going to make a living
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.560]   and most of them are
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:22.320]   Moving on to the 360 deals and you know a lot of other things that they can you know make money on a lot of other things other than their music
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:28.800]   We're gonna take a break when we come back. Let's talk about that patent that's floating around of the a new
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:36.240]   I watch apple applied for the patent. Does it mean they're actually going to make something like that and uh the security researcher who's
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.000]   PowerPoint at the hope ex conference
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.440]   It's done a lot of iOS users actually steve gets them. Be talking about it
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.040]   That's one of the few times I wish security now was first. I want to watch that before the show
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.960]   Come on the show and I said no
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.720]   We'll just tell everybody to stay tuned because steve's gonna do a deep dive
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.960]   But we'll talk about that in a second first. I want to talk a little bit about my friends at linda
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.960]   Dot com and I literally mean my friends because so many of the people you and I know my friends our friends

[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.480]   And she realized there was a better way than writing a book was to make
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:41.360]   Beautiful video courses. They have how was she's talking to them? They have in their sanibarbra offices nine video
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:47.760]   It's huge it's bigger than this nine video productions studios where their teachers can come
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.360]   And they can create courses. They create courses so fast

[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:49.600]   There's a little eight-minute section or this thing in cinema 4d. I don't understand how to set this up and someone's done it
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.680]   I love it. Let me know lynda.com slash
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.600]   Mac break. We love them. We thank those so much for their support
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.320]   Mac break weekly
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:05.600]   So I don't usually talk about patents because as we've mentioned before
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.640]   Apple has a whole building full of lawyers
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:14.960]   Their sole job in fact they even do this they'll go around to different departments and groups sit them down and say
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:21.840]   Okay, what'd you what'd you do today? I could patent that and they literally patent everything and it doesn't mean they're gonna make it
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:27.440]   It doesn't mean it's a product. They're even considering it's more. It's as much defensive as anything else right
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.640]   So but there is a new iWatch patent
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:35.520]   I time I think i time which kind of is not a good name
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:41.920]   Mostly because uh, I think that's the last thing that any uh smart watch is about its time
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.600]   That's like calling a you know calling the i phone
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.160]   You know, I mean that's crazy talk
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.000]   It's crazy crazy
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.320]   So they did get this patent. That's how we know it was published from the us patent and trademark office for the iTime
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.600]   It's interesting because it has circuitry in the straps
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:05.600]   This I don't think this is like anything apple's considering because it's really much more like a nano watch
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.200]   The the timepiece itself gets snapped in
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:13.280]   Kind of like a nano like an ipod. I'd be really interesting
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.080]   the next nano deal
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.840]   The idea of this is the is the strap
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.240]   uh
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.240]   contains all sorts of features
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.120]   That are separate from the central unit
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:31.840]   The strap could have gps Wi-Fi haptic feedback
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.040]   accelerometers
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.840]   Do keep in mind that these are intentional because they can they can get the patent on this base
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:45.680]   But they're getting a patent on is a basic technology where you have a band that has electronic and so it has support electronics inside it
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.440]   And a modgia you snap in and out
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.560]   Right and so that way they people have seen the nano the nano is established
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.840]   They can do you can use the nano for the art without revealing whatever it is
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:58.560]   They plan to make it a pleasure. Oh, that's it. That's interesting. But again, I think it's I don't know
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:04.320]   I think it's pretty hard to read patents look at them and say oh, this must be a clue as to what apple's working on
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.560]   It isn't necessarily it might be
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:10.480]   Maybe they'll just license it in the retired engineer will get a check in 50 years
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:18.640]   A wrist worn wearable with a admitted strap capabilities. Oh and support for arm and wrist gestures
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.720]   Yeah
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.560]   But it's hard it's not hard to imagine that there will be smart watch patent suits the way
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:30.400]   They're a smartphone patent suits and apple like everyone else is gonna want there as much as average as possible. It's defensive as much as
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.000]   It can be I think it's a really interesting way to think about
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.480]   Something that you always have with you. Maybe not always wearing on your wrist. I'm wearing the android wear watch
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:45.040]   Which one Leo? I have the LG, but they're both the same
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.600]   Um, and it's you know, it's nice. It's like it's like the pebble
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.840]   It lets me know I mean I can read texts. I got just got a text
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.640]   Uh, let's see what else
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.360]   There's a text from lisa
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.920]   The download of something is complete. I don't know why
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.960]   Um, you know overhead right notifications all sorts of stuff and then it's a watch
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.240]   Yep
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.080]   Uh, and I could talk to it. I could tap it
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:14.000]   Send text to lisa. I'll help you with that later
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.440]   And then it will automatically send it
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.240]   Uh, actually it doesn't do a one thing that's not good. It doesn't do a confirmation
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.920]   So
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.600]   You know what? I'm actually distant or not
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.640]   You can use that to your manager Leo. I swear I sent that text honey. I swear
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.720]   I I talked to my watch
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.440]   No, it says I sent it but what it doesn't do is confirm that it got it wrote what you said
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.080]   So you get kind of hilarious
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:42.640]   Right quotes. It's like just this ring. It's like a real damn you autocorrect because there's no second chance
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:47.440]   It's like okay. I pack is the cupcakes into the Audi but that could be now. You're not coming out tonight
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.360]   But that could be fixed but I mean
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.320]   So it's somewhat useful. I could talk to it. I can say
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.440]   Listen to yo-han bock and it will
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.600]   Play bock on my phone because it's tied to that. It's very tightly integrated with the phone
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.560]   So you could come and your phone with that. I mean, there's but it's not something you're gonna say to people
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.600]   Oh, you gotta have this it really isn't like that
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.960]   Not yet and I don't think and I watch because ness
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:16.480]   Well, we've talked about it. I don't I just don't see what apple could do that could make this something everybody has to have
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:23.280]   Well, I think that's what's gonna make it so spectacular when it does happen. Right. We say we said the same thing about a phone and about a about a tablet
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.760]   Wow
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.160]   Done it before
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.880]   Definitely keeping the powder dry. I mean, you know, it's like you're watching all these people go
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.440]   I think apple just no comment no comment no comment
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:40.240]   I can I can finally admit something that I was this close to like having to write a check to pebble and to say that yeah
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.800]   I lost your watch
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:47.040]   I can't find it anywhere. I'm just gonna have to buy it from I know it's here somewhere
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.800]   I'm sure I'll find it when I do like by spring cleaning, but I can't find it
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:58.640]   And and I was going to use this in my review as a as an explanation of some of the unseen problems of these wearables where
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.880]   You're wearing it. You're wearing it. You're wearing it
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.680]   But it needs to be recharged on a very very quick basis
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:08.800]   And it's just in the middle of the day and your battery dies and you find yourself that you're wearing
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:14.080]   A dead piece of whatever on your wrist you take it off you put it in a pocket or you put it in your laptop bag
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.800]   And that's how I thought that I lost it because like, you know, I'm not going to wear this all day
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.800]   And then of course I found it
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:25.680]   It turns out that after I finished my research I put it back in the box that it came in and prepared it back
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:30.560]   Which is the last place I would have looked for it because it was in fact a place where a sane person would actually put it
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.680]   But but it did really sort of it really did sort of point out that
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:38.640]   It's not only going to be have to be a watch it's going to have to be a charger that you keep track of and it's going to have to
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:43.760]   It's going to probably introduce a lot of problems that we're not going to be able to see until people start wearing them just like you
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:49.760]   I think it's a waffle. It's a loseable. They just won't release a watch at all in a draw. No, no, I don't think it's all anymore
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.240]   It's apple's biggest troll
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.800]   Apple's is trolling you
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.280]   Of course, you know, it was sneakers all along
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:03.520]   Uh, and of course the the other story, which I think is a fairly important story and you're right
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.000]   We're all waiting here with steve gives it gives it has to say
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.560]   Uh, steve did a very good two part security now
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:17.280]   When apple released its security white paper about what it's doing in modern versions of ios particularly on the iphone five s
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.240]   to secure your stuff and steve was
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:25.440]   Very favorably impressed. He said apple has really gone the extra mile here
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.880]   They do a lot of things that nobody else is doing
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.440]   They've really clearly got privacy and security as a primary focus
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.160]   Uh, he was extremely complimentary
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:41.200]   Then along comes uh, jonathan's jarski who is actually quite well known
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:45.040]   Uh, it's computer security expert and forensic scientist
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.280]   He actually wrote a paper
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.160]   That was behind a paywall about six months ago. Nobody read
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.760]   Then he made a powerpoint presentation for the hope conference in new york last week and everybody read it
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.920]   In fact, jonathan tweeted something like the way there's the power of uh slides
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.320]   Right. Nobody paid nobody paid attention
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:08.240]   Yeah, but uh, he makes a very very day. I think damaging claims
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:15.040]   He doesn't come out and say apple has provided back doors for the federal government of course apple hotly denies that
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:19.360]   But he says for instance that every single ios 7 device
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.160]   hundreds of millions of them have
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.400]   A built-in packet sniffers that are running not in developer mode but all the time
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.920]   and can be even connected to via wi-fi so
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.160]   Um, uh law enforcement could or somebody who knows how to use this
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.960]   could connect
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:43.680]   To your iphone via the wi-fi and uh sniff use it as a packet sniffer and see everything you're doing
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:49.200]   I think they had to get in via usb first the wi-fi direct attack. I think he said was the article. Okay
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.200]   Nevertheless
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.760]   It was really I went and read the white paper because I found the slides hard to understand because they might seem
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.400]   Contradicky, but he's really talking about similarly it related things a lot and it made it very dense for me
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:05.440]   But when I went and read the white paper, it was clear that a lot of this is based on a couple different hacks
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:11.040]   And one is the mobile device management stuff for enterprise, which I think maybe apple implemented perhaps too quickly trying to
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.680]   I don't know if it's ibm deal related, but it's incredibly powerful and maybe too powerful
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:19.200]   And there's also these undocumented services the file relays
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:24.320]   Um, and the the packet sniffer you can have that on almost every linux box some of the packets niffer
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:30.000]   It's that it's not constrained to dev mode that you know problematic that someone hasn't doesn't have to put their phone in dev mode first
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.320]   So I think it's less he goes to great pains to say that he's not saying anything sinister here
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.840]   But he thinks legitimately that apple has to answer a lot of questions about it apple very hotly denied it
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.200]   Uh, although some say kind of cite kind of a non-denial denial
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:48.480]   Um, they sent me their denial. I got I spoke to apple about it. They sent me a their statement and they again
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.120]   You know they it's the same thing with the china thing
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:54.960]   They they believe they say emphatically that they are you know privacy first
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.520]   Security first and that they have not worked with any government to create a backdoor in the system
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:04.240]   And that is that is absolutely a press reply that has not you know, Tim cook or apple security department saying something
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:09.280]   That's their press department saying it but and we talked about this before when a big company says something like that
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.560]   They're going to be held to that and if it's proven otherwise, uh, there's gonna be
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.920]   You thought and tennigate was bad. It would be a lot of repercussions
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.400]   Yeah, that's exactly what I thought that they left themselves almost no wiggle room here
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.480]   So if it turns out that they said, oh, well, we said we didn't work with a government
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:29.440]   We just simply anticipated a future need possibly but we've never worked with the government to implement this
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.600]   They will they will not get away with that this is
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.120]   They and they given that they had a lot of options on how to
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:41.360]   Respond to this or not respond to this the fact that they picked something that is will screw them mightily in the future
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.000]   If they were waffling on this, I think that's a that's very indicative
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.760]   Uh, one of the things steve was very impressed with was the the encrypted data on the iphone
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:54.720]   Uh zajarski who's a hacker name by the way is nerve gas. So I believe in
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:39:01.520]   You've got a hacker name like that that's very important. He says almost he could have been in a 1997 movie about hackers. Yes
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.640]   Oh that nerve gas watch out for him
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:09.280]   He says that almost all native application o s data is encrypted
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.960]   With a key but a key that is not married to the passcode. We knew this
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:17.600]   I mean that was part of what apple was doing but rather encrypted with a hardware deduced key
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:22.880]   Uh, this is not new. We knew this we talked we thought that was a good thing. However
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:29.680]   Uh as a viOS 7 third-party documents are encrypted, but library and cash folders usually are not
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.680]   But here's the here's the damning thing and I don't think apple addressed this and I find this
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:39.040]   Fascinating when you power up the phone and unlock it it remains
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.160]   Unencrypted until the device is shut down
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:49.680]   So I think a lot of us thought that when you press the button and lock the screen and you need a passcode to get back into the phone
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:53.200]   Oh now it's encrypted. It is not I'm wondering if that is
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:57.440]   What i'm curious about is is that a performance thing like how long it takes to close my open
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.680]   I asked about this. I didn't ask apple at this
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.840]   But I asked security people and a couple of things that's again
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.360]   Why like and zajarski says is too
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.280]   He said that he's afraid that journalists are going to take this wrong and you know some of them absolutely did
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:11.520]   But there's a couple of things like the level of security that you need also has to remain functional
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:15.120]   It's the same problem that the lock screen has with bypasses that people can get around it
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.920]   Because the lock screen doesn't just lock your phone. It lets you make phone calls
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.640]   Let's do access control center serie notification center
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.360]   And if you lock it down too much you can no longer make phone calls
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:28.240]   Which is technically illegal in many jurisdictions because you have to be able to dial 911 in case of emergency
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.840]   So it's one of those things where there's a tension between security and privacy
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.000]   And it might be that there are things they can do better
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.960]   But a lot of the stuff when you read it like the the some of the stuff the point the point before you go on
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.600]   Yeah, that should the takeaway on that is
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:45.840]   Do do your stuff is not encrypted until you turn off your phone
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.480]   So if you're worried turn off your phone
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.760]   Because just pat just having the screen lock
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:56.320]   Does not I turn off my phone by accident all the time. It's called running out of battery
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:56.880]   Okay, sorry
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:02.000]   I just want to make sure people understood that so that they know if you want to hide your stuff turn off your phone
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.880]   Absolutely and we actually on i'm where we're doing a series of things like one of the problems also is
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:11.440]   When you connect your computer your phone to a computer it creates a pairing record
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.920]   So that when you don't you have to do that trusted device dialogue
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.920]   Yes, this is another one across this device
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:20.160]   Yeah, you press yes and it maintains that record and that can be but a lot of the stuff for example
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.880]   The pack of sniffers documented and apples developer portal
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:28.320]   Uh one of the components that tells you the protocols that you can initiate if you do break into a phone is open source
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:33.120]   Another one you can pull a whole p-list file off that tells you one by one what services they are
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:38.240]   So there there's nothing very well hidden about this stuff, which makes me you know think that it's more a case of apple
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:43.120]   Went too fast with some things and maybe has too many probably too many masters are trying to serve with another
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:48.880]   But the there are legitimate security concerns and they a lot of them can be fixed with apple zone tools
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:53.600]   Yeah, it also bears mentioning that just because apple is not working with
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:42:01.040]   Governments in order to provide user data. That's only maybe 20 about you about what you worry about you worry about the government
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.960]   Helping themselves to data with or without uh companies involvement and help
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:10.720]   So just because the this they're making a clear statement doesn't mean that a device isn't vulnerable or that it can't be made a little bit more
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:14.400]   More secure and those are the kind of and vulnerable to hackers too
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.320]   I mean if it's vulnerable to governments, it's vulnerable to hackers it weakens the security overall
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.360]   Well, and I think the the concern that I think this article brings up
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:26.000]   And I think a lot of things that people are worried about is whether there's any kind of it doesn't mean the apples handing off over any
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.920]   Data to the nsa or anyone else, but they're you know, people are worried about a conversation that said well, why don't we just not?
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:37.200]   Close that door, you know, like, you know, like, you know, let's not you know, let's not do anything about that
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:41.440]   But let's not you know, not even internally so I see here are the questions
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:46.080]   Jonathan asks apple did not really directly address any of them to my knowledge Renee
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:52.720]   Why is there a packet sniffer running on 600 million personal ios devices instead of being moved to the developer
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:57.040]   One why are there undocumented services?
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:05.600]   Services apparently not used by any of the software on the iPhone that bypassed user backup encryption and allow somebody
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:11.840]   Whoever to dump mass amounts of personal data from the phone. Why is that there and why is it left on?
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:16.720]   Why is it most of my user data is still not encrypted with the pin or passphrase
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.000]   Enabling the invasion of my personal privacy by you
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:25.440]   He's talking to apple here and finally why is there still no mechanism to review the devices?
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:32.320]   My iPhone is paired with so I can delete the ones that don't belong and that's something that
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:39.280]   Every device should do yeah, and in most systems they do they give you a list of things you've trusted and and give the chance to revoke it
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:43.280]   And what's great about this article is I think that it opens up these things and apple will have
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:50.320]   You know a couple updates to start, you know, working on, you know, closing that stuff off or really have to come up and explain why they're not
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:55.440]   It's really important like one of the things I worry about is that security is so hard to explain
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.560]   To normal people is that in order for these attacks to work
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:06.000]   To get the keychain sorry to get the pairing records someone has to take your computer a government agency or a malicious attacker has to take your computer
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.400]   To get to them they have to take your device if they want to use a juice jack which is a maliciously
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:15.840]   Controlled accessory to sort of generate their own pairing keys. There's a lot of steps that have to be done to get to these
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:21.600]   Not yeah, he says in his in his own statement that apple has done a lot to prevent the typical kinds of attacks
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:26.480]   Which is what steve was addressing in the ios seven document was addressing is that it is incredibly hardened against
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:31.360]   Typical kinds of attacks. These are very specific times of attacks that he's exposed one and like Alex
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.360]   I think he should the apple needs to fix these yeah
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.520]   He raises a good question. He says why is this is what was clearly designed to be secure
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:41.840]   Uh, why is it being compromised by apple intentionally? What's the point?
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:48.480]   Well, and what's interesting is that I know several large companies that have a policy of if you walk into the airport and tsa takes your
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:53.360]   Computer to a way, you know out of your site or puts or put no puts anything into it
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:58.640]   You just leave them with the computer like literally you just you know the company say we'll replace your computer
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:03.440]   Because we know it's done like it's it's like as soon as tsa walks away with your computer
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:07.840]   You're no longer allowed to take it back, you know and so you what they did these the people that I know will
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:12.800]   Upload everything to the cloud. I don't know that makes me better anymore, but but they'll save it all off
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.560]   Um, you know before they get on the flight so when they come in through customs
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:21.360]   They don't have to they know that they could walk away from that computer any moment and you're so you're gonna write up rnae
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.640]   How to use the apple a configurator configurator yesterday?
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:30.320]   Okay, so there's an article on the i'm more site because if you really don't want this for instance this pairing to happen
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.320]   There's a way to disable that but you have to download the free apple configure
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:39.040]   And there's also ways you can make pat the lock screen safer like you can turn off your you can turn off control center
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.840]   You can turn off notifications center. You can turn off passbook
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.840]   You can do a lot of things to make your yourself less vulnerable to any kind of attack. Yeah
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:49.200]   Um, I think though the I think
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:53.200]   Jarski raises some interesting questions. Steve will talk about this
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:58.400]   Right after this show on security now get your propeller hats out. It usually gets pretty thick
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:02.960]   But uh, it's if you want, you know, this is the problem of course and you you raise this rnae that
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.640]   um, the the mainstream media takeaway headline is
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:11.280]   apple devices insecure apple cooperating with the feds
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.760]   But it's obviously more complex than that
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:18.720]   I'll put the article in the chat room. Just if people are thank you about it. Thank you. All right. We appreciate
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:23.920]   Um, we're gonna do a question thing right the question engine. Are you ready?
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:27.760]   Well, give us the url. The url is um, it's just bitly
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:32.720]   No, you gotta use twit.2. I don't know how to I don't know how to sign in for that. We got to get that set up
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.920]   Yeah, I don't even know how to sign it. I don't know how to sign it. I don't know how to sign it. I don't know how to sign it
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:41.440]   That's the problem. The it.ly/mbw-412
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:47.360]   Mbw-412 because this is episode 4 12. We've got lots of questions. So, uh, we'll come in after it
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.800]   I'll give it out people just guessed it. I tweeted it. Oh, you tweeted it and then I put it in the in the
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.760]   In the chat room. We'll take a break. We'll take some questions
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:59.440]   Uh, but uh, if you have a question or if you go to the question engine, you can vote up the question because a lot of times
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:09.760]   Messing it was the vote of the questions you're most the questions by now probably asked, uh, again, bit.ly/mbw-412
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.600]   We'll go to our question engine
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:18.720]   In a just a moment I show today brought to you by Squarespace
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:25.280]   Alex Lindsey is kind of the the poster boy for Squarespace. I love Squarespace. Yeah, he used to go into
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:29.840]   Rest in front. Say, where's your website? I don't have a website now. You do
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:34.320]   Yeah, I mean like I'd make one while I was having food because what you could do one of the things you could do with Squarespace
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:40.160]   So Squarespace is hosting and software. So it's everything you need to create a really great website whether it's a personal site
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:43.760]   A business site because they have ecommerce on every single template
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:48.240]   Uh, maybe uh a photography portfolio and art portfolio
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:52.960]   Uh newborn baby site. There's lots of you know website right website could be anything
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:55.600]   Uh, but it's the hosting and the software everything you need
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:02.320]   But one of the things they do that no one else does that I know of is you go to squarespace.com and click the get started button without giving them a credit card
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.560]   Or really any personal information
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:08.480]   Except your email address you can start a site created for two weeks free
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:13.440]   That's the hook. So what you did you go in there and you just set up a site here
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.160]   interesting
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:19.200]   Then log in and just get a new login and just created it if you like it then keep it if you like it though
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.200]   I do usually require a free meal
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.240]   When I come back, I want a sandwich
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:28.800]   Uh really nice. Well, you could do it as a wedding gift a baby gift wouldn't that be great?
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:33.680]   If you know a little bit and by the way, you don't have to be a css or javascript or html. It's always a big
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:38.800]   It's always a wig drag and drop point and click you can add little widgets that give uh that
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.600]   You know bring in your social media connect everything together
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:45.600]   And the big thing is you don't have to figure out also how to figure out how to make it work on an ipad and android
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:49.520]   And on like all of that stuff you just throw your stuff in and it's all going to reformat as as needed
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.880]   With new space guys gals are very very sophisticated
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:56.640]   And so in fact one of the reasons it took them so long to do this current versions
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:01.120]   When it came out version six, it was I think two years in the making is they wanted to make sure that
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:06.160]   Without you're having to worry about it. It did everything modern mobile responsive design
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.400]   So no no special mobile site
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:12.880]   It's your site looks good no matter what size screen when you upload a picture for instance
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:18.480]   Automatically in the background they make nine different versions of that picture in every possible size. So you know, you
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.360]   It's all it's all done for you eat commerce is built in
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:29.600]   Um in fact even the least expensive site and square space can buy or you can sell one thing which would be great for donations charity
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.320]   Um, you know a school fun drive

[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:05.440]   Self-help articles video workshops, so it's very easy
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.640]   Even if you you know, you stumble and say well, how did I do this?

[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:19.760]   And for for one of our clients and it was just great because and and it was little some little issues that we had with translations and

[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:13.440]   For tip one throw your computer into the canal get a mac
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.160]   Yeah
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:21.760]   Just the worst piece. I always 804 has a built-in tip app now. Yeah, I saw that
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:25.200]   Um, what is that? How is that gonna work a new tip a day or something?
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.880]   It says there's gonna be new ones there
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.960]   I think there's six or eight right now and you tap on it
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:32.480]   It has a little bit of animation and tells you what's happening and you can look at a whole list of them as well
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:37.680]   That's kind of a strange app. It's not made a but I mean, maybe it's helpful to some people. Yeah
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:44.880]   That's fun that I always 8b4 came out yesterday day before yeah, yeah anything else new and exciting
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:48.880]   Uh a control center looks nice. I mean they've they've made it a little bit easier to see
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:52.800]   They're just doing a lot of little improvements health hell got a little bit of improvements
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.760]   It's deadly. It's steadily getting there Leo. We're about halfway there
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:00.240]   By the way bill Campbell retired. I didn't realize this boy coach has been there forever
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.960]   Yeah, practically says the was in jobs days
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:06.560]   long time 17 year apple board member retiring
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:10.960]   Uh sue wagner will replace him. She's a director at black rock
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:14.480]   With m&a experience black rock
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:22.800]   We'll see it could be m&a preparing apple for sale unlikely or extra. Yeah. Well, that's an interesting place. Yeah, it's fine. Nobody could buy it
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.680]   I think we'll go over nine for it out
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:30.480]   Hey, we're printing money at 80 billion dollars a month. We can just print some more
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:34.720]   Actually north america's printing us currency too. So maybe they could buy it. Oh, yeah, there we go
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.480]   Every every time there's like a major redesign to the hundred dollar bill. It's usually in response to okay
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:47.360]   We we found out that another country has basically bought the the stuff that's required to manufacture hundred dollar bills now so
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:52.880]   Okay, guess what we're putting mascara on ben franklin this time use adamantium
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.040]   adamantium
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:58.720]   Question one this is from boston squirrel bastards quell
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:05.920]   He asks when will we see an apple for k monitor not likely buddy boy? I don't know
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.920]   October
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:12.720]   Ah, that would be a good time. That's my guess. That's the next mac event. Well, why do why not why I mean?
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:15.120]   it's built into 10.9
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.080]   as of 10 10 3
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:22.240]   uh, so, uh, you know, I have a 4k monitor I have the uh
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:25.440]   LG what is what do I have no I have the
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:28.160]   q1 to q3 to 1
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.880]   And I remember who makes it but it's that's the point
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:35.680]   I still like my big theory that they're just gonna take apple tv and incorporate it into a 4k monitor that you use for your
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.680]   iMac or whatever, but you can just have it all
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.760]   into the Mac as well just put it straight until s10
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:45.440]   You know how I like using my 4k. It's a 31 and a half inch monitor. How's that working for you? It's an a sus is it nice
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:50.640]   Uh, it's beautiful, but you know, I don't use it at 4k. I use it at uh, 1/2 1920 by 1080
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:56.240]   Uh, so everything's nice and big right you come in here. You go. What are you an old man? I go. Yep
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:03.760]   Everything's nice and big but if I do a photo editing or watch a video it's thought for thought right?
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:07.520]   So that's that that's that high dpi mode that apple's really good at
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:10.480]   And i'll tell you what that's what you want. That's the support
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:17.920]   I do know people who have like really really big like prestige 4k screens in their office that they're using as a
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:22.720]   As a screen for their computers for their and for their mac pro and it works great
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:28.560]   If you do have a big big big screen it becomes this is this picture window that places your desk that
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:33.440]   You can basically turn into four different monitors because of how big you can make these windows
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.440]   I just don't every time that i've seen a setup that has like a 31ish display on it
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:44.160]   List like you said leo it's you it's great demo, but at some point around the first 45 minutes of a full workday
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:48.720]   You say that I can't I don't have I'm not I don't have superhuman sight
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:52.400]   I can't appreciate from a distance of 18 inches or 24 inches away
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:56.560]   How nice this display is I want things to be bigger and easier to see yeah, so
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:02.480]   Yeah, well, so i don't i don't know if i have two 27s and a 31 it's ridiculous
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:09.680]   I see apple doing a doing a 4k display if they figure they can do it better than anybody else or if they can make a bigger markup
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:12.320]   But a bigger profit than anybody else can i think some
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:19.920]   They're leaving money on the table. That's the only one and I also think though that you it's just weird to not be making their own monitors for their own computers
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:23.760]   That's yeah, it's just weird. Well, they make thunderbolt. They just don't make 4k yet
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.640]   Just we just answer the question from bastard square. When are we gonna see a 4k computer? I'm gonna
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.520]   October anybody else
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.400]   October thinks the next likely time
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:38.560]   Yeah, I don't think apple wants to I think if apple does it they're not gonna do an announcement
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:43.520]   They'll just slip it because you press release. Yeah because uh, it's too small a market
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:47.920]   You don't want to emphasize in any way because it's gonna cost three thousand dollars
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.920]   You don't want to emphasize in any way
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:55.520]   How expensive your stuff is but it's the mac pro leo. It's that super car is the thing that makes apple cool and sexy
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:59.920]   They're gonna talk about they can do a little movie about how it was constructed by robots
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:08.640]   On the large I think you want to focus in your very few very precious events on the iPad the big sellers
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:13.760]   I phone the watch you got enough to say there you don't want to talk about 4k displays
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:18.160]   Too much for a b2 small market. It's a tiny more dub is computers trucks
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:23.360]   Next up wdc. Yeah, I the more to the point. Where are they gonna update the mini?
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:29.680]   And that was one of the questions, but it fell off the thing and fell I know nobody cares just you and me
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:35.680]   I want so many minis and I love them. Thank you boss. All right question two question
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:40.080]   Uh next question. Do you think the sam this is from franklin?
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.840]   Western
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:45.680]   Western connection that's a really good milwaukee. I love that name at least from milwaukee
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:51.520]   Do you think the sam sunglasses are working against apple or just helping to raise the brand awareness of the iphone ipad?
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:56.320]   iPad mini retina mac pro mac pro mac pro mac pro
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:58.320]   Mac pro mac pro late 2013
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:03.520]   I gotta tell you on the radio show. I always use this as the example of the unwashed masses
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:08.720]   They talk about there is no android device. There's sam sung and there's iphone
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:14.480]   Samsung's marketing has done at least that it has been and I keep telling I don't get a samson phone
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:21.280]   They're crap the only reason you want a samson phone is because they spend hundreds of millions of dollars advertising it to you billions billions
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.960]   billions
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.960]   Yeah, I've not been I've
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.400]   I've um bought a couple samson phones now and i'm kind of done
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:32.800]   They were great. I mean my galaxy is too. I loved the galaxy nexus loved
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:40.160]   But after the s4 never again. I mean it just in the s5. I don't like the plastic. They've jumped to the plastic key
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.160]   They have way too much touch whiz
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:46.960]   Yeah, the thing is you can do in touch whiz you can't do in google so it's an inconsistent user experience
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.120]   I like the HTC is much better. I like the motorola
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.880]   It's your pure is better
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:55.840]   When I still think we're gonna end up with this big tug of war between i mean sam's like I think i think is determined to move away from android
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:00.800]   I think slowly but I think that i think it's a tug of war because google's not doesn't want them to
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:06.080]   Well, it becomes very complicated if if a company that big moves away. It's complicated for the platform. They have tizen though
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:10.640]   It's in your back pocket. So yeah, I often when people call I say well have you looked at the HTC one
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:12.640]   This is so much better than the samson phone
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:15.760]   But and it's the same price. That's the m8
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:20.400]   That's not necessarily I mean there's there
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:27.760]   I agree that the the hand feel of us of a samson phone isn't as good as what you get from hdc and certainly not what you get from apple
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:31.040]   But they're they're doing some nice things for the platform
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:34.720]   It's it's nice to have a really good solid weatherproof phone that costs no more than
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:38.480]   Or the cheap phone that you can't drop and drop into a toilet or into a beach
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:42.800]   They I agree that a lot of the things they're doing with touch whiz are kind of weird
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:43.920]   But some of them are very nice
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:47.680]   They're also doing some things with split screen that to me points the way to
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:51.120]   Wow, this is incredibly useful now that I have the ability to
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:56.960]   Be doing something boring like clearing out the 200 or 300 emails in my inbox while i'm waiting for it to be picked up
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:00.720]   But I can still watch a youtube video in a pane above that is really nice
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:08.480]   Especially on the note seven on the new note to tablet the ability to again do that sort of split screen screen one tap one panel for
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.760]   Productivity another panel for uh to keep a track of communications
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:16.160]   So it's not it's not as dire as all that but they certainly have a way to go to
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.640]   Be the superlative of anything
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:21.520]   I'm also not 100 sure that they will ever
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:25.280]   Move towards ties in as an operating system because they give up so much
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:29.520]   Uh in order to not just if they stop using android they give up so much
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:32.000]   They don't they don't want they don't want to be known as a google phone
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.120]   But they definitely want people to have google apps on them and that's gonna
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:38.400]   Well, I think that they give up i don't think i think that's a five-year curve
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.200]   I don't think it's something they do in a year, but I think that well in five five years
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.520]   Apple might might stop doing ios they might have decided to do something more impressive than that
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:49.840]   So that's right five years might be five might might we might not be walking upright
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:50.960]   We might be just
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:54.640]   Ungulating like uh modules of light as human beings in five years
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:59.920]   But to leo's point, I mean sam'sling really does believe that awareness creates sales and they will spend as much and again
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:05.040]   You know, they are creating conglomerate they make oil rigs they have as much money as their country needs to make rice cookers
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:08.720]   They make fridges they make everything everything yeah and they can spend as much money as they want like now
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:13.840]   They're making moneyable, but they didn't for a while and they unlike other companies like blackberry and palm and HTC
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:19.120]   Who can't take those kind of losses sounds like could take as much loss as they want and they were willing to do that to buy awareness
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:23.680]   And now so many people just think of android as sam's on it's really just delivers huge benefits for them
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.720]   Yep
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:29.360]   And yet there are gonna be some great androids phones the motor oil ass x plus one we've got an op-o
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:35.440]   One plus one here the op-of-fine-seven. There's some really good phones out there. Shao me. Yeah
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.760]   um
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.520]   But they don't exist
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.320]   It's really an iPhone sam's song world especially in the u.s
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.040]   Question thank you for the question franklin
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:52.160]   Question three next question is from jeffrey jameson from chilowak chilowak
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.200]   What are you most excited about in Yosemite?
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.520]   Do you know where chilowak is i don't know where chilowak is
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.880]   cholombia
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.400]   interesting yes
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.560]   More canadianisms love the canadians
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.520]   We brought him in with the with the movie before the show. Yeah
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.800]   So yeah, what are you most excited about in Yosemite?
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.040]   For me it's continuity
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.240]   It's just this ability to have one seamless experience between all these devices
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.920]   That's really all i've ever wanted
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.680]   I mean the fact that I I switched i switched to chrome from safari for a couple of reasons
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:25.680]   But the majority of it is that really just because if i'm using chrome on every single one of my mobile devices
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.920]   All the work that I do through browsing becomes one single experience. There's no syncing
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.000]   There's no copying anything. There's no
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.240]   Giving permissions to anything it just all exists
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.560]   So I think that once we're in a full ios 8 in Yosemite world
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:43.520]   There will be fewer times when I even feel the desire to take my macbook out of the office
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:48.640]   Even if it's just for two or three hours because the ability to right right now one of the one of the hang-ups
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.040]   Continues to be just getting data
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:57.520]   App data from one to another by between the ipad and my macbook and it's not that it's really difficult
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.680]   It's just that it's one step on my macbook
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.600]   I simply close the lid put it in the bag and leave about the day that I can just simply
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.760]   By virtue of the fact that the ipad is in the same room as or the same network
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.200]   Even as this mac and it knows that oh you're working on this document
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:15.440]   Well, I have also synced this document and I have a version of this app for ios
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:21.760]   I can just pick up right where you left off including here's where you're editing cursor was at the point at which you decided to leave the house
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.760]   That's going to be
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.760]   You like little changes that make things easier
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:29.040]   But they're very rarely that an operating system upgrade
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:34.160]   Changes the way that you work with something and that will change the way that I work with with these devices
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.280]   I like the new Siri and the new system spotlight fine thing
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.760]   So I don't need a quick silver on there and he doesn't use quick silver
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.600]   So but I like that kind of stuff. I do I'm afraid i'm gonna go with Andy
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:49.440]   I use so many different devices like for instance like my texting is all done with hangouts now because
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.200]   No matter what computer i'm on no matter what device i'm on I had the same
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.040]   conversation going on, you know
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:58.240]   Whether it's an android phone or an iphone or whatever whatever country i'm in
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:02.160]   I just pick pick up whatever i'm doing and i'm going fair is not going over to the other side
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:07.680]   I understand but what i'm saying as an example though continuity is is that
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.600]   Um, that's true though. A message is does the same thing, right? Yeah, right?
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.920]   But the reason I don't use messages. I mean this is the problem
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.640]   The reason I don't use messages is because it doesn't work on my android phones
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.960]   so I think but I think that the
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.680]   uh, but I think that it is a
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:25.920]   That being able to do that is gonna have me actually use my ipad more
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.320]   I mean I feel like I I love the ipad and everything else
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:31.040]   But I think my parents use their ipads far more than I use mine
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:35.440]   Just because i'm just i'm too old and I know like like I just feel like I need my keyboard and
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.080]   Um, and so I think that but being able to just do some of the little stuff and know that I can come right back
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:43.280]   I think that's a it's gonna be important too for continuity. What do you think Renee?
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:47.280]   Oh because Alex and Andy already sung a praise of the continuity. I'm gonna go with extensibility
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.440]   And I think on iOS it's in arguably the biggest advanced the app store but on a
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.240]   We're talking about you somebody not
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.280]   Yeah, there's a lot of benefit too. Sorry. Yeah, why
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.600]   Extensions are on on on on you semi-yard thing. They are on Yosemite
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:07.600]   So Yosemite is getting the uh today view widgets so you'll be able to do a lot of things in the widgets
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.120]   Which are very interesting they're getting um iCloud drive and it's going to be
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:15.520]   Shown to you actually in an iCloud drive but because there are storage provider extensions
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:19.040]   If you don't want to use iCloud drive you can use uh drop box in there
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.360]   You can use one drive in there. You can use google drive in there
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:27.360]   You can apple's giving them as far as i can tell as much access and and the same kind of access as iCloud
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:31.600]   And again, maybe that's because ibm wants to be able to put enterprise data stores in there
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:37.360]   But whatever i benefit that's great. I did not know that they had i didn't really see that highlighted that i've been ready
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:40.640]   You got extensibility all we all for the last two weeks. It's making me so happy
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.800]   uh also action extensions so
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:47.760]   There's both sharing an action but action extensions means that you'll be able to do things like markdown in mail
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.920]   Markdown sorry markup isn't just in mail that extension can run anywhere in os 10
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:55.920]   So you can do mark up in any app but you can also for example the new photos app
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:00.880]   Won't have everything that aperture has but it it it'll it'll conclude support for the photos extension
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:04.080]   So people can make all these plugins for it that could conceivably do
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:11.040]   Whole scads of productivity in in the photo context for us and sharing extensions means that things like instagram and things like
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:11.920]   um
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:16.320]   Pinterest whatever you like can be an equal citizen with the apple partners like twitter and facebook
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:19.840]   So I think it's good. It's again. It's like it's not as apparent as continuity
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:22.640]   But I think the level of power that we'll be able to get out of it. It's gonna be really
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.880]   It's not the first time apples try this remember services
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.560]   Yes
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.240]   Those are buried though. These are front and center
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:33.760]   I mean, but but that's the point is that these capabilities are this is not new. It just uh,
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:37.040]   It wasn't widely used. I loved so I was very high on services
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.720]   We used it. We used a lot of services
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.440]   But uh nobody ever and they're still there I guess but nobody ever really
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:44.880]   It's better for anyone because drop blocks previously had to hack their way into os 10
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:49.120]   Now that there's an extension right for the finder, you know, there's an apple approved way to do that functionality
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.680]   Um, and yeah, again, it's not it
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.880]   IOS is getting all the attention for this, but I think it's just as valuable
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.520]   Maybe not just probably but still still super valuable in os 10
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.600]   Oh, it's I think that I agree if if the question were but ios
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:07.760]   Ios 8 and Yosemite I would certainly have chosen extensions because it's not in in
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.680]   in uh
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:10.240]   in
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:11.680]   Mac OS
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:18.400]   It adds functionality. It's an improved way of doing something that we've seen happen on uh mac before
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.320]   On ios. It's sort of like well. There's this car called the pinto
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:26.160]   It's a great car unless someone ruins you in which case you will explode and die
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:29.200]   to me the lack of extensibility in ios is the
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:35.040]   Exploding and die aspect feature and they've said well tell you what what if we said that we we heard you
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:40.560]   We understand that you don't want your your children to explode and die in a low level level accident
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:45.360]   What if we were to give you this thing that's been a really valuable part of every other phone experience for the past two
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:48.160]   Three years and how you can do it too. That's it's another one of those
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:54.000]   This is almost like an entirely new phone for with for me by virtue of the fact that now I have
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.120]   extensibility and the ability for apps to talk to each other so
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:01.600]   Yeah, I agree but contour. I just wanted to give extensibility a little bit of love. Yeah, good
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:05.040]   Well, and you open my eyes to it. Although
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.640]   You know what's not necessarily you like and he said and i've said
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:14.000]   It's not the first time we've seen this attempted well, I mean while it's not necessarily you somebody thing. I I think swift is going to be
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.120]   I use the beginning of programming language. Well, I think it's me
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:22.800]   Much bigger over the next couple years. I think that we're gonna see a lot of us tend to perfectly reasonable. Yep. All right
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:27.280]   Thank you, uh, Jeffrey for that one more questions more questions here we go. Um
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.120]   Fronicity
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:33.840]   Uh, make them on make them on from Chicago. She sounds like a action figure
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:43.280]   Megurmon Megurman Megurman. Uh, there's no way that apple can't be thinking about acquiring a tech company that also is involved heavily in coffee, right?
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.600]   What would that be blue blue bottle?
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:54.080]   Apple's thinking about buying blue bottle. No, that would be great if just a good room. Every let's start that starbucks
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:59.760]   Let's no not starbucks site glass every apple store needs a blue bottle every apple store needs a blue bottle
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:04.400]   Wow, I like that. What other tech companies are heavily involved in coffee
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.800]   I
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.600]   Well, there was another question earlier on that that was uh
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:14.480]   It's also about apple partnering up with starbucks. I think that was the is there a rumor going around?
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:19.040]   I don't know. It was two different questions. Hmm. Anyway, so
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:23.840]   All right next question. I had a lot of companies. Go ahead. Next question here is
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.080]   from uh
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:32.160]   Craig shelter from charlotte north carolina. I was there two days ago. Hello. She's on it. Um, will apple
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:37.040]   Fine finally get the cloud right with ios 8 and cloud drive
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:40.800]   That's a big question. Yeah
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:43.840]   All of us are just like
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:49.920]   It's not cloud drive though. It's cloud like the exciting thing is cloud kit because cloud drive is based on it
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.920]   The new photo system is based on it from what i've talked to developers about it is a much more
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:57.360]   It's much simpler solution. You basically store key values or blobs there
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:00.560]   Uh, it's built on the back end of of uh, microsoft asia
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.880]   I think there might be some amazon stuff behind it too
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:05.200]   But it's it looks really solid
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:10.160]   It people seem to like it whether they'll fly back to it after being burned with icloud before is a big question
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.400]   But I think it's a huge step in the right direction
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:16.560]   All right. Thank you for all your questions. Thank you for the question engine. Yep
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:19.840]   We love uh, we only do it when a alex is here because
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:25.760]   He has the keys to the king time. Let me give you those keys. You guys can have the keys anytime i like doing it
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.440]   It's fun. We were talking about sam selling all the money they spent on advertising
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:34.080]   But apple does some pretty fair ads. I thought this one. I haven't seen a mac ad in ages
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:38.640]   Yeah, I thought this one was a really nice ad especially was the last one which one
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:45.840]   2012 the retina macbook pro is a lot's been that long i believe so, you know this one was a real tip of the hat today cult of mac watch
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:52.240]   Uh
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:56.240]   There's showing the backs of the macbooks and all the decals
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.360]   Things people do with their little apple
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.640]   I just wonder about all the clearances they had to get for all these
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:05.200]   characters, yeah, they got melo kitty and homers simpson and
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:10.400]   One i noticed that i noticed that they had a run of dc commerce characters no marvel comets characters
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.600]   Um, disney made like at least three of three appearances
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.040]   So there's no attack
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.120]   So those of you listening didn't just heard music but it said the notebook people love
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:25.840]   The macbook air and the whole point of it was how people have customized their macbook airs with stickers, which everybody does
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.920]   Yep, that music makes you want to crump
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.840]   I prefer to be a big I don't like for all your stickers
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:36.080]   So you just throw stuff google chrome and android, but then there's also red
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.040]   Twit pixel core i picked score for apart
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:43.920]   But yeah, but i kind of like it. You think you think they waited until johnny i was on vacation
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.640]   Before they filmed that
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:51.120]   You've ruined the most beautiful computer i've ever made it was aluminium and you really
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.200]   Solve we've solved the problem of decorating computers by making a laptop that was so beautiful
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.000]   Nobody would ever want to put anything on it
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.400]   We we anticipate that the secondary market for stickers will dry up within two months you're welcome
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:09.200]   Was sorry johnny was so so sorry johnny do you uh you guys have stickers out?
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.440]   Do you what do you do rene you have a sticker on your macbook?
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:16.160]   I well i don't have any twit stickers, which is one of the reasons but i do not have any we can do that we can fix that
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.760]   We'll send you some awesome, but i don't i don't currently have any stickers on my macbook
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.120]   I'm always looking maybe a nice iron man or i got tired of peeling them off
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.240]   That's why i added this spec that's what i do i put a shell on the
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:31.360]   And i have a nice idea because it's really nice to have a clean macbook when you take the shell off then it's like brand new
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:37.520]   It's pretty sweet. Yeah, i have a shell on mine and mostly don't see so that during baggage during tsa screenings
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:41.520]   I know that this is my notebook. Please nobody take mine. They do all i wonder i wonder though
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.000]   Does it does i wonder who was the first person to come up with the snow white sticker because that was
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:50.240]   She's holding the apple logo holding holding the apple
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:54.720]   And someone had to be the first person to think of that and produce that sticker and whoever it is
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:02.320]   He's not up there with the the guy who designed the rubik's cube, but man they deserve some sort of a design award because that's just i think it's jellus skins right
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:07.920]   I don't know. I don't know those jellus skins. There was the music skins who did all the beetle stuff
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:13.280]   There was but for a long time jellus can is really all this whole they really do the whole yeah
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.280]   And they were the one on at sea they were the ones who hired real artists
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.720]   To do the jellus skins. I saw them first at mac world
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:28.800]   Um, i've had a lot of jellus skins me too. They're awesome really gorgeous
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:37.120]   The omg craft logo on the back of my computer is a jellus skin is so you could have custom. Yeah, it's amazing now. I want to we had
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.120]   On the twit on sunday. We had ben toms and from
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:45.600]   Stretecherie. He used to work for wordpress.com. I'm sorry for automatic
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:53.680]   Matt maulin wigs company that created supports wordpress.com and he said everybody works at wordpress.com gets a custom mac book
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:56.320]   uh, you know aluminum
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:01.360]   Uh shell but instead of the apple it's a w they literally replaced the apple
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:06.160]   Wow, it's the word press w and somebody sent me a link. There's a company that does this
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:09.760]   That will make a um an apple like a mac book
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:15.120]   Metal, you know, I guess I don't know how hard it is to replace the metal on there, but uh
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:17.760]   Does anybody in the chat remember where that was?
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.200]   It is a batman logo right there
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.240]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:28.160]   I'm thinking maybe we'd get some twit ones cut out. Yeah, you know
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:31.680]   um
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:37.200]   Or maple leaf teapots or maple leaf teapots. Hey, it's time for our tips of the week
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:40.320]   We'll see if I I'll see if I can find that before uh for the end of the show
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:44.720]   Uh, let's start with you rene richy your turn to kick things off
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:48.320]   I have two this week because there were two really interesting apps that were released
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:55.440]   The first one is overcast which is a podcast client by marco armont who he'll might know from insta paper and from the magazine
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:58.880]   And podcast clients, you know, people are listening to podcast right now
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:04.400]   So obviously, you know a lot of people like podcast they've become a really interesting category because so many
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.480]   Really good designers and developers are making them and they're not monotonous at all
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:12.960]   Everyone has a very different idea about what's important how opinionated you should be versus, you know, how flexible
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:16.640]   You should be how many options you should have and overcast is definitely opinionated
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:20.800]   You know marco armont has a very specific sensibility and he wants a very specific experience
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:24.960]   But it's flexible where it needs to be it's a really well done well designed app
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:28.080]   You wrote his own his own audio engine using core audio
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.080]   We didn't want to use the built-in avi foundation stuff
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.800]   It does really smart things like it has a smart speed
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:39.120]   So it'll automatically adjust the speed of the recording depending on how fast the host speaks and how many pauses they have between their words
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:43.680]   And it shows you how much time you've saved when you've used it. They could say it saved you 10 minutes 20 minutes
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.040]   30 minutes
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.480]   It also does an audio boost
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:50.160]   So if people have different volumes or the volume is low it boosts it up for you
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:53.280]   And i've had podcast that for some reason one person was louder
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:57.040]   One person, you know wasn't or it was just generally not loud enough
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:01.200]   So it does a lot of really clever things there are a couple drawbacks still it is a 1.0
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:04.960]   There's no support for video podcast yet. There's also no support for streaming
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.360]   So you have to download stuff that you want
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:11.360]   But it's got a lot of really really clever features built into it. I was on the beta
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.040]   So i've been using it for
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:17.360]   Over a month now and i'm currently using it as my main podcast client very happy with it
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.280]   It's worth a look
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:21.840]   And the second one is ours which is by tappity apps
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.000]   Which is jeremy oldson and this is a time tracking app
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:32.400]   And you know there's a lot of those as well, but he's been working i think two or three years on this and he's had very specific ideas
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.200]   And he put it together very very well
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:39.520]   It's it's received a lot of attention. You know he's not as well-known a developer
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.880]   Someone like marco arma
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:43.920]   But he's a really attentive developer and he built this
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:47.040]   Sort of to scratch his own itch which is what a lot of adult developers do
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:50.400]   But if you were in any sort of time tracking and people immediately joke, you know
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.720]   Lawyers bill in six-minute intervals you may not want to build in six-minute intervals
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.480]   But you might be doing consulting work
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:01.360]   You might be doing client work and he makes it as easy as possible for you to keep track of those billable hours
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:05.760]   And again, it's really really well designed. So i wanted to make sure both of those got mentioned
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:13.360]   Great rene. Thank you. Yeah, i've really been saying a lot of energy that we all have a twit thinking about how people listen to our shows
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:16.320]   It's pretty obvious that no one listens to shows by
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:23.920]   Subscribing them into them in iTunes hooking up their iPod to the iTunes right sinking that's kind of downloading
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.560]   John Syracuse that still does but i think he's the only one it doesn't really because it seems yeah iPod shuffle
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:33.600]   It seems really old school and of course, that's how we built our business
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:41.120]   Uh the podcast app on iOS and the various apps on other platforms seem to be important our own apps of course important
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:45.760]   Oh, I didn't mention that the because apples podcast app is free and it's the most popular app arm
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:48.720]   I made his app free too. So you get the entire app is free
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:52.640]   There's some features that you need to pay like you get I think you get the smart speed and smart
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:59.520]   Audience smart sound for 10 minutes for free. There's a five dollar in-app purchase if you want to unlock all the other features. Yeah
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.640]   Thank you marco for doing that
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:06.720]   Chatham tells me that the place to go if you want to get your
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.040]   MacBook cover
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:14.720]   Customized to have a chakshoul aluminum cut out is called uncover at uncover mac
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.520]   Dot com
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:22.480]   And uh, I don't know how hard this must be but they have some really cool
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:25.360]   Logos. I don't know what install which is it?
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:28.800]   Uh, I remember them being like around a hundred something
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.720]   I wish I could figure I had a point and clip on this computer
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:36.800]   Sure, there's a way to do it. Wow
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:42.640]   I like I liked that a lot of these designs were seeing they're sort of like when someone has a bad tattoo from their youth and they try to get a cover up
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:47.600]   Yeah, that has to sort of incorporate the ink in it without making it look like this is the three dog night tattoo
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:53.760]   And so you've got you've got some they're like incorporating the logo by sort of incorporating some of the contours without making it look
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:59.200]   Oh, they're a little more expensive. There's 399 euros for a circle if you want to custom
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.840]   It's 600 euros
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:08.720]   I watch for that. Yeah, that's kind of that's that's pretty pricey as almost a thousand bucks
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:13.760]   Uh, never mind. I presume you have to send them your mac. It's just one Alex
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.560]   Come on
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.400]   Just an Alex
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:22.800]   If you're like a band though or like a DJ, you know, this if you're gonna be out there in front of a lot of people
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.840]   Yeah, sense
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:25.840]   I want one. I want to twit one
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:32.000]   If you want a trick venture capitalist into thinking that you've developed your own computer laptop design that's a good as apples
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.080]   Yeah, that's cheap money invented it
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.160]   Alex lizzy. What do you got for us?
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:41.040]   So we've been doing mac brag for a long time. We certainly have and back in the early days
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:45.120]   In fact episode number one. We had a different well on a different set of hosts. We're still here
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:51.200]   We had amber and emery wells. Yes. Emery has come out with a new piece of software all new new web service
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.040]   I love you embers
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:57.280]   And um, i've been starting to play with it. It's really cool. So this is uh, all right, it's
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.880]   You can you can get notified when it's more publicly available, but it's called frame.io
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:06.320]   And it's really for people who are professionals. I mean people who are if you're working on
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.600]   uh
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:08.480]   sending
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:13.760]   You know putting up files and having them reviewed and having people able to draw on them and say change this and move this around and really
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:18.720]   Taking care of all of those things as a as a production company. Um, this is a way to
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:24.880]   Manage all of that. Um really effectively. So it's really and and it's the it's the best one that i've seen so far
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.560]   So if you're interested in this if this is something that's been driving you crazy collaborative
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.800]   um, you know
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.800]   creative development
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:39.040]   Um, it's a pretty pretty slick, uh, system that's um that he's rolling out. So I would highly suggest
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.680]   uh, at least sign up for the uh
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:46.800]   It's signed up. It's video sharing. It's video sharing, but it's also video commenting
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.600]   So and specifically within a creative community
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:54.640]   So if you're not a creative community, but like i'm a team i'm a producer and someone's uploading stuff and i'm marking it up and saying
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:58.960]   We need to change this and we need to move this around and we you know and it's and it's going to play back and it's framed.io
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:04.800]   someone's asking in the in the chat room, um, and uh, uh, uh, uh, and it's a really um
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.720]   So you can see how you can annotate stuff and and comment on it and so on so forth
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:13.200]   So if you're and keeps track of you know versions and all those things and emry's done a lot of production
[01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:17.360]   I mean he still does a lot of production. So this is really not driven by someone who thought this was a good idea
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.520]   But this is someone who actually does this every day
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:23.520]   And um, you know, you can see kind of how that's done, but I would highly suggest
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.920]   Getting on the list now before everyone else hears about it
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:28.720]   I know I just said it so if you're listening to it live and do it now before everyone else
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:35.840]   Listens to the show, but um, but I would definitely get on the list because I think this is going to be something that a lot of people are going to enjoy using
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:39.040]   So anyway frame dot.io frame y'all
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:44.160]   Now the chat room is saying that another company called colorware
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:47.200]   Is the company that did the word press?
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:48.400]   A logo
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.120]   How much is that?
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:52.240]   More phones too. Yeah, and they're less less expensive
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:57.360]   Oh, they kind of show you a little bit of show you how they do it. Yeah, they do take off the cover
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:01.440]   First the entire laptop is disassembled and that's what the word is
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:04.960]   The lid of the laptop is taken to the colorware machine shop
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:11.680]   Where it will never be seen from or heard from again, then the basic shape of the new logo is machine from the laptop
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:14.960]   Lid the opening is where the new logo will be placed
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:21.680]   Well, Alex's friends can't even leave them a tsa. I imagine this exactly. Wow. So there's actually the word press
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.400]   That is pretty sweet
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.960]   Wouldn't mind that with a little twit thing there
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:32.640]   Maybe when the apple comes out with a new laptop all spring from so tempted the retina my book early on much
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.640]   Is this one was a big tip?
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:39.440]   If you have to ask exactly you can't avoid it
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:46.160]   So chowram did say it was less expensive. I don't colorware c o l o r w a r
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.600]   e
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.600]   Your pick of the week mr. Nieckenma. Oh
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:54.960]   Mine is the sort of game. I really like i'm sorry, but my cable was not let me
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:59.680]   Broadcast us to the thing behind me. This is it's a game called f sim space shuttle
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:03.120]   All it is is a space shuttle landing simulator
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:09.680]   Where this is a replay of my last attempt to land the shuttle it gives you it uses of course all the tilt and motion sensors
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.000]   To do your final approach
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.240]   There's also anyone let me change the camera view
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:20.000]   There are also a lot of different views available because the graphics on this are just amazing
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:24.320]   It really does look like photo realism depending on what camera angle you take
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.720]   Uh, so you're obviously you want to get yeah
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:32.880]   This is me figuring out that which one is the rudder control and which one is the brake control because you're kind of supposed to be on that
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:35.120]   Yeah, see someone had a parachute out there
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:38.880]   You really want to line it up right there on that center line there
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:42.960]   Uh, they give you after you land you do get a score on how well you did
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:47.680]   And let me tell you this is not like the game is not like a long long mission to live
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:53.120]   Uh, not long long shuttle mission all it does is it sets you up for your approach to land this thing
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:56.800]   You can look at the cockpit. You can look at your instruments you can choose
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:59.200]   You can choose the view from the from the chase plane
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:03.200]   There are some on-screen guidance to show you where you should be lined up
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.080]   And it really is just this it's it's like city
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:09.920]   It's like having a basketball hoop in your driveway and you've got a basketball in your hands
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:15.360]   And you can over the course of hours days weeks and months just get better and better at shooting free throws
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.880]   And that's how much fun this thing is one simple thing
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:23.120]   But you do it successfully once and then you think okay, but I was way off that line
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:26.000]   I was sort of skidding left and right and my score kind of sucks
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.760]   I want to see if I can what did I do wrong?
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:34.560]   How can I do this better and it is just so entertaining and almost meditative because it's all about tiny little like motions
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:38.080]   Works on the works on the works great on the iphone works also in the ipad
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:44.640]   I have sometimes been playing it via airplay on my big tv and that's like this that that is my real
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.200]   Oh
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:52.160]   Gameplay moment when I got this big screen in front of me, uh, it's five bucks, but damn worth it
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:59.920]   Lipping back to rene's recommendation of overcast. I'm so glad that uh that he priced it
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:05.280]   Uh, I'm so glad that that that he priced it at five bucks for the unlocked features
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:08.400]   I think that too many games and mobile apps are underpriced
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:12.880]   And I think that five bucks is not too much to ask for a really nice polished
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:18.000]   Professionally done app as opposed to a simple flashlight or or sound effects app
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.600]   So I'm I'm this is worth it's five bucks worth every penny of it 10 bucks
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:25.040]   Maybe I have to think about it, but five bucks. I was more than willing to give them five bucks for it
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:27.760]   I have to admit that I mean, I'm quite happy paying a little bit more
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:29.760]   I mean, I know that we've gone to this thing like everything's a dollar
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:34.560]   But I actually want to see people charge a little bit more for the apps because I want to make sure that they're successful
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.080]   I want to make sure this is a business for them
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:38.800]   I want this to be their main job if I'm buying an app and I'm going to use it
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:43.840]   You know, I want it to be I want them to make enough money in the first couple weeks that they could hire more programmers or do whatever
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:49.280]   They need to do to make a great stand. I don't want to see ads in the app and I don't want in app purchases
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.920]   That's over to the hundreds of dollars. Yeah, there are no in-app purchases on this game
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:58.080]   You buy it you own it, uh, and yeah, I mean just just as you're saying Alex
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:04.640]   I think that if you help somebody to become successful enough that they can afford to take a two-week vacation to someplace nice
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:10.400]   During that two weeks of downtime where they're not coding is when their brain is going to give them great ideas for the next big app
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:17.440]   So it really does that extra $2 or $3 you're spending will pay off in the long run in the form of a brilliant new app that wouldn't exist
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:26.000]   Otherwise, I think actually, you know, the ec the european union has compelled google to stop listing apps with in-app purchases as free
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.600]   In the play store and they I think they've advised Apple to
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:35.360]   What's the alternatively like we've been thinking about this like if it's a game if it's like overcast overcast is free with one purchase
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:40.560]   But candy crush is a very different non-free game. Well, just don't put it in that free category
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.400]   You know, I mean that's misleading because it really aren't playable free many of these
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:51.760]   Uh now it is unfair because candy crush, you know, you really need to buy something, but maybe this you don't I don't know
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.760]   I mean there are games
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:58.480]   Plants versus zombies. I really felt like the new one really I just lost interest
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:01.120]   It was like there's too many things that I had to purchase on the other hand
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:05.840]   Fieldrunners, um, you know, I can completely play without buying anything
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:10.640]   But I still I probably spend more money on field learners because I I buy a little extra point so that I can buy
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:16.080]   Infectious poison leaves it really and I'm not sure what you label it like you label it as free within app
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:21.280]   I mean is is phi app something that a normal person I pay for your runners. It's not like I paid like a call of freemium
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:28.000]   There's freemium and pay me. Um, what's pay me? Um when it's there's a price upfront and an app purchase. Oh, I hate that
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:34.240]   I mean last week one of a candidate for my pick of the week was uh the the electronic arts and lb
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:40.160]   2014 app they created a home run derby app that was just all you all you're doing is the
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:45.440]   That the the picture is throwing tomatoes right at you and all you got to do is swing and hit dingers
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:50.640]   Fun fun a fun concept, but it was just every 10 seconds
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:55.280]   There was some sort of a harang for you know if you bought this special bat you could bring it around faster
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:59.360]   How about a cap with a logo of your favorite? I don't I just want to hit all runs
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:04.640]   I want to put a dollar and feed a dollar to the machine and then it throws 20 things. I mean it's terrible
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:11.120]   Well, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this ranch portion of the program. We are done done done
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:14.160]   Andy and aco from the chicago sun times
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:19.920]   Is always a pleasure. Thank you for being here my friend always a slice. Thanks for having a wonderful

[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:31.600]   I'm getting caught back up. I'm way behind but I'm trying to get it
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:37.520]   It's so hard to I don't know how you do it where you schedule your entire day to be sitting in front of a microphone and talking
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:42.400]   All I have to do is find 45 minutes to every single week read what I wrote last week
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:47.200]   And it's like if I scheduled for wednesday something tells me why don't I try to do it Tuesday that I don't do Tuesday
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:49.200]   I plan to do it through oh goodness
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:51.520]   My generation for you. Oh great. That's not
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.560]   It's nothing. I'm not doing anything
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:28:02.160]   Renee ritchie. I'm more calm the mobile nations is debug podcast many other
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:06.160]   Anything you want to plug all sorts of stuff going on over there. I know
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:10.800]   The latest debug if anyone's interested in swift we had a swift roundtable with don melton who did wick
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:16.720]   Webkit and safari brent simmons who did net newswire and vesper and natalia baredes who did vu uh kudu
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:19.360]   kitchen, but
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:23.120]   I don't know very much about programming and I understood a lot of it and I was really impressed with it
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.080]   So I if anyone is interested in swift check it out very good
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:31.760]   Alex been nice seeing you safe good rambles. Thank you. Don't know when we'll see you again, but that's part of the fun
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:33.040]   Yes

[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:39.920]   He survived

[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:04.320]   And in overcast he has a list of all the alternative podcast if abs if you don't like his which is a very classy
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.000]   Wow, that's very classy. Yeah, sounds like overcast is the one though. I'm gonna try that
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.080]   Uh, it's yeah
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:14.160]   It's it's a it's a good there's such a personal approach to podcast apps
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:19.840]   And i'm glad that there are five or six really good ones because if you think that that a certain that that downcast is terrible
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:24.400]   It's not because it's terrible. It's because it's working in a way that's not in harmony with what you like and maybe you'll like overcast
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.000]   Right there are choices
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.400]   We also encourage people to try stitcher and uh and commercial apps like that as well
