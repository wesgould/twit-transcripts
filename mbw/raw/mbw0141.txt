[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Hey, I'm Don McAllister.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Boy, I mean, Olid would be great.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.280]   I can't say that LG is definitely making some of the new screens for Apple, but it's
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:11.080]   like the 24-inch LEDs.
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:15.280]   It's not, I don't have any information that it's for the iPhone.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.760]   They are, in fact, making some of the new cinema displays.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.760]   Oh, interesting.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.560]   They are more energy efficient.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.560]   That is factual.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.240]   An OLED iPhone would only need to light up parts of the screen that are required to emit
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.840]   light leading to vibrant colors with other contrast and deeper blacks.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.160]   It's a better looking screen, isn't it?
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.200]   I mean, it really looks spectacular.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.320]   But the screen is already, I mean, how many people complain about the iPhone screen?
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.320]   Nobody.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.800]   It's already the very best period screen in the marketplace.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.400]   So that's not a place I think Apple needs to spend a lot of R&D money.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.200]   They need to look at the camera, which is a constant source of complaint.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.800]   They need to look at battery life, which is a constant source of complaint, whether
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:58.240]   or not those issues are realistically complained about, isn't it relevant?
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.760]   Those are areas of complaint.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:05.320]   But otherwise, I mean, the screen, every screen I look at, pales in comparison with the original
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.320]   iPhones.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.080]   The OLED would make those display thinner and fewer parts, wouldn't it?
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.080]   Yes.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.080]   I think OLEDs are good.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.640]   If they can do it, I think there's a lot of reason to do it.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.880]   Oh, I think it'd be great.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.280]   I just don't think they're gonna.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.080]   I'd love to see OLEDs.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.840]   One of the things Blackberry's doing very well, the screens are getting better and better.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.960]   The bold screen is gorgeous.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.000]   I don't know if it's an OLED.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.280]   I think it might be.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.560]   If I ever have a son, I'm gonna name him OLED.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.560]   OLED.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.720]   That's very popular name.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.720]   And in a sort of...
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.680]   In Utrecht in the Netherlands, is it not Michelle OLED?
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.680]   Everybody is called OLED.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.120]   We have a visitor from the Netherlands.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:50.680]   He's our Netherlands expert today because he's the only person in the room from the Netherlands.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.680]   According to research, and you know how important it is to do...
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.480]   Was that a capital R?
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.480]   Research.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.720]   This is from a company called Brand Index.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.680]   They do research.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.240]   They actually did research on...
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:12.160]   According to ad age, on the effectiveness of Microsoft's anti-Mac ads, and they say
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.920]   it's working.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:23.440]   And index found the younger folk gave Apple its highest rating last winter.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.840]   It notched a value score.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:32.360]   Now this is their rating in on value of 70 on a scale of minus 100 to 100.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.640]   But its score began to fall shortly after and despite brief rallies, hovers around from
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:45.440]   72, 12.40 means equal amounts of positive and negative feedback about a brand.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.000]   Microsoft on the other hand went from zero in early February to a value perception score
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.440]   of 46.2.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.560]   People are apparently paying attention to the ads.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.480]   At least that's what Brand Index is thinking and reporting.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.560]   And that's why they do these studies to find out if these ads are working.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.960]   It doesn't say if Microsoft paid for the ad.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:11.680]   They're working on me because I learned last week from Microsoft that it cost me $30,000
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.680]   to fill my iPod.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.680]   Unbelievable.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.680]   That's what we account last week.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.680]   $27,495 was charged to it.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.000]   I was like, I must be true.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   They're right.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.160]   Must be true.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.280]   So there's the, for those of you watching on video, there's the graph.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.280]   You can see the graph.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.280]   If you get the story from ad age, you've got your, you've got your mind, you got your
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.280]   mind share graph.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.840]   You got your buzz graph, your index graph, your impression graph, your quality graph,
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:43.280]   your, your graph, psycho, gravitational set, but on my, for value, I you graph, they've
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.280]   crossed the lines.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.920]   Microsoft is blue and is going up.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.320]   Apple is orange and going down.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:54.560]   They've crossed the wires, the streams are crossed.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.560]   So do we buy that?
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.280]   I've never heard that just because this is the first time that Microsoft has really presented
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.280]   its.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.280]   Any ad.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:09.000]   Well, I mean, there's never been an ad campaign for Mike, a PC hardware in general,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.280]   as opposed to individual, individual models.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.280]   Right.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.120]   So it's sort of like an inverse of the way that poll results on how people feel about
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.800]   Congress tends to be a little bit weird.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:23.240]   As, as you know, I mean, if you ask people, what do you think of Congress in general,
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.320]   you're talking about 500 people and opinions very negative.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.640]   But if you ask them, how do you feel about your particular Congress person, then the
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.640]   results tend to be a lot different.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.320]   I think maybe we're seeing something like that here.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:38.240]   You're the first time people have a perception about PC hardware in general, as opposed to
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.360]   that PC, you know what that they took home from Best Buy three weeks ago and has been
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.040]   dark for three weeks minus three days.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.040]   Hmm.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.040]   Yes.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.160]   Well, Apple's kicking back.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.160]   Apple's kicking back.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.600]   You've seen the ads, the response to the laptop.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.600]   Hunter ads.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.840]   I just want to say I've never heard of that research company, Leo.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.840]   Brand index.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.840]   And you would know probably.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.760]   I mean, I'm familiar with a lot of the very well known research companies that work on
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.760]   stuff like that.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.480]   And I'm not saying this isn't a legitimate one.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.680]   I'm just saying it's one I'm not familiar with.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.080]   So I'm willing to take that with the grain of salt.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:19.000]   But my position is the fact that Microsoft is spending money to go after its competition,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.080]   that's almost always a bad idea.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.280]   It should be spending money to tout its own success.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:29.040]   Well, and the fact that it has to draw attention to its competition.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.400]   I mean, I think Apple shouldn't do it either.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.400]   I just don't.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.400]   No, but that's what some people have pointed out that at no point do they mention the operating
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.400]   system.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.400]   They never, in any of these ads, and there are four or five of them now, do they say
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.400]   Vista?
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.120]   The V word is never mentioned.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.640]   Did you talk about any software at all?
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.640]   No.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.640]   Right.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.080]   So I forbid everybody knows what's going on.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.520]   But you know, the bottom line is that I think it's a waste of time for both of them.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.880]   They should just both tout their positive traits and let the market decide.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.560]   In any event, I do have to say the newest ad from Apple is quite funny despite the fact
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.360]   that they take my advice where the guy's, you know, calling tech support.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.720]   Should we listen to it?
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:15.640]   Before we do that, I just want to quickly show there is if you go to mackenstein.com, they're
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.240]   dissecting the ad and they do a before and after shot.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:25.120]   Remember, the most recent one is Lauren and Sue, the mom and daughter, and they're hoping
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.080]   to find a laptop.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.800]   They are intercutting between the beginning of the ad where the girls are talking about
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.160]   what laptop they want to get.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:37.080]   In the end of the ad where they get the money, the clouds apparently have decided not to
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.520]   move.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.280]   The cars are exactly the same.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.280]   It's pretty obvious.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.320]   This shot was done sequentially, right?
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.320]   You can hardly see it, but go to mackenstein.com.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.200]   The conclusion is pretty clear.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.200]   Cotton hoodie.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.800]   You know, I mean, come on.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.020]   What that means is the entire ad is faked, right?
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.200]   Because they shot the, you're going to go look for it now.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.200]   And then they said, okay, cut.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.040]   All right, let's quickly, we're going to give you the money.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.240]   You act excited, right?
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.240]   Right.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.240]   Okay.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.960]   So if you had success, we're going to cut.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.960]   Well, why not?
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.960]   Why waste the time?
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.880]   You've shot films and much easier just as when you're up there, you got the setup on
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.880]   the parking lot.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.880]   You got the lights.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.880]   You got the gold reflector.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.880]   You got the sun.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.880]   You move the cars.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.880]   You move the cars.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.480]   Clouds, clouds change radically in 15 minutes.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.080]   So this was done back to back.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.080]   Within seconds.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.120]   You know, the fact that this isn't real is just ship my content.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.880]   Change your mind sky.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.520]   I mean, I'm starting to think maybe the Easter Bunny isn't real now.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.440]   It's pretty cheesy.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.440]   I have to say it's kind of, I mean, you're right.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.520]   You move the cars.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.240]   They didn't even move the cars.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.200]   When will these ad agencies understand that the way the world works now is that you just
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.400]   organically do stuff and people will respect it a lot better.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.400]   Don't lie.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.080]   Again, especially since Microsoft has such a great argument to make here.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:01.680]   I thought the first I'm a Mac, I'm a PCS that just didn't click with me was the one where
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.720]   you can tell that this was produced in response to the Microsoft ads, which, you know, Mr.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.640]   PC has a whole line of PCs behind him.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.840]   It's OK, everyone who's who doesn't have the power that video step back, everyone who doesn't
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:13.920]   step back.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:19.720]   And but you get I had a briefing with the ASOS company that's been really, really going
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.480]   forward and diversifying their range of Windows.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.480]   Nope.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.480]   Oh, sorry.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.480]   Sorry.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.480]   Go ahead.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.480]   Keep talking.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.480]   I'm just going to wrap it up.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.680]   I mean, I saw at least three machines that at least partly made me think, oh, why doesn't
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.680]   Apple make something like this?
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.680]   Oh, why doesn't Apple make something like this?
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.480]   Oh, boy, I'd really love to have that if it ran Mac OS.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:42.240]   They're they're sending me what would probably in a couple of days what will probably could
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.920]   be termed imagine the Mac Book Air only as a true netbook.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:52.680]   So imagine a netbook only super slim and with a it's like, please, please, please.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:57.120]   When I put Windows 7 on you, I will actually really, really like your operating system.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.640]   When that happens, I'm just going to have to go to a cave for about three weeks and reconsider
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.640]   my view towards reality.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.640]   I'm going to say something kind of controversial.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.960]   I think Apple does have a little bit of a clock ticking because Windows 7 is good.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.760]   And I think a lot of Mac users will look at Windows 7 and say, hey, that's that's pretty
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.760]   a pretty spalligan.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:16.720]   Especially when you run Windows 7 on a net on a low powered net, the price increases
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.000]   pretty damn high.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.200]   And that's I mean, Apple's really Apple's going to have to work a lot harder now.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.000]   I mean, they they they they're still ahead.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.480]   They're still the operating system of choice.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:33.640]   But there are a lot of arguments that may no longer be as as powerful a weapon next year
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.640]   as they are today.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.640]   All right.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.200]   I am going to pause for a moment here.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.200]   Jigger.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.200]   All right.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.160]   Let me so you want to do the one PC choice chat.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.160]   That's the one you like.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.320]   Oh, Mac, easy.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.600]   The PC like the radio show on that's what it's good to do.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:54.560]   The one I was laughing at was the one with the genius and girl, the genius.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.560]   That was good.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.960]   This is this is this is this is based spontaneously giving you my approval.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.160]   Yeah, I love that one.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.160]   That's a good one.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.160]   Okay.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.160]   So I've got customer care elimination.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.640]   Oh, that's the customer care one.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:12.320]   I think is the one you're talking about where the genius is standing between the two.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.320]   All right.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.320]   Let me let me play that one then for people here.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:22.320]   They start, you know, I hate sites where the video starts spontaneously.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.280]   This is one of them.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.280]   This is the one I could just sit here and watch these ads all day.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.880]   You see, and I'm a Mac genius.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.800]   Oh, the incredibly helpful Mac geniuses must be so great to have a real person you can
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.960]   go to when you need help.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.960]   What does that do for you?
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.960]   Well, customer care represents.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.960]   I see.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.960]   Okay.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:42.960]   I'll try software then.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.960]   Thanks.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.960]   So what I'm trying to explain is they told me to call you representative.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.960]   You just have computers.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.960]   Customer care.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.960]   That's about the same.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.960]   Same actually.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.960]   That is pretty funny.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:28:01.080]   And that one's that one may be more true than anything we've seen.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.040]   I mean, that one really does strike home.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.240]   I mean, there's there's no way that anybody who's bought a PC can deny that that's the
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.080]   experience compared with going to the genius bar.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.400]   Apple's done a really remarkable job of making that a very positive experience.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.320]   This is the one I wanted to play for for you, Scott Bourne.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.120]   I thought you might you might like this one.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.120]   Hello, my man.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.120]   PC choice.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.120]   Yes.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.920]   The radio show that helps people pick the best PCs for them.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.160]   Hey, let's go to the phones.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.160]   Tom from Kalamazoo.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   You're on the air.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.160]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.160]   What PC do you recommend for people who hate getting viruses?
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.160]   That's a good question.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.160]   Crank call.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.160]   I'm from Fairfield.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.160]   Hello.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.440]   What PC offers great customer support like Mac?
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.840]   No, not doing that one.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.560]   Let's go to from Dearborn, Michigan.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.560]   You're on the air.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.560]   I'm a long time PC user.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.640]   No, I'm thinking about switching to Mac.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.800]   I love doing that.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:53.040]   The fun part is when he continues on and goes on his Nancy Pelosi screed.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.960]   Yeah, right.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.960]   Right.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.960]   These are very clever.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.400]   I have to say they've done a really nice job.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.920]   I think these are the very best in a long time.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.920]   Hodgman's just totally on it.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.920]   He's brilliant.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:05.920]   He's really nailing it.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:06.920]   He's brilliant.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:07.920]   Well, let me show as long as we got it.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.000]   Let me show the elimination one.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.520]   This is the one with the all the PCs involved.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.520]   Oh, Mac.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.520]   I'm a PC.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.280]   You know, there are tons and tons of PCs out there.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.080]   So I brought the whole range by to help find the one that's best for her.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.320]   It's a lot of PCs.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.320]   So what do you want?
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.320]   Well, I want a computer with a big screen.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.760]   OK, small screen speed it.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.760]   What else?
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.400]   Well, I wanted to have a fast processor.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.840]   OK, slow PCs go.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.840]   What else?
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:32.320]   I just need something that works without crashing or viruses or a ton of headaches.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.600]   Did you say no viruses or crashes or headaches?
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.440]   Oh, I'm a Megan.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.440]   I'm a Megan.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.440]   There's a little...
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.680]   I love that last line.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.680]   I'm a Megan.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.680]   I'm a PC.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.680]   No, I'm a Megan.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:51.320]   Somebody in our stick-am chat room said he was having dinner last night with Perfect
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:56.440]   Face for Radio says with a hardcore PC user, Andy Mac, and he Mac person who said he actually
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.960]   liked I'm a Megan.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:03.360]   So it may work for even non-Mac people, you know, to kind of warm them up.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.080]   I think it's great that we're having the battle of the ad campaigns.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.040]   I don't think there's anything wrong with that at all.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.360]   That just it just brings attention to the industry.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.280]   It's a competition's good.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.760]   And I don't think we have to declare a winner.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.760]   No.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.040]   In fact, I hope the market share kind of levels off for Mac.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.040]   I don't want to hire.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.680]   Yeah, because then a virus author is trying to head our way.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.680]   Go away.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.680]   There's nothing to see here.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.680]   We should do that.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.640]   If you watch your windows, go have your windows.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.240]   We're fine with that.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.960]   No need to buy a Mac.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:42.240]   If only we're possible to run financial software, run like personal and valuable information
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.240]   on the Mac.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.240]   It's not a limitation.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.920]   You're just not possible, but credit card information or naughty pictures of your friends.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.920]   Can't do it.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:50.920]   No boring.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.920]   And you can't trade files.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.920]   Something interesting here.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.920]   Yeah, can't try to spread shit.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.880]   Can't run a spreadsheet.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:57.880]   You can't game.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.880]   There's no choices.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.320]   Really, all you can do is edit video and make pretty pictures.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.800]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.800]   Keynote.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.800]   What's that?
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.800]   What's that?
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.680]   They don't even have, I mean, you know, you have to buy PowerPoint.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.760]   All right, I'm going to take a break and tell you about something you can do on a Mac and
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.060]   a PC.
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:19.840]   It's called go to meeting from our friends at Citrix.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:26.800]   Go to meeting is the indispensable way people work with today.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:31.320]   You know, you don't want to travel anymore for in person meetings.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.320]   Nobody has the time.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.320]   Nobody has the inclination.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.320]   Nobody has the money.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.360]   That's why go to meeting is so great.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.360]   You stay where you are.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.640]   You have meetings from your desktop.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.640]   We do it all the time here.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.720]   In fact, Ray Maxwell uses go to meeting.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   He's in Vancouver.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.440]   I'm here in California.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.320]   He puts his shots for his show up on go to meeting.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.320]   They look great.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.320]   They're fast.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.960]   He can point.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.960]   We can collaborate.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.520]   It's great for sales presentations, product demos, training sessions.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.840]   Yes, even making podcasts.

[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Macbreak, weekly.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   I've been trying to get the IRS to use go to meeting so they don't have to be at all.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Are you still going?
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.240]   You're still going all these auditors.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.000]   I've been audited since March 2nd.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.560]   You know, I have a tax attorney who says you don't go.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.720]   I go.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.720]   You have to go?
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.640]   No, I don't actually have to go.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.520]   My attorney and my accountants go, although I did make a couple of visits to give them
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.520]   the stink guy.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.520]   I'm sure that helped.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.560]   Yeah, I was effective.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.000]   This got something to do probably with the fact that our next meeting on June 2nd will
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.800]   be the three month anniversary of the audit.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:15.200]   What are you supposed to bring, cake?
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.200]   Sunglasses.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.200]   So we just give them the stink guy.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.200]   Three months.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.160]   Yeah, every time they say, "Well, bring these records," I do.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.280]   And then I prove what I said with, "Oh, okay."
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.920]   Well, then bring those records.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.920]   Oh, more, more.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.480]   It's just one question.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.040]   I'm sure you have really great legal advice and tax advice.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.640]   Are you, is it possible that the guy is just flirting with you?
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.720]   He's just trying to set up another date.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.720]   I got one.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:43.400]   If you had like some, if you just made like sort of an overt gesture of, you know, of
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:47.800]   affection, like just reached over just kiss, just one big kiss, just right on the way.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.800]   You know, I don't know.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   No way.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   It could all go away.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.480]   He's trying to do something with me that begins with an F, but I don't think it's flirting.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.160]   It could all go away.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.160]   That's what they say.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.160]   Especially if the examiner looks a little bit like Reese Witherspoon because you could
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.360]   be one of those movies.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:07.680]   Oh, didn't one of their movies where the guy had a bakery and had tax problems and.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.680]   There you go.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:12.520]   All I can say is once you get, once they get their hooks into you at the IRS, it's a long
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.520]   road.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.520]   There's another meeting.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.520]   Be welcome.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.520]   Let's see.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.520]   I see if I can find this.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.240]   Let me see if I can find this.
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.400]   Number one in customer experience.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:28.000]   Do they have get a Mac ads in the Netherlands?
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Michelle?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.840]   They're the same ads.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.840]   They speak English there.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.880]   In some other countries where they don't speak English so widely, they have their own
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:35.880]   people.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.720]   But you have John Hodgman and everybody in the good sea.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.440]   I knew I liked the Netherlands.
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.640]   But in the UK, they're different.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.440]   They're different in the UK where they don't speak English.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.440]   They don't speak English.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.600]   So they have to have different people.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.600]   I don't know why that is.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.600]   That makes no sense.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.560]   This is a YouTube video.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:56.920]   You've seen when you go to the New York Times, you've seen how they have the ads on the
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.320]   front.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.920]   The get a Mac ads on the front.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.920]   This is kind of a play.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:02.920]   It's cool.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.120]   The people who are listening, it's a banner ad that goes the entire way to the screen.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.280]   It's a familiar banner ad.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.840]   But also, there's a sidebar ad that interacts with it.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.840]   Right.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:11.840]   Here we go.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.840]   I don't know.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.840]   Is this real or just?
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.840]   It's a little bit when that happens.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:15.840]   When character is a little bit.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.840]   But it gets your attention.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.840]   It's like reach up and starts to turn a little bit.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.840]   I talk to each other.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.840]   So I don't know when this was on the New York Times, but here's what it looked like.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.840]   Hello, Mac.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.840]   I'm a PC.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.840]   How do you look?
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.840]   The results are the latest forces for sure.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:31.080]   So there's Apple ranks highest in customer experience among PC manufacturers.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.640]   Well, it's just one survey.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.720]   I'll hear some other opinions before I decide.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.760]   I love how Macs are so incredibly easy to use.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.760]   I have a question.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.760]   I can just talk to you.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.360]   I know PC virus problems.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.360]   You got to see this.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.360]   It's on YouTube.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.320]   These guys who are talking to them are in another ad across the page for hair growth
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.320]   academy.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.960]   It's actually, I get the same guy.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.560]   One's bald, one's got hair.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.560]   So yeah.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.560]   So there's the banner ad at top.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.120]   It says Apple number one in customer experience.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.800]   On the right hand side, Justin Long and John Hodgman.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.120]   And then the left, it looks like a clearly unrelated ad.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.120]   I would love to see this in the New York Times.
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.120]   It's the Brady bunch.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.120]   I saw it yesterday.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.120]   Did you?
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.120]   I wonder if I go there on that.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.000]   And they've done this before once before.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   It's really brilliant.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   Brilliant.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.240]   I was really appreciating.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.240]   There was an ad last week in which, again, simple banner ad and there's like click here
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.500]   for more information.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:24.160]   And Josh Hansman gets on a ladder from his ad, climbs up into the top ad and tries to
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.160]   disable the button.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:30.240]   It's basically, and not only is it a really cool, effective ad, but I'm also thinking,
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:34.960]   okay, I realize that most of my web skills are like HTML 1.4.
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.520]   I know how to do tables and I can do a little bit of job.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.000]   How the heck do they do that?
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.440]   And know that it'll work in any browser and they'll never be any misalignment.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.280]   Oh, it's amazing.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.160]   It's not your father's HTML.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.160]   Is it flash?
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.160]   What are they doing, Craig?
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.160]   I believe it's flash.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.360]   I'm not a web guy, so can't really tell you.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.360]   I would guess it's flash.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.880]   It's got to be flash, right?
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.440]   I know his video, obviously, too.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.400]   So it's very clever.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:02.160]   You know, and they say banner ads or maybe web ads aren't working, but you know, it just
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.160]   takes some cleverness.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.960]   That ad has got, I mean, this has got to work.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.880]   You play with the meme and it's, yeah, people get to go.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.880]   Wow.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.880]   Right.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.880]   And then no PC virus problems.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.880]   Okay.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.880]   Okay.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.880]   Okay.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.880]   Before guy, that's enough out of you.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.880]   Looking good after guy.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:23.880]   So before and after guy, the same guy went as everyone does it.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:29.160]   It shows you how how how how people who develop really great ads like that are worth eight
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:33.360]   times, whatever you pay them because look at us, we are talking about an ad and got
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.360]   them to replay their play in our show.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.440]   We haven't played the Microsoft ad.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.640]   I mean, we could, but it's just not that interesting.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.960]   Just makes me angry.
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:42.960]   Mostly we mocked it.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.960]   Right.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:44.960]   I know.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.960]   More opportunity.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.360]   Well, we'll definitely err it if there's more nudity.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:51.960]   But you know, if they had if they had Seinfeld and Bill Gates, you know, talking across a page
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.680]   in the New York Times with churros, I'd be interested.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.120]   I might not buy a Windows machine, but I might trust.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:02.040]   Actually Andy and I are the are the kind of two guys who still use Windows because we
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.240]   need to for for work.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:07.560]   And I think we're both saying that Windows 7 is something that Apple has to pay attention
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.560]   to.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.440]   It is not is a good it is good version of Windows.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.560]   I've got it up and running on two different machines.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:17.720]   I mean, it's of interest to Mac users because if you want to get boot camp or any sort of
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:21.880]   virtualization working, it's free up and then it'll and it'll keep where the beta is
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.920]   free and it'll work until what is March 1st of next.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:25.920]   Isn't that a great deal?
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:26.920]   I just love that.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.800]   And right now, right now, I believe they're up to a release candidate that's very, very
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   stable.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.280]   So this is a good time to grab a free copy of Windows.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.920]   But to quote Scott Borne, why would you want Windows on your machine?
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.920]   Thank you.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.920]   You're welcome Scott.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.920]   I'm with you buddy.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:46.640]   Let's see if we can buy a Cadillac and make it look like a you go.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.640]   I really wish that I had like video production skills in a real studio instead of like my
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:56.280]   fake one because I just keep coming up with ads for more effective Microsoft Microsoft
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:01.960]   ads where I'll just go into my loan locker, stuff that's like has to be locked up.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:06.000]   They're like stuff on loan and it'll just be, you know, the Mac guy will be showing off
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.600]   the really great Mac book pro, which is which is an awesome, awesome machine.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.600]   And then what you got there?
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.520]   Oh, well, I have a machine that has many of the same specs and it's perfectly good for
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.520]   my for my roof.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.520]   And what's that other thing?
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.520]   Oh, well, that's a net book.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.160]   It's about this big, which means I can carry around.
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.560]   What's that thing on top of it?
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:24.600]   Oh, this, well, this is a palm top version that runs also Windows seven on it runs all
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.600]   my Windows software.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.360]   So I can do the I can do virtualization, that's for stuff.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.760]   But you but you have that stuff available on Mac to well, no, we just have the Mac book
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:32.760]   pro.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:37.000]   Oh, and we also have a slightly smaller version of the Mac book pro.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.080]   If there are things that I love about about the Windows world is the diversity that it's
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.240]   possible to find a machine that will fit exactly what you want it to do.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.640]   In a matter of the specs you want, and of course, it still runs Windows.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:50.640]   So I could be, but I really wish that there were a little bit more diversity in the Mac
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.640]   line.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.480]   Yeah, there's a lot of diversity in the window world.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:58.200]   You can you can get viruses of many diverse kinds and many diverse ways.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.200]   Okay.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   Well, I'm not see that.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.600]   I'm in Don't I'm in devil's advocate mode.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.480]   No, I'm going to back up because there's a lot of hardware diversity.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.040]   We don't have the choice of video cards.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.040]   We don't.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:13.680]   Yeah, I'm just I'm just saying that the viruses and trojans, it's largely a manageable problem.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:18.400]   It's unfair that you have to essentially pay, you know, pay an organized crime kickback
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:25.240]   of $60 a year to keep noise operates is to me going to be paid for the app to it.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:30.840]   You know, if you bought this utility for $60 a year, we'll make sure that whenever these
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:35.360]   that gangs of ours come around, they'll still skip over your machine.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.960]   That's the guy Richie protection mob.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:42.720]   I'm just going to say that's not we're not talking to pranels usually this guy.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.360]   I have a legitimate question, though, for you guys.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:50.120]   So I've never run Windows and let's say what let's say never.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.120]   Why would you?
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.120]   Well, let's don't go.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.120]   Why would you want to?
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.120]   No, no, no, I just find it fascinating.
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:55.920]   Anybody can live life and not have run Windows.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.920]   Yeah, or Microsoft word for that better, but but beyond that, let's say, for instance,
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:05.600]   I wanted to put this new Windows seven thing on my Mac and I would do bootcamp because
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:09.360]   I would want a separate partition because of all the disease is going to happen on the
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.160]   Oh, no, it's just as fine to do it.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.680]   Okay, well, I still going to do it because I'm that way.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:17.680]   Let's say I download this Windows alpha beta, whatever it is.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.240]   What do I need on top of that in terms of viruses?
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.040]   I have no idea what to do for about viruses.
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.520]   Do I download something that's one reason to do it in virtualization?
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.880]   Because then if you get a virus, you just throw it out.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.160]   If you do it in bootcamp, it's a little more tricky.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.120]   You have to you do need an antivirus, I think, but I don't think you need one if you're doing
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:36.480]   it in VMware parallels or a virtual box because you just you take a snapshot, you throw out
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.720]   the snapshot.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.480]   If you get a virus, you throw that one out.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.480]   What if I'm going to do it on bootcamp?
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.480]   What would I do next?
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:46.400]   What's my first step after I after I install Windows 7 on my bootcamp?
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.400]   First thing you do.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.400]   That don't go online, right?
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.200]   Well, you have to go online because the first thing you do is run Windows update like crazy.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.200]   Wasn't it.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.200]   Wasn't it over by then?
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.200]   Aren't you attacked by all kinds of?
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.200]   No, it's not over.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.800]   The only place you go to is Windows update.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.800]   Okay.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.800]   You've got the Windows firewall on.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   So that's going to protect you against a lot of stuff.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.440]   So you go to Windows update, you run Windows update that can take a while.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.360]   If it's if it's Windows 7, it's not going to take any time at all.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.840]   But if you're installing Windows XP, you may be there for quite a few hours.
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.960]   I'm going to do something because it's free.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.840]   Also, Windows 7 is a much harder target for virus.
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.200]   It is as much safer.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:23.640]   If you have like an un there's a lot of very, very real and very scary statistics about
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.080]   how easy it is to compromise a Windows XP machine.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.920]   Like you just put it on the internet and it gets attacked.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:33.240]   But we're talking about like XP service pack one that's horribly out of date on patch.
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.240]   Okay.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.920]   Something that you something that you bought put in a closet and have not taken out for
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.920]   three years.
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:44.360]   It's not the case where as soon as you go to, you know, semantic.com to download and purchase
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:49.320]   an antivirus kit in that amount of time, you're going to get infected.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:56.800]   I would never consider running Windows without Norton without a really good, well, well spoken
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.800]   of antivirus tool.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:02.000]   And again, I do think it's things that you have to pay again, not just by this utility,
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   but pay $60 a year to get regular updates.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.160]   I think that that should be just for the good of the land.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:12.040]   It's got to get together and simply say we're going to have a public fund of here's the
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.840]   annual budget for killing viruses on the windows on the windows and make sure it's free for
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:17.920]   ordinary users.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.520]   But again, it's a very, very manageable problem.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:28.200]   And it's a Windows does get blamed very correctly for being such a easy to compromise system.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.560]   But that's mostly due to the aggression of the virus market rather than the weakness
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:33.560]   of the operating system.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.880]   And assuming that you, you know, out of the box, out of the box is very good.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.440]   We run updates is even better.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.880]   Is there any free antivirus stuff?
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:41.880]   There is.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.520]   There's tons of free antivirus stuff, which is probably adequate.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.240]   I mean, I think your behavior is more important really than the antivirus, but yeah, a good
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.320]   one, Komodo is good.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:52.400]   A vast AVG there's there's doesn't probably half a dozen anyway.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.400]   Good free ones.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.400]   Doris Scott.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.760]   And then we get done with that whole experience, Craig.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.760]   I'm not doing it, Scott.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:57.760]   Don't worry.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:58.760]   Uninstall.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.000]   And you know what happens next?
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.360]   I get to find yourself as happy as a butcher's dog.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.360]   Wow, that's that's happy.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.360]   That is.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:11.960]   By the way, we have great people in our Twitter conversations, Ramana, friend feed.
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:17.040]   And Simon Abrams says the Apple ads are indeed flash probably served by a rich media vendor
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.200]   like iBlaster or iWonder.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:23.640]   He says it's a special and fairly expensive media buy to take over sites homepage like
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:24.640]   that.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.640]   Very cool.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.640]   And three parts of the home page.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:30.640]   We offer homepage takeover here at Twitter.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.640]   Go to a comfort day.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.400]   I got I got lots of travel.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.400]   Exactly.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:40.120]   We're flying any out for WWDC.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.600]   We need the money.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.480]   WWDC is coming up and the Naka will be doing coverage for us.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:50.760]   Alex Lindsey as well will be there for the keynote speech and we'll probably do some
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.760]   sort of live.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:52.760]   That's a Monday.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.360]   So we'll do some sort of live coverage for you.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.200]   Maybe even do live simulcast.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.600]   We won't be able to broadcast the keynote, but we can we can broadcast the coverage of
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.840]   the keynote, I guess, something like that.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:04.840]   So watch for that.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:05.840]   That's coming up.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.840]   It's June 8th, right?
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:08.840]   Yep.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:09.840]   Starting on 8th.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:14.200]   Other big story actually is an Apple security update.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.360]   Huge security update.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.160]   Almost 500 megabytes.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.720]   It's a system update, right?
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:21.720]   Well, it's everything.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:26.680]   It's touched according to Griffiths on what's his first name I can remember on Macworld.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.160]   Rob Griffiths.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.440]   It covers 16,000 files are changed.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.720]   So it's a big update.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:39.120]   But to Apple's credit for such a massive update, I haven't heard problem one.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.440]   Yeah, I haven't any problems.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.440]   Anybody have any problems, Scott?
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.920]   Have you done all the updates?
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:43.920]   I haven't.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.920]   I haven't had an issue.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.920]   It's so big.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:49.640]   You know, but yeah, it's been very reliable.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:57.720]   One potential problem, the VMware is warning its customers if you have an ATI graphics
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:04.040]   card in which could be an iMac or a Mac Pro and you use 3D acceleration.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.720]   If you upgrade to 1057, you will not get 3D acceleration.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.960]   You may even see worse, you know, not just slow performance, but incorrect rendering
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.760]   or crashes when you run 3D applications in VMware.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.560]   So they're saying, Apple's aware of this.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.040]   Do not update to 1057.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.720]   They will have a fix.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.200]   It only affects the ATI driver issue.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.640]   It only affects 3D functionality.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.640]   On VMware.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.440]   That's an edge case if I ever heard one.
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.440]   So it's a niche case.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.720]   Yeah, but I'm sure that people listening do it.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.880]   No, but that's great that they actually called it out.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.080]   Yeah, VMware announced it right away.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.080]   No other problems that I heard of them.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:44.280]   Well, the only problems that I've upgraded on my Macs on it and it works great, the only
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:48.720]   problems are for people who have hackintosh machines and of course Apple isn't responsible
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.720]   for that.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.880]   Although there are, it does reveal that there appears to be some sort of different power
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:58.560]   management system going on in 1057 because a lot of people who are running these, you
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:04.800]   know, these, these, these dels and these, and these aces and these other machines are
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:09.640]   saying that they're getting hugely expanded battery life when they're after they reply
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:14.120]   the 1057 patch that goes from about maybe three hours on battery to four, even five
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.120]   hours on battery.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.120]   Wow.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.120]   I don't know what they're doing.
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:19.120]   But not on the Mac side, huh?
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:20.120]   Just on the Mac.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.120]   Just on the Mac.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.120]   That's funny.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.560]   I'm wondering, I'm wondering though, if like it's one of those things where there's one
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.360]   engineer at Apple who has a hackintosh, you know what?
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:33.840]   If I just add change this to that, these two pieces of hardware work just fine.
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.400]   They'll never know about it.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:38.680]   I don't have to put it in the change log and it'll work just great.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:39.840]   It's the strangest thing.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:44.080]   And I haven't heard anybody else in any other way say, Oh, 1057 is a must have because it
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.080]   improves anything.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:49.560]   It's only people who have hackintosh just, which really probably is not an Apple's best
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.560]   interest.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.560]   Maybe it is.
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.760]   Maybe they want you to have a hackintosh.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.760]   Maybe they think it's a good idea.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.000]   I don't know.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   More people do that.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.640]   The more people realize how happy they are with Macs.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:05.240]   I mean, I'll tell you, I mean, these netbooks are not the greatest thing in the world.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.240]   They're not good for the companies.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.760]   I mean, the profit margins for the company are so bad.
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.520]   Apparently, they're, Asus is complaining they're losing money.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.520]   And market share probably.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.280]   It's probably they're selling a lot of them and they're not, they're, they cost us so
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.080]   little that they're not paying money on it.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.080]   Empiric.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:23.840]   I wrote a piece on this recently and I think it's instructive for a lot of companies right
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:24.840]   now.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:28.000]   Apple says, you know, that's not the market we want to be in.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.960]   We want to sell high quality products.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:33.440]   They sell $1,200 MacBooks, not $200.
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:38.440]   Netbooks and Virgin Records across the street from the Apple store in San Francisco went
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.480]   out of business, but the Apple store's got a line every day.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:46.560]   I think it shows that there is a market for high-end quality and that they're still even
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.560]   in a bad economy, people who are willing to pay for it.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:55.880]   And by going down that road, there certainly could be some popular buzz, but I think that
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:49:02.520]   Apple's been smart so far to protect the general assumption that when you get a Mac product,
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:07.520]   there's going to be a certain elegance and function and style and performance level that
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.520]   you're going to get.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.080]   And you can't find that in a $200 netbook.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:14.640]   We should point out that the Macintosh sales are way down for the last quarter.
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.440]   They're not way to everyone's down.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.440]   Well, they're down for...
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:21.440]   Their year-over-year sales in desktops are actually up.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.440]   Oh, really?
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:23.440]   April to April.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.600]   But that probably has something to do with the recently refreshed line.
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.600]   Right.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.720]   But I think paired with everybody else, they're doing well.
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.360]   Yeah, everybody's down.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.360]   Go ahead.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.360]   No, you go ahead.
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:42.120]   I absolutely agree with what Scott said that Apple is a very unique company in that
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:46.880]   the moment that they suddenly say that we are the bargain PC maker, they lose one of
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.320]   their biggest advantages in marketing.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.600]   They are associated with quality.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.200]   They're not associated with.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.920]   It's a great machine for the price.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:58.280]   However, you really can't dismiss netbooks as being really cheap and chinsie.
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:02.240]   They're just simply very, very efficient for people who have a very reasonable set of
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.800]   expectations for it.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:08.200]   This machine that's going to be arriving at my house tomorrow the next day, if I went
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.800]   back in time a year and a half and simply...
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:15.360]   If you were not aware of this market of netbooks, and I simply handed this to you and said,
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.080]   "How much do you think that thing costs?"
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.440]   You would say, "1000 bucks easy."
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.440]   It's a Windows machine.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.440]   Okay.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:24.720]   Well, for Mac, it would be more expensive, but 1000 bucks easy, maybe 750 if they really
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.320]   want to try to sell a lot of them.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.840]   And this is selling for 400 bucks.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:28.840]   It's not...
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:31.080]   It's a very, very usable, very, very well put together.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:34.920]   There isn't any of those gumball machine like trackpad buttons.
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:39.520]   It's solidly built and it's just as credible as the builds on pretty much any other mass
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:46.600]   market, $89,000, HP machine that you'd find in a major store.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.600]   It's very, very...
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:48.600]   They've got a real problem.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:49.600]   It's way too successful, though.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.680]   All the companies that make them are really unhappy about it.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.880]   Intel's very unhappy.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.040]   The Atom processor is a low margin processor.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.320]   Well, they're doing a lot of things now where...
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:03.120]   Now HP is doing this deal with Verizon where you can buy a subsidized HP netbook that comes
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:04.840]   with built-in 3G.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:08.760]   So maybe they're doing sort of the same sort of thing that Apple was doing with the iPhone,
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:11.960]   saying that we're going to sell this at a racer thin margin, but we're going to take
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.440]   a percentage of all the new business that we bring you.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:18.680]   That would be the only business model I can think of in the netbook category that really
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:19.680]   makes sense.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:23.640]   Because right now they're losing a dollar a unit and making it up on volume.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.600]   You don't ask why Ben & Jerry's is giving away free ice cream today.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.400]   You just take the free ice cream.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:32.160]   And I just want to ask one question, Andy.
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:35.680]   Where in the world have you found somebody with reasonable expectations these days?
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.680]   Can I have that person's name?
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:38.680]   Not on the internet.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.360]   Okay, that's for sure.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:43.440]   All right, it's time for our picks of the week.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.120]   Gentlemen, start your engines.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.360]   Do you have a pick Craig Severson or would you...
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.360]   Huh?
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.720]   Yeah, we're going to do an Audible ad first.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:51.880]   Why, do you have an Audible pick?
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.160]   Well, I was one of you.
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.160]   That's usually the sequence.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.160]   Oh, I haven't forgotten.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.160]   I don't need to run your show here.
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.160]   I'm so really...
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.160]   You think I forgot my friends at Audible?
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.160]   Well, I wasn't sure.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:01.160]   I was kind of looking forward to...
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.000]   I was going to give you a little heads up so that you had time to think of something
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   for a pick.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   Oh, your teeth.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   I can't get this teasing.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   I'm just a little bit of a thing, people.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   And I just...
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   It's a habit that I have from radio.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   Scott, you understand the tease.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.440]   You got to do the tease coming up after this.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:16.400]   But apparently it's a bad idea.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:18.040]   It just throws me.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.880]   So here's what people are saying.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.040]   And maybe I might be right.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.440]   There are a couple of people that first of all, it sounds really cheesy.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:25.440]   Because it's...
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.440]   That's okay.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.440]   That's a tenured.
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.600]   Second of all, we can just fast forward.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.680]   So if the tease is really good, bye-bye ad.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.680]   Oops.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:37.240]   And third, it just wastes time.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.680]   So get on with it.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:42.960]   You know, hey, but they tease, you know, nowhere do they tease like they do on television.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.960]   Right.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:44.960]   I don't do these.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:49.120]   They still tease 17 times an hour.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:50.120]   That's the rule.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:51.400]   17 times an hour.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:54.640]   And TV still makes a bunch of money for people.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.640]   And you know, yes, you can fast forward.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:00.400]   They can fast forward on TV too, but that doesn't stop them from doing it.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:02.400]   That's a good one.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.400]   It builds up anticipation.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.480]   And I'm trying to increase your anticipation.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.200]   You're wondering what's going to happen next.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.440]   Something exciting.
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:10.800]   I didn't say something like...
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.720]   But doesn't the ads are exciting too though?
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:13.720]   I think the ads are exciting.
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:14.720]   Especially exciting.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.720]   Audible ads.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.720]   You want to be a calicandis?
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:17.720]   Oh.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:19.960]   Do you listen to Audible books?
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:20.960]   I do.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:21.960]   I actually have a pic.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:22.960]   If you do.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:23.960]   But Annie might have, you know...
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.960]   Well, but you know, Annie'll defer to you because...
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:26.960]   I'll be here next week.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.920]   You'll be here and you know.
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:29.920]   No.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:32.520]   No, you can come, Craig.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:33.520]   You can come anytime you want.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:36.800]   I hope the brake system on that car is just a bit of a thing.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:40.040]   How's about to say, Annie Narko predicts you'll be here.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:44.400]   Yeah, I was bringing some house with a father from home for you to hear.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:48.200]   And the Grim Reaper says maybe.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.560]   Craig Severson, what have you been listening to lately at Audible dot com?
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:55.040]   Well, I've been listening to it lately and I listened to it two years ago.
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:58.160]   So this is a good testament that my wife and I actually wanted to listen to this book
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:59.160]   again because it's so good.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.560]   And that's by the way one of the nice things about Audible.
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:05.800]   Unlike say iTunes where once you download it, it's yours and you can't get the back.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:10.000]   Audible keeps track of all of the things you've ever bought and you can download them again
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   anytime.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   That's what we did.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   Yeah, because it's like we want to hear this again.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.160]   We might have done this before, but it's a novel Pompeii.
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.480]   Oh, I love Pompeii.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.480]   I know that.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:19.480]   I've read it.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:20.480]   I love it.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.920]   So this is a great book for, I mean, since most of this audience are geeks and happily.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:24.920]   So it's a really great...
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:25.920]   Some of them are Greeks.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.480]   Greek, a hall, you're clever.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.480]   But this isn't about Greeks.
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:32.080]   It's a good combination of Greek, Greek history and sci-fi.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.080]   A little Latin.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.560]   And a little Latin.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.760]   And the reader is fabulous.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.400]   The unabridged version.
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.720]   John Lee has his most remarkable accent.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.480]   It's like Patrick Stewart, but in Beata.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:48.640]   This is a novelization of what happened to Pompeii, of Volcano Erupt.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:53.000]   From the point of view of the Aquarius, which was the man who runs the water system.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.760]   So it's a great combination of many memes.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:59.440]   It's got a lot of great geek science to it.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.280]   It's got a great story.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.280]   It's read really wonderfully.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.880]   Let me play a little of John Lee's narration here.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.200]   I loved this book.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.200]   I got a spoiler.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.440]   The Volcano Erupts.
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:10.880]   And when it does...
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.880]   It's not good.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.880]   It's not good.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.640]   It's really exciting because you know it's coming through the beginning of the book.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:16.640]   And they don't.
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:17.880]   And so it's really exciting.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:21.320]   I have to say, this is one of my favorite historical novels, Pompeii.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.320]   Especially as a...
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:28.680]   I know.
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:50.000]   This is our...
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   I want to get it just to listen to that guy talk.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   It's wonderful.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   It's wonderful.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.040]   And this is a really good book to listen to because of the reader.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.520]   But it's also...
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:59.000]   I found it more interesting to listen to than to read.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.200]   It's a really good recommendation.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:08.200]   Pompeii, P-O-M-P-E-I-I, a novel by Robert Harris, read by as you say John Lee.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.440]   The unabridged version of John Lee.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:10.920]   Yeah, get the unabridged version.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.280]   You're going to get this for free.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:16.000]   Why waste your credit on a bridged version?
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.720]   I don't do a bridged fiction.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:21.600]   I'll do a bridged nonfiction because sometimes it's overwritten.
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:23.240]   There's too many words anyway.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.640]   But I hate to abridge something.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.340]   Somebody's art.
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:27.340]   And that's what this is.
[00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.340]   True art.
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:30.440]   With a great performance to boot.
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:34.000]   Audible is the world's library of audiobooks.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.520]   More audiobooks than anyone else.
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.400]   Really, they're the definitive place.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.920]   And if you've never listened to audiobooks, I've got to get you into it.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:42.360]   I mean, you're already listening to audio podcasts.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.880]   This is just going to enrich your experience.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:47.360]   Whether you're in the car, I listen in the gym.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:51.880]   I listen as I'm writing my recumbent.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.880]   I listen as I'm doing housework too.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:54.880]   It's really great.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:57:00.040]   I plug it into that audio engine five that you told me to get Mr. Scott born.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:03.520]   And it's I plug my iPhone into it and it sounds so great.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:07.160]   The room is filled with these great novels.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:09.600]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.000]   That's the place to go.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.400]   Get your first book free.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.400]   It's the gold account.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:15.600]   You get a book a month, but the first one's free.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:16.600]   And it could be this one.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.520]   Audible for BlackBerry is now available.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:22.560]   So it is now on all your iPods and the iPhone devices.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:23.560]   It's on the Kindle.
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.560]   It's on the Zoom.
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:25.560]   It's on the Sanddiscs.
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.320]   It's on the iRivers and now on BlackBerry.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:28.560]   And GPS devices.
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:29.760]   Yeah, many of those.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:31.760]   It's really great on a GPS.
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.560]   You already have it in your car and so forth.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:37.480]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:41.960]   And if you have a BlackBerry, go to audible.com and they'll tell you how you can do it over
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:46.280]   the air install that puts Audible right on your...
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:49.000]   On your BlackBerry, which this is awesome.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.480]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:55.720]   We thank them so much for their support of MacBreak Weekly.
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:58.720]   All right, kids, it's time for our picks of the week.
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.440]   And Craig Severson, I'm going to let you start.
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:03.880]   He's filling in for Alex Lindsey, who pulled an all-nighter last night.
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.480]   He never does that.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.840]   You know, Craig did me a great mitzvah.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:15.760]   He, at the very last minute, I panicked when I was giving my Macworld Expo keynote.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:19.320]   And I said, "Literally, the week before the keynote, I've got to get some slides."
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:22.240]   And I called Craig up and said, "Craig, I got five days.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.240]   Help me."
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:24.880]   He pulled several all-nighters, I think, to do that.
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.320]   And did a great job if you saw the speech.
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:28.640]   The slides were fantastic.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:29.640]   Thank you, sir.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:34.160]   So he's the keynote wizard and has pulled, I think, a few all-nighters in his time.
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.400]   Oh, so, Michelle.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:41.160]   Well, my pick this week is actually, it's kind of a design geekery app, but it's really
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.160]   quite amazing.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:48.960]   It's layers, and the website is the.layersapp.com.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:53.320]   And what it is, it's a screen capture program, but it does more than just capture a screen
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:58.440]   because it'll take every layer that's on that screen capture and put it into a separate
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.480]   layer into Photoshop.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:04.080]   So you have all of these different layers going on, which you might not even know about
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:05.320]   or be aware of.
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:11.160]   But if you're into web design or graphic design, you want to take apart a screen, this is really
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:12.160]   wonderful.
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:17.280]   It'll take what's naturally being drawn by either OpenGL or whatever and put it on a
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.800]   separate Photoshop layer.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:23.640]   And it makes for pulling out bits of the screen very, very handy.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:24.640]   Super fast.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:25.640]   Neat.
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:27.640]   I know.
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:28.640]   How can it tell?
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:29.640]   There's layers.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.640]   I don't understand.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.640]   I don't know.
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:32.640]   It goes way down to the core image that whole thing.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:33.640]   The operating system kind of knows.
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:34.640]   Right.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:35.640]   And then it just separates those out.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:39.640]   And the interface itself, in my opinion, still needs a little bit of work.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:43.720]   It's version one, but it does work really well.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:47.760]   And it's 1995 US company out of Spain.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.960]   And it's very, very handy for those times.
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:53.560]   And you really want to dissect a screen, pull out stuff.
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:55.200]   You could take screenshots, not just really have to.
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:58.200]   Just be good for book authors because you could just get the button or just get the
[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.200]   yeah.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.960]   It's great for doing rapid prototypes for you to borrow stuff from.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.200]   Steal people's buttons.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.320]   Just to test things out.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.320]   So very cool.
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.320]   The layers app.com.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.320]   Layers.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.320]   Twenty dollar US.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.320]   A good pick.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.320]   In case.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.320]   Mr. Andy and not co.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.560]   You are next.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:22.320]   I'm in one of those really horrible traps where I get a loaner item for review.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.000]   And I'm like, Oh, don't send the check.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   Don't buy it.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   And don't.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.800]   Oh, write it.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.800]   Write it.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.800]   Send this one back.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:31.800]   If you miss it, send it back.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:35.560]   This is a lot of you going to recognize this.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.160]   This is the Verizon MyFi.
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.840]   Oh, you have a MyFi?
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.840]   I'm going to kill you.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:40.840]   Yes.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.840]   I want this.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.400]   Now, people who are seeing this on stick cam, they can see that this is just a little
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.400]   credit card device.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:51.400]   It looks like an iPod without a screen on it.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.720]   It has just one button, which I will now press for you.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:01:00.760]   If you press this button here, it turns on and a little light on the bottom goes green
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.200]   and flashes for a bit.
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:07.160]   And after it turns, after it goes steady on, this is now a Wi-Fi access point that will
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:12.480]   support up to five users connected to Verizon's EVDO network.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:17.720]   So basically, as I walk through the streets today, I'm projecting a bubble of Wi-Fi around
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:18.720]   me.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:23.480]   If you're on a car trip with your entire family, now hopefully you will not be using Wi-Fi
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.480]   as your driving.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:28.440]   But your goodly spouse in the passenger seat and your three kids can all be on their laptops
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:31.440]   doing chat, watching video on Hulu.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.120]   It is definitely fast enough to watch the video of Hulu.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.120]   Wow.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:42.000]   As a matter of fact, I was using it to stream music by a Pandora on a car trip.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.680]   I was afraid of being pulled over by the cops for whatever.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.600]   So I had the laptop in the back seat under a blanket just with a cable plugged into it.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.960]   But the idea is that this almost seems like exactly what we've been holding out for and
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:59.520]   exactly what you want in terms of access anywhere.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.920]   Many of our listeners have little EVDO mode.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.120]   It was the USB dongles that you just plug into whatever device.
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.880]   But it only works when you have a device with a USB port.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.760]   And it also only works with one device at a time.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.680]   So if you want one device to work with everything, even if it's just one at a time, you're kind
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.680]   of out of luck.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.680]   You have to buy multiple things.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:22.200]   This will again, projects a bubble that you're in a meeting and someone else needs to check
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.040]   their email or do we need to collaborate on something?
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.680]   Well, everyone else can be on there.
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.280]   And it's very, very smartly done.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:32.720]   Once it's set up, really, there is nothing special about it.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.080]   You don't need a special piece of software.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.600]   You don't need a special connect application.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:41.160]   You just, again, once you've turned on this light, it's simply a Wi-Fi base station.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:47.040]   When you click on the Wi-Fi menu lit, it will simply appear in there.
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.000]   It will be the name of the thing.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.240]   The actual password-- I'll put my finger over it.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:52.440]   I know some people can't see it.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:56.280]   But the default password is actually printed on the back of the device on the label so
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.520]   that you just simply turn it over and read the password.
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:02.720]   If you want better security, there is a web-based interface.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:06.160]   Again, with this just in your pocket, you can simply connect to the web interface because
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.320]   they can change the password or something else.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:12.080]   The battery life is roughly six hours.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:16.640]   It also has a micro-USB connector on the side there so that if you want to power it from
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.640]   your laptop as you're using it, no problem there.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:24.240]   But as I said, I mean, it's-- I'm not joking when I say you simply can drop it in your
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.240]   pocket.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:28.120]   You have it mounted anywhere visible.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:32.120]   It will just simply magically a bubble of Wi-Fi will appear around you like two storms
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.480]   invisible force field or something.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:37.640]   The rate plans are good but not awesome.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:41.360]   It's about the going rate for most mobile broadband modems.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.520]   It's about $60 for five gigs of speed.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:52.200]   By the way, I'm getting about one megabit and a half second down, about $200 to $400
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.320]   up, which is very, very respectable.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:57.360]   It's $60 for five gigabytes of down.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:02.320]   If you want to save some money, you can go down to 250 megabytes down if you're just
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.320]   using it for email.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.320]   It's $40.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.240]   Overages, $0.05 per megabyte.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:12.800]   If you have the $60 plan, it's $0.10 if you have the $40 plan.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.360]   But they also have a really interesting thing.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.960]   It's very, very affordable if you buy it with one of these monthly plans.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.120]   You can get it for $150 minus an instant $50 discount.
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:23.640]   So it's just $99.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:28.400]   If you pay the full price for it, you can buy it on a day pass program, meaning that
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.360]   you don't pay for it unless you actually use it, in which case you pay essentially
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.160]   hotel room rates.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:38.480]   If you access it and turn it on, you just bought yourself 24 hours of access to the
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.640]   network for $15, which is, again, hotel room rates.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.920]   It's not cheap, but it might be the solution for people who don't necessarily--
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:49.080]   It makes sense for me.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.000]   Yeah, because I have one of these--
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.760]   Two months, not even traveling.
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:55.560]   But then you have that one month when you really need to have this.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.520]   And so it'll make up for itself.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:00.320]   But like I said, it's not the easiest thing in the world to set up.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:04.680]   It's supposed to-- you're docked by a USB and there's a piece of software that just does
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:06.960]   the configuration, just says, OK, here's who I am.
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.520]   OK, you're authorized to use this.
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.520]   Good.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.520]   That's all I need to ever do.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:14.640]   But unfortunately, I could not get-- it's a Macintosh and Windows compatible.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.960]   I could not get this to mount on my Mac, even though it's supposed to.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.920]   So I think I just got an early production unit.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:23.960]   But I had to do is, again, because I had a Windows Netbook also in the office, I was
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.720]   able to mount it on my Windows machine.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:29.200]   Again, double click that app just to get it for that first time configuration.
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.920]   But after that, it's, again, it's just a Wi-Fi base station.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.640]   There's nothing else you need to do with it.
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.680]   So I'm really very enthusiastic about it.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:42.280]   I hope that this is the way that broadband companies start to sell internet access, because
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:46.080]   the idea of just having an access point that travels with you wherever you go, that can
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:50.480]   be shared with multiple people just by being in your orbit.
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.960]   This is, like I said, pretty much the solution that I've been looking for.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.920]   Not the price I've been looking for, but it's pretty much the solution I've been looking.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.640]   How much is the unit if you don't buy the packages?
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.720]   I believe it's $150 outright.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:02.720]   It's made by no-tell.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:03.720]   Well, that's not awful.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:04.720]   That's not awful.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.920]   I do have to double check on that.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:09.800]   That's actually one of my few remaining questions that I have in with Verizon before I write
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.280]   my review for the SunTimes.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.280]   Now, it's kind of interesting.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:17.560]   We're all sort of expecting that when the iPhone updates are released over the summer,
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.800]   one of the things that's going to be available is USB tethering.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:26.000]   It would be interesting given that the Wi-Fi in the iPhone and the 3G connection are two
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.960]   separate radios, it would not be a ridiculous concept to have this sort of a feature in
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.720]   software in the iPhone.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:36.400]   And I hope that someone at Apple or someone in the third-party community decides to actually
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:40.960]   make this a reality, because, again, you can't beat the idea of just, again, magically having
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.200]   a bubble of Wi-Fi around you.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.600]   That's exactly what I want to do.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:48.840]   Yeah, I have a cradle point router, which I can plug the USB EVDO card in, and that
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:52.200]   makes it Wi-Fi, but it's a lot more complicated, a lot bulkier.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.200]   This is like tiny.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.400]   I would love to have that in my pocket or my backpack.
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.480]   Your Mac will allow you to share that connection to right, Leo.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.240]   You could effectively fake that with the Mac.
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:03.640]   Can you share your wireless connection with others?
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:04.640]   For your EVDO?
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:11.520]   You mean turn your Mac into an ad talk Wi-Fi network?
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.520]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.720]   But that's really complicated.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:14.720]   This sounds great.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:15.720]   It's a plug and play.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:16.720]   Oh, be great.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:19.720]   Oh, I'm so jealous you got one of those, and I can see why you might want to keep it
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:20.720]   handy.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:21.720]   I mean, that's pretty tempting.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:26.000]   Yeah, I don't have a game console just for the reason that not only is it a $200 thing,
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.280]   but it's a $200 thing that makes me spend 50 or 60 bucks every month.
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.800]   This is even worse, because I could say, but it's a business.
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.880]   It's a business expense.
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:35.880]   I work.
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:36.880]   Oh, come on.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:37.880]   It's about this.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:38.880]   This is my...
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.880]   Why are you so against your own career?
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.720]   You put a screen door on your own personal subplane.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.720]   Shut up.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:44.720]   Shut up.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.720]   Shut up.
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:46.720]   Shut up.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.200]   All right, time for Scott Borne.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:51.280]   It's his pick of the week, Scotty.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.000]   Brand new application just came out from my friends at...
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.500]   Ubermind!
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.800]   I love just being able to say Ubermind.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:01.400]   A Swedish is mine, Havelin.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.440]   Who is Ubermind?
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.000]   Ubermind has come up with Mapeture Pro.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   Oh.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   I like the name.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.560]   Mapeture Pro is, as you may suspect, a way to combine the power of aperture and Google
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.200]   Maps.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:21.880]   So for those of you that don't have the Nikon GP1 or the Nikon 6000, that allows you to
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:26.080]   geotag automatically or any of the other third-party geotagging devices, you can do
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.520]   it after the fact with this.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:34.680]   You simply pull up your photograph in aperture and then you select the Edit with Mapeture
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:36.840]   Pro plugin.
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:41.120]   And then you type in where, you know, generally you thought this was and then you can pinpoint
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.120]   the location.
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:47.280]   And it's already got a bunch of the landmarks built in and it'll put a little pin down for
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:53.280]   you and it'll take that information and drop it into your ITBC data.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.280]   Nice.
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:55.280]   I never say that.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:59.040]   It also supports track logs because I have a little GPS tracker that I carry around with
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.280]   me and I could import that track log to, which would be...
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.280]   Then I don't have to do anything manually.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:06.800]   Yeah, you can make this part of your photographs.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.800]   It made a data.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.640]   That's the main thing I like about it.
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.440]   And that you've got all this information.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:16.040]   Now, a lot of people still don't get the point of geotagging and it's not something
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.120]   that's important to everybody.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:23.240]   But let's say you're doing guide service and you go to remote areas and you say, "Wow,
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:28.200]   I did not realize that there was an elephant watering hole down here in Kenya at this particular
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.560]   place where I am."
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:34.360]   Might be good to be able to automatically recall that in the photograph or, in my case,
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:40.240]   I find down near Mac Allen, Texas and I find the Cozad Ranch where there are just a flurry
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.920]   of migratory birds in April.
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:47.800]   I might want a GPS coordinates for the exact location that I find at a particular nest
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:51.040]   or a particular watering hole that the birds like to visit.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.280]   And I can do that after the fact.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.760]   You can do all sorts of cut and paste.
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.200]   You can manage the locations as bookmarks.
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:02.520]   It's really quite powerful and it's only 39 bucks.
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.000]   Very good.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.360]   Thank you for the pick, Mr. Scottyborn.
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:12.760]   It does require aperture, by the way, which you can try that for free for 30 days and
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.520]   then try this as well.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:18.840]   But I do want to point out this only helps you if you've got aperture.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.920]   I am going to recommend something that's a little bit odd, a little bit different, a
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:22.920]   little bit goofy.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:23.920]   It's called curio.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.480]   Have any of you ever used curio?
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:32.400]   So curio is in the category of mind mapping software.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:37.600]   It is from Zen GoB, Z-E-N-G-O-B-I.com.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:41.240]   And now I've used a bunch of mind mapping software.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.240]   You use NovaMind.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.960]   This one is the most elegant, the most mackish.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:48.920]   It's clearly designed by people who kind of love the Macintosh.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.240]   It also has, this is new, and Evernote integration.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:11:04.400]   So I can drag stuff out of my Evernote library and put it into a curio page.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:09.640]   This is a web page that I had archived, and I can even make it go live, which is kind of
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.560]   cool.
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.000]   Plain text notes.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.960]   There's all kinds of different templates for this.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:18.360]   It's very sophisticated.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.680]   I have to say it's kind of an amazing thing.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.400]   I want to give it to my daughter for high school.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.560]   It has supports Cornell noting.
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:29.480]   But you can then do brainstorming too, including drawing into it.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:32.960]   You can do things like do interior design with it.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:40.280]   You can scan in pictures and then put in images that you want paint samples.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:44.160]   The idea of mind mapping is you kind of have a blank canvas that you could put stuff on.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.640]   This one is particularly sophisticated.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:48.040]   For instance, any web page in here is live.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:54.440]   So you can put live web pages in it and it will use WebKit to actually update it, which
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.520]   is kind of nice.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:01.120]   It also has the ability to turn your mind mapping into a presentation.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.360]   So I thought you might be kind of interested in this, Craig, because this becomes in effect,
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:09.800]   it becomes keynote with a lot of the same transitions because those are built into courts.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:13.720]   So you can do any courts transition on this.
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:18.600]   So if you're using the mind mapping program and creating some ideas and thoughts, drawing
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:26.560]   them out, using the built in kind of project flow and things and so forth, and then you
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.280]   want to turn it into a presentation, it's halfway there.
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.200]   It's almost ready to be a presentation.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:35.280]   Not quite as sophisticated, of course, as a keynote.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.200]   But a great way to sketch it out.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.280]   Great way to sketch it out.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.160]   And a lot of times I use programs to sketch it out and then I've got to go and I've got
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:45.160]   to launch keynote and I've got to kind of import everything over into it and so forth.
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.560]   This one, it's kind of already done.
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:50.000]   I have to say, I'm very impressed with the program.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.120]   I think it's $70.99 for the professional version, which gives you a few more features.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.640]   But you can try before you buy.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.440]   You can download it and take a look at it.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:06.720]   It is from, as I said, a Zen Goby and George, the guy who wrote it, is very responsive.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:07.720]   I actually heard about it.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:10.480]   Somebody was talking about it on Friend Feed and really said they love this.
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:16.400]   I'm using it, send him a note and he said, "Yeah, we'd love to send you a copy."
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.880]   So he sent it over and I've been very impressed.
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:23.160]   You see, you can see here this is embedded into my homepage and it's already got the
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:28.720]   Gmail chatting is going on inside my Curio, which is kind of intriguing.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.240]   I love the Evernote integration.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.240]   I mean, that just makes it really simple for me to clip stuff into Evernote, pull it over
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:38.200]   and now it's part of my mind.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.400]   Can you export these individual screens as well?
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:43.000]   You can export as PDF, which is really great.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   It's very helpful.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.120]   So you can do a lot of work and then just send it out as a PDF to anybody.
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.120]   I'm finding a lot.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.680]   I mean, this is one of those really open-ended programs that can do a lot.
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.040]   So I'm finding I'm learning a lot.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:58.760]   You can record audio or video directly into it, which is kind of handy.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:03.400]   So I can now record what I'm talking about and put it in as a note.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:06.840]   It really is designed to make it as easy as possible for you to kind of get your thoughts
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:08.840]   in there.
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:15.280]   Very advanced searching, tagging, templating, scrapbooking.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:21.640]   It uses spotlight so you can search for content anywhere on your hard drive and then add it.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.080]   Just I mean, it goes on and on and on.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:26.440]   It's one of those programs that I, the more I use it, the more I realize is in there.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.720]   It's kind of thing you might want to live in, actually, if you do a lot of brainstorming
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:30.720]   and thinking.
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.980]   I have been reading comments on it in their forum.
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:35.280]   Some people use it in conjunction with Scrivener.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:39.000]   So it would be a good program to kind of sketch out your ideas and then use Scrivener to then
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.440]   write.
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.320]   I think you could almost use this instead of Scrivener.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:46.400]   I mean, it has, it's not a word processor, but it has a lot of the same features.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:52.040]   It's called Curio and it is from Zen Gobi in a very impressive, I have to say, a very
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:59.480]   impressive program, which I plan to use a lot more because I'm always brainstorming.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.360]   Craig Severson, thank you so much for being here.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:02.360]   We really appreciate it.
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:07.360]   Craig Severson.com is the site to go to for Mr. Severson to find out more about what
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:08.360]   he's up to.
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.360]   S-Y-V-E-R-S-O-N.
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:11.360]   C-R-A-I-G.
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:15.800]   And if I could plug my latest project with Linda.com.
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:18.000]   Oh, that's right.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   Congratulations.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000]   Thank you.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.600]   Now with, together with Mr. Born, I am a author of Linda.com, but I did the keynote
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:30.080]   '09 title right after Macworld and just got released last week.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:34.360]   So you were working with Apple on keynote and I doing a lot of the examples and stuff.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.480]   Right, before the launch, I was launching the dev.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.880]   Yes, you were way ahead of that.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:43.640]   And Apple with this title, Apple gave us permission to use the same content that Apple
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.600]   used for their tutorials.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.720]   So I had the same keynote presentation, which was designed to teach about keynote.
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:51.720]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.760]   And it's really nice artwork from Ducati.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:57.800]   So I was able to use that same content to create the lesson plan.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:02.240]   It's about four and a quarter hours and it covers all the basics of keynote from soup
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.640]   to nuts.
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.400]   And then we're talking about possibly I might do the next level.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.600]   Now how would somebody do this?
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.360]   How do you sign up?
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.640]   Linda is a subscription type service where you can join on a monthly basis.
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:18.000]   You pay 25 bucks and you have access to all of Linda's titles.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.280]   And that's most every app you can possibly imagine they've got live tutorials for.
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:27.000]   So for 25 bucks, you can gorge yourself on training.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   Yeah, we have one of those.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   That's really great.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.880]   And they also have an annual plan.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:35.800]   And then the premium plan that they have also includes the example files that we create.
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.120]   So I have example files that go with the lessons that you can download and use if you're on
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.120]   the premium plan.
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.880]   And is there DVD yet or that's coming?
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:43.880]   DVD is out too as well.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:46.040]   So you could get the individual DVD title as well.
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:47.240]   That's another way you could do that.
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:48.240]   Yes.
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.240]   That's fantastic.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.240]   Yes.
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:54.840]   So LYNDA.com, the keynote 09 essential training by Craig Severson.
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.920]   Or get the DVD and own it.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:58.920]   Own it.
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:00.400]   This is the guy who I mean, you want to own keynote.
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.400]   This is the guy.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.040]   And there's nobody better.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.040]   Thank you, Craig.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.040]   It's nice to have you here.
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.040]   Good to be here.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.040]   Vancouver, Petaluma.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.040]   I'll follow you around.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.040]   Hey, do he's following me.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:15.320]   Mr. Alex Lindsay is not here, but he will be back next week and Craig filling in for him.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:18.200]   He most ably, I might add.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.200]   Andy and I co thank you for being here from the Chicago Sun Times and the celestial waste
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.200]   of bandwidth.
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.640]   Look for his review of my fight in the Sun Times soon.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:30.760]   I'll have one of these panels painted maybe.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:35.680]   He's sitting in what looks like a sauna with a naughty pine.
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.760]   If I don't have one painted next week, I'll be naked for the chest up sweating, just beating
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:39.760]   myself with birch branches.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:40.760]   It'll be great.
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:41.760]   It'll be a good look.
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:45.520]   Oh, there I don't know if the herring harvest is going to be good this year.
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.040]   I've got not the stress.
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.880]   I need to be in the strat and now, you know.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:50.880]   Scott Borne.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:51.880]   Thank you for being here.
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:53.880]   Mr. Scott Borne is at scottborne.com.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:59.560]   He does so many things, including all of his photography, you know, stuff, his workshops,
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:00.560]   the aperture workshop.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:03.440]   What do you got anything you want to plug coming up?
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.440]   Well we are.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:08.320]   We opened up the fourth and final contest for the aperture nature photography workshop,
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.640]   giving away a free trip to four people this time to Mount Rainier.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:12.640]   Ooh.
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.560]   We just came back from Yellowstone, had a good time.
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.640]   So now the contest is running.
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:19.920]   Go to f64.com for more information or just check us out at photofocus.com.
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:22.840]   There you go or scottborne.com for everything as COTD.
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:23.840]   B-O-U-R-N-E.
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.840]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:29.280]   You're a very gracious man to plug the hell out of what you're doing.
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:32.680]   But you know, we reciprocate because I plug you all the time.
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:33.680]   Thank you.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:34.680]   I appreciate it.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:35.680]   Well, and people want to know more about you guys.
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:40.120]   And you are the very best radio host on the planet named Leo Le Porte.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:41.280]   That I'll give you.
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:43.600]   Why I even have my own jingle.
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.840]   Of course, I don't have it queued up.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.320]   It's not in the cart machine.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.320]   He's a professional.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.320]   Do they use the cart machine?
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.320]   No, I missed it.
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:52.960]   You know, do you remember those days where you'd slam the cart--
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:57.320]   Oh, I didn't think I would slam the cart into the cart machine, so it'd be ready to go?
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.040]   Hey, I worked in a big radio.
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.040]   Le Porte.
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:01.040]   It's the worst of all of them.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.040]   I worked in a big radio station.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:03.040]   We had four cart machines.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.160]   So you can get all kinds of very sophisticated.
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.160]   Slam them in.
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.160]   Slam them in.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.160]   Now it's all on computers.
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.640]   Now you have no recourse if the thing is--
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:14.120]   You need one of those 360 systems deals where you just hit a button now and it's all
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.120]   digitized.
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.120]   Have you seen those?
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.360]   Yeah, it's way too easy now.
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.360]   Those kids, they don't know.
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:22.240]   You also need those on-air lights like PC guy has.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:23.840]   You can't let him show you up.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.400]   Yeah, that's not right.
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.840]   Actually, I do have an on-air light.
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:28.840]   He's got right on-air, man.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:29.840]   Right on the air.
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.840]   I stole this.
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:33.600]   Well, I borrowed it.
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:34.600]   No, I took it.
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:37.160]   No, I actually asked permission.
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:42.280]   When I was first starting working in San Francisco, we took over an old station in San Francisco
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:43.280]   at KSFX.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.720]   It was a hippie station where they played album rock.
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.000]   And this was their on-air light.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.360]   It says, "Right on the air."
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.760]   And there's hippie dippy lettering.
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:50.760]   It's awesome.
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:51.760]   Oh my god.
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:53.440]   It actually had a light box with a light bulb behind it.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.440]   I could rebuild that.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.680]   But I just think it's so cool.
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:59.080]   So this is the actual KSFX on the air.
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.080]   It's awesome.
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.080]   I'm so jealous.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:02.080]   Isn't that great?
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.080]   Right on.
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:06.640]   I think there should be a couple of leaves to the left and the right of that maybe?
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:07.640]   Yeah, man.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.640]   Right on the air, man.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.640]   We're right on.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:11.560]   What kind of leaves, dude?
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:16.440]   I didn't want to brag, but just to show you that I'm actually getting serious about upgrading
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:22.200]   to Dunscap Studios after being interrupted twice in the past two months by gardeners and
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:23.200]   UPS guys.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:27.800]   I now have my official on the front door right now is my official recording in progress.
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:30.200]   And you know what?
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:33.040]   This time next week, this baby's going to be laminated.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:36.040]   I got the budget, baby.
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.880]   Yeah, Scott, maybe you and I.
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:39.600]   They know they're not going to be messing around.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:42.480]   Oh, I was going to knock on the door, but gee, that's laminated.
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:43.480]   He really is.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.520]   He's got a budget.
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:47.520]   You and I are going to go to bswusa.com.
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:49.080]   We're going to chip in.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.200]   We're going to buy him one of those light up on air.
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:52.200]   I think we should.
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.200]   Yeah, they're really cool.
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:54.360]   They even have retro ones.
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.920]   They look like they're, you know, by the way, the last two that I bought cost $40 a piece
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:03.280]   and it cost me $750 in electricians fees to install them right now.
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:08.440]   My board, my controller, my control board has a, you know, a little power thing for to
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:11.080]   light the on air switch.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.760]   But I don't know what it's tied to because you know, days you turn on your microphone
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.680]   and that's when it would turn on the lamp.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:16.840]   I don't know what it's tied to.
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:17.840]   But we had it set up.
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:20.920]   So when you turned on the studio, you went in the studio and turned on the lights.
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:22.160]   It turned on the on air light.
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:25.920]   And that cost me 750 smackers for my $40 light to light up.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.040]   You're getting, you're getting a little too fancy, I think.
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.360]   Let me see what I know.
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:30.880]   I do like on, on air lights.
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:35.080]   I would really like to have a nice, well, there's quite a few of them on bsw.
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:38.280]   Here's a dual lens on air vertical display.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.280]   Ooh.
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:40.840]   That's the one I used to have right there.
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:41.840]   Imagine that.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:45.400]   I used to have in my big studio, 389, there was a lot of money for it on air.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.400]   I like these.
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.400]   These look like they're from the 20s.
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.200]   You know, they've got the fins on them.
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.000]   I came so close to buying one of those.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.200]   They might T flea market, but the guy wanted like a hundred bucks for it.
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.720]   And then I looked on lines and oh, that's why he wanted a hundred bucks.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:57.720]   It's $349.
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:58.720]   Wow.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:01.240]   You get the little white plastic once now for 49 bucks.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:02.240]   It worked.
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.240]   This is good.
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.000]   I've got mine right on the air.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.680]   I should, I should be duplicating it.
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:07.680]   I think this is a red one.
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.480]   Oh, this is the one every radio station I ever worked in use this one.
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:12.480]   It's only woof.
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:13.480]   Woring.
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:14.480]   Woring.
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:15.480]   Woring.
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:18.360]   Alright, thank you everybody.
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.360]   Break time is over.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:26.360]   [Music]
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.360]   [Music]
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.360]   [Music]
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:37.360]   [Music]
