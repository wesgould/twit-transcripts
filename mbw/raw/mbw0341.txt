[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.120]   switching from Starbucks to second cup oh my oh my a blackberry there is only a
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.920]   true cup of a king it's an X10 a white X10 yeah you're Canadian that's allowed
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.120]   yeah they released the micana first of course I've got people from in the studio
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.360]   audience who got people from Waterloo home of research and most of Barn Me
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.320]   blackberry they call it blackberry now so we're to what I want to talk about
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.280]   that a little bit that's good because I'm I'm torn I'm thinking about it I'm
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.720]   considering making the move and when welcome also Alex Lindsay who's joining
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.920]   us from Austin Texas where he's just arrived for South by Southwest it was
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.320]   gone I was like what happened there's a lot of people wandering around that are
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.120]   over I'm actually not here for South by Southwest I'm here at U studio which
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.840]   we're having some meetings here and then they do a lot of content management
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.480]   software and then we're doing some streams down here that are cool kind of
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.400]   connected to South by Southwest but not at it so well the you know it really
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.920]   isn't over the interactive is is winding up but the music begins this week so
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.440]   that's gonna be really cool actually and unfortunately I probably won't see any
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.920]   of it or is it the film I'll be working is it was it music is I can't remember
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.920]   the order music interactive film I think maybe it's film well no no I think
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.240]   that yeah I think that the the film and music is starting this week so I think
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.080]   all the interactive which is what we pay attention to of course is over but
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.080]   the Rio festival that has been here for a long time is really just starting
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.800]   so interesting Twitter on Sunday because I had to find people who weren't at
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:20.560]   South by right and so all we did is sat around and be bitter it was it
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.400]   actually was a great to it because we had Liz Gaines and Dwight Silverman who's
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.320]   never been to South by even though he lives in Texas and of course Julia O'Dell
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.120]   and Liz Gaines from all things D said she had been asked to go to South by and
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.560]   said no Wow I always think that every year I think this is gonna be the year I
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.680]   don't go to South by and and every year here I am at some point in time if you
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.280]   can it's worth going because it's a great great great and but it's not a
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.560]   news well there was a little bit of news but it's not a huge news event no but
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.440]   it is a lot of fun and there is an incredible amount of networking an
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.160]   incredible amount of you know people here to to see and you know Austin is
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.400]   beautiful so I love Austin yeah they did Google was there with Google Glass and
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.400]   they did announce that a number of the big apps like Pass will be available on
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.800]   Google Glass the New York Times which seems a little odd to me I'm not sure I
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.760]   want my New York Times over my upper right hand corner of my eye but maybe it
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.480]   has to do more with I don't know what it maybe it's not the paper I don't know
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.320]   the guy sitting in front of me on the flight down last night had had glass on
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.560]   and there was a lot of you know moving around and looking at stuff and I
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.560]   have to admit I was very jealous it's one advantage of glass over an eye watch
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.880]   is it's got a bigger display it's not a bigger display it's actually smaller but
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.680]   it appears to be bigger mm-hmm is it so close yeah I think it's gonna be really
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.120]   I think it's gonna be a pretty big deal so yeah I'm excited to what degree
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.000]   was that man actually using glass towards some productive purpose and to
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.320]   what degree he just you know you know anytime you're the only one with
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.320]   something there's no product of this they're just showing everybody you know
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.800]   like so literally you're just like and then I can do this and I can do this and
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.640]   then the next person in line so okay tell me about glass and then and then
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.880]   it just keeps on going you know one after the other so that's that's more
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.120]   happened until the day the Google Glass becomes widespreadly available it
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.200]   that's gonna be there's gonna be like a some sort of a new super virus form of
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.920]   pink eye that's communicated just by people giving each other demonstrations of
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:27.320]   glass I'm confident about this yeah so let's talk about the new iPhone the 5s
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:33.320]   because Renee is a font of information about the 5s I'm or which last go around
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.120]   really was on top of all the rumors has once again taken the lead with lots of
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:45.640]   rumors what's the latest you call it the iPhone 5s problem that was just so
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.480]   last week I published some information about an iPhone 5s that we were hearing
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.680]   it was coming out in August and because there's so much Apple is doomed coverage
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.200]   these days anything Apple announces this doc goes down or there's a weird story
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.600]   that appears just a lot of things that are very curious I was trying to explore
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.320]   some of the sentiments and I did another piece about journalism and now I was
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.720]   trying to think about it as a consumer and if every year Apple releases one
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.800]   iPhone a year and if every second year it's an s-class phone iPhone 3GS the
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.320]   iPhone 4s you start to assume maybe this year it'll be a 5s and then you
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.800]   start to look at when you buy becomes a factor of when you think Apple's gonna
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.120]   release because it's always around the same time of year and if you have two
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.800]   year contracts do you really want the S phone is the S phone a symbol that
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.360]   they've got something better or they fix something in the previous one or is
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.320]   it just a non-exciting update to what you already bought so let's look at
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:47.160]   previous S phones the S the first S was the 3GS and I guess S stood for speed
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:54.520]   yes the second S was the 4s in that case Siri yeah so those were both big
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.040]   additions while the phone didn't look any different they were significant
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.880]   improvements in performance they were absolutely and they added features and
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.040]   functionality you know some people say that Apple does this deliberately
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.200]   deliberately hand-capped handicapped older phones but the 3GS had video and
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.520]   only the 3GS had video recording and the 4s had Siri and only the 4s had
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.720]   Siri so they were they were software differentiation on top of the camera
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.800]   boost the processor boost and usually the radio boost that went along with it
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.320]   but now we have we have two things that come with that not only do people wait
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.800]   to buy until they think the next iPhone is coming out when it becomes when it
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.440]   gets to a certain point in year but competitors start to understand that I
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.200]   think the HTC Nexus one was one of the first ones that did this but we have the
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.480]   HTC one now in the spring we have the Galaxy S4 coming in the spring we have
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.880]   the BlackBerry Z10 coming in the spring and this is when the iPhone is six
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.920]   months old the next update is presumably six months away and if people are
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.000]   generally interested in technology and they see these exciting things happening
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.680]   at a period where there's very little Apple news or very little information or
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:06.000]   sign that a new iPhone is coming I think those things start to start to affect
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.720]   the market it could be a defensive rumor it could be Apple leaking it saying hey
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.280]   don't worry we got something coming which brings you right to the iWatch again
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.340]   where you know you you want to have something that increases overall platform
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.040]   value and you start hearing all these rumors and some people think that some
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.520]   people think that Apple you know leaked that the iPad is gonna be a thousand
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.080]   dollars so that when it was 500 dollars it seemed like a bargain so that can
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.800]   absolutely happen I just think that when you start looking at Apple's
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.120]   behavior last year and they they called the new iPad instead of the iPad 3 and
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.440]   Phil Schiller said because they didn't want to be predictable and then they
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.120]   released a new iPad again two iPads in a year three if you count the iPad mini
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.240]   that's not a usual thing for Apple and we heard that this year there might be
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.840]   the iPad 4 as soon as April yeah and that would be Apple starting to play
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.480]   again with their release schedule and that becomes less predictable more
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.440]   interesting and if they split the iPhone line the way they split the iPad line
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.560]   then presumably you don't have that big product dump in the fall anymore but
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.360]   you have a more spread out schedule across the year.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.160]   One other part one it's been so hard to really feel as though you know what
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.000]   Apple's thinking one thing that complicates for instance the the iPad
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.440]   revision 3 announcement was that remember that came right on the heels of
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.640]   them putting out those lightning connectors and Apple given how quickly
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.600]   they move product through the retail channels possible that they simply said
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.320]   we'd like to stop making these 30 pin connectors and assemblies as quickly
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.720]   as possible why not we just roll out a roll out an update the current current
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.480]   buyers are not going to are going to be pleased with by getting a slightly
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.000]   improved product and we'll have one less problem on our hands.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.160]   If they dealt internationally to which was a big deal.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:50.600]   Yeah and that's another thing I mean the more you think about how Apple
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.960]   releases its products the more you realize that they really are a universe
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.800]   in and of themselves and it's hard to apply conventional logic to how they
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.840]   release things the iPhone 5 for all of its strengths when you think about it
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:09.840]   adding LTE is just it's almost as if they finally finished developing the
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.760]   first revision of iPhone this is probably the first model of iPhone where
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.400]   you can't say well here is a here's the list of features that you would expect
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:23.240]   to find on every phone as of 2011 and now finally every iPhone has every item
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:28.440]   on that feature list so the kind of tickles your imagination as to what they
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.720]   can do now to make a very very resolute enhancement to the iPhone at this point
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.640]   I hope it's making a camera that's even better than what they have right now but
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.200]   I don't even want to try to imagine what they've got in mind as that really big
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.760]   rollout done done and now here's something that the iPhone 6 does or the
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.560]   iPhone 5s does I was never imagined before but we made it happen for you
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:56.280]   because we love you the consumer that's what I'd like to see
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.040]   just the mail app like Apple just picks the mail app I think I mean I think I
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.840]   would consider that what's wrong with mail what doesn't it do okay so if you
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.280]   don't get a lot of mail I guess it's not that big of a deal but I get like 400
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.440]   emails a day you know and the problem is is that it just I have mail that doesn't
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.960]   show up on my email so I have to you know I've moved to Gmail I mean I'm using
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.400]   the Gmail app and the Gmail app works perfectly but the the mail app is just
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.360]   in you know I don't I it's easier to use the Apple products on you know the Apple
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.640]   software on an Apple product so I'm I'm I would use it if I could but literally
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.480]   there's just a whole pile of emails and I go to my computer and suddenly there's
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.880]   a bunch of emails that I didn't see on my on my iPhone my iPad that are there and
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.280]   I'm not sure exactly why that that is the case you know you know I'm quite happy
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:43.000]   giving mail five gigabytes of my of my storage just to keep them there like I
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.360]   don't want I don't want it to go up to the web every every every 20 seconds to
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.040]   find them because for me the last 200 emails was like the last 12 hours you
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.520]   know it doesn't do me any good to so I think that high volume usage of mail on
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.760]   the on the iPhone is not something that it's that it's particularly built for
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.800]   and you've tried you've tried Gmail and mail box the Gmail works the g the gmail
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.160]   app is probably the best app for if you're getting a lot of mail the gmail app is
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.840]   the way to go and so you know I've been slowly you know we need my way away
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.840]   from mail and just using Gmail for that and since where our account is a gmail
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:19.400]   account yeah it's no good to you if it's not there's a basic my frustration is that
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:25.080]   uh I I need to pick up an email that that arrived like maybe yesterday of the day
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.680]   before I know who sent it I know what the subject line is I think I'm searching
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.480]   for exactly the sort of thing that will return that hit of that important
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.080]   email that says here's the location of the meaning that got changed two days ago
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.320]   but the desktop excuse me the iPhone app will not find it I actually it's it's
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:44.440]   very very belittling when I find I have to launch Safari uh open the web mail
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   client for my inbox because they're simple web based type anything into the search
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.720]   box anything that matches will find it and boom hey what do you know I did a
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.120]   search on room change and there it was yeah I don't understand I think search
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.800]   can be so complicated I mean you know for for something a simple string across
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.160]   the emails that I have I don't know how it cannot get that right
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.000]   the app apple mail and gmail have historically not worked well together and
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.800]   part of that is because apple is trying to look for a standard i-map
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.160]   implementation and gmail is anything but and I know you can set it up over
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.840]   exchange and things but apple asks for a lot of simultaneous connections and
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.840]   gmail has a very low simultaneous connection limit so it errors out a lot
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.280]   gmail has a very low bandwidth limit you know for a company the size of google
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:31.160]   and apple demands those emails a lot so if you use mail any apple mail client
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.400]   and gmail together it's not great and it was sometimes mail comes in and it
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.360]   goes to all mail instead of inbox and because there's no folder mapping the
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.720]   way i map expects you just don't see it in your inbox there's a whole bunch of
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.440]   issues as to why those two things don't play
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.160]   very nicely together hmm yeah that's that's good those are good notes have you
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:55.080]   guys tried the mailbox at all i didn't understand in line yeah it's a long
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:59.320]   line i'm i'm in but uh mail box is the app that uh people have been talking about
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:03.320]   like crazy because it's supposed to be kind of emerging of mail and gtd
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.920]   i don't know if this would help you though alex because it's basically a single
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:12.040]   inbox and then you slide and depending on how you slide you can either this is
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.400]   archive this is delete if i slide it to the left whoops if i slide it to the left
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:23.400]   i can uh set a ticker that says remind me about this later to handle
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.680]   uh i love that it might be i mean i mean i think and then and then if you go all
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.560]   the way to the left you can put it in a list and you can make all these are
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.200]   arbitrary lists so it's a it's really more about
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:36.520]   processing the mail quickly than it is about i don't think it actually solves
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.560]   your issue of just i have to admit our our obsession right now is getting
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.560]   just not using mail in general email i don't think anybody uses mail they just
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.880]   make built-ins article in the times no i'm saying this is whiny article about
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:53.560]   don't send me emails text use text everybody just text these days or
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.600]   well the hard part with text of course is finding it later and so really the
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.200]   the focus that we have within you know as as our company grows is really trying
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.360]   to get to a point where people are using you know docs that we're all updating
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.480]   um you know systems like you know we're now implementing right now salesforce
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.600]   dot coms that we across the entire things that you know all the information about
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.440]   a specific client is being added from about six different directions and we're
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.040]   not sending emails about it we're just having you know updating documents
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.840]   um and then of course a lot of g-docs and everything else but but the main thing
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.800]   is is trying to get away from the idea that the information that you actually
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:28.840]   need is sitting inside of email uni's podium have you tried podium i have not
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.440]   tried podium they didn't buy an ad on the show so i'm
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.200]   that this is an advertiser it's a citrus product but it's it's an attempt and i
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.120]   think that though there are probably many of these
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.280]   to take these disparate pieces of information in a lot of different places
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.960]   like google docs and email and combine them in in a way so that you can work
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.120]   with them together with a team and that i mean this is the problem it's a
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.960]   work it's a workflow problem isn't it yeah i mean right now we have on any
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.560]   given projects i've got eight to ten people touching that project and so
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.000]   you know and and right now a lot of it has been you know there is a lot of
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.120]   google docs that keep track of it i mean so like to manage like for instance for
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.120]   us to manage you know we have all these people like for an event we had recently
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:12.040]   we had probably 30 people working on it um and in and they all had to have
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.160]   different information so everybody has their own gdoc
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.280]   that because that way we're able to manage like there's a skeleton doc that says
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.960]   here's how we do it everyone can see yeah and then and then there's links to all
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.760]   of the all of the documents and when you click on it then it decides whether
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.560]   you're allowed to see it or not but there's this whole process and you're
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.240]   just and and and you still devolve into some sometimes sending emails of one
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.960]   we're gonna have meetings and so on so forth and we're trying to by the end of
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.920]   this year kind of you know get rid of that you
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.640]   you you will be the one among the first companies to solve this and i can't
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.960]   wait to see what you do because it is a nightmare there are companies that do
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.800]   it i mean you know i think that you know uh sales force do they have
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.440]   solution to the sales force that's what they do they build tools to let you do
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.000]   that right so i mean it's and i and i you know
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   uh we do a lot of work for sales force so it's it's embarrassing that it's
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.800]   taking us this long to to get it fully implemented i mean we use sales force
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.800]   in limited ways for crm and so on so forth but to actually implement it in a
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.320]   way to manage you know really manage the projects at an enterprise level is
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.800]   something that uh we just weren't big enough to need
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.400]   and now we i guess we are i mean it's you know it's just turning it you know
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.280]   just dealing with lots and lots of data and lots and lots of pieces is is a
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.880]   possible role be high but these are all enterprise high-end
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.920]   solutions and the problem is even normal people now have this problem
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.600]   well really how to control what's hard is is that is that is that as a when you
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.880]   when you have you know five or six employees
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.120]   it's hard to see why you should um you know add these tools and i think sales
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.840]   forces probably not just because we work for them but but looking at all the
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.800]   options they're probably one of the best as far as project management that type
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.440]   of thing i mean at an enterprise you know like when you're going to
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.600]   do all of the stuff from crm to you know everything else but the
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.640]   the um the issue you get into is that uh you're little and it's really hard to
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:58.200]   justify the cost and the effort to start then right but what they all tell you
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.120]   is is that to now you're getting it's 20 or 30 employees now like now i'm
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.040]   like i if i had started this three years ago you know i can't even imagine how
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.960]   smooth this transition would be and we got the the memberships three years ago
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.080]   we just never devoted enough time so that all i can say isn't if you're
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.680]   you've got a little company that whether it sells for us or oracle or
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.000]   whatever think about those kind of tools because
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.600]   we really wish we had implemented them years ago well i will never use
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.200]   lotus notes again i don't care but you're not here no not that
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.800]   that doesn't it's it's funny i think everybody agrees that email is universally
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.000]   broken but nobody has really figured out what to do
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.280]   in this place so i know that was a big rat hole i'm sorry and it all began
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.840]   because you said you didn't like mail and then i had to find out why now i'm
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.920]   sorry there you go there you go i had a future
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.240]   that's how i was gonna say just to Andy's point earlier that
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.240]   uh you know we're in a very different market than we were when the 3GS and the
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.120]   4s came out i know Andy knows that much more competitive
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.480]   much more yeah absolutely and the thing with the 4s update is
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.680]   again we've heard that it's going to be the same casing again and when you hear
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.880]   about it two years ago when apple introduced the ipad they were very
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.520]   successful in changing the conversation from
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.000]   spec sheets feature lists and technology into an experience debate they had
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   those peter kliete commercials and they said it's not about being thin or fast
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.040]   and whatnot but now it's gone back to being almost a
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.560]   spec battle again in a feature set battle and there's things like optical image
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.240]   stabilizers and digitizer pens and 1080p screens
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.720]   and wireless charging yeah yeah and fc all these things that people look at and
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.480]   they wonder why apple doesn't have them and apples never been
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.920]   quick about adding those things the three the original iphone had no 3g
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.720]   the 4s had no lte the five has no nfc apple's always been very conservative
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.320]   with those kinds of technologies so to say apple's not innovative for having
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.360]   stuff that they were never market leading on is odd but
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.480]   it's the it's not the reality i want to make it clear that this is part i think
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:56.360]   of the apple is doomed um general meme but it's the perception that is now
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.040]   surrounding the idea that oh it's just going to be a five s this year even
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.160]   though apples never announced it may never make a product all the i've been
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.160]   for s the perception is it's going to be a five s and that's not going to be enough
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:12.840]   as your fault we blame you well to correct the perception
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.680]   according to commscore apple is the top in the u.s. anyway the top
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.600]   phone manufacturer in fact increased its lead
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:25.720]   um so google is first in terms of platform with android apple's second
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.680]   with ios but as ios now gains on believe it or not ios thanks to the
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:36.280]   hot sales of the iphone five is gaining on android in fact apple's gains according
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.720]   to commscore in the hardware space was so large that not only did ios gain
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.360]   significantly and it actually took a hit uh so it's android ios blackberry
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:50.760]   microsoft and symbian um and in terms of sales
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:56.920]   uh the share of subscribers um is uh is let's see
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.280]   point change three and a half anyway you can see if you go read all this
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.320]   it's not like the mackerelope that an excellent column and a lot of these
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.760]   surveys came out and the headlines were still android gains on apple and
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.960]   enterprise no oh in enterprise maybe yeah
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.800]   well i mean the apple grew a huge amount but the headline focused on the small
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.280]   amount that android the headlines now are no longer as
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.560]   favorable to apple as they were yeah two years ago
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.680]   so it's a much harder climate people were calling the iphone five boring
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.360]   imagine what the presumption is they'll call an iphone five that's all it looks
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.480]   the same right apple went up apple's share of
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.240]   smartphones went up three and a half percent in the last quarter
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.600]   um google's dropped one point three percent
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:42.280]   um and maybe uh i mean uh maybe maybe more to the point
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:52.200]   i mean it's it certainly addresses the claim that apple is facing a problem
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.360]   with the iphone because that's just competition is what it's facing
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:01.480]   well i mean well i mean if uh if they were really if apple were failing to
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.160]   ship a product that was that were that was communicating to consumers
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.760]   that would definitely be reflected in the sales numbers and it's just not
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.120]   so whatever apple's doing it's making its customers very very happy well
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.040]   apples yeah apples number one in terms of manufacturer
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.760]   and only reason android's number one is because it's 18 different companies
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.920]   making it well also internationally uh with the
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.720]   the subsidies of the u_s_ numbers here yeah right
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.640]   the internationally the if that's the most interesting piece of data there is
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:35.400]   that if people if people are offered the choice between an iphone and an
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.200]   android phone and they both cost him on a money
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.840]   so many more people are going for the iphone in the u_s_
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:45.400]   when you go to another market where the iphone costs substantially more than an
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.080]   android phone even a really really substandard iphone
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:53.000]   excuse me a substandard uh android phone a lot of people are saying look i
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.840]   don't i would much rather have an extra hundred euro in my pocket or 200 euro
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.760]   in my pocket then uh then have something that that's a much much better phone
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.960]   so there's a lot of information to collate from all these data all these
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.680]   pieces of data to me one of the most interesting pieces in this com
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:11.240]   score study is that only 55 percent of americans have smartphones that means
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:16.040]   there's still a large number of people who haven't bought smartphones
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:21.960]   who are those people i don't know i don't i don't want to out anybody
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:28.760]   but uh i've a friend of mine who is a senior contributor to a very prominent
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:35.800]   online mac and apple news publication has this a basic feature contract phone
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.720]   uh even though he can certainly afford an iphone he can certainly afford to have
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.960]   whatever he wants he just wants to keep all that as he as he puts he wants to
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.560]   keep that crap out of his pocket you know i wonder there may be a backlash where
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.160]   people don't want you know the i watch and glass may be the thing that pushes
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.800]   over the top where we just say no i don't want people sending me stuff in my
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.840]   pocket i just i need to make i think i think i think i think it's gonna
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.760]   be i think it's gonna be the opposite i think we're gonna find that that our
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.440]   iphone is is it's not enough it was too much it's like oh i gotta
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.080]   carry this thing around right you know like i you know i think that that's
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.560]   gonna be more of the the issue i think that there's a lot of
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.840]   day-to-day things that we're using our iphone for that something like glass or
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.960]   an i watch would would definitely fix maybe i don't
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.560]   still have to have a phone for both of those devices you know
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:27.400]   uh yeah maybe i'm pretty sure you will i i don't think they've yet
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.760]   it's mostly battery is the issue i don't think they've got a big issue but yeah
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.400]   but i think that there's you're really not carrying a phone you're carrying a
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.040]   battery pack well again i think that one of the things that
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.920]   that that is going to be interesting is that i think both apple and
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.600]   and google need to attack this process of getting rid of the phone number one
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.520]   way or the other which is that i agree i i haven't always reachable
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.640]   this is who i am when you click on Alex you're gonna get me and is whether it's
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.880]   using cellular data or wifi data or whatever it is way ahead on that
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.040]   they're way ahead of that and i think that app this is
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.480]   like the big feature that apple has to figure out is how to solve
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.080]   take what they did with i messages and move it to to the phone you know
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:08.360]   who has a stealth play in this game is microsoft because of skype
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.320]   right it's just that the problem is is that skype it turns out buying skype
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.680]   might have been a really smart thing for microsoft to do
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.080]   oh yeah i think i think i think it was i think it was a great idea i think they
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.120]   had to do it i think that was you know i i i think that that was um
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.840]   probably one of the best purchases they've made in a long time but one of the best
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.400]   things they've done i don't think it was necessarily good for skype but i think
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.320]   it was good for um for for microsoft but it puts them in a position to make a
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.240]   phone that is not a phone that is uh that is a
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.080]   VoIP phone well and i think that the the issue is we still have to have a have a
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.040]   way for us to react i mean the problem right now is skype is still a matter
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.160]   of a you know opening it up and making sure that it's all there and and rather
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.840]   than like literally if it's built into the o s like this is the way it works
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.240]   well can i just tell you having used windows a for a while
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.800]   it's very hard to turn skype off well and i just reboot it skype started
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.360]   it's logged me in right i mean that might be the
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.160]   that's the few that's where microsoft's headed that's why they're
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.480]   killing messenger their i.m. solution is getting killed on the 15th and three
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.960]   days very abruptly and the message from it every time you
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.960]   you try to use it is please go to skype go to skype they want skype running in
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.920]   the background all the time and then the next step is
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.240]   by the way you might as well have a phone number as long as you got skype
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.200]   running right it's time to load i think it just it's just there right
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.960]   whenever you turn on something there's no separate app anymore
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.080]   FaceTime yeah i think you know that's probably the same thing you turn on
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.200]   FaceTime is just waiting FaceTime what i want is FaceTime
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.000]   i essentially want FaceTime without the face part like like the thing is i
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.480]   don't really want to do FaceTime all the time you know like i
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:37.320]   and yes you can close it people send me every time i say that people i get a
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.360]   whole bunch of emails and post on my twitter that say you know you can just
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.400]   hide the app and then and then it's basically not FaceTime but i don't
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.200]   want that i just want to just want to call someone i want to say do i just
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.400]   want to do a voice call to this person and if they have an iPhone
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.600]   it just does that you know and you know and i just in FaceTime link so it's just
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.040]   one thing yeah so i mean that's i think that that is
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.280]   such a missing piece of this communication process and i don't want i can decide
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:03.960]   i want to call them and i can decide whether it's going to ring on my iPad
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:08.520]   or on my iPhone or on my on my computer doesn't matter as a Mac user it should
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.800]   be something that is just like i just decide okay here i'm here or i can
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.440]   define where that phone call is going to go maybe it goes to all of them and
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.440]   whichever i answer first is where it goes but you know a lot of us have these
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.240]   multiple devices we're trying to figure it out and we don't i you know i want to
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.200]   be able to use my iPad if i you know with a with a headset
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.520]   you know um as a phone you know where remember the remember the the
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.880]   the key feature of any communication system is the initial connection
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.320]   you that has to be the simplest part of the entire process
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:39.800]   and as great as FaceTime is you start with the question of does this person
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.280]   have an apple product that i'm communicating with
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:46.600]   then if not okay do they have Skype if not okay well do they have this and can i
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.880]   walk them through the process of installing Skype or can i convince them
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:56.040]   to switch to an iPhone so we make i mean it's it's it's uh the phone numbers are
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:00.760]   a problem voice communication is a problem but the but the win is that
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.200]   it's something dumb that everybody knows how to use and everybody can support
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.840]   well i think in the in the issue though is like for instance so when i when i'm
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.160]   overseas which i do fairly often i stop sending texts to people who have android
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.760]   phones because now it's expensive like it's costing me like 50 cents every
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.120]   time i talk to them you know and so so like i immediately like you know if
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.000]   they don't have that now i have to send them emails or figure out something but
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.880]   i literally just cut everybody everybody gets cut off a communication when i go
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.480]   when i go overseas and i only do stuff with i message because i'm gonna trust me a
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.280]   lot of money because i message just data you know and so
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.640]   so the you know and and that's nothing i mean here's where apple really missed
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.760]   the boat and it's funny because they promised otherwise they'd never put
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.800]   out they said when they released FaceTime this is an open
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.160]   standard we're using open standards and they never put out an api they can
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:47.720]   never put out an api for messages had they done so it could be cross platform
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.440]   and then they'd be very well positioned
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.480]   my understanding is they got sued on FaceTime they've been sued once they were
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.920]   into appeal i believe they just lost the appeal and i think the lawsuit's
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.200]   kind of gotten away of their plans to reread because it's FaceTime is all
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.840]   open standard technology anyway and they were going to put their packaging of
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.960]   it together and there was a company i forget the name right now i'm a tracer i
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.080]   didn't know i think twice now that's a he so that's really
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.680]   interesting because that's obviously then what what apple intended
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.560]   and you see the big players microsoft and google
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:19.480]   doing this eventually i don't think it's very long
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:24.040]   before we aren't using telephony anymore even the
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:29.720]   wireless companies are using are moving towards lte data for voice
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.280]   they haven't done it yet but there but that's the plan that's why they're
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.480]   rolling out lte so hopefully when the lawsuit is
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.760]   either settled lost one whatever then we can what's the whole that's interesting
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.720]   i didn't i have to look that up i didn't know about that yeah i believe they
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:46.040]   just lost the appeal but i'm not positive and it uh it's somebody who says we own
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:51.080]   the uh it's a patent role i think you know or at least it was east it was
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.640]   east texas district or that's a patent role
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:57.080]   yeah or as i've learned by talking to our lawyers
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:01.080]   you call them npe's because that's not it's inflammatory
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.120]   non-practicing entities and what it means is somebody who has a patent
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.640]   but never made a product or intended to make a product
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.200]   in other words they got the patent so they could sue people
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.280]   yeah so oh that's really interesting i didn't know that and that's
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.480]   yeah can we pay such a tax in this country for these guys
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:21.960]   on innovation it's very sad that's it would make such a difference and it
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.920]   would give apple a real opportunity to be a player in this
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.400]   and i think this is going to be a huge space
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:32.360]   you you pinpointed it Alex what you need is a cross-platform solution
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:38.200]   that lets you do text voice and if you want video any platform to any
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.520]   way anywhere like all of that stuff and as Skype is close to that
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.720]   Skype is close to that well i'll say the problem with Skype right now is that
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.320]   is that on my iPhone uh it i'm i finally
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.600]   nailed the fact that if i open up Skype and leave it on in the background it
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.320]   just drains the battery to the to the ground i mean it's like
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.880]   like literally in an hour my phone will be dead
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.640]   you know and so so leaving Skype on on a on an iPhone is not
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:05.640]   not a good idea so the company uh the company suing apple is called
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:11.160]   vernet x v-i-r-n-e-t-x and you're right a couple of about a week and a half ago
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:17.080]   a judge in east texas upheld the uh decision against apple
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:21.400]   saying that face time infringes on their patents
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.640]   now the judgment said that apple will pay 368 million dollars which is not a
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:30.200]   huge amount for a company that has 140 billion in the bank
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.200]   and the the judge ordered the two companies to come to a licensing deal
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.800]   so that apple could continue to use the patents so that we we actually are
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.880]   close to resolution of this which may mean that apple is a is in a position
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:47.640]   in a in a few months or a year this lawsuit um what was also against
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:52.920]   microsoft which settled in 2010 and um
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:57.560]   the company wanted seven hundred eight million dollars got half that
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.800]   so they usually do i think they sue someone they get the money from that
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.600]   lawsuit and use that to start suing more and more people well i could tell you
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:07.560]   a lot about that i have i have i have some knowledge about these stuff now
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:12.440]   um very interesting well that may be maybe face time free face time
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:17.400]   free messages but the question is why would that be an apple's best
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.520]   interests because it's such a great value add just like just like
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:24.280]   alex said if you're talking to people who have iphones that's free messaging and
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.160]   it works and it doesn't really have any downside whatsoever as long as you're
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:31.480]   within that same ecosystem so i don't know the real issue is that they wouldn't
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.760]   blame apple for wanting to keep this an apple apple exclusive product
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:38.200]   yeah but it makes it much less useful and if there are cross-platform solutions
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:42.920]   like so i mean it it it may it might but the other advantages is when you own
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.720]   the ecosystem you have a lot more control over whether it works or not you know
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.280]   once you start when you start trying to play with everybody then you have to
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:52.520]   deal with everybody and so the the the that is the one advantage that apple
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.400]   has and i have to admit that the reason that i
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.080]   slowly have been buying ipads and stuff for my
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.640]   for my family is so that we want to thank you but i mean just
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.000]   FaceTime like i it's harder for me to try to explain to them how to use
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.560]   Skype or uh hangouts or whatever which is something that i use a lot of both of
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.160]   those this is much more than than not than FaceTime but FaceTime is much
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.400]   easier if i just give them a platform and then they can just click on the button
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.600]   this is the great battle this is the great battle or open versus close there's
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.800]   benefits to both there's also this thing that everyone
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.920]   likes to talk about this company's open this company is closed but almost always
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.880]   companies keep closed what makes the money like google search
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.680]   google ad sense and they open up what fragments and
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.960]   affects the money of their competition and you apple made web kit that's
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.840]   well they didn't make it but they they've helped pioneer web kit
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:41.480]   and that's completely open if apple believes that FaceTime makes the
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.960]   money and it's worth owning it then they'll keep it closed but if they
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.680]   believe that it creates a halo effect to apple products
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.440]   or that owning infrastructure in telecommunications is important enough for
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.480]   their future then it might be in their best interest to open it and that's
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.040]   usually how all these companies kind of measure yeah
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:59.480]   i can't think a single single case of apple doing this by the way
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.080]   even i'd say they did their own thing on on windows they made it
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.400]   it was a big battle over whether to make a windows version
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.680]   they finally decided i'm kind of tired of people saying that
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.760]   uh open is just universally a feature open is not a feature it's something
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.280]   that can allow a feature to blossom and to be practical and useful
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.040]   but every time i hear someone touting linux or touting
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:25.240]   uh less standards compliant excuse me less proprietary standard compliant
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:29.240]   technology i'm like okay you're saying that open is better
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:33.080]   in the sense that cannibalism is is not better than you know not eating
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.760]   other people what what feature is the open nature of this i'll give you the
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.400]   feature actually delivering to the user i'll give you the feature
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.840]   open apis that other companies can create clients
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.720]   and that would allow for instance somebody on linux
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.720]   or windows to create a FaceTime client right and it would solve Alex's problem
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:54.040]   that's what i mean by open right i'm just i'm just i'm just addressing a
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.880]   larger thing i mean people people seem to think that open is
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.320]   is just universally a good thing as opposed to
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:05.240]   red is not universally a good color it's a great color for a fire truck not a
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.600]   good thing to wear it to wear it a funeral would you agree that open is good for
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.680]   people and closed is good for companies not necessarily depends on the
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.560]   of the implementation i think apple products are really the
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.720]   the the crown jewel of this argument that it's the most locked down ecosystem
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:23.400]   ever but it's good for companies well no but the fact of matter is that it's
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.840]   also good for users because these things work in a predictable manner
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.520]   that if you that if one company controls the horizontal the and the vertical and
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.600]   the in and the depth as well that means that they can reduce the
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:38.200]   number of surprises that the user is actually going to experience
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.720]   i like my boxes my shiny boxes to be closed because they give incredibly
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.280]   good experiences and i like all the protocols that come in and out of them
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.400]   to be open because that way i can switch whenever i want i would
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.440]   i would submit one of the reasons i'm ready to change to an android phone is
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:54.520]   because it's more open than the i thought absolutely my i i i think that there's
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.320]   a happy medium someplace in between i mean to you to
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.240]   to build upon renaissance analogy i i like to have a house with weather type
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:05.000]   windows that i can open and close when i choose to i want to i like i don't want
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.440]   to i want to find out these things are sealed shut because the building super
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:11.400]   said nope we have air conditioning which is much better for you than simply
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.040]   natural breezes you're welcome i want to breeze it's nice outside
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:21.560]   web ado one says the future is not open or closed it's a jar
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.280]   that's true well i better hear the ball
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.960]   i think that we uh we just have to remember that every company that is in
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.800]   businesses looking to do two things um they're looking to to control the
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.440]   areas that make the money and commoditize everything else right
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.320]   that's you know that's you know and so every you know every company is looking
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.800]   to do that and so you know and they're just picking their battles you know
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.600]   which part do we want to control to make to generate revenue
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.720]   and everything else to them should be commoditized it should be you know
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.840]   well i i think it's more new i think it's more nuanced than that Alex because i
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:52.680]   think if we're in our in the way we got into this discussion is
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:57.160]   uh the issue of whether you could face time from anybody but a
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.120]   Mac platform one of the things that keeps you from using face time
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.080]   is you have to know whether somebody has a Mac platform or not
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:07.480]   an apple platform or not that's a disadvantage to the general widespread
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:11.080]   adoption of face time and i think that you could make the case that that would
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.840]   be good for apple if it would open the apis and let others develop clients
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:18.200]   oh but i think that my question would be and that might be the case
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.640]   i mean which is better to have a phone that can call any phone in the country
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.280]   or a phone that can only call half the phones in the country
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.240]   oh yeah but but i think that well i think that that would be an issue but i
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.080]   mean i think that you'd always have a phone i think that you're always going to
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.880]   have to have a phone that can call everyone um but the main thing is is that
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.000]   what i'm mostly interested in is that is to make sure that
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.280]   i can call apple products you know on data uh i mean our company as i said we
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.880]   what a lot of us have android phones i have an android phone um
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:47.160]   we and we use we use them a fair bit you know the standard
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.680]   is like everybody's got iPads at every location that we work at and and
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.640]   everything else and so for us we're mostly focused on just making sure that
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.600]   works um i mean i have to you know as a company that
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.600]   you know we do a lot of stuff that we occasionally we work as an open company
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.800]   and a lot of times we work as a close company where we control the entire
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.640]   pipeline and when we control the whole pipeline of what we do
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.920]   you know it is more stable it is more predictable it is easier for us to
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:15.480]   to produce a great product at a low price um you know and it is not it is
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.520]   it's a dramatic difference than when we have to interchange with a whole
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.720]   bunch of other people to to do that because we sometimes we fill apart and
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.920]   sometimes we fill the whole thing and we we can always tell our client that it's
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:29.000]   gonna be a better solution if we control i'm not arguing with you about that but i
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.640]   think that that's the that's why you keep things closed is that that's the
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.120]   impediment to widespread adoption of FaceTime period this
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:39.400]   why FaceTime hasn't taken off yeah and why Skype has yeah i mean yeah okay
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.960]   yeah it's right there's not a lot of people using
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.080]   FaceTime it's yeah but yeah okay but it's very clear
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:49.800]   here's an example Skype versus FaceTime yeah there's a clear winner
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.920]   protocols have historically done really well when they're open and by the way
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:58.280]   Skype is not open by any means it's just cross platform right um but i also
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.080]   guess the point where open is so open to interpretation and definition and
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.960]   people just use the word without specifying which meaning that they have
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.760]   for it i just i just want as a user i don't care
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.720]   open close and i know this is what users users aren't thinking about that
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:13.720]   they just say i would love to not use my cell phone company or maybe only use
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.680]   them as yeah it's very analogous to what's happening with the television
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:21.240]   where people want to use Comcast and Time Warner as a k as a data company
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.960]   and not by the premium television service and of course these companies
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:27.560]   hate that the the cell phone carriers hate messages
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:31.800]   because it rides on top of the data and supplants their very profitable SMS
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.000]   system but that's where we're moving regardless
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.960]   i think and that's what customers want right yeah absolutely
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:43.080]   so i don't you know it depends on the product that's what i'm saying
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.880]   yeah it would be nice if it worked nicely and it was pretty in fact you
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.200]   could make the case that one of the reasons FaceTime didn't take off is
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.720]   because it only works about half the time
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:55.640]   real but messages works great for just for all the reasons that Alex said
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:59.400]   if a message is confusing a little bit to me like maybe it's solved now
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:04.040]   because you have a problem where you don't know whether this is being
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:07.560]   sent through the excuse there's color codes that
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.440]   tip you off whether or not something is being sent through the text messaging
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:13.960]   network or through the messages network but then what if someone moves from a
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:17.160]   phone to another device and your conversation was being done through
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.040]   text messages does i is i message smart enough to know
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:23.960]   that okay hey he's on an iPad now hey that iPad is on the LTE network i can
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:27.880]   i can reroute through this now and in my experience it's just not that
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.640]   it is not clever enough to take that switch i see that one jumping back
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:34.440]   back and forth all the time when i'm using it and and i again like the
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.600]   things we send lots and lots and lots of images
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:40.600]   and again when when someone has an android phone one of the reason we don't
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.640]   supply android phones to everybody in the company is because with i message i
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.520]   can sit there and right send all those i can text all those images to
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.880]   someone from a site that we're you know we're scouting or whatever
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.680]   and i can text things to people and if it's if they've got android i know that
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:56.040]   that's a buck fifty each you know i mean like you know you know if if
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:00.200]   it's a shame that google voice doesn't support uh mms or some sort of
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.560]   uh text uh pictures because google voice works
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.120]   it works for messaging cross-platform it works
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:09.320]   if phone number if i could just get everybody use my google voice number
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.840]   uh and my google and my gmail account it works totally cross-platform works
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:16.120]   everywhere it's not great on the iphone because you have to run a google voice
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:21.000]   app but it works and uh it just but there is one big issue you can't send
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.960]   images and it's us only still you know it's it
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.600]   promising yeah oh well then it's worthless then forget it
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.520]   yeah i didn't realize that oh that's worthless then
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.800]   yeah they've been promising it to go international for years and hasn't
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.320]   i didn't realize that well that's no good
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.960]   and i admit i meant that google voice is one of the big things that i mean if it
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.160]   did if it did images and uh you know it is one of the thing
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:45.080]   yeah and international you know it would change our view of android
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.760]   you know i mean it's just yeah oh i'm disappointed i forgot about that it's
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:52.440]   not yeah never mind forget i mentioned it we're gonna take a break when we come
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:56.360]   back Phil Schiller says don't use android
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:00.440]   in a cryptic tweet and i want to ask you mentioned the wireless charging uh
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.960]   any rumors i'll ask rene if there are any rumors about wireless charging on the
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:08.520]   iphone or an ipad i would love that it's one of the things i would like to get
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.240]   you know windows phones have it and i would like to get that in
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.560]   my next phone just plop pre-hat it the pre-hat it right
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:20.520]   does your blackberry have it i don't i don't know actually i didn't look it
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:24.840]   might it's got a plastic back but it's got a battery do you like that z10
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:28.840]   it's uh it's not it's a version one product it's nowhere near the version
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:32.680]   one product the g1 was uh but it's it's really nice i like the
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.400]   concepts i like the gestures i like the way they thought about the interface
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:38.280]   and the way that they did the blackberry balance between business and
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:42.280]   between personal it's got a lot of really really good ideas
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:46.760]   it's so funny because i'm starting this is this is starting to sound familiar
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.080]   this isn't that what we said about windows phone really great ideas really
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:52.040]   nice implementation beautiful i'm not going to use it
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:55.000]   this blackberry time really great implementation really good ideas it's
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.040]   really pretty i'm not going to use it i'm not going to
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.120]   before before we go to commercial i'd be right before i forget
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:04.360]   ever any when you when you said that's not say not where the g1 was do you mean
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:07.880]   in a good way or in a bad way i will like like the g1 if you remember
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.760]   i had that google search field and if you close the keyboard it would ask
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.240]   you to input in the search field and you physically had no way of
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.600]   inputting it or a game would say like push up to continue and you had no idea
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.320]   if it was the four way off or stroke up or yeah so
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.800]   this it just has a very different one five was not
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.480]   was not a real no but you could see like rene said you could see the future a
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.480]   little bit it was like a window into hey this may
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:32.680]   as i i think when one mind the that sticks out for me from my review of of the g1
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:36.760]   was you've got to really really hate apple to buy this
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:41.960]   you don't want it real bad yes yes no it's it's not like it's got like i said
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.760]   a few little version one quirks but it looks like blackberries fixing they're
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.120]   doing updates already and it's i like the idea of being able to quickly
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.280]   gesture into all parts of the navigation i think that's really
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:57.160]   phenomenal yeah i i we'll see i i i i i i i i always like i always
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:00.440]   see it like i do a lot of work in dc and i and i'll be in dc and i'll look at
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:03.800]   somewhat it is a lot of blackberries in dc and you just look at it like really
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.920]   oh yeah but that's there's for a lot of good reasons really why the government
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.800]   still uses blackberries yeah but they all have they all have
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.680]   an they all have their their government phone to the blackberry and then they
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.480]   have their own which is an android or mad yeah the samsung ads have made great
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.920]   hay with that safe yeah yeah safe that's the new safe thing
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.640]   because they're really trying to convince people it's safe to use android
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.520]   sand safety samsung not even an ill still shall there will teach them
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:28.200]   yeah we'll show you i'll just tweet about that
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.360]   um no but you know we have it because we're tech journalists we we are always
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.920]   looking we're trying to find a crystal ball that we could look into the future
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:40.520]   so we'll look at things like glass or blackberry x 10 or chrome o s and see
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:43.720]   the future not but but it but don't confuse that with us saying that's a
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:48.520]   product you should buy right exactly but there's something there we see
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:52.840]   something happening but whenever i can use it you like it happens
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:55.880]   when i when i write reviews i feel i have to be very very careful about
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:59.480]   uh making you in paragraph number one saying i'm not saying you should buy it
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.040]   but there's a lot of interesting things going on and then i'll go back there
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.640]   otherwise yeah exactly people who asked me why did why did you why didn't you
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.640]   switch to windows phone and i had to say because i've heard about these things
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.560]   called apps and i really think there is a great idea that i i want my phone
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:17.800]   platform to have i think a lot of us like a lot of people think that we are
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:22.040]   that we're partisan in these games but we just love technology almost all of us
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:25.720]   i used to have windows phone xbox and pc exclusively in my house and then i like
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:28.680]   something else better right and maybe one day i'll like something else better
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.840]   again but as a fan of technology it's the first time every major platform
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.920]   has great devices on it and i think that's an amazing thing and i want to try as
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:40.680]   many of them as i can precisely well what i what i love is the fact that
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.240]   they're so close in about they're they're so close in
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:47.720]   parody uh which is just creating this just intense growth in our in this
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:51.960]   it just the i think we're really beating up on Moore's law in a lot of ways
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:55.080]   not so much in the in the speed of the processor but but beating up on how
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:59.560]   quickly we expect to see incredible leaps in technology uh because there's
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:03.000]   so much competition in this in this area we're really in that kind of
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   the railroads moment you know for a smartphone still i think we think that
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.320]   everybody has them but really as you were talking about Leo before
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:13.320]   45 still don't have him and we're still talking about the rest of the world so
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:17.000]   we're still in that that crazy growth period where there's just a lot of
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.280]   creativity and a lot you know and this will all probably settle down and
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:23.240]   it'll be implanted in our brains i don't want it to settle down
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.840]   that's that's the reason we become tech journalists because right we want to
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:29.880]   see what's next what's next what's next what's next what's next we're a
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.720]   little strange that way i'll tell you what's next a commercial and then we'll
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:37.400]   be back with more Alex Lindsey Renee Richie Andy and Akko we're talking
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.920]   mac we're talking apple we're talking phones talking about whatever the hell
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:44.200]   we want to talk about that's right that's the true sorry girls
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:51.720]   i apologize she says she's that's cute it's okay it's okay
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.320]   i showed it they brought you by legal zoom dot com

[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.560]   this idea
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.680]   wireless charging we're going to get it rene
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:13.080]   uh... you know if it is a five s like we've heard then there's very
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:16.040]   what capacity charging right now there's two big players is the power map
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.720]   people and i believe is pronounced key
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:21.480]   um... one has a starbucks deal one has widespread support with a bunch of
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:24.360]   manufacturers and it's one of those chicken and the egg things where if
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.000]   apple decided to pick a side it could probably help
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   move us towards a standard
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.800]   uh... i haven't heard about wireless charging phil shiller made those
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.600]   comments about n_f_c_ and wireless charging not being
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:39.160]   mainstream technologies right after the iphone five launch last year
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:42.440]   uh... but i'd like to see it one day like i said the palm pre is had it
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:45.160]   had us what to two thousand nine two thousand ten
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.960]   it's i think it's a mature technology and it would be a great addition and if you
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.640]   start doing things like watches or you have a bunch of different ipads or
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:55.720]   ipods lying around being able to stack them on a mat is is a much more
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:59.240]   attractive solution than having to have eight hundred cables lying everywhere in
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.120]   your house it's capacitive not inductive
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.680]   so there's two there's there's inductive and there's
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:08.440]   i forget pompre had inductive charging and the samsung galaxy s as the other
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.080]   country had the other kind oh
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.720]   and then there's a different burn the different brands the power map brand
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.920]   and the chia brand
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:17.480]   well i think that one of the one of the things that i i think about with this
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.880]   is that it i think it works well with people who have
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:23.080]   great home bases whether that's the office or the house or whatever i think
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.560]   that for me i travel a lot and i think about and i think about how many
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:29.800]   things i charge and you know i get concerned that that when we get into
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.640]   that it's the unit cost of every of charging each thing becomes much
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.040]   higher and that's the only thing that that that i get
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.280]   concerned about when i when i think about a lot of these technologies and
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.960]   whether i'd actually use them or not
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:45.000]   inductive charging also known as wireless charging uses an electromagnetic field
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.320]   to transfer the energy according to wikipedia it's sent through
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.840]   an inductive coupling to an electrical device which can then use that energy
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:57.480]   to charge batteries so it's like a magnet
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.600]   and it was like a friend of mine deter bone is now at the verge he put them into
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.560]   his car he put them everywhere so you could just come in slap his phone down
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:07.560]   on his dashboard and drive and again starbucks is apparently rolling them
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:10.040]   out into a lot of their restaurants and there's probably going to be hotel
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.320]   deals and it won't be ubiquitous especially at first but it'll be
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.640]   interesting you don't you know lower risk of electrical
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.920]   shock uh it's safer for medical implants which is
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.280]   interesting uh you go through the skin instead of
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:27.000]   wires of course lower lower efficiency and it wastes
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.320]   heat it is more costly of course to build the electronics
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:35.480]   and the charging is slower have you tried it is it a lot slower
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:39.320]   it's appreciably slower i didn't i've never timed it i did have it with
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:41.880]   the i did have one of those touchstones for the palm pre
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:45.000]   and you know it is gimmicky in a way because you
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.120]   it's one of those things that appeal to us geeks that's nerds much more oh look i
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:51.000]   can just slap my phone down and it charges we
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.800]   might would my mom use it i don't know yet and i think that's you know one of
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.840]   those things where apple usually waits a generation or two before
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:00.120]   picking aside and embracing a technology louise in our chat was pointing at it's
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:03.000]   been used with electric toothbrushes for a long time that's right my electric
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.520]   toothbrush you just put it on the stand and it charges
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.880]   but it is a cool example the sort of technology that can sort of hide inside
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:13.000]   the device until the user is ready to start embracing it
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.680]   um i mean the the the weird thing about inductive charging is that
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:20.040]   what you're the problem that you're freeing people from is the problem of
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:25.400]   having to do this right not easy was it oh my god that's so
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:29.160]   careful unless if you're trying not to drop for those of you listening at home
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:33.000]   he was plugging in a lightning cable yeah yeah exactly and that it takes like
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.400]   no time but i feel about the wireless charge in the same way i feel about nfc
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.600]   where uh it's if it as long as it doesn't
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:44.840]   appreciably make the device cost a lot more money so long as it doesn't make it
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:47.400]   so thick that people are going to be looking at this and thinking oh my god
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.440]   that's one big chunky phone it can be a thing that's just
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:54.040]   there lurking until the moment in which someone just sort of happens to
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:57.400]   introduce you to nfc or introduce you to wireless charging and you realize
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:01.160]   hey that's kind of a cool thing to have and then it's it doesn't confuse until
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:04.120]   you discover it that when you discover it it might transform the device for
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:08.120]   you there are by the way working on uh inductive charging for
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:11.800]   vehicles yeah i see yes every year you see the
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.680]   big company's power mat and she always talked about the partner licensing
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:17.160]   agreements and i think nissan was going to put them into
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:21.000]   the cup holders or something on their cars it's one of those
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.960]   i don't know if it's a checklist item now or if it's a badge of honor item at
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:26.200]   this point but it definitely is getting a little bit
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:29.560]   attraction and i would guess that that's what near field communication uses
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:34.360]   is some sort of induction it's rfid yeah i think yeah that's how
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:38.600]   rfid id works because the the tag has no power but it gets power
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:44.360]   uh by by inductance yeah
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:47.800]   that's that thing that uh and matthew panzerino had a great article from the
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:51.800]   next web this weekend about how the one fatal flaw in the iphone and every
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.520]   phone and every gadget is battery life and because it doesn't
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:58.440]   progress as fast and you know i look at an iphone five and if apple had come out
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.080]   and said right now they said the iphone five is much
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:04.200]   thinner than the iphone four s and it gets the same battery life but if they'd
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.480]   come out and said the iphone five is every bit is then as a four s
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.840]   and hey it gets two days of battery life i mean i think i would have made that
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:14.760]   trade like the droid razor max sort of decision and i'm not sure we keep
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:18.680]   needing the thinner phone rather than the the longer lasting phone
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:21.960]   i was thinking about that i think i wrote something a couple months ago about
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:25.240]   that about how this might be the time that apple has to sort of give up the
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.960]   idea of making thinner devices with each iteration
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:32.360]   um and not and not just the idea of putting more more battery space in there
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:35.720]   but also there's going to be a time in which to do what apple wants to do with
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:38.520]   a camera they're gonna have to they're gonna be hitting the wall of
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:43.160]   limitations about how good a camera you can put into a micro thin device
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:48.440]   and still make it a superlative device if they i would love to i love to imagine
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:51.720]   that somewhere inside of apple there was a what if
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:54.840]   in which they're saying well we will never ship we're not necessarily going to
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:58.040]   ship this but build the best camera you can
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:01.720]   possibly and practically put into an iphone and it doesn't matter if you have
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:06.360]   to make it thicker we want to see how what the what the visual cost is
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:09.160]   going to be if we decide that we want to make the best
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:12.440]   eight megapixel camera that's ever been put inside a phone i never will be
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:15.320]   put inside a phone it's always bothered me that
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.680]   the battery technology just doesn't seem to move in the same with the same
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:22.600]   lightning speed everything else is we're just it we're still using ancient
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.560]   technology in effect you also have tricks to try to get it
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:28.120]   longer but there's not there's not a solution there's just more advanced
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:31.240]   trickery that they can do to reduce power to demand turn things on turn
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:34.120]   things off i got to think in a lab somewhere there's something that's
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:37.320]   lots more you know this that's that's one of the
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.200]   charities yeah something yeah well that's that's the trickle
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.640]   effect of tesla because it's been said quite accurately that tesla is really
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:46.920]   a battery company uh and this car is the car is the thing
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:50.440]   that put the batteries into uh because most most of the
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:54.200]   a lot of the really great new science about how to make batteries work
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:57.640]   better is really being funded by tesla as a matter of fact uh
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.680]   you know on musk i think uh in either interview or some
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:03.000]   some of the some of the conversations he was having
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.200]   around south by south west was talking about how he was trying to advise
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.440]   airlines on how to avoid the problems that
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:11.480]   cause that big real because he's saying though here's here's here's the problem
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.920]   you can have the exact same battery life the exact same
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:18.440]   parameters for these batteries all you have to do is package them in this way
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:21.160]   inside the container and this is how they will actually work
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:24.120]   so everybody that you're saying and because we talked about it on the
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:27.640]   security now on wednesday graphene is the next
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:32.040]   big leap forward i love this i haven't seen this very often on wikipedia
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:35.800]   this article may be too technical for most readers to understand
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:40.280]   but uh it's an atomic scale honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms it's literally
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:45.400]   uh one atom thick um and i don't know exactly how that helps you with
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:49.720]   batteries but apparently fragile uh no it's the toughest
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:54.520]   material known to man for its thickness for its thickness but i'm still
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.400]   interested yeah if you've got something if i had a sheet of something it was one
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.880]   atom thick i well you you know you probably you could
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:03.480]   probably tear it on the edge but it's a lot of paper cut but this is
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:06.920]   what's remarkable about it is how strong it is
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:12.360]   it's a full reen structure named after buckminster fuller
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.240]   you know apple gets hit sometimes for the lack of repairability of their
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:17.400]   devices but when they announce those first
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:20.440]   non-changeable batteries in the i in the mac books and
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:23.560]   the ipad those are just giant sealed batteries they poured battery into
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:27.400]   every millimeter and every milliamp that they could
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.400]   and that's one of the ways that they try to get around it
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.360]   you know to Andy's point about how you package the batteries right but it's
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:35.080]   it's going to hit a hard limit especially if you do want to get
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:40.360]   thinner and we got it and i will say that i that that uh battery life on all of
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:43.720]   my devices is far more important to me than their thickness i mean my
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:47.000]   my iphone is always thicker because generally i'm waiting for to go buy a new
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.600]   mophie but for the iphone fine but generally all my iphone 4s and
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:52.520]   everything else was in a case all the time it was in a
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:55.480]   my lee or or mophie case all the time because
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:59.240]   mophie's out the mophie ear is out i know i think of the week no spoilers
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:04.520]   nope x-nay on the x-nay phil sheller says on twitter
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:07.160]   he doesn't tweet much but when he does it's pithy
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:11.480]   be safe out there and then he links to an f secure article which says that
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:16.600]   android is terribly dangerous i might point out there was an
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.640]   interesting article i read today and i don't know if we have it in our show
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:24.120]   notes but uh about uh an issue that uh could be a
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:29.160]   huge issue on uh ios particularly on iphones
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.440]   these uh configuration profiles and i had one
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.560]   you've perhaps seen these on your iphone i had one installed
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:39.560]   for a beta of a program that was testing that wasn't yet in the app store
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:45.080]   but these profiles are installed often by your carrier on your phone
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:50.120]   and a malicious profile on your phone could give a bad guy access to
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:54.760]   everything including ssl uh web surfing
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:59.240]   passwords texts everything there's nothing
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.920]   innately malicious about it it's you it needs to be used
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:07.000]   but and they point out in this article which is on the next web.com
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.360]   there are a lot of companies uh using these in ways that are
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:16.040]   fundamentally risky for instance um
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:22.040]   AT&T which i think sells a few iphones um
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:28.120]   as AT&T stores were regularly handing out a printed document that told users
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:33.960]   to download a profile from unlockit.co.nz
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.400]   it's a site that hosts APN configuration files for international
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.880]   travelers it is a third party site it did not use ssl it was not a secure
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:45.640]   connection and so AT&T was telling customers oh yeah you want to
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.440]   configure a phone for international sites just download these
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:52.040]   these profiles these are inherently dangerous now they weren't dangerous
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:57.480]   of course but the point is that that's really a dangerous thing to do
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.840]   an apple used to give out profiles sometimes if you had battery issues uh
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.480]   and you got to advanced apple tech support they might give you a profile
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.120]   that would let them monitor all the battery usage on your device. But of
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:09.880]   course the apple gives it to you that's safe the issue is it can be
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.680]   installed very quickly and easily by going to a website and saying yeah
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:17.800]   install that profile and uh that's be very careful about that because
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.520]   this is a huge vector for especially if you beta test if you use test flight
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.120]   or hockey they'll always install profiles and you might get to a point
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:29.160]   where you just you get them so often you're not paying attention but
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.520]   just like on a computer when a thing pops up and says you've got a virus
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.720]   click here or do you want the latest xyz click here
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.520]   never ever click there unless you read really carefully. Do you know
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:43.560]   because I was I don't I found one a while ago from a beta of an app that I
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.360]   was testing and I removed it as soon as I found it because I wasn't testing
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.480]   anymore but do you know Renee where you would see these
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:53.640]   do you go to general yeah they're in settings general and I'll scroll down
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:57.400]   to find the exact because of the cellular you must get towards the
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:01.400]   bottom you must have some maybe I don't have them because I don't have any
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:04.680]   on yeah I have a bunch of them what is it where what what entry
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:08.120]   profile so general at profiles it's right above reset on the bottom
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.640]   okay so I don't have any because I have none but if you have profiles installed
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:15.960]   you'll see profiles there open that and if you don't recognize it take the
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:20.280]   dang thing off right absolutely you can and if it
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.360]   comes to worse if you remove it in error and you're
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.920]   whatever you beta you next try to install doesn't install you can just
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.720]   read download the profiles it's very low risk
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.960]   um it does underscore that almost every threat that's gonna hit your device
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:37.560]   is requires some form of user interaction right so but we know very well with
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:42.440]   phishing scams and stuff that most of us even some of us
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.440]   fall for this stuff all the time of course and and normal people you know
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.600]   especially if AT&T says oh you know go to this site and download this thing
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.840]   so Phil I agree be safe out there blah blah blah but uh I think it's a little
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:58.920]   mistakenly cocky to say well the problem's all on android side
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:03.240]   yeah I mean especially when uh the you get some eye-watering numbers that
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:07.000]   describe how many instances of malware exist
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.760]   for the android platform but if you limit it to just the sort of stuff that
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:14.600]   actual normal users are gonna encounter if you say well how many
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.640]   instances of malware are spread through the google play store
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.280]   and it drops down to something that's statistically
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:24.040]   practically nothing I think the the largest number I've seen is about
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:27.560]   0.5 percent of instances of malware would get
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:33.480]   be delivered to the google play store and you know the reason people
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:36.680]   assume that apple safe is because all apps are vetted and so the reason I
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:39.480]   mention this is that there are vectors for you to
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.720]   sideload that is totally wide open and if you could be tricked into
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.600]   sideloading these configuration profiles it's not an app you don't need to worry
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:50.360]   it's yummy and the same thing applies if you jail break you
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.880]   know you're you're told to change your SSH password you're warned not to go to
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.480]   certain repositories or just stick to trusted repositories it's
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.680]   it assumes a level of user control and what that user control comes
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:04.440]   the spider-man line right like great great power comes great responsibility
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:07.160]   somebody who said this and he's absolutely right no
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:10.200]   nothing is secure as long as users are using it
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:13.560]   well well I think I think also apple apple users I mean the thing that I always
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:17.080]   worry about is that we really risk a smallpox epidemic
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:21.400]   you know the way the native americans risked it because we've been team for so
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.680]   long we just don't have any we just don't have a lot of interaction with
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.640]   viruses you know and so the thing is is that we don't really you know I know
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:31.400]   that there's there's uh there's lots of people I can even be a
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.880]   little bit brazen about clicking on things because I'm like it's not gonna
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.040]   do anything to me I mean I'm not worried about getting you know and
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:39.480]   the thing is is that it could move you know if if something opens up I think
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:42.200]   we do have to stay vigilant and not get cocky about it because if something
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.080]   opens up a lot of us aren't really ready we don't have the tools we're not
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:50.040]   used to being you know in that in that environment
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:58.440]   here's an exclusive from uh writers apple has held talks with beets
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:03.720]   Jimmy yovine dr. Dre's company on a potential partnership involving beets
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:07.080]   planned music streaming service
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:11.800]   according to writers who says three people familiar with the situation
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.840]   told us this ice cube told them
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:19.400]   Apple's you're an apple CEO Tim Cook met with Jimmy
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:25.000]   Jimmy yovine CEO of beets uh in late February to find out about project
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.840]   daisy which is their music subscription service which they announced in
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:34.760]   January eddy q was at the meeting according to sources
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:38.280]   cook expressed interest in daisy's business model its rollout plans
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:41.720]   but did not discuss specifics of a deal does it make sense that apple might be
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:44.680]   moving towards a prescription and if they do would they partner with somebody
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:48.600]   else like beets I don't think they would
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:55.400]   doesn't sound incredible yeah it's um i've i've thought in the past that uh
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:59.400]   apple and beets have a lot in common in terms of wanting to have a brand that
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:03.480]   people recognize not only being not only having technology but also being
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:07.880]   a recognize consumer brand but yeah i mean if they would if they would want to
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:11.000]   do a radio service if they would want to do a subscription service
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.800]   really they are a content company they would want to own all that they
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.600]   wouldn't like to be beholden anybody else right
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.160]   i think the only reason apple would partner with someone is to get the
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.680]   get the in that they need if they're having trouble with negotiations
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:25.000]   i mean i think that if apple can do it on their own they would definitely do it
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.200]   on their own i think that they're i think it sounds like it's pretty sticky
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:33.320]   the situation as far as what it takes to get at least what apple wants probably
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:38.120]   probably a certain level of control and a level of control over the
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:43.400]   monetary distribution as well as the the the look and feel of the of the product
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.200]   and so i think that that trying to hash that out with the music industry has
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:50.600]   probably become um traditionally sticky i think it's also in
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.880]   when apple's in the music business my guess is that and jimmy i mean is not
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:57.640]   only with beets he's chairman of i forget the exact long string of record
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.080]   companies that he's oh yeah but they routinely meet with these people and
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.960]   this sounds to me like one of those routine meetings that he has with the
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:07.640]   heads of every record cable and discusses all services that they're
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:10.280]   i mean it would it would almost be negligent in apple's position not to
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.320]   meet with everybody when they have the opportunity
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:18.120]   well according to the newspaper of record the new york post
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:22.200]   record labels is objecting to apple's proposed low royalty rate for streaming
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:25.400]   savis which was ivy and again i think saying that apple was low balling in
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:28.360]   yes six cents per hundred song streamed
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:33.960]   um a pandora pays twelve cents apple wants a rate that's low at
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:37.560]   empan doris at one high level executive probably iovine is that how you pronounce
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:42.200]   iovine i have no idea i have no idea
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:46.040]   i don't i guess i don't understand uh you know
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.760]   maybe i don't i don't have an mba so i don't understand why
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:52.760]   it seems like the negotiation rather than a per song basis really to me it seems
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:56.440]   like it makes more sense for there to be you know we have a this subscription
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:59.320]   service and we're going in really the more of the agreement is is that we're
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:03.640]   going to give you 60 percent or 70 percent of the revenue of that
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.040]   subscription service and then we're going to track how many people watch all
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.760]   these songs and fractional songs and everything else
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:14.120]   and then if your song gets if your you know content gets 10 percent
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:17.880]   you know we can give you 10 percent of that 60 percent that we agreed to or the
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.520]   70 percent that we agreed to or whatever that number is
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:24.120]   um you know and it's a pot that's being cut up rather than a per song it seems
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.080]   like that the per song is a very i'm sure it makes sense to somebody but it
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:30.120]   it seems like it would it's saying you know then we can negotiate
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.760]   what the total percentage of apple's going to take out of that
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.440]   and then everyone else is just sharing in that in that pot so to speak
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:39.560]   um you know it's variable based on how many people are there and and you know
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.640]   and it seems like it would be a a fairly fair way to do it but i guess i'm
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:46.760]   i'm probably missing something here's about the worst infographic i've ever
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:50.200]   seen from the year post apparently Justin Bieber
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:54.680]   is somehow involved in this cash rift chapels attempt to start a music streaming
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.920]   service featuring artist like Justin Bieber has run into turbulence after
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:02.840]   offered record labels just one half the price pandora is paying
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:06.600]   Spotify pays i didn't know there's 35 cents per hundred songs streamed
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:10.600]   it's the highest wow i heart radio twenty two cents
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:13.720]   huh do we know if they get more for paying more or is it just what they
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.080]   they managed to get gouged for well they you know weren't they
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:21.400]   kind of the first to do that maybe not pandora's older than that i don't know
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:25.560]   i don't know then then there's a question of ad revenue like produce
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:29.080]   how valuable is this not there's so many different revenue
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:32.120]   revenue streams you can get off of subscription service not only people
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.800]   paying to access the content but also the information that the
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.760]   publishers could get out of listenership from this
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:43.400]   from this relationship plus if you're not necessarily making these folks pay a
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.920]   lot of money for the service uh how valuable our ad impressions
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:51.080]   given how closely you can target a specific group of people
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.200]   by throwing up the right ad at the right time through the right song
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:58.520]   one one must assume that apple uh started at the lowest amount it could
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.720]   mention and then we'll go up from there it's called
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:05.720]   negotiation kids yep and of course where they're not going to start with a buck
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:09.960]   fifty that started at six cents well you know eddy
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:13.880]   q he's tough he's a good he's tough but fair
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:18.920]   our show today brought to you by squarespace.com oh i like the new squarespace

[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:54.040]   what is it they use stripe we talked about this last time
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:57.480]   so um let me find it and the best part is is
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.040]   the whole commerce solution if i go to pricing
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:05.560]   it's 24 bucks a month and they don't take a cut of your sales or anything
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:09.960]   i mean this is that's it 24 bucks a month so now you got three pricing plans
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:13.080]   at square space this is if you buy an annual plan if you don't buy an annual
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:16.120]   plan it's 30 bucks a month i'm going to tell you why you do want to buy an
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.840]   annual plan in a second but here's the three different
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:22.520]   pricing there's the standard pricing at eight bucks a month for an annual plan
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:26.200]   unlimited which is actually the one we've been touting for a long time
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.200]   unlimited pages galleries blogs unlimited bandwidth you'll never get a bill for
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:34.040]   excess bandwidth unlimited storage and contributors
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.520]   but then on top of that unlimited for 24 bucks a month to get all of that
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:43.240]   plus unlimited physical products unlimited digital products
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:47.080]   um a mobile store inventory tracking it does
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:51.960]   taxing this is actually just by itself that is huge
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.600]   because every state even in some states like california there's different
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:59.400]   taxes in every county it does all of that
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:04.360]   full tax and shipping rules by region and this was quite a thing i have to say
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.840]   that i'm huge we've been using square space for a long time and we've been
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.720]   in which we had to hire an outside consultant
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:13.160]   to tie in the e-commerce into our square space site you know it was it was quite
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:16.360]   a thing so now we're researching moving all that stuff back into that absolutely
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:19.960]   now when you buy a year plan on any of these plans you get the custom domain
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.840]   you free registration of a domain name they hook it up
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:26.360]   to your page course great support that square space is famous for that

[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:15.320]   squarespace.com there is just no better way to do this
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:18.200]   and it is stripe that they use stripe there yeah
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:21.800]   your stripes are very good uh service so they'll set you up through stripe it's
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:25.320]   all automatic um it just in fact if you want to know
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:28.920]   what what it looks like that you can see it they use a stripe API
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:32.760]   just slick i you know i'm not surprised Anthony and crew are just the best
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:38.680]   squarespace.com use MAC break three as the offer code
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:42.760]   field trips on iOS are you excited?
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:47.400]   okay uh you know what field trip is you should use this if anybody should use
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:51.560]   this Alex it's you okay because you travel a lot so it's a google it's a
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.680]   google app we've had on android for a while and what it is it's like i got a
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:58.280]   tour guide in your pocket so as you want you want by something that's of
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:01.160]   interest it can actually start speaking to you or
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:05.640]   being you but i like it when it says hey on your left
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:08.360]   that house was used for peggy soo got married
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:11.800]   you you are absolutely right i didn't i don't know about field trip and i was on
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:15.800]   a trip uh 12 years ago and we we talked about this
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:19.000]   whole thing that what you really need is a gps driven
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.040]   tour yes this does it oh my gosh okay i'm
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:27.080]   getting it it's free field trip uh be okay so the
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:31.560]   negative is if you turn it on it'll alert you all the time
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.040]   right even in petaluma there's a ton of stuff
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:37.080]   overhears where sublime played its last concert
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.640]   over there's where peggy su got married was filmed
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:43.000]   that's where you know even in petaluma so i can only imagine the places you go
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.360]   must be like crazy yeah i don't think i keep it on all
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.000]   the time but i could definitely see myself like oh i
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.280]   i have to wander through austin or whatever and i could definitely see my
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:56.360]   oh perfect for austin yeah yep and then john c de vorac wrote a
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.880]   funny column which misstated the situation a little bit john and i went
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:03.160]   down to apple last week to talk to the uh
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.080]   itunes folks who are great by the way really supportive of podcasts i want to
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:13.160]   thank them um and john unbeknownst to me was doing a little field test
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.960]   he was down there with our marketing guy glenn rubenstein
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:19.560]   he glenn had his car john had his car and lisa and i had our car
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:23.560]   and we apparently were all three using different gps devices
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.920]   and john wanted to try apple maps
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:31.400]   and unbeknownst to everyone else he said lest they race around like madman this
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:34.280]   was a battle of the systems actually i was using ways
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:37.960]   which i love he says i was misdirected i wasn't i just
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:44.120]   took a wrong turn sometimes i you must have this happen with gps
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.760]   i'm driving along it says turn left here and i go what
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.160]   yep bye so that happened once or twice but that's not
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:56.920]   ways his fault um he says he got lost for unknown reasons
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:01.720]   okay this is because this is because glenn said we're going to the falafel
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:06.040]   drive-through and i thought he said we're going to the house of falafel
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:10.120]   different place so that wasn't ways his fault
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:15.400]   glenn uh was using apple maps which he said worked really well
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:19.320]   and then john i think was using he has an android phone nexus for
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:23.160]   and he said that glenn won every time because apple maps was so dang good well
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.840]   i bet it is in uh kupertino i bet it's the best
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:35.000]   what is apple maps getting better um it's i mean it's it's getting better at the
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.880]   macro level if you're a really important place there
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:41.800]   like they just did the japan update without having to even push a new firmware
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:45.720]   wow so a lot of the big places if if you're a little house that's been in the
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:48.840]   middle of a park for the last you know six months you're probably still in that
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:51.080]   little park because they haven't gotten to you yet
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:54.040]   right they don't have the same team i mean google has thousands i don't know if
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:57.000]   it's that but they're said to have tons and tons of people on the map team
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.200]   actually going and physically verifying hospitals and emergency rooms and all
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.360]   those things and apple just doesn't have that
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:05.400]   uh corporate infrastructure yet and i would say there's not a lot of
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:08.840]   excuse for it given that they put out a map app not to have not to hire the
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:11.000]   infrastructure to do that right well if they're i think that's the
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.920]   question is they obviously realize they blew it and they've been hiring and
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:17.880]   working hard and the question is is it getting is it noticeably getting better
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:21.640]   john says yes but i mean geotines people aren't like we've spoken before about
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:24.520]   how it's hard to find engineers in silicon valley and it's hard to find good
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:28.200]   geotine members as well right but i think that i think that it's it's hard to
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:31.640]   i agree there's i'm definitely a definitely hard to find engineers to do
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:34.280]   do this sort of work but i think that the other thing we need to look at is just
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:38.360]   the verification of a lot of things and and i think that's a
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:41.320]   trainable solution in a lot of ways i mean that's that you know and i think
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.720]   that you know getting out there i think there's just a lot of groundwork that
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:47.720]   google has done over a decade uh that that apple has an apple if they're
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:50.920]   gonna really get into this game if they really want to own this um
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:53.720]   they're gonna have to put a lot of investment into catching up
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:56.760]   yeah there's there's a lot of boots on the groundwork involved in this i mean
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:59.880]   some of their competitors they have that they have the policy where they don't
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:03.480]   simply trust data to tell them there's a hospital somewhere they actually send
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:06.200]   someone out to verify the hospital is there
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.880]   not only that but they also map the location of the emergency rementering
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:13.000]   so that their software can guide you exactly where you need to go
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.760]   but that said i think that the poi database uh on apple maps has gotten
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:20.200]   so much better and we won't okay could hardly have done otherwise
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:23.720]   but but i but i i hope that the maps can shed
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:27.160]   has shed like it's a it's original stigma because they have been doing a lot of
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:30.520]   work on it uh that that those improvements are
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:33.560]   easy to encounter when you're using it as a standard navigator
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:37.800]   um as i i do every couple of weeks though i do check to see if my favorite
[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:41.480]   problem or my least favorite uh problem with it is still there
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:44.680]   i keep i keep i keep i keep being more and more direct about this
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:47.800]   this is a map of the boston public garden
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:51.320]   and it's still labeled as the public gardens uh
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:54.520]   okay this is not something that you do to somebody who lives in boston
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:57.000]   although they they do they they have correctly
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.680]   called labeled it boston common another common problem is calling it boston
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:04.760]   commons but it's like i i don't know i i don't know
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:08.440]   it's it's like that one sour note in a very very
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:12.360]   large symphony that you have to know where that note is supposed to be in
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:15.160]   or even notice it but if you do notice it it's like
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.880]   common public garden it's not the garden
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:24.280]   it's one big beautiful garden for you please fix this it's like when john
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:29.160]   every time i say daylight savings time john slaney comes running over says
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:33.160]   saving yeah this i i i i freely admit this is my
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:38.040]   version of atm machine it's like certain a million people will hear that and not
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:42.600]   even strip over but it's like it's a automatic teller machine machine you
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.200]   don't have to say machine twice
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:49.160]   ha ha ha ha now this is interesting because
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:53.560]   somebody in the chat room says every time i search for an address in alabama i
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:57.960]   get ohio um and so i tried i entered in the address
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:01.560]   and it's interesting because yes indeed i get this pop-up
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:06.520]   what says did you mean and i gave it the the street the city the state and the
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:08.760]   zip code and it says do you mean
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:13.400]   madison ohio or madison alabama
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:17.800]   but at least it gives me the pop-up but it's interesting that it doesn't even
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:20.920]   though i've given it the fully qualified address it's still confused about what
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:25.000]   that is that happens with a lot of systems i mean i i i try uh no key
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.280]   a map i try uh maps on on google android
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:31.480]   and it's no system is a hundred percent where
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:35.720]   no no system has ever freed me from the responsibility of saying
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:41.560]   no if i wanted wolf and colorado i wouldn't have said wolf and massachusetts now
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.360]   have would i it is after all a computer
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:47.880]   just before what why don't you what you got me to the city that's about 11 miles
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:51.880]   away as opposed to the one that's 1,100 miles away well we just maybe make a
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:55.720]   guess that maybe that's what i wanted right so yeah i've had all of them i got
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:58.600]   i had no key i drive me no key has here maps now that's their big
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:01.320]   thing and they're putting here everywhere so i was trying it and it
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:05.240]   literally had me drive in a circle before i continue on my route uh
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:08.520]   different points they all fail it's it's almost like a comedy of errors you just
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:11.080]   try to pick the one that is the most reliable for you
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:14.520]   boy and i actually had my first i mean i usually google maps is very uh
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:18.840]   reliable last night at 1 30 in the morning when i was going after i landed
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:23.480]   uh it turns out two highways going out of the airport of austin and uh
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:27.080]   out of the airport to austin and google couldn't figure out which one i was on
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.160]   and just kept on you know no matter what i did just
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:32.920]   finally it couldn't it was constantly telling me to turn around take
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:35.640]   rides take labs it didn't you know it couldn't quite you because they're
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:39.000]   right next to each other and that was actually one case where i
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.680]   tested apple maps and work fine is that interesting was that i 35
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:46.760]   that that the map was was that i 35 upper and lower deck is that what you're
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:50.200]   talking about oh we had this thing where i was outside
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.960]   monscony looking for a restaurant and as i got closer the pin would move around
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:57.400]   and there was a four or five of us looking at our phones using google maps and we
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:00.600]   just thought they were having fun with people at wwdc but the restaurant would
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.320]   actually move as you got closer to that's funny
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:07.720]   isn't it weird that we do you really do have to have multiple map
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:10.200]   solutions on your device no matter what device you have
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:14.360]   where there's their instances in which i i trust ways when i know where i'm going
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:17.880]   i just want to know the best route and what the live traffic is going to be
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:22.600]   because ways ways is signature quirk is that if there is a way that it can
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:28.040]   save me one quarter of a mile by adding 18 left and right turns to get me there
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:32.680]   then it will definitely do that uh we're asked the google maps and apple maps
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:35.800]   they're really great for getting me someplace where i'm not really sure if i've
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:39.320]   been there before but it's not but even though both of them try to integrate
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:42.360]   traffic they're really not good at figuring out that yeah
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:45.800]   tractor trailer just overturned and blocked off all three lanes of i 9
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:49.880]   9.5 maybe you want to not use i 95 that's why exactly
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:54.040]   in fact i'll often look up uh on three different devices and my car
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:58.520]   GPS just to see what the choices are and i will say that my go to is always
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:01.400]   google maps at this point i mean i don't i don't really i'm kind of waiting to
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.720]   hear news every once in a while i turn on apple maps as i said
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:06.840]   if something's really going wrong but but it's generally i just use
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:09.880]   i mean you know for me a lot of it's also being able to the mass transit stuff in
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:14.280]   New York and everything else was kind of a deal breaker for me yeah
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:17.480]   interesting well i think the consensus is it is getting better
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.760]   but it's a hard thing to do and nobody does it perfectly and really in some
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:23.800]   ways it's a measure of how far we've come that we even expect these
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:27.480]   things to be so accurate yeah i don't think i would even go
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:30.360]   far to say that it's not only come a long way
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:35.160]   i think it's right in the it's right in the bandwidth of expectations for a
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:39.320]   map and a navigation device uh it's not the greatest app on the
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:43.880]   market right now uh but the way that it integrates so well with
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.600]   Siri the way that it integrates with so much of the
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.520]   the other ios experience and this is parenthetically this is another thing
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:54.680]   that makes me wish that why why is it that apple is willing to allow a
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:58.760]   navigation app that it that it makes integrate well across the experience
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:01.720]   but it doesn't make those sort of apis that sort of experience available to
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.760]   third party apps uh i mean it's it's it's a it has a lot of
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:08.440]   positives in and of itself and i think it's it's it's now time we can stop
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:13.240]   saying the believe the beleaguered mapping application from
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:17.720]   good it's it's now a perfectly decent app we will stop saying it now
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:21.960]   remove the word be a leaguer i now proclaim your mapping app
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:27.880]   and the glitch hey nanny so say we all you have been unbeliggered
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:32.520]   we've removed the beleagueering uh

[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:41.640]   week how about that gentleman yay yay the first word about backup you

[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:52.120]   right what's on your hard drive just think about the kinds of things you
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:55.800]   might be losing if you don't back up financial records
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:59.160]   tax times coming i bet you got a lot of stuff right there maybe right
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:01.160]   don't want to lose that you have to start all over again

[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:08.600]   of and it's on your hard drive that's what you got to back up
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.560]   you don't need to back up your apps or your operating system
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:15.400]   you need to back up the stuff that you made that there's only one of
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:18.760]   that you can't afford to lose now backing it up to a drive next to your
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:22.040]   computers all well and good but that's not really planning for disaster
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:25.800]   back-uping backing things up is about disaster planning planning for
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:30.120]   tsunami fire flood thievery to steal everything in the house that kind of
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:33.480]   thing for that you need off-site backup that's the really the

[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:05.040]   uh... well my pick of the week is uh... as freshest of days headlines it is
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:07.240]   uh... of course uh...
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:08.440]   backing up backing up
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.440]   it is of course the pope app
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:12.360]   there is there's an app for that
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:15.640]   there is a uh... the the official of that is a little of that is a little
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:18.600]   more about creates this uh... that the it's a the
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:21.120]   the pope at your work your go-to source
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:23.520]   for all people news and information
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:27.480]   uh... it includes a life's a a live stream to any
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:30.720]   any live events are being streamed from the holy sea
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:33.960]   uh... so if there's a mass going on you'll be able to see live cam of the mass
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.080]   in progress
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:38.200]   i presume that when there's news about the new pope that will be streamed live as
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:38.960]   well
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.400]   uh... in addition to uh...
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:45.360]   uh... the the official calendar official the announcements uh... from the
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:47.160]   from the the papacy
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:48.600]   uh... it's
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:49.600]   you eat it
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.680]   else i'll say a number of things about this
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:55.360]   on the one on the one hand it's a very very well
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:59.480]   uh... designed app it looks really really cool here's a live cam
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:00.680]   uh... from
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:04.320]   for that we're seeing behind here right now wow uh... it's it's it's it's
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:05.520]   nicely designed you
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:08.320]   it's nice to be done see drill down then drill up
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.000]   uh... through whether you want to news where they want video
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.320]   uh... but whether you want alerts
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:15.160]   uh... and so
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:19.200]   it's it's kind of off it's kind of off-wishing when you know when like the one
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.360]   of the square institutions in the world
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:24.720]   actually has a really what has a better design app than your tech startup has
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:28.640]   wow but unfortunately that that that that is the that is the the problem you're
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:29.800]   facing it as a
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:33.280]   founder of a tech startup and it is actually called the pope app as simple as
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:34.080]   that wow
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:38.640]   uh... another app that's kind of similar but since more it's more event oriented
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:41.400]   is a new app that came out called conclave
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.040]   uh...
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:45.520]   where is really an expert on this and he
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:46.040]   well it is
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.440]   see it
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:51.920]   uh... i'm not even i'm not even really joking about this i love them i love the
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:52.920]   way that
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:55.960]   uh... all these mobile apps all these mobile devices are changing the way that
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:57.680]   we're plugged into news events
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:01.240]   i remember when i first started uh... following the idea ron is a vent like
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:05.000]   ten years ago where i really it was it was almost like it had some secret
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.280]   information about
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:11.000]   which uh... which alaska based sites in which mushing sites actually had blogs
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.800]   that had interesting information on them
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:16.520]   and now you can get like a news app that get that turns your phone
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:21.000]   pretty much into a television channel devoted entirely to this one news event
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.360]   this one news item
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:26.080]   so it's not as though i'm that i'm that interested in how the conclave is
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:26.920]   going but
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:30.560]   you know what if there's a simple app and that that will give me just a quick
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:33.840]   look at here's everything that's going on you need to know at this moment
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:37.440]   and you know you take out your phone and you see that okay no one said no one
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:40.560]   sent me a text and you refresh your twitter page and okay there's an
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:43.200]   interesting thing about twitter there's no links i want to follow
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.600]   then let's see what's happened with the pope right now
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:48.400]   yeah that's that's where they that's where they need seconds of your time
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.960]   and they're they're both these apps are free and they're cool and
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:54.480]   there'll be of no use to you a week from now pop up or excuse me after the i'm
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:57.840]   sorry i'm sure you want to see the the uh... the investor to the new pope but
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:01.040]   after that maybe you'll be maybe you want to put this in the back drawer
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:04.160]   uh... of of your of your ios app store but since then hey
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:07.520]   free and he can't be free it's pretty that's pretty cool i gotta say and it is
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:09.840]   such an interesting mix of medieval
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:11.040]   and modern
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:14.720]   yeah oh and so someone on to uh... it's someone on twitter was kind enough to
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:15.760]   answer
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:18.800]   uh... the question that i posed early earlier on
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.040]   uh... i'm gonna scroll up it's uh...
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:23.680]   mario santa maria appropriately enough
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:27.600]   so that they delete uh... about the the the the pontifex account they delete
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:31.760]   every tweet from the account of pontifex for the city of a cante until there is a
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:35.280]   new pope so the fact that there is so the account is still active but
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:39.360]   because the pope has left that means that his tweets are no longer uh...
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:42.400]   available while they have to delete them all and then it will be the same
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:45.200]   account that the only the new pope can tweet to the new account
[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:47.840]   but that's kind of like what you said they break the seals and everything that
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:49.280]   starts fresh start
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:53.360]   yeah it's it's it's it's kind of cool i i wish i would love to read a book on
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:57.040]   comparative uh religion that that takes it from that perspective
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:00.800]   i mean catholicism for all of its many problems
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:04.480]   at the one of the features is well look you're plugging into something that is
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:08.800]   very steeped in tradition and every time they a new technology or a new twist
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.960]   of society comes along they have to reinterpret
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:14.240]   uh... something that they basically came up with seven centuries ago to figure
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:16.320]   out how this works in a new world
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:20.240]   uh... and i i it's it's cool to see how other religions sort of have to respond
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:23.520]   to that but how they uh... how they maintain that connection with the
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:27.920]   past without being encumbered by it so and i'm just glad to see there's nothing
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.800]   prevent preventing you know the pope from having a twitter account there's nothing
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:32.880]   preventing them having uh... i_o_s_ apps
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.560]   no absolutely not
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:37.520]   and i apologize for the snoop dog in the background
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:41.520]   um well i was i was searching for drop box because they said there there was a
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:42.960]   new drop box
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:46.000]   uh... app out and i unfortunately you know i did the search
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.880]   for drop box on my phone and i accidentally
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.720]   tap drop it like it's hot
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:56.480]   so that's that's why just so you know the end of a life
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:59.760]   and then i couldn't figure out how to stop it
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:03.600]   so that's it you can't see can't stop the snoop the snoop is unstoppable
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:04.800]   can't stop the snoop
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:08.640]   he to the b_o_a_ he had to be snoop lion now not just the dog that's right
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:13.520]   i like slainzy what do you got for us um so i have two apps to go together
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:16.560]   and it may seem odd when i talk about which ones of the which ones they are
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:19.440]   but i i do i use them all so i i i get a lot of taxis and
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:23.920]   and uh i had a little trouble getting taxis at it and in d_c_ um a couple
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:26.640]   weeks ago and it was and i ended up walking like eight blocks with my
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:30.080]   laptop open this big mess and one of my friends was like i can't believe you're
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.960]   not using uber have you guys used uber love uber
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:36.720]   yeah so so uber is the one app and uber basically what you as you put all
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:39.600]   your you put all your information into the uh
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:43.680]   uh into into the app and uh you so you're your cell phone and i mean
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:45.840]   not your cell phone you're your charge card as
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:48.960]   well your charge card so it's all built in there anything yeah and then you say
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:53.600]   i want a car and and you'll see little cars you know it's not very popular
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:57.440]   in austin but in new york it is incredibly popular and
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:01.680]   d_c_ to the much to the chagrin of a lot of cab drivers
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:04.400]   um so you got up there you see these little cars going around and you say
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:06.960]   okay i need to pick up and say it'll be downstairs in five minutes and then you
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:10.320]   get that's nice black car shows up you get in it takes you away it's a little
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:12.400]   bit more expensive i think it's about 20 more
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:16.000]   um but there's a car there like you're not sitting there for half an hour
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.040]   putting your hand out uh you you walk out of the office when it's ready they
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:21.520]   they'll they'll ping you to tell you they're downstairs
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:24.800]   uh you walk down so it really feels like a car service so it's more expensive than
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:28.080]   a cab but less expensive than a typical car service and you get a picture of
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:31.440]   your driver so you know when you go out the door what he looks like
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:34.800]   this is the best space you're gonna see and he gets a picture of you
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:39.280]   yeah right and there's no exchange of uh there's no exchange of money you
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:41.840]   just like thank you and you get out the car yeah they tip you and tip him and
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:46.240]   everything yeah so everything everything is all self-contained so if you uh
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:50.960]   um if you're looking for that pain-free way of of traveling around a lot of
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.040]   these LA or New York or DC or whatever has it that's where i used it yeah
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:58.240]   it's incredible it just really saw it really makes that that experience
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:01.440]   because i've been in almost all of these cities in the rain
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:07.440]   trying to get you know hail a cab and uh you know it's very hard to look back
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.840]   once you once you start using this you can afford it
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:13.520]   you can afford it because they do also something called demand pricing
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:18.080]   so like a new year's eve the price goes higher a lot
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:21.600]   right right these are also those are some people that are in areas where
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:23.920]   there's no cabs and they're worried about their security and they can just
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:27.120]   pull out the uber out and press a button yeah car will come to them yeah
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:30.480]   yeah exactly it really it really works and it i think it's really one of those
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.440]   things that it is uh a disruptor because it makes
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:36.320]   the the relationship so much more efficient you know you know you know
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:39.440]   you're not calling somebody you're not doing it it's like totally refined now
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:42.880]   when you're in the car assuming you're by yourself otherwise it's kind of
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:47.040]   antisocial but have you seen figure by uh by
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:51.680]   propellerhead is it propellerhead uh hold on no that's the music company
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:56.880]   yeah figure so this is like i don't know how much it is but it's not very
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:02.160]   expensive and it is incredibly cool um so basically what you can do is you can
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:05.040]   you can kind of set up a little you can hear it
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:08.240]   and you can start playing and it's just it really is now what here's what i
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:11.680]   think is interesting about this this is really moving away from the
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:17.040]   um oh and i sort of Alex Lindsey does when he's in a
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:21.840]   cab that's what i do i have music play around with music it's fun it's
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:24.880]   anyway so so so this is this is like you know
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:29.280]   this is really cool this is the um uh i mini and this is really cool and it's
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:31.760]   it's the whole thing it really looks like you're working with a keyboard and
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:33.680]   the problem with that is trying to make something
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:36.960]   that really uh and we've talked a lot about this trying to make something that
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:39.440]   really looks like a physical thing work like the physical thing is very
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:41.600]   difficult and it's very hard to hit these little keys
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:45.760]   this is a cool app especially on a mini but very hard to use on a mini um
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:48.400]   where you're seeing like this is the next generation
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:53.120]   where we're not trying to um we're no longer trying to look like
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:57.360]   a piano or a synthesizer we are simply being a synthesizer
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:02.240]   um and and so it is uh uh and then you know you can
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:06.400]   um let's see here if i hit record anyway i'm like i screwed it up somewhere
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:10.000]   but um but anyway so the uh but you can change all your keys you can change
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.360]   your beat bpm uh you can add drums add pieces and it's
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:16.640]   just it's i don't i don't know what i'd use it for i don't know if it's really
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:22.240]   productivity but it is um a lot of fun so um figure is the is the app and you
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:25.440]   really do end up with stuff that that i end up with stuff that i like to listen
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:28.000]   to um i don't think i'm ever going to publish it
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.920]   but uh but it is um definitely uh you know worth checking out if you like
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:36.800]   that kind of how much is that how much is it i i i think you had it up there for
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:39.040]   a second those tend to be expensive those music apps
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:42.480]   i just i just bought it for 99 cents oh well worth it
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:45.840]   i'm getting on all my stuff yeah it wasn't it wasn't very expensive
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:48.480]   go ahead keep it ten times a price because propeller heads they do
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:52.400]   reason that's a purchase for ten dollars yeah could be expensive
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.880]   um rene rachee you're pick of the week i have to the first one i'll just do
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.240]   quickly because it's incredibly self-serving but we if we ship the uh new
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:04.800]   version of the i'more app i'more 2.0 uh the developer is nickelfish which was
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:08.880]   spearheaded by seph clifford and tami koron they rebuilt it from
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:13.600]   from scratch like x x code new project and it's it's got comments it's got
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:16.560]   landscape mode it's got videos it's got
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:20.000]   everything in it and it's the only way that i actually read my own site anymore
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.600]   just how good i find it uh so if you haven't seen it yet it's
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:26.960]   it's brand new in the app store it went out on thursday and i'd love for you to
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:30.080]   try it how important do you think it is for a site like yours to have an app
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:33.920]   um i'll people keep asking this because it's actually a really big debate and the
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:38.240]   reason we did it was twofold one is kind of self-serving one is kind of
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:42.560]   community-serving the first one is that we offer more than just web stories we
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:46.160]   try to do a lot of original content and part of that is audio and video shows
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:49.520]   kind of almost like what what twit does i mean not in the same scale but we do
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:52.480]   a few of them right and to be able to build that into the app is something
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:57.120]   that we can't do on mobile safari so you have a full web a full podcatcher in
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:59.840]   there that you can get all the audio and video shows
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:02.320]   and it's got other features too like you can favorite things so if you're in an
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:05.440]   airplane or you're in a subway uh the stories your favorite stories are
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:08.960]   always in that tab always downloaded and offline for you
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:12.240]   and eventually we'll do push notifications and and things like that and it's a
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:15.040]   free app we don't have any ads in it it's just a
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:18.400]   it's really meant to the service for our community but on the flip side the app
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:21.360]   store is becoming more and more of a search engine there are people
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:24.720]   who aren't familiar with the web or don't use the web but would never find i'm
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:29.360]   more that way and we want to make sure that um we're we're we're we're we're
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:31.920]   we want to skate to where our customers are going to be we want to make sure
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:35.280]   that we don't rely on them happens to actually coming across us but we're
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:39.040]   really everywhere on youtube or social media or the app store and they can
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:42.800]   easily find us and if we prove you know valuable or helpful to them they can
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:49.200]   enjoy what we're doing and your second app it's version 2.0 so it's the second
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:52.240]   version of that app the original version it didn't have all the features that
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:55.120]   we wanted we we tried to polish it as much as we could but we didn't have time to
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:58.880]   include everything so this this upgrade is where we actually really want it to
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:02.880]   be and then we're going to build out from this going forward
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:11.440]   oh sorry uh the my main people is the mophie juice pack air yes it is
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:16.160]   finally helium the helium on the left the helium is a light gray one the air
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:20.080]   is the dark black one and the air is so good i actually i'm not sure why they
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:23.600]   made the helium it's 20 bucks more but it is basically the same size
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.160]   the same weight it's got buttons instead of uh holes for the different
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:32.400]   it's more milliamp hours though isn't it yeah it's 100 instead of 80 percent it's
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:36.720]   not $99 instead of 79 but that big a difference yeah so i would i would
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:40.240]   almost forget that the helium exists and just completely go with the air and i've
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:44.000]   been testing it it has all the same features that you know and love from
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.720]   previous mophies including you know the charge indicator it won't sync data same
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:52.720]   as the helium the lightning connector that they're using is for power only so you
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:56.560]   can't sync to iTunes over an old-fashioned tether but if you use iCloud or
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:00.320]   Wi-Fi sync you're fine i do wish that they would provide lightning
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:04.080]   pass through because you know i plug into lightning in my car i use that to
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:07.440]   connect to my audio system i would prefer to have lightning on both ends but i
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:10.960]   understand why they don't but overall if you have an iPhone 5 and you want to
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:13.600]   get through whether it's a day at a conference or you're going away for an
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.800]   overnight trip and you don't want to bring a charger this is
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:21.360]   the the pack that i'm going to from now on yeah i think we're reviewing it on
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:25.040]   before you buy it a little later on actually
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:33.680]   this is so fun Alex it's a dickiness yeah it's like you know and you stand up
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:37.360]   with something that is cool like like you said they're like and and
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:40.960]   literally i can lose an hour
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:45.360]   i love propeller head they're amazing yeah they they do they do such great
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:49.120]   work and i think that the move away from i i said i think this is gonna that is
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:53.120]   to me that app is this kind of step away from skeu morphism that we've talked
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:56.080]   about in the past where you're ending up with a clean application that is
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:00.320]   producing the result and you're and you know like we don't need to think about
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:03.280]   what it used to look like or what it used to what what it used to be
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:06.160]   right it's digitally authentic digitally authentic
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:09.760]   then oh i like that native that's yeah that's that's a trendy term for
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:13.680]   non for the opposite of skeu morphism like metro and things like that yeah
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:18.400]   yeah so i was the reason i was looking up drop box it's not a refined iOS app it's
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:23.200]   a refined desktop app in fact if you have an updated drop box drop box 2.0 for
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:28.960]   your mac desktop now is the new drop down which will show you activity show you
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:34.800]   recently changed very interesting change so if you are a drop box user on the
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:39.280]   macotage make sure you update to the latest client
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:45.440]   it went live just minutes ago and uh really interesting uh change and how
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:50.160]   how it works thank you all for being here Alex Lindsey is at the pixel
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:55.440]   core pixel core.com if you have need of their services and i'm sure you do

[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:20.960]   going on it's like whoa what a wow how much do you get a
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:24.080]   partnership with uber so that anytime someone needs server addressing or
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:27.040]   video streaming they could just simply you know use their credit card
