[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, our weekly travel down the river,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   the wide river that is the Mac cult with us right now.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Our guides from all the way from Boston, Massachusetts, Andy and Naco.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Hello Leo. Hello Andy. How are you?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Doesn't feel like the sky is crying to you. It really feels as though the sky is crying to me.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Is it raining in Baston?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Oh, it's raining in our hearts.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Has somebody doing a football game, bro?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Oh, a little...
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Oh, right.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   A little patriot.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   It has to do with the fact that me and just about everybody in my peer group
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   seems to have not seen the last 20 minutes of this Sunday's episode of "House"
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   because Fox kept screwing with us on when the start and end time was going to be.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Now, we're not pleased that we lost the Super Bowl, but we need to know what happened to that woman at the Arctic Research Station.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Yes, they were promoting it like crazy.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Oh my God, it's hilarious. It was ridiculous how they were promoting it.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Yeah. So Andy, I'm sorry, our commiseration. Were there any Giants fans in the group here?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   No.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Good, we killed them all.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   They're gone.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I was rooting for the pets, but that was such a dramatic game.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   It was an awesome game.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   It was an awesome game.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Yes.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   And Andy...
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Say again...
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Not the best...
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Two minutes I've ever seen.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   It was very exciting.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Well, remind me of those Joe Montana two-minute drills for the Niners many years ago.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Not quite as... not quite as clockwork, but still very exciting.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And when he broke that tackle...
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   That was a...
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Oh man, that was great.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Then caught the ball on his head.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Yeah, that was a wild catch. Anyway, this isn't...
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   This isn't...
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Big Giants today. There are many, many football podcasts.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   We invite you to listen to those, but not this.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   This weekend Super Bowl.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Scott Ford is here from Padango and...
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   PhoneCrazyGirlsGoneWildShow.com.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Not exactly, but thank you.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Geeks, GirlsGoneGeek.tv and ApplePhoneShow.com.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Thank you, sir.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And Mr. Merlin Mann from 43folders.com.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Hey, Merlin.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Hello, Leo. How are you?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I was watching Andy... I'm well. Thank you.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I was watching Andy Twitter during Super Bowl.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   It was fun to watch him.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And others talk about the ads in the game.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   It felt like a little Super Bowl party.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Really? The fact of the matter is Leo Laporthe.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   These are two teams that really came into play football.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And the fact is whoever gets more points on that board
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   by the end of the game is going to walk away with any questions.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Andy...
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   But, Merlin, the question is, is Montana hurt?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Or is he just holding up for free agency?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I've got to tell you the truth, Andy.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   You've got to play this game hurt.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And if you let the other team get more points on that board,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   you're not going to win this football game.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I'm just not convinced that he came to help the ball club.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Alex...
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   He just had the contest for it, too, that I like to see.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Alex, Lindsay's also here from Podshow.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   No.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   From Pixelcore.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Unless you have an announcement to make.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   You sound like you might be like some kind of a malfunctioning AI at this point.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I think there's something going wrong with my brain.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Is this her next friend from Podcheck?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Podcheck.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Podcheck.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Pod.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I can help you with that.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Unhappy, Macknay.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Things about your order.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Okay.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Sounds like you said yes.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   That's my favorite.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Your podcast.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Your podcast is important.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   The way he says sounds like it's like, "Okay.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Sounds like you said yes."
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   It's like there's something going on.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   There's some subtext I'm missing there.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Okay.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   It sounds like you're screaming at some of these.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Let me get you an upgrade.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Okay.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Breathe deeply.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   He's got the Alex Trebek.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.240]   Is that the same guy on the Virgin America oxygen mask announcement?
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.240]   Sounds like it.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.240]   It might be.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.440]   That one's really, it's going to be really funny for a little while and then it's going
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.440]   to get really old.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.960]   The last two times I flew it, they didn't use it.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.960]   I'm wondering.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.960]   Oh, did they?
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.960]   I've gotten old.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   Scott, you've been on Virgin America recently.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   Are they still using the prerecorded safety announcement?
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.400]   I'm sorry to say I only sit in first class where the videos don't deliver that service.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.400]   So they have to actually do it.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.960]   They actually do it with the real person.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.960]   The instrels cohort for you and the out between or sleeves and the one in front of you.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.960]   Yes.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.840]   We've heard the tambourines during coach.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.040]   No, actually it's just the, let's say well seasoned flight attendant who can't be fired
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.000]   due to age discrimination rules who ends up in first class.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.200]   No, it's minstrel.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   It's minstrel.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.160]   Minstrel would not be the word I would use to describe most of them.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.640]   I'm sorry, but I can still hear the rattling of orlocks from the galley.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.720]   Could you do something about that?
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.720]   Boom, boom, boom.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.840]   I have seen the video in question.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.080]   I know which one you're talking about.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.080]   I saw it.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.320]   I think on Alex's site, didn't I?
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.320]   Or I don't remember.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.760]   Alex, I remember I saw part of it while you were playing your video.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.920]   You had done when they were showing off the planes.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.400]   Right, right, right, right.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.360]   In any event, little, little news story today.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.920]   We're going to, in just a bit, we're going to talk to a guy who just opened his brand
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.600]   new Apple II C.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.400]   Huh?
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.880]   Live the dream folks.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.600]   Saving those pennies, you can live the dream.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.920]   I think Asian chamber really works.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.320]   Dan says, oh, Janice, and just a little bit before that though.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.040]   Micra who, I mean, Yasoft, I mean, what the hell?
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.520]   Microsoft, we talked about this on Twitter, of course, to great length.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.080]   But I think that Mac people have some interest in this as well.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.200]   Microsoft's attempt to basically run over this search and advertising industry by buying
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:15.800]   Yahoo and becoming the biggest player in online mail, online search, online advertising.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.960]   Are we scared of Microsoft doing this?
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.680]   Google seems to think it's the evil empire.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.080]   Oh, okay, the yawns I hear, but let's get Dan on before it goes on too long because I
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.080]   hear him in the background.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.080]   Hey, Dan.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.080]   Hey, Leo, how are you?
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.080]   Great.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:37.720]   Let me make some noises so that those of you in the listening audience can hear Dan.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.720]   Merlin, Dan's a friend of yours.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.720]   It's me as hello, Dan.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   Are you there?
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.720]   Hey, Marlon, I'm here.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.720]   Hello, my friend.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   Hi.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.400]   And it was all over the interwebs this weekend.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.480]   Dan got a brand new 2C.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.040]   Congratulations, Dan.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.040]   Thank you, Phil.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.040]   Was the 2C plus?
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.640]   No, I had a 2C, the regular.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.160]   Oh, see, you're stuck with us five and a quarter inch floppies.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.880]   You're really going to regret that not spending that extra $75.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.440]   That might be an adequate product you've got in your hands.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.320]   You can actually buy five and a quarter inch floppies still.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.400]   You know what stuns me is that Apple was still selling this four years after they released
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   the Macintosh.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.160]   I think even further past, I think 88 was the last year they filled it.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.000]   Yeah, they had an event in '84.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.360]   I remember called Apple II Forever at the Moscone Center.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.720]   Except when it's not forever.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.720]   It's sort of forever.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.720]   Forever is four years in this case.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.400]   And the Bush presidency, it has seemed like forever, so maybe.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.240]   So a little dig there on Super Tuesday just had to stick something political in.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.720]   Now I'm going to pull it out.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.160]   Let's talk about this Apple IIC.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.160]   Where'd you get it?
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.520]   I bought it off of eBay.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.520]   And why?
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.800]   Well, I've been looking at these Apple II units for a while.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.440]   A lot of them available on eBay, but a lot of them are showing their age.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:08.800]   A lot of them have yellow discoloration from the agent in the plastic that causes them
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.480]   to turn this disgusting kind of yellow.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.240]   Yeah, all the old Apple IIs are kind of yellowed now.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.360]   Yeah, so there have been a handful of auctions that have been from, I think most of them have
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.480]   been from resellers who have been awarded these units as like sales incentives.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.360]   And presumably the resellers already have a system set up so they just stick them in
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.160]   their basement and they sit there in their original packaging.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.120]   And I've let a couple of these auctions slip through my fingers and this was the one that
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.800]   I managed to get a hold of.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.080]   So you didn't think it was a scam of some sort?
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.080]   No, no, no.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.480]   I mean, I was cautiously optimistic, I suppose.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.480]   How much did you pay for it?
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.520]   We're shipping $2,600.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.520]   What?
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.520]   $2,600?
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.520]   It was, it was me.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.520]   What?
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.320]   I, you know, this just got less, less fun.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.760]   Guys, no, no, no, but at least see like, like with Dan, he knows what he's getting into
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.800]   whereas Leo goes out and buys a 17 inch Mac like the day before it's EO-led.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.800]   So I think Dan knew what he was getting into.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.240]   Yeah, there was pretty, pretty sure that that was the...
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.880]   What do you take, take into account, uh, inflation and it's about the same, actually.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.440]   About the same as when it was...
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.120]   So are you just normally this slow in deciding what computer you want to buy?
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.120]   I have.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.800]   And you started this process what like 10, 12 years ago and it kind of came around to
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.000]   that's the one I need.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Let me think.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.720]   You know, you did great.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.720]   You did great.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:35.680]   This all came to light, of course, when many sites dig, Grubber and others showed your
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.480]   pictures of this laughing squid.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.800]   That's where I first saw it was on Scott's site.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.000]   You took on the traditional unboxing pictures.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   We haven't seen it.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.680]   I don't think they did unboxing in '88.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.680]   So this is good.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.200]   This is good.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.840]   When I first saw the headline, Apple II C unboxing pictures, I thought, oh, they must
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.400]   be from 1988.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.400]   Nope.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:02.160]   You do have a shag carpet, so it could have been.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.520]   Is this your first computer?
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.240]   The Apple II C, yes.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.840]   Those, my, my, my dad had the Apple II Plus and then the Apple II E. But this one was
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.040]   the first computer that belonged solely to me.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.040]   It sat in my room, opened it up on Christmas morning in 1986, maybe.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.040]   Wow.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.480]   And it's, do you like this computer so much?
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.160]   You bought a second one.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.160]   You don't have the old one.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.160]   No, no, no, no.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.160]   Longer.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.160]   It's a beautiful design.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.160]   I really liked the II C.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.640]   It really is gorgeous.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.640]   And yours is a yellowed.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.400]   It's been sealed and out of the sun.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   It is, yeah.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.400]   It is, it is.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.640]   In the condition that it was, the data was boxed into the factory.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.640]   I mean, you-
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.240]   I think this is one of those units that a lot of people hung on to for a really long
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.240]   time.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.240]   Around the time, I mean, because at the time it was, if memory serves, it was a good deal
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.240]   more to get a Mac.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.520]   And a lot of people like, why?
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.920]   I've got all my stuff is on this.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.320]   Like, why would I, this does everything I need, you know?
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.560]   You got the spreadsheets.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.960]   You know, you got the writing program.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.960]   It's all there.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   Yep.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.800]   Looks like Apple printed out the packing list on a Mac, though.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   I have to say.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.960]   It looks like that's definitely New York.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.760]   So you plugged it in.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.960]   Did you have to put in a floppy to boot it or?
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.960]   Oh, yes.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.120]   You don't necessarily have to, but yeah.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.080]   You don't want to boot to the ROM because there's nothing there.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.680]   So you booted the floppy.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.440]   Did you hold your breath while you did this?
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.440]   Oh, yes.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.880]   It was a grueling 20 seconds or so as I waited for it to boot up.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.040]   Remind us, what does the 2C do when it boots up?
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.040]   It doesn't go long.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.640]   No, it's a little bit of just a beat.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.440]   And then you've got this click plaque.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.320]   It just tries makes it.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.800]   And then it boots into, well, in this case, it gets pro-dossed.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.800]   Pro-dossed?
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.560]   With the floppy disks.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.440]   Do you see you have a little blinking prompt there?
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.520]   So you have chopper command, anything left over you could play?
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.640]   Yeah, I bought a couple of games off of eBay.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:07.080]   But the day that I bought it, I only had the disks that came with the computer.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.040]   I do have somewhere in my parents' basement.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.040]   It's a blue floppy disk.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.320]   It'd be very first program that I ever wrote professionally when I was, I think, 12 years
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.320]   old.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.320]   Wow.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:23.160]   I got hooked up with a software writing gig where I wrote a label printer for some company
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.960]   in the industrial park of a small town that I live in.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.760]   I love the chopper game.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.240]   Chopper-- it wasn't chopper command, great.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.240]   Chopper.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.240]   Chopper.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.240]   Chopper.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.240]   Chopper.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.240]   Chopper.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.240]   Chopper.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.240]   Chopper.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.240]   Chopper.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.240]   Chopper.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.240]   Chopper.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.520]   Chopper may still to this day be my favorite video game ever made.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.680]   And it felt so good when you brought those people and you saved them that came running.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.680]   Come on, it's a great game.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.680]   And it's green.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.680]   I can see why you paid $2,600 if you got chopper.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.680]   Oh.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.680]   But it is CRT.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.840]   Load runner, do you get anything good?
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.840]   I mean--
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.200]   I'm actually sitting tight because there's actually an application out there that will
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:09.040]   allow you to hook to your Mac and push down disk images through a serial key.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.040]   Oh.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.040]   So--
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.040]   They can have everything.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.600]   The key is to get Aztec.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:20.320]   That was like the end of my-- that was like hours and hours and hours of good Apple
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.320]   Too Fun.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.960]   Are you going to keep it set up in a place of honor in your house stand?
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.560]   It's sitting to the left of me right now on my desk.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.560]   So yeah.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.040]   I don't want to mention that there are free emulators that will emulate the Too
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.240]   Sea and all the games.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.240]   Oh, come on.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.080]   You don't think this is kind of cool?
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.080]   It's not the same.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.840]   Yeah, it's not the same.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.200]   Yeah, it's totally not the same.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.200]   This is totally bad.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.200]   I totally get this.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.640]   And I just like-- I totally just bought a 1961 Yatsi game off of eBay.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.640]   Like yeah, I could go down the wall, right?
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.640]   All right.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.640]   I want the guy with the mortar board.
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.240]   My feelings are very mixed on this one, guys, because I am a 10-year veteran of the MIT
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.400]   flea market.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:04.720]   As I speak right now, to my immediate left within reach is a diagnostic panel from like
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.440]   a 1971 mainframe burrows sorting machine, because it's got a little cool Apollo era
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.440]   switches and lights.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.680]   I've got a whole storage unit full of cool stuff that I just had to have.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.480]   But all this cool stuff I had to have, I have two C's, two C+'s, WaaS machines.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.240]   I got the black Apple II.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.960]   I got all the other Apple IIs.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:27.400]   But all this stuff, my threshold, upper threshold for this is typically like 40 to 50 bucks.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.160]   I don't know if I could pull the trigger on 27 or more.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.160]   Mints in box?
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.160]   Mints in box.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.160]   Mints in box anymore.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.680]   You've got to take it out and play with it.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.160]   It's just that-- would I rather have that or like 10 days in London having fun?
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.160]   No, no, no, come on.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.320]   Dan has spent the money already.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.920]   Let's not make you feel bad about it.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.840]   I just want to know if you're going to remodel your living room to be 1988 vintage.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.840]   So it is appropriate for this.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.840]   Oh, well I already have this.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.840]   I'm going to give you a little bit of a let you down.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.840]   Yeah, you have to only play it easy.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.840]   Hey, Dan.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.840]   You can pick up Lang Chun, pretty cheap.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.840]   20, 600.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.840]   So, yeah, because then people would go come in your house and think, wait a minute.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.920]   Oh my God, have I stepped back in time?
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.240]   And you could give them a little thrilling moment of like--
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.760]   Maybe it could be November 1st, 1988.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.520]   It could be like right before Bush got-- we'll never mind.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.920]   The first-- the first Bush.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.920]   The first.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.920]   Exactly.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.160]   It just-- you freeze the moment in time before the Bush thing started.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.640]   No, no, no, I'd visit that.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.800]   There really was a time before there were bushes and Clintons in the White House.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.000]   A time we didn't remember.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   I say, there we go.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.800]   I threw the Clinton in just for fun.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.760]   A couple times we look back on eight years of Reagan and look forward to four years of
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.240]   Reagan term number three.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.240]   Reagan and light.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.240]   Reagan and light.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.240]   I want to come back.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.640]   Guys, we're going to get email now.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.640]   You know what?
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.640]   It's funny.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.640]   We used to get a lot more.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:57.360]   I think that many of the Republicans listening now are hiding.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.640]   Anyway, we love our Republican listeners.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.640]   We do.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.640]   We do.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.640]   Thank you for listening.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.560]   So, yeah, the blimp industry would just cease to exist if it weren't for the Republicans.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.520]   Listen, I want to say that I actually think this is kind of cool.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:17.360]   Having an old computer and carrying it for it and preserving it.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.480]   I can see you doing this, actually, Scott.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.320]   Yeah, I was about to say, I can see it's kind of cool if you don't have anything but
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.320]   money to burn now.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.160]   Well, that's what I meant.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.160]   Oh, it's Scott.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.200]   I would totally do this with an SC30 with like a big ass monitor.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   I would totally do this.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.640]   Well, that's what you're looking for for your backpack, right?
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.400]   I don't know if you guys heard about this.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.240]   Anyway, no, I still content.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.800]   I want to play with this.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.320]   Guys, I'm just going to disappear for a second because Microsoft's calling about my Xbox.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.080]   So you just talk amongst yourselves.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.080]   Go ahead, Jessica.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:51.200]   Now, can we make a backpack out of the Apple Red Ring?
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.720]   I have the Red Ring a death, the three segment Red Light.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.720]   After it's late.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.720]   Look at it.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.720]   Really talking to Microsoft?
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.720]   Yeah, I think I think he is.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.720]   He should put him on.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.720]   So you feel we can get some insight.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.720]   Yeah, this would be fun.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.720]   I'd like to get some answers.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.720]   This is 1988.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.720]   Could you give him a quick question about multi-plan?
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:12.800]   I keep waiting for the one and a quarter inch floppy upgrade, but it's not coming.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.520]   Yeah, and could you ask him to freeze words functionality at word six?
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.160]   I do have an 80 column card.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.640]   I would really freeze it to do a option.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.440]   One modification on my Apple II.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.800]   Which was the one that installed like 30 extensions?
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.280]   No, I think 5.1 was really the last great word.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.280]   You're right.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.280]   I think that was...
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.280]   It was really much.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.280]   It's 1988.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.200]   You would have been on what macOS?
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.000]   That would be macOS six point, right?
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   It would have been still.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.320]   Yeah, 7 came on like 89, I think.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.840]   Maybe it was a little later than that.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.520]   It would be 90, 91, and 7 came out.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.080]   I got an Apple II.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.160]   I got the Apple, the CI, I think was my...
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.160]   Was that was one of the...
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.160]   I was on a pizza box.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.400]   That was one of the thicker ones.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.080]   Yeah, that was the thicker one.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.560]   I bought it all decked out with...
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.680]   I had 122 megabyte hard drive in it.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.640]   Why would you buy a hard drive that big?
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.640]   That's ridiculous.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.640]   Because I was doing audio production.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.360]   No, you could never fill 122 meg hard drive.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.280]   That's what everyone told me, and I did.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.560]   I filled it quickly.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.560]   I had a Jasmine backpack.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.480]   I had a 20 meg Jasmine backpack.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.040]   And it seemed ludicrous.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.880]   What would I ever put on 20 megs?
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.880]   I was looking on eBay.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.400]   There is an Apple II right now that's available for $100.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.640]   It's fully functional.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.640]   It's not new.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.640]   It's not as pretty as...
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.640]   Is that the sound of Leo slamming his head against the microphone?
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.640]   Oh, that's the sound of his talking mind.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.320]   He slammed my head against the microphone.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.560]   I know I'm not a young person, but I'm not old enough to talk about 80s nostalgia just
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.560]   yet.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.560]   We're just waiting for Leo to come back.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.560]   We're just...
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.560]   No, no, no.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.560]   So here's the thing.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.560]   When you guys mention pro-dance...
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.200]   It's gonna cost how much?
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.040]   My god, you sons of bitches!
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.280]   I can't find Andrew Yahoo! purchase and get another Xbox.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.280]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.280]   We'll fix this all in.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.840]   No, they were fine.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.440]   My head red-ring of death.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.600]   This is the power of the Twitter.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.840]   I mentioned this last week.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.840]   I twitted it.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.560]   So I'm getting special treatment.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.680]   I got a call from Jessica.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.120]   I need to get more active on Twitter.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.120]   You know what they do?
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.480]   Because this is the thing that Microsoft put aside a billion dollars to fix.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.640]   They send you a box.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.360]   You put the thing in the box and they send you...
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.080]   And then they fix it and send it back.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:23.480]   Because you don't want to piss off people who spend 18 hours a day figuring out ways
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.120]   to blow up Germans.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.360]   That's right!
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.600]   You want to keep those people happy, especially in America where you can easily convert that
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.920]   into an analog experience with just $50.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.920]   Guess what?
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.800]   There are a couple of things they might not have told you when you bought this computer,
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.280]   Dan.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.600]   What is in that document?
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.600]   You know, I have no idea.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.120]   I am not hoping to let me pull it out.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.680]   You have all the documents, which is great.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.800]   I mean, there is a certain thing.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.520]   Now I wonder if you fill out the registration card and send it in.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.440]   Do you think you could actually melt down Apple's customer service?
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:01.280]   You know, the consensus seems to be on the Flickr thread that I am obligated to send in
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.280]   the register.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.280]   I think you have to register it.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.280]   I bet you get a call.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.520]   What I am going to do is I am actually going to just photo copy that in the tricky card.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.720]   Keep the children at least 18 feet away.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.480]   Close all the doors on the room around.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.960]   Do not go back into the house.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.760]   We will be sending a hazmat.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.760]   Amen.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.400]   Thank God we finally heard from the last person who had this.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.600]   I figure I better include a cover letter.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:29.600]   I am going to pull up a copy of PFS Right and it will take my workhead to print a job.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.600]   Magic window.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.120]   Come on, you are full for not going with Magic Window.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.760]   You do have an Apple.matrix printer I hope.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:39.720]   No, but actually one of the virtual environments will let you print to PDF.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.720]   Ah, perfect.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.200]   I played around with print shop a bit last night.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.000]   Damn, what is next on your shopping list?
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.080]   Ah, software.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:56.000]   I am looking for a floppy disk case of some sort.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.080]   What Dan is not telling you is that he has one of the sexiest departments in New York.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.840]   He has been in that apartment therapy for having a sexy apartment.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.440]   Yeah, the fall colors contest.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.160]   I am very interested to see where this ends up.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.040]   So Dan, Dan, the thing is that they also dance tidy.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.560]   I have seen pictures.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.880]   His apartment does not look like mine.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.200]   I am sure this is going to end up someplace looking really cool.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.680]   No apartment looks like yours, Marlon.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.840]   But not many people have roller skaters next door.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.400]   So that is the upside.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.880]   Dan, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.200]   The pictures are online.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.280]   Dan's Flickr account is Dan Says, D-A-N-S-A-Y-S.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.960]   Do you have a blog we can plug to?
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.960]   Dan Says.com.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.080]   It is kind of a play holder right now, but eventually it will turn into something.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.280]   Now is your opportunity.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.280]   Yep.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.480]   Run, run.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.360]   Dan Says is Dan Bootiek, a web developer who lives in the East Village in his fall colors
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.360]   apartment.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.200]   My question is, can you do a blog from your Apple?
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.880]   From your Apple to E to C.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.880]   Ooh.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.560]   That would be, that would be cool.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.200]   Clear your calendar, Dan.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.200]   You have software to write.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.200]   That's a great idea.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.960]   Well, you can do it in storage.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.360]   I have a copy of the Merlin assembler if you actually want to use that for a little extra
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.360]   personalitude.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.600]   Was it really called the Merlin assembler?
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.200]   Well, that was the best one that I used.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:20.120]   I also have a copy of, I think Mr. Roots' Assembly Lines the book.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.680]   As a matter of fact, I actually have my copy within reach.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.680]   One moment please.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.680]   Nice.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.960]   He's going to read a little assembly code now for us.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.440]   A little dramatic reading, little 6502 assembler.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.640]   I can actually remember to do a little 6502 assembly.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.600]   That was actually a fairly easy processor to write for because it was...
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.600]   Yes, though.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.000]   Somebody's talking about making it 32-bit.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Again, 6502.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.720]   A good resource library.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.520]   It's also my audible pick of the week, by the way.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.520]   Assembly Lines the book.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.120]   He begins a guide to 6502 programming on the Apple II by Roger Wagner.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.280]   He reads it himself.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.920]   He reads it himself.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.920]   Line 35.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.120]   Oh, you know the...
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.280]   This section we will have.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:09.160]   You know, I got bad at assembly because when I bought my Apple II and they had the built-in
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.080]   basic, I just used GoSub routines and I needed to do...
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.400]   Yeah, I see files here.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   Spiles here.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.440]   I was thinking Apple DOS 3.3 when you guys were talking to Prodos and I realized I am
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.440]   old.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.440]   Prodos.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.440]   That was the Prodos.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.440]   He's not a new fruit.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.440]   He's not a new fruit.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.440]   He's not a new fruit.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.440]   Hey, thanks, Dan.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.440]   Thanks, Lee.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.440]   Alright, take care.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.440]   Enjoy your two-side.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.440]   I'm 2,600 bucks.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.440]   Wow.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.360]   You got to admire the guy.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.400]   I thought he was a 26 bucks.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.000]   No, it's not a box.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.360]   You knew it could be similar.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.600]   Could you go to eBay now and order something similar?
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.800]   You can get an Apple IIe for 500.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.440]   This just gave me a great idea, guys.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:51.480]   I'm going to buy one of everything at the Apple Store and put it in a garage for 20
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.480]   years.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.280]   Try to find Dan's project and see if they want to pop up.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.680]   I have a better idea, especially for all your listeners out there.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:03.200]   If you do happen to own a 5-1/4 inch floppy box, you know who's willing to pay top gear
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.200]   now.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:09.260]   I'm putting this copy of Beneath Apple Prodos in a Mylar bag with a backing for it acid
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:10.260]   free.
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:15.400]   I'm going to see if I get a gem 9.4 rating on it.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.000]   Those pages will brown if you're not careful.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Wow.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.480]   Alright, let's get to some of the news.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.640]   There's some big news.
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.080]   We were going to talk about Microsoft and Yahoo!
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.480]   But nobody seemed to nibble on that one.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:30.000]   I mean, I'm not sure how...
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.160]   I know this sounds odd to say, but I just don't know if it'll be very successful.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.160]   You know, I know that it could be.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.240]   It's one of those things that if it was very successful, obviously would cause a lot of
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.240]   damage.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.280]   But it just seems like you're matching up two companies that...
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.280]   Two losers.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.280]   It just could be...
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.640]   You have a lot of cultural stuff that would go in between.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.640]   When losers...
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.240]   When losers made, it doesn't create a beauty queen.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.600]   Okay, Microsoft...
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.280]   I would love to own stock in a company that's losing as badly as Microsoft is.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.840]   And I use and rely a lot of Yahoo!
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.840]   Losers stuff.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.360]   But both companies are struggling of late.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.360]   You can't deny that.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.120]   I really don't think it's fair at all to call either company a loser.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:13.440]   I think what we can say is that when you look at when two behemoths meet, I mean...
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:18.520]   I remember when the AOL time Warner stuff, their idea of synergy was like a 1/8 inch
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.200]   bar across the top of each page saying click here to go to CNN.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.000]   And that was the best they could come up with.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I mean, if you...
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.440]   God, if there's anything you learn in this stuff, it's the culture matters.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.040]   And when you try and slam two companies together, somebody I forget who it was.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.960]   You might have been Daniel Punkass said this.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.360]   Somebody was saying, "You know, it's like...
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.480]   If you tie two turkeys together, you don't get an eagle."
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.520]   And I think that's the case here.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.880]   I mean, they're not on their own.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.240]   I'm much more interested in this.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:46.680]   The second story, which is the idea of Google doing some kind of an infusion into Yahoo!
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:51.000]   To let them concentrate on what they're good at, let Google do the search and the ads.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And let Yahoo!
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Yahoo!
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Yahoo!
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   I think that one makes a lot more sense.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.520]   It makes me a lot happier, I'll say that.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.520]   Yahoo!
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.520]   Yahoo!
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.280]   When we talked about it on Twitter, I was one of those people said, "Oh, this is ridiculous.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.280]   Nothing to fear here."
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.840]   But as soon as Google, that shortly later that day came out with that...
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.840]   Yeah, literally.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.200]   The Chief Counsel with that kind of weird, whiny blog post.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.280]   No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.680]   That was all calculated.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.840]   Here's why.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.840]   Who...
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:25.240]   You know, as soon as Google got big and successful, it went from underdog status to all the young
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.120]   guys hate it now because they're successful and you got to hate anybody who's successful.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.120]   Now they're back to being the underdog.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.720]   It's great PR for them.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.720]   Well, exactly.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.720]   I mean, Google really is a monopoly.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.120]   I mean, there's search.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.120]   Exactly.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.520]   Now they can act like, "See, we're not the big bad wolf.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.520]   Look at them over there.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.520]   They're the big bad."
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.680]   But it looked like that blog post was calculated to kind of say to Yahoo, "Hey, come on.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.680]   And I'm sure Yahoo!
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.680]   He's talking about them."
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:55.520]   Yeah, I mean, the language in that statement was not...
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.760]   Was not, "Hey, we're looking forward to being the underdog again."
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.840]   It was regulators, investors.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.440]   Beware that we're going to be fighting this.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.040]   We're going to try to make it very, very difficult for this thing to happen.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.760]   And we're going to start with grassroots support, but also realize that we have founders who
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.520]   invest in space flight.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.400]   That's sort of money that we have access to.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.560]   And we think that we can do a good job of poisoning the soup here.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.120]   That's the other side of the coin.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.960]   Definitely they want to make it as expensive for their competitors as they can.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.760]   So they are going to defend on that level.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.000]   But I still think it's a good PR move for them.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.760]   At the end of the day, the most interesting aspect of all this is it will force Microsoft
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.400]   to do something that I don't recall them having to do in a long, dang time, which is
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.400]   to borrow money.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.800]   That's the surprising thing.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.240]   They had to go to borrow money.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.240]   Don't they have 46 billion?
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.680]   No, I actually just don't want to use it all.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.840]   Well, actually, to tell you the truth, I was surprised.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.840]   They're cash on hand.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.360]   I mean, I made a joke about it last week.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.480]   They're cash on hand isn't as great as I thought it was.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.760]   And part of the news we should report on this week is that Apple did something they don't
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.760]   usually do.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:01.160]   They assured investors with a statement from Steve Jobs since we last spoke.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.560]   And they got 18 billion.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.080]   Apple has 18 billion on cash.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.560]   And if I read the numbers right, and I haven't double checked this, but I think Microsoft's
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.120]   only at about 30.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.160]   Somebody I'm sure will correct me, but whatever the exact numbers, I don't have it in front
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.160]   of me.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.160]   But they don't have as much cash on hand as I thought they did.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.640]   And this would put them in a more vulnerable position.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:26.280]   And then Apple would be in cash-rich catbird seats.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.280]   So in that regard, it's an interesting thing.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.880]   As long as I can remember, Apple's always made sure to have a lot of cash on hand.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.400]   Yeah, they got a staggering 18 billion for the size of their company.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.400]   That's a bunch.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.400]   And that's historic.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.560]   Even when their stock was at something like 12 and 3/8, and a lot of the mainstream press
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.560]   was talking about, "Oh, well, they're going to get bought out by Sony.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.840]   They're going to get bought out by this, that, and the other."
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.360]   The fact remains that even back then, they had enough money to buy themselves out if
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.360]   they had to.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.600]   But it seemed to work too.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:58.280]   That announced it seemed to work because all the analysts this week put them on buy, and
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.200]   several people have put them at a 250.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.960]   Are you going to get back in?
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.320]   I can't for legal reasons.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.320]   I wish I could.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.880]   I wish I could.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.520]   And besides, it takes the bullets out of all my enemies' clips.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.080]   Now they can't say everything I'm saying.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.080]   That's certainly not cool.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.080]   No, I think it's good.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.080]   I think it's good.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.200]   Now they're going to have to actually think about what I said as opposed to just saying,
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.320]   "Ah, Scott said that because he was dog-holding."
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.480]   What's interesting is Microsoft.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.880]   What's interesting is Microsoft actually, so they've paid out nearly $100 billion in dividends
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.120]   in repurchasing their own stock in the past five years.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.800]   They could have done it in cash.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   This is an argument, possibly, for keeping more cash on hand to make these big purchases.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.800]   But they had specifically-
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.800]   That's right.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.440]   They bought a lot of their own stock back.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.160]   That's why they have to borrow.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:44.600]   It is about $29 to $30 billion that they have pocket cash.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.880]   That's to me the most interesting part of this whole deal.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:51.120]   I don't think it's huge for Mac users, obviously.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.840]   It might be for Yahoo or Microsoft users.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.640]   Yeah, but we're all Google users.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.920]   We're all Yahoo users to some degree.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.440]   Of course, Yahoo.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.960]   Remember, did the mail thing for iPhones?
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.440]   Push mail for iPhone, right?
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.000]   Plus, I mean, the widgets that they've got in there depend on Yahoo.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.840]   That wouldn't be a big loss.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.040]   The only thing that was, I found a little bit concerning were some rumors that started
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.400]   to spread that Apple might be in the bidding to buy Yahoo, which of course is a stupid.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.400]   Don't do that.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.000]   A stupid rumor has absolutely no foundation.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.160]   It was just speculation.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.360]   But that's the sort of thing where if analysts and other people start to think that Apple
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:31.400]   might buy something that's stupid and frivolous, it's about to say something uncharitable about
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.200]   a previous guest, but I'm not going to say that.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.720]   They might buy an Apple 2C.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.600]   Bring back the Apple 2C.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.760]   I won't pay a dime less than $800 billion for Yahoo.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.520]   All right, $900 billion.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.520]   That's my final offer.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.400]   No, I think Apple is better at sticking to its knitting.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.560]   I guess that's my question for Microsoft is what is your business?
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.560]   I mean, are you a...
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.640]   The only thing they've ever made money on is operating systems and software.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.520]   Well, the thing is that I don't know if they know what their business is, and I think
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.160]   that the dangerous thing for Microsoft is that they go into debt and they use up a lot
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:09.480]   of their cash reserves and they don't have a clear vision of which way to go.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.920]   It could be a really fascinating turn of events.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.960]   Well, it might have to come out of retirement.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.960]   No.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:24.200]   All this while Max Markichur hit a record last month or actually I guess in January, sorry,
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:30.360]   December 7.5% market share according to net applications.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.360]   That's a huge growth.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.960]   It doesn't seem like that long ago.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.280]   They were only at four.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:40.880]   Up 21% from January 2007.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.440]   And a lot of that has been in the portable arena, hasn't it?
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.800]   I mean, that's the largest.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.800]   I think that the number of...
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.800]   No, this is OS X.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.800]   Oh, I understand that.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.320]   Oh, it just always 10 in general.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.720]   This is OS X compared to Windows.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:53.720]   I got it.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:32:00.400]   So OS X market share actually up 7.31% in December 7.5% in January.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.400]   That's a 3%.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.920]   Almost 4% gain while Windows dropped 0.36%.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.920]   Linux is up even more.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.040]   Linux is up 6% although still a tiny market share.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.040]   And iPhone up 8%.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:12.840]   I don't know of what.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.320]   I guess overall market share or overall operating system market share.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:22.440]   So iPhone has 0.13%.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.400]   But I mean Windows, it less not.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.200]   Windows is still 91.46% of the market.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.640]   But this is a big jump for Apple.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:36.320]   And a lot of the people who have always poo-pooed Macintosh have pointed to that 3 or 4% market
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.960]   share saying, "See, it can't be that good, really."
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.080]   Well, now it's twice that.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.120]   Well, and I think that you also are looking at...
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.560]   Apple has a very, very successful computer business at 7.5%.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.720]   You can only imagine what happens if they follow what some analysts are saying that
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.720]   they may rebel their...
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:56.000]   Remember, they're a single manufacturer that makes...
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.280]   Windows has sold 100s, 1000s of manufacturers.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.440]   It's almost a different ball game.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:08.120]   So it didn't be interesting to follow and see if they can continue to claim market share
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.120]   if they can.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.840]   See, that's just it.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.840]   I don't want them to.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.040]   Well, you're dealing with numbers like this.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.320]   If you make it to 8 or 9, you're doing just...
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.320]   That's funny.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:23.480]   I would hate to see Apple be more than a small percent, wouldn't you?
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.480]   I mean, I just feel like...
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.520]   For me, they might be tempted to lose their Maverick image.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.120]   Yeah, and we'd be a target.
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.200]   I think more than 15% would be really.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.960]   I think at that point, we'd start really seeing the change in what we have now.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.520]   Apple's actually created a new series of switcher videos.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.280]   I mean, clearly they're paying attention to this.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.280]   Yep.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.200]   This is the how-to site that they put up?
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.280]   And it's good.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.280]   Have you seen it?
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.280]   It's a typical Apple.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.440]   It's very clean.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.000]   It's not particularly edgy or anything.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   It's just this very clean.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.480]   We show you exactly how to do this stuff.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.680]   Very methodical, very well thought out, very well organized.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.440]   Apple.com/findoutow.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.680]   All one word.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.080]   Find out how.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.080]   So is it that guy?
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.480]   Because he gives me the creeps.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.480]   [laughter]
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.080]   There's something about him.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.280]   I believe it is that guy.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.240]   If I remember correctly.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.240]   That guy.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:25.560]   That guy in the turtleneck on the white background, you know, there's something about him.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.360]   He just bugs me a little bit.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.120]   When you get a new Mac, a setup assistant helps you set up your internet connections,
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.120]   mail accounts, and basic settings.
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.120]   No, this is somebody different.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.120]   This is a younger guy.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.120]   So you get started using your Mac right away.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.280]   That sounds like almost like Justin Long practically.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.680]   So that's the anatomy of a Mac.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:41.240]   There's a two and a half minute move to Mac.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:45.520]   There's a two and a half minute windows on a Mac.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.320]   Interesting.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.440]   And it says there's a free human with every purchase.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.320]   Now that's got to cost some money.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.400]   That's right at the bottom there.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.920]   Free human with every retail store as a staff of trainers.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:57.920]   That's a good point.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.920]   You don't see that.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.440]   Microsoft doesn't do anything like that really, do they?
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.280]   He's a Cornell grad.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.280]   [laughter]
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.280]   Play that until you bought it.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.440]   Come over to your house.
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.440]   I think that's Apple.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.200]   I'm good for Apple for doing that.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.120]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.640]   That's the kind of thing that people are always asking me.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.440]   Where can I go to find out more about switching?
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:24.240]   I think they're smart to respond to that.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.280]   Apple also announces a 16 gigabyte iPhone and a 32 gigabyte I touch.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.240]   I know my source was right.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.520]   He just was three weeks late.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.520]   But no HSDPA.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.960]   In fact, no changes in the iPhone at all.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.960]   Just more memory.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:42.800]   We did have one report which I made earlier which said there were two versions.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:47.480]   One would be the point of view that we'd have two separate phones and this apparently makes
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.480]   that one to be correct.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.520]   The other one was that we'd see it all at once.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.040]   The thing that's stupefying me and I'm just begging for somebody to tell me the answer
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.600]   is why didn't we hear about this three weeks ago at Mac?
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.080]   What's the possible reason?
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.160]   It's not because it was still done from MacBook Air because he talked about other iPhone related
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.160]   stuff.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.160]   It is odd, isn't it?
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.160]   Maybe it just wasn't ready yet.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:10.720]   Well, yeah, but neither was Apple TV and he announced it.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.840]   Are you saying announce it with an upcoming?
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.920]   Yeah, why didn't he say what?
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.140]   My only thinking is maybe they were afraid it would hurt eight gig sales in the three
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.140]   week intro.
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.140]   That must be it.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:23.240]   Or maybe it was a Steve Jobs temper tantrum.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.680]   It was supposed to be ready and it wasn't.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.680]   So he said screw it.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.680]   I'm taking it out.
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.680]   Yeah, clearing out maybe the inventory.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.800]   Maybe it's something to do with the fact that you've essentially tripled the amount of
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.800]   memory that's in play.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.520]   The ram and it's possibly want to have those supplies pretty much locked down for the buying
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.520]   stuff.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.520]   But they must have been manufacturing them.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.880]   I mean, they're shipping now.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:44.600]   Yeah, but there's a whole bunch of strategic things going on to try to figure out to make
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.200]   sure what's the most opportune time to release this.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:51.600]   It's definitely going to be before applications for the iPhone and the iPod touch start rolling
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:59.320]   out because that's going to change the economy of what represents a realistic amount of memory
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.960]   for an iPhone or for an iPod touch.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:05.720]   But it might not have been a good idea to roll it out at the same time as the software
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.160]   development kit either.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.840]   So it's right between because the software development kit comes out in the next three
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.840]   weeks.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:18.200]   Yeah, I talked to Jaws this morning and there's still no updates on the SDK as far as the
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.080]   firm shipping date, but it's definitely on track to be released by the end of the month
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.080]   as they've said.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.080]   It's 32 gigs.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.760]   It must be the largest flash player in the market.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.560]   I don't there's nobody's doing anything that big.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:31.160]   Are they in flash?
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.640]   That's bigger than my hard drive iPod.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.560]   I think it's as big as it gets right now.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.320]   I wanted one immediately.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.880]   I mean, that's what I've been waiting for.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.960]   I'm thrilled about that.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.840]   How many of these Samsung made is what I want to find out?
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.360]   Yeah, although it's interesting.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:51.080]   I was trying to figure it out this morning that there is an actual sweet spot for storage
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:56.840]   on these sort of devices where anything above this amount of storage is nice, but not essential.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:02.560]   I tend to think that on an iPhone or iPod touch, eight gigs is perfectly fine.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:07.960]   Six sixteen gigs is probably the sweet spot at my I have a sixteen gig iPod touch and an
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:08.960]   eight gig iPhone.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:13.320]   I find that I almost never bumped my head on the ceiling of the iPhone and I almost always
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:18.560]   have a few gigs free on the touch because I mean iTunes does such a great job of letting
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:24.920]   me automatically turn the device into a rolling window over my hundred gigabyte media media
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:25.920]   library.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.400]   I don't need to have three weeks for the content on it.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.240]   So long as I have enough to last me until the next time I dock the device.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.320]   I'm just thinking that I'm going to put a lot of video on this thing.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.560]   Yeah, I think that's that's where the pain comes and that's it's interesting in terms
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:39.880]   of what feels like a strategy is to start providing more of that room.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.680]   It's a video player.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.040]   I really do I know I really do think this is more about applications than anything else
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.040]   because you're going to have more stuff being stored locally.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.880]   The big applications being that I'm not talking to the applications.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.960]   I'm talking about RSS readers that will download podcasts directly to the device.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.960]   I like that.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:01.000]   Talking about things that convert YouTube videos directly into playable iTunes library files
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   in the device.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.080]   I'm talking about wanting to having a halfway decent office suite mobile office suite and
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:13.680]   now wanting to carry two or three gigabytes worth of office files using the device as
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.960]   a viewer and as an editor while on the road but also using it as a storage device when
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.720]   you're connected to your iMac or to your Windows machine.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.640]   You still want that little touch computer.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.640]   That's what you want.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.360]   That's what you're saying this is turning into.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:29.680]   I think all freedom loving Americans and Americans at heart living abroad would want such a device.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:35.480]   But so many times I'm in the habit my workflow with the iPhone is so locked in at this point
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:40.120]   that whenever I file my newspaper column I automatically get it automatically get CC
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.680]   to my iPhone so that when I have my celebratory you know hey I made another deadline for another
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:48.960]   week I deserve pancakes breakfast.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:53.080]   Of course there's going to be a phone call about an hour later saying okay we had a really
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:57.120]   long discussion we're pretty sure that this word is not really a word we just wanted to
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.040]   check with you.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.120]   You can refer to it on your iPhone.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.520]   Well not just refer to it but be able to make it and sometimes I want to have to do a
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:08.960]   rewrite or an edit over the phone and as is it turns into let's just take a look let's
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.520]   write some things down on a little notepad that I've got handy and then read it over the
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:16.440]   phone just like you know just like the Kennedy assassination got covered you know you had
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.360]   to dictate things over the phone.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.440]   But it also makes sense if you're running movies and you're selling movies you want a
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.640]   large capacity portable device that people could put them.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.160]   And more is always more.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:30.280]   One question that I asked specifically was I asked Jaws the sweet spot question and he
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:35.000]   was talking about well thing is we had the 8 gig iPhone and the 4 gig iPhone and people
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.680]   just weren't interested in the lesser of two.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.480]   So now we'll find out whether or not 8 gigs is what people like or whether they will always
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.280]   just prefer having the largest capacity phone that we make.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:49.840]   You pay a premium $4.99 for the 16 gig iPhone or the 32 gig touch that's $500.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.280]   Well that's not it's not hell of a lot of premium over what you're paying for the lesser
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.280]   model.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:59.720]   What I would have thought found interesting is if they wrapped it in if they make a 32
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:03.480]   gig iPhone and make it only as part of the 3G chipset.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:06.520]   Meaning that it's not just this one storage feature that you're getting but you're getting
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.080]   it as part of a larger package.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.720]   I'm wondering if that will drive people to say you know what I don't feel as though I
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:16.840]   need these extra features but I will happily pay $150 or $200 more to have twice as much
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:20.400]   storage as I might on a 16 gig model.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:27.080]   I think that's I think that the $100 price bump is I think we're going to see the basically
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:32.080]   people who are new to the market who are just buying a new iPhone that won't be a hiccup
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.080]   to them at all.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.080]   They'll pay the extra $100.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.680]   It's 100 less than the phone originally came out of it and I bet that they'll you know
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.720]   from now on everybody will just buy this 16 gig phone.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.280]   How do you think the touch does?
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:46.040]   Is that going to be desirable at that price?
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.520]   I think it would be more desirable if they finally enable disc mode on these devices.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:51.880]   Yeah I don't understand why not.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.880]   Then you'd be great you have this big disc as well.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:00.840]   I was talking to an Apple engineer actually who had a bit of a fit.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:06.600]   He worked working on the iPod team and he was like you know those drives aren't designed
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:07.600]   to work that way.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.600]   If you can't you can't keep on using them that way they're not going to last there.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.160]   Well especially the flash ones.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.400]   They're built to playback.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.560]   They're built to playback.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:18.160]   You know audio they're not built to be used as a hard drive and instead of you keep it
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.000]   the way you read and write on those drives is completely different than the way it plays
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.800]   back that stuff and it puts a lot more stress on the drive and a lot of in a way that it
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   just not designed to handle.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:30.560]   Well now we heard that a lot on the hard drive iPods and I haven't seen that happen.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:35.440]   I talked to an engineer Tashiba because I was trying to chase down exactly that explanation
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.320]   and he said that boot from it.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.320]   Excuse me?
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:42.600]   Well he said that you don't want to use it as a swap drive but he said that using it
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:46.840]   as a standard storage device is well within its design specs.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.520]   To pull stuff off to put stuff on.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.160]   Meaning as a device to have documents on that you read from and write to.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:56.000]   Not so much as a swap.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.720]   Something that you boot off of where it's constant and boot off of with 512K of real
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.040]   memory on your iMac.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:06.200]   And running Photoshop and Office at the same time so it's always running to the drive.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:09.600]   Yeah there's a good chance that you won't be able to listen to ABBA on the way back home
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.440]   if you keep doing that to the drive.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:16.240]   But being used as a standard USB pocket drive is well within the specs for that mechanism
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.920]   is what Tashiba told me.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:23.640]   People must now be easily the largest consumer of flash memory but the 64 gig hard drive
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:28.240]   in the air and these big capacity iPhone and iPod.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.680]   I mean they must be eaten this stuff.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:36.560]   Yeah maybe I think I saw statistics that they were doing 90% of it.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.560]   Wow.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.880]   It's like what search technology is to Google is what flash memory is to Apple.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:45.920]   I mean they're the people who had just owned the entire thing.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.640]   Any other stories before we get to our picks?
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:54.400]   I think we have to just at least talk about or mention them at least briefly.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.160]   My personal disappointment at the Apple TV delay.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.840]   Oh yeah that's right.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:43:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.840]   I keep every day.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.840]   I was sort of slipped under the rug.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.480]   Yeah they said how long do they say they just said it's not going to be out.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.000]   Oh they're a couple of weeks.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   It's already a couple of weeks.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.640]   A couple of weeks is kind of like for Apple it's like the indeterminate amount of time.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:12.640]   Exactly.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:18.280]   It's like come on the whole thing is weird to me that that's all they just sort of oh
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.320]   yeah and by the way it's going to be a couple weeks late.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.760]   I'm not only it starts to feel like this to creep.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:29.360]   I feel like I really think that for me the number one thing for right now is with the
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.560]   rentals it's just moving from 24 to 48 because I was really excited about the Apple TV and
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.640]   then I missed a movie that I had rented for 24 hours.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.360]   You know that I'd started and then it didn't get to watch it and then I lost complete
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.360]   interest.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.520]   I was just like I'm past.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.480]   You do not want to be dead to Alex.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.480]   It's DTM.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.480]   DTM.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.480]   DTM.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:53.080]   Yeah so I was over I'm just waiting and now so now I was just like well eventually Apple
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.080]   is going to figure this out and I'm going to fix it so I'll just wait until they do that
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:01.800]   and then I went back back along my merry business.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:07.520]   Alright let's get to first before we get to our picks our audible commercial.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.120]   Let's call it spade is spade.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.840]   I was going to say our audible pick of the week or what.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:15.920]   No it's a commercial for audible audible.com/macbreak.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:20.080]   We do love being part of the audible family of course but we're all audible but I don't
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.840]   know if we're all but I certainly am and I know Andy is audible listeners.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.520]   I know many of you are.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:29.920]   Audible.com/macbreak is a place to go to sign up and get yourself a credit toward a book.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.960]   Lots of great books on audible.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:36.920]   I don't think as yet there are any sixty five oh two assembly language programming books
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:37.920]   but who knows.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.920]   I'm going to do a keyword search for sixty five oh two.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:41.920]   Nope.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:48.560]   Well actually I know that people at audible are listening so I'd like to audition for
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.960]   it from chapter three of assembly lines the book.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:57.320]   The status register here at last is our reputation representation of a single byte made up of
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.320]   eight bits.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.360]   In particular the byte we are looking at is the status register of the sixty five oh
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:07.320]   two consisting of the sign bit the overflow bit the break bit.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.320]   Thank you so much.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.640]   I'm so much cheaper than Liam Neeson.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.200]   I don't know why I don't get more work from audible.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.680]   You read it beautifully.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.000]   Just put that on your card.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.800]   So much cheaper than Liam Neeson.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.040]   What if I don't URL is available.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.040]   Cheek just cheaper than Liam.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.240]   You don't even have to say so much just cheaper.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.640]   It's cheaper than Liam.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:31.400]   So I don't know if we if we have a book last time you picked Scott Dune which I've I've
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.800]   downloaded now and I'm reading it it's wonderful.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:38.920]   I've also been listening to Dirk gently another excellent choice.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:44.800]   I have I have a cool one one of one of the the the the adjutant sort of book searches where
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.600]   I was looking for one book in particular from this author that they did not have this one
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:52.760]   but they did have another great one by an author by the name of Dave Gorman.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:57.440]   A lot of you listeners are probably thinking oh the guy who did are you Dave Gorman which
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.040]   is that was the book I was looking for.
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:04.360]   He followed that up with another sort of adventure book where he seems to spend a lot
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:10.720]   of his time thinking up ideas for obsessive compulsive world spanning adventures that
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:15.840]   he then after having thought of it his nature is that he now has to actually do this.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:19.080]   So the name of this book is Dave Gorman's Google WAC adventure.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.960]   Lots of you folks know what a Google WAC is.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:28.080]   If you do if you plug two and only two words into the Google search engine and it returns
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:33.160]   only one and only one page that contains those two words what you've discovered is a Google
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:37.960]   WAC and Dave Gorman well after the success of the first book he got a contract to write
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:43.080]   a novel and as a way of avoiding having to write the novel he started getting interested
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.080]   in Google WAC.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.080]   So a good time killer.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.080]   Yeah exactly.
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.400]   Well no you don't know the meaning of time killers.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.920]   I thought that I was good at like under deadline pressure finding ways to avoid doing the thing
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.840]   I'm supposed to be doing.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:59.520]   What he decided to do is he found his first Google Google WAC and he decided to email
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:03.280]   the person letting him know that hey you know that your webpage is a Google WAC and
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.480]   then he decided to travel to where this person was and meet him.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.480]   Oh my god.
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:11.680]   And then this person gave like found two more Google WAC so he decided to go meet somebody
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:12.680]   else.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:16.800]   So he decided to do try to see if he could do 10 Google WACs in a row this way meaning
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.960]   somebody whose webpage is a Google WAC then wherever they where ever they live and then
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:25.320]   getting them to generate a Google WAC and then finding meeting that person.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:30.320]   It was it's obviously there's a certain amount of obsessive compulsive disorder.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.440]   No certain amount of disorder period in this because meanwhile there's thrilling tales
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.960]   of adventure of ducking emails from his editor who wondering why are you in Tunisia right
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:38.960]   now.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:43.240]   That's you know as a freelancer I know that I don't have a good answer to the question
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.920]   of gee your thing was due three days ago what are you doing in Tunisia.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.880]   But he has an answer and it's a it's and it's a great story.
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:53.480]   Again there are there are so many ups and so many downs and you think that well at some
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:57.080]   point here he's just going to give up or he's going to reach that point where he says no
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:00.480]   this is getting just silly it was a lot of fun to do all this traveling and meet these
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.480]   people.
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.680]   But no turns out that he really is that dedicated.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:08.560]   But just like with his first book and if you if you do have a chance to find R.U.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.040]   Dave Gorman definitely search it out because I'm definitely one of my favorite books one
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.520]   of those books I went up rereading every year or two.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:19.240]   It's a celebration of random people in the world that almost everybody has a great story
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:24.520]   to tell and almost everybody is really interesting to meet very few of us have that spirit of
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:29.480]   again OCD adventure and having you know a big five figure advanced check to support
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:36.160]   yourself with to to meet just random people for the most flimsius of reasons.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:40.960]   But he tends to den a tends to celebrate humanity in every page.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:41.960]   Sounds really fun.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:46.280]   There's a little bit of Dave Gorman's Google whack adventure written by I mean read by
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.280]   Dave Gorman.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:55.240]   Now one who admires France and the French namesakes now plural of namesake a person or thing
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.280]   with the same name as another.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:01.280]   A lot of people find turning 30 a bit traumatic.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.520]   They realize how little they've achieved and decide it's time to take life a little more
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.520]   seriously.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:09.440]   Perhaps the hope is that if they take life a bit more seriously life might take them a
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.120]   bit more seriously in return.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.720]   Now I have to say that unfortunately they sometimes these samples they are lower quality
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.600]   than the actual download.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:21.400]   You can download in three different quality levels on audible depending on the device
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:25.600]   you're using and how much storage you have you can download over that's probably a 16
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.760]   kilobits file.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:30.240]   But they have full quality mp3s and that's what I usually download and listen to on my
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.240]   iPhone or my new touch.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:38.040]   Dave Gorman's Google whack adventure three hours of Google Mirth.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:43.720]   Now normally this be $17 but you can get it free just by going to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:47.920]   That's just one of 45,000 plus titles for this political season.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:52.400]   Lots of stuff from both the Republicans and the Democrats that you can read, debates and
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.520]   so forth available for free.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:59.760]   I mean audible has always been really good at this and they always have special events,
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:02.960]   special occasions and lots of interesting stuff to listen to.
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:09.400]   Fill your mind and fill your iPod audible.com/macbreak.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.400]   We do thank them for their support.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.400]   I can't well I'm going to read that.
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:13.400]   I tell you this is the problem Andy.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:17.200]   Every time I ask you for a recommendation now is another book I got to read.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.200]   There you go.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.200]   Sounds good.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.200]   I can't wait.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.200]   Who wants to start with a pick?
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.200]   Raise your hands.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.200]   Show of hands.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.200]   Anybody?
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.200]   Scott Bullharn.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.200]   Oh Alex wins.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.200]   Alex go ahead.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:33.520]   So my mind is we talked about I stat pro in the past.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:38.080]   I think Craig Severson talked about it but I don't I use that.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.960]   It's great to have a dashboard widget that does that but there is another application
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:46.000]   that I use probably more than almost any application that I you know because I'm always
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:52.160]   looking at it which is I stat in menus which is a slightly different version of this.
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:59.880]   What I stat in menus does is it you know embeds into your menu so you when you install it
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:04.520]   you have a heads up display at the top of your computer that shows you how much your
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:10.160]   CPU is being used your upload and download speeds how much your hard drives full the
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:14.920]   temperature and whether your fans are going you know all these little things that in the
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:19.480]   one that I use the most to be honest is for me when we're doing diagnostic stuff I'm always
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:23.760]   looking at CPU while I'm working to see how much my CPU I'm using but most importantly
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:27.520]   knowing what that up and down speed is you know you know that something's dragging you
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:30.680]   know something's downloading or something isn't or am I getting a good connection or
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:36.880]   I'm not and it's just it's in it's a really really great application and it is I believe
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.320]   it is free it's freeware.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:43.040]   It's not even it's not even share where it's freeware.
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.040]   Hi.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.040]   Nice.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:50.040]   And it is it is so valuable you know they have things that that'll drop down into calendars
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:54.080]   you know that'll show stuff but but the as of the thing that I use the most is making
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:59.000]   sure that I can see what's going on in my network and the flow on my network and I just
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.840]   find that extremely useful especially when I'm traveling and I'm trying to decide whether
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:05.040]   I really have a good connection or whether it's something going on in the application.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.200]   So anyway that's it I stat menus at Islayer.com.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.200]   Islayer.com.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:15.400]   Yeah I use I think it's also free I use menu meters I think I've even made it a pick before
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:22.000]   similar idea but it's especially if you have a multi-CPU system it's really useful to know
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.240]   what's going on in there.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.240]   Very useful.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:29.480]   Alright I stat I use I stat as well on the there's a dashboard application as well.
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.720]   Alright Scott born your turn.
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:36.600]   My pick unfortunately is not free a little bit north of an Alex in fact but if you're
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:40.440]   a photographer and you want to show off your pictures this is probably the coolest thing
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:45.720]   I've seen I went to Las Vegas last week for the photo marketing association trade show.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:50.920]   It's the largest photo trade show in the world with the exception of photokina and I walked
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:55.800]   around a corner and saw this beautiful digital photo frame and we've all seen them before
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.640]   they're like five by six inches and you know you put photos on there and you thumb through
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.640]   them but this one was 32 inches.
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.640]   Wow.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.640]   Wow.
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:04.640]   It is the biggest one in the world.
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.640]   That's bigger than my mother.
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:06.640]   From the Rogers.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:08.960]   Yeah it is really cool.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:14.160]   It's nice looking frame looks like any piece of frame yard it's just has a 32 inch digital
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:21.520]   display now it's a the only thing it's a little odd about is it's it's a 16 by nine.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:26.240]   So a lot of people shoot for three and so your pictures you need have to kind of think
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:31.240]   about 16 by nine or maybe creating collages to fill the 16 by nine screen.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:34.720]   I've got a lot of 16 by nine shots because you know I know a guy named Malon Slinsey
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:39.640]   who's got me thinking 16 by nine since I was eight years old but for the average person
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:43.480]   four by three is where they shoot so that's the only negative I saw but the picture quality
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:44.480]   was really good.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.600]   Now you don't look at a 32 inch frame from two inches away.
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:50.800]   You know the the that's over the fireplace stuff.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:57.000]   Yeah this is over the fireplace stuff and you know 899 bucks and what's the cool thing
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.480]   about it that I've never seen on any of these frames it actually has the ability to hook
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:01.480]   up to a printer.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:06.320]   So you can actually say hey I want to print that photo.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:10.240]   So check it out it'll be shipping within a week or two.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.160]   It's 899 from a company called Smart Parts.
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:17.520]   Well that's also could be thought of as a third of a 2C.
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:22.400]   So you go a third of a 2C or a little bit more than smart parts is the company I'm not
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.400]   familiar with them.
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:27.880]   But if you figure you're going to spend twice that for 30 inch monitor that's not a bad
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:28.880]   price.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:32.440]   Yeah and you can put two or three of these things up in your house and you know pull
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:35.760]   a bill gates like he does the art in his house changing all the time.
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.120]   It's actually large enough to to really be enjoyable.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:42.680]   Scott of the power management features on it because it seems like that really costs
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.400]   a lot of money to keep running all the time.
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:49.600]   You know they wouldn't let me get close enough to see that the one I saw was a beta.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:56.640]   The in fact the sole working prototype that they have they wouldn't let me like get into
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:57.800]   too far to it.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:03.640]   But I'm certainly hoping that it had some sort of either you know screen save shut down
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:07.120]   mode or whatever because that was one of my very first questions Andy.
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:08.280]   Awesome.
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.280]   Very cool.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:13.360]   We will report on that once there's there allegedly sending me a review unit.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:15.080]   What's the company again?
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.480]   Smart parts smart parts.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.480]   I never heard of them.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.480]   I don't know anything about them.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:20.720]   I don't know what their reliability is.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:23.040]   But I can tell you that the panel looks good.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.040]   Very good.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.040]   My own man.
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:26.920]   What do you got for us?
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:32.000]   Well I think we all agree that there are bits about spotlight that are kind of cool.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   And I think you know looking at spotlight and using it you go hmm this is kind of so
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.920]   almost where I want it to be but parts about it really vex me.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:45.240]   That's how I feel anyway.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.880]   And I actually I just discovered this this morning off the Mac Gems website.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:53.280]   Have you guys seen this it's called Huda spot?
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.280]   Huda.
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:56.680]   H-O-U-D-A-H I think it's how it's pronounced.
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:57.680]   No.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:58.680]   What does it do?
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:00.080]   Do you remember File Buddy?
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:05.280]   Favorite probably that's always my like it's my go to example when I talk about how much
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:08.480]   I used to love Mac applications and it was just this really neat application that would
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:09.720]   let you do stuff with files.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:13.240]   It was really easy to change multiple you know the thing was really cool about File
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:18.840]   Buddy is it had a really kind of tricked out nerdy search capability that was way more
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.280]   than the OS could do.
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:23.360]   Well that's the first thing that came to mind when you open up Huda spot because it basically
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:28.560]   exposes all of the stuff that you can search on using spotlight that is not apparent in
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:31.520]   the one little field in the upper right hand corner.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:36.200]   So you open this up let me pull it up here and and there's it's no this is nerdy like
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:39.880]   as soon as you open this layer you're gonna go ah File Buddy because it's very nerdy but
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:43.080]   you can go in there and using all kinds of Boolean stuff.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:47.000]   Say I want to find nothing such kind of thing in this area you know this but not that and
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.480]   so forth which is cool.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.720]   I mean that's I think that's great.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:55.480]   So like there's times when I you know straight up Pathfinder search or you know kind of string
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.040]   filtering isn't what I want.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:01.640]   I you know I know stuff is out there but you know that one little field is pretty vexing.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:05.280]   So this is great for that but what makes it even cooler is again like File Buddy you
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:09.840]   can then save that search as what they call a template.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:11.520]   And the templates that give you are actually pretty cool.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:17.080]   You can do a search of for example music going astray which searches your drive that's
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:18.720]   a template music kind of stray.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:21.880]   Yeah yeah so it pulls up any like mp3s or a half.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:23.160]   The iTunes folder.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.160]   Exactly.
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:28.000]   And so you know it's in some ways it's philosophically I think probably somewhat similar to something
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.480]   like Hazel but you know if there are times when you need to just go and really find a
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:35.920]   certain kind of file or you're really anal about keeping stuff tidy this looks like a
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:38.640]   neat app I've been playing with it for a little while but it looks cool.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:47.360]   It's a very strangely priced $24.25 and it's at I think I'm at the store here I think
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:48.360]   it's at Google dot.
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:49.360]   Who did I come?
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.360]   H-O-U-D-H-O-U-H.
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:54.520]   Yeah but it's I don't know if you're if you're a nerd you miss File Buddy I think this is
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.520]   great.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:57.840]   You know I'm really interested to see what Apple eventually does with this themselves
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:01.840]   because you have to imagine at some point they're going to expose more of that to nine geeks
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:02.840]   in spotlight.
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:03.840]   Yeah yeah.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:04.840]   But till then you got this.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:05.840]   Who in a spot?
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:07.600]   Who in a thunk it?
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:10.360]   Annie and I co your pick of the week sir.
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:14.440]   I have a pick that I'm sure has been covered before during the immense August history of
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:15.440]   this podcast.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:21.080]   But I'm using it in a totally new way it is I stop motion which has recently been upgraded
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:26.200]   to I stop motion to this was an app that's designed for doing stop mode really fun stop
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:30.640]   motion video either using your eyesight camera or using basically any source that you have.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:33.520]   I just got it from the Mac heist thing that I'm using it.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:36.760]   Exactly that's that's that's how it came to land on my hard drive as well.
[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:43.440]   I was importing all my pictures from Mac world Expo and you know on at a trade show or at
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:46.800]   an event where I'm taking the camera out I'm having a lot of fun with the camera.
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:51.160]   We're talking about hundreds and hundreds of pictures and I'm also getting in the habit
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:55.840]   of just leaving the camera on on sequential mode I just hold down the instead of trying
[00:59:55.840 --> 01:00:01.400]   to capture that on recap your personal perfect you know perfect moment.
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:05.480]   I'm just I know something cool is going to happen all this in the camera in that general
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.780]   direction hold down the shutter and I know that one of these twelve pictures will come
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:09.780]   out okay.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:16.380]   And as usual I'm you know importing the pictures and I photo and as usual I photos is you know
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:19.520]   showing me what it's what it's importing as things are coming in and I realized that
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.660]   actually this sequence of images the sort of subliminal blip vert of everything that
[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:28.000]   I found interesting in that day rolling in front of my eyes is actually sort of an interesting
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.660]   sort of thing.
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:35.940]   So I did it I after everything was was imported I selected everything in I photo didn't didn't
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:41.380]   export to 640 by 40 480 after using a couple of different apps that did not work I had
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:43.100]   I stop motion on my hard drive.
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:47.080]   I stop motion can also in point in addition to shooting things live with your camera it
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.540]   can also just import a stack of pictures and you tell it what's what do you want the frame
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:53.580]   rate to be how big do you want this to be all this sort of stuff.
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:57.900]   And you know imported into I stop motion it spit out a nice quick time and now I have
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:02.980]   a lovely movie that lasts at six frames per second like two and a half three minutes that
[01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:08.460]   collapses my entire Tuesday at the show into one video and then you can put into into
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:13.460]   iMovie do some more edits add some music and stuff like that but it really I've been
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:18.500]   doing this to a lot of the stuff that I've got on my hard drive because not only because
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.700]   you have these subliminal flashes of all the people that you met and all the things you
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:25.740]   thought were interesting and then they'll be a burst for two seconds of sequences of
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:29.860]   full motion video when you're just hitting things in sequence but then I'll go back to
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:30.860]   these blips.
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:36.100]   Again it's oddly compelling I put it up on my YouTube account and again I'm getting
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:39.340]   a lot of emails from people who are saying wow that's so cool I'm doing that myself
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:44.180]   and now instead of because people are not willing to sit through a slideshow of 40 of
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:48.540]   your pictures of your darling baby trow faz and their for their first steps but if you
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:52.660]   put them give them all 600 and they can watch them all in about 30 seconds they'll stay
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:56.580]   put for that they're willing to give you 30 seconds.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:59.260]   Excellent excellent I stop motion.
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:02.420]   I'd say my kids have my stop motion.
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:03.420]   That's great.
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:08.100]   I bought a form and my son got crazy I mean he did probably two hours of stop motion with
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.100]   it.
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.100]   He just I mean total.
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.100]   Yeah.
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.300]   I mean I came back and he did two and a half minutes and I was like how long did that
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:16.300]   take you to do because it was all cool clay and it was very complex and all these little
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:22.220]   guys running around and he's like oh about two and a half weeks you know and but it was
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:26.980]   easy it was easy enough for them I mean he was doing that when he was eight so it was
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:30.300]   easy enough for an eight year old to pick up and start to work with so it's very kind
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:34.460]   of eye-appish that you don't need to read a lot to kind of get it working.
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:39.740]   That's very very aggressive yeah and and and that's kind of nice to have another use for
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:45.500]   I can't wait to play with I kept going to find the time I guess to play with it.
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:49.260]   I stop motion how much I say we didn't pay for the full full freight I don't think it's
[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.260]   very expensive.
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:53.700]   This on the website that you can buy it for 49 bucks and up.
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.100]   So it's not it's not terribly expensive.
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:58.700]   So if you have kids this is one of those this is I think it's one of those classic apps
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:03.860]   where if you have it on the hard drive at some point in life before you before you take
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:07.500]   your eye back to the trash you will find your facade playing with it and using it and enjoying
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.500]   it.
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.180]   Like I said I went through two or three or four different apps a lot of which cost two
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:15.100]   three four hundred dollars for editing video and processing pictures and I was this close
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:19.180]   to saying okay pilgrim looks like we're looks like we're putting on the apple script gun
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:23.860]   belt and heading heading to the Sal Carrell once again to write the write a piece of software
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:27.020]   that that should exist and then hey what do you know there is a piece of software that
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:31.420]   exists for turning still images into into video so very cool.
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:37.460]   I just we did an interview in Vancouver last week with some guys that did a new movie.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:41.420]   The first I think it's the first stop action feature out of Canada it's going to be called
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:44.380]   Edison and Leo it'll be out later this year.
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:50.060]   And of course they used a lot of Python and apple script workflow stuff some high-end stuff
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:54.220]   but I asked him what should you end users get he said I stop motion is absolutely fantastic
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:57.780]   and you know they shot that movie on get this a Canon 5D.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.280]   Wow.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:02.780]   Because the Canon has that app that you can control it with so the and they and they had
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:07.260]   a and they actually had a video tap through the eye piece of the Canon 5D so the animator
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:11.740]   could see what the Canon is seeing and it's believe it or not the resolution is so high
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:16.860]   on the Canon 5D it's essentially a 4K they have to down sample it to make it a high-def
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.260]   movie.
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:23.620]   So such high resolution so it's kind of neat shot at raw and Canon 5D my pick is an old
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:28.300]   I think we've picked it before actually but it's an update a much a long awaited update
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:35.900]   to super duper the leopard version is finally here hallelujah 2.5 just came out and who was
[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:40.180]   it that was friends with the super duper folks was that you Scott or Merlin what I had dinner
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:44.620]   with Dave of a Canadian just left with Andy yeah and so you probably knew this was on
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:45.620]   its way.
[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:49.900]   As a matter of fact I knew that I had ruined Dave's weekend by spotting out a bug that
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:51.580]   I found in the beta.
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:55.700]   Well you fixed like it was like oh well it's great because we think we've got all the bugs
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.940]   lit and we can finally release it and I said you even fix the one that I found two days
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:04.060]   ago which one I mentioned it's like no I didn't know about that.
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:09.340]   So you've been using 2.5 it's designed to work with time machine so you can have a bootable
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:14.260]   backup finally along with your time machine volume what else does it what else is new
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:19.220]   in there besides the leopard compatibility time machine support anything else new or
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:21.500]   is it just that was the main.
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:28.180]   I think it's I have to say that super duper has that has that distinction of being piece
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:31.660]   of software that just sort of works and so I set it up once and then just trusted to
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:32.660]   work.
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:38.860]   Yeah chiefly they're going for compatibility chiefly they're going for making sure that
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:45.060]   super duper and time machine live makes sense as a two prong solution to making sure you
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:50.420]   never get yourself you know shiv'd in the rib cage because of data loss and yeah I mean
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:56.540]   it's it really is the one download answer to the question yes but if I have time machine
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.140]   I don't need anything else don't I.
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:01.540]   Yeah you do because you want to be able to boot your backup and that's the whole thing
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:05.420]   the hard drive internal hard drive fail you can boot your backup.
