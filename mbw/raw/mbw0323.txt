[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.840]   And we were here on Tuesday covering the announcement Apple revved every single product
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.440]   In its line except the Mac Pro and we're still waiting to hear about the Mac Pro
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.640]   Anything we could wait for a long time
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.540]   We could do a bit you know the Mac Pro held hostage day 372 I just keep going and see how long
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.440]   There is a Facebook page if you joined it you liked it yet
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.540]   We'll bring back the Mac Pro or something like that
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.440]   I've given up
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.540]   You don't think it's gonna happen
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.640]   I don't think it's gonna happen
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.540]   Well you know, wealth is not coming back
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.840]   So I did note that they did not bring Scott Forest all up on the stages
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.740]   They wouldn't be want to do to talk about iOS 6 they did release iOS stuff. They have a new iPad
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.440]   And normally but I guess we've all heard about iOS 6 so you could say credibly
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.340]   Well, there's nothing new on iOS so Scott could just sit there
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.840]   He was sitting there in the front row not next to Johnny I if I might add
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.440]   They're not they don't see I'd I currently we're learning a lot now. Yes
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.140]   This is I think that if you go to the Apple like PR site the Apple Apple dot com slash PR
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.840]   Like now if you see like the like the archival photo of like Steve Jobs and Johnny I've and the rest
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.540]   There's like this curious like gap between I've and Steve
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.240]   Yeah, just just like in the old Soviet Union likes people used to disappear from that photo of Stalin
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.140]   Well, apparently I've upset the chatroom because
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.340]   Here we are. This is a never seen us before Mac break 323 and I've neglected to introduce you all
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.140]   So in order to soothe the very anxious chatroom. There's some real nerves going on in there
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.540]   Let me introduce ladies and gentlemen Andy and not co he's got the Hayward fire department hat on apparently
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.540]   That's where he is right now. You're not at home. I can tell
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.040]   No, I am at undisclosed location
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.140]   Playplace so I decided to relocate from my studio where there are no free-floating electrons in the power grid to this place
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.740]   Right here where there are free-floating electrons in the power grid
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.500]   I somehow thought that would help with the with the transmission of this of this broadcast
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.340]   You don't have any power in your house
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.240]   None but the ones I brought with me
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.840]   The it's it's like we know the usual like the 1960s disaster plans
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.280]   It says make sure you fill up the bathtub with water fill the buckets with water
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.640]   You want to make sure before it's just like that like when you have technology
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.340]   So anything that has a battery in the house spend three days charging up
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.000]   So I've got like you UPS's that are disconnected from their desktops are just being used to like recharge my iPad recharge
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.240]   Anything it re-recharge all the other devices, which is which is weird because now that I'm relying solely on my iPad with LTE
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.340]   I've actually got better bandwidth
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:41.640]   Usually have on my home internet service. So I'm doing okay. Well, I'm thrilled that you're all right and no trees fell over
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.740]   The squirrels are
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.340]   Battened down the hatches and well, you know, it's it's weird
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.740]   There's a there's wood chucks squirrels and chipmunks
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.740]   And is I can usually count on it like about 45 minutes after the after the storm starts
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.240]   There's always a little wrapping low on the door and answer the door and they don't say anything
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.040]   But there's this expression that says we were we were worried that you might be scared because of all the storm
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.240]   We thought we'd come in and help you not be scared after pretend that oh, yes
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.260]   They're helping me, but you know make make they cocoa for them. They're there. You know, they're they're nice
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.020]   John's Parkman in our chat room had a great suggestion
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.420]   I would like to do a Kickstarter project a mophie case for your refrigerator. Oh, it's a great
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.260]   Just slide it right in it would be like the size of the refrigerator though
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.660]   Oh would be bigger because it has to go around the refrigerator
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.060]   Yeah, what's wrong with it?
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.620]   Oh boy, if they change the dock connector for that are you
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:43.220]   That's Renee Richie also here from imore.com our newest panelist on Mac break weekly welcome back
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.060]   We're in anger to see you how are things in Montreal the storm didn't get that far north
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.380]   Did it it was windy and rainy and my power usually goes out at the mirror thought of storms?
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.140]   But so far it's holding it's holding strong so hydro Quebec is pulling it through for me. Yeah, hydro Quebec. I
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:04.660]   Love hydro power. It likes wind and water turns out the water is a feature not a bug. Yeah, and that's Alex Lindsay
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.680]   Oh my god, I'm here. You're here in person in the flesh look at that. Oh my back
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.300]   So welcome back you are you you must be used to traveling. Yeah, I'm fine. You don't mind. No
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.340]   There's there certain keys to it. What's the key?
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.420]   I drink a lot of coffee on the plane and then I stay up for 14 or I stayed up for like 20 some hours straight
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.000]   And then when you get home you sleep for 20 hours
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.100]   I just you fall asleep the first day
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.540]   I'm a little woozy and then by the second day I'm fine because I'm right just the key is getting your sleep schedule back on
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.740]   Well, you guys are just you know
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:38.460]   I'm thrilled because basically I don't know what happened but your business just took off and that's why Alex is in here
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.060]   That often it's but we're crazy thrilled when we can get you. Yeah, so thank you and we had a great time
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.580]   Did you see any of our pictures? Where were you? I was in Rwanda
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.340]   No, you you're already back from Rwanda. I was I went to Rwanda and back. Where would I see those pictures?
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.900]   Go up to G plus go my G. I just put I just put a small
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:02.700]   Rupa folks. You were hiding them then yes. Yes. So yeah, go to just Alex Lindsay. I think that then should be there
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.700]   I really should probably every once in all visit Google plus. It's awesome
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.020]   Yes, it's very quiet now. It's easy to go there
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.540]   What happened
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.980]   No
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.980]   No, oh
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:24.700]   There's cat pictures still I'm glad to see as long as I've been gone that the cat pictures have not gone away
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:30.060]   Here we go. Here's some photos. So this is the digital media Academy. You're calling. Oh look at you in a time
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.500]   Look at that. I'm all formal just double click on that
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.000]   I think it'll pop up the full screen
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.340]   I can't remember how to use this so and then yeah, so that's me and that that is a Jerome and
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:46.240]   Minister of education that's great. So you're building a center in Rwanda. This is our lab to teach
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.060]   Rwandans how to use digital
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.840]   Media like 3d rendering 3d video
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.480]   you know so that's
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.440]   Outfit in the center is the is one of our teachers from
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.800]   Nairobi and then the rest of our students. It's fantastic
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.200]   And we have 20 24 students were about to add another 20 nice building. Yes, we have
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:14.840]   Nice building. So great. We're very excited to be there and obviously the Rwandan government is thrilled because this is great for the economy
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.920]   Well, they they have been extremely supportive. I mean so the the
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.000]   the
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   That's what one of the things we were really waiting for was make sure that we had the right country to work in
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   so I've been going in and out for a decade and
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.560]   In and out of Africa and I was from my house my my from my hotel. There's an iPhone panel
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.040]   Yeah, so the but the
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.000]   one of the things that the government is so focused on
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.120]   Development so they you know I actually toured up and put some more photos up from the from their actual workforce development
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.760]   But everything from from you know welding to you know to all kinds of
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:54.520]   Votec stuff as well as what we're doing. We're all part of the same organization now
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.560]   I'm surprised because I thought Rwanda. It's an Africa equatorial. I thought it'd be warm
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.720]   Apparently it's kind of cold there. Oh, it's still in its 80s. That's nothing to do with me
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.720]   That was just a funny video
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.720]   You know the really should clear the ice. Oh, that was a real
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.600]   That was a repost I was reposting that from somebody else that has nothing to do with me
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:21.560]   But it is pretty funny. Is he gonna actually jump into the with ice? I think he's gonna give it a shot. Oh, I don't he's no
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.560]   This is just one of those oh
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.560]   That has nothing to do with okay, if you're not watching a video just go to Alex
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:37.880]   He's Google+ and scroll down and the poor guy. I guess he thought he would break through the ice didn't
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.920]   Didn't happen he's cocks his hirding, but he is okay. Yeah
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.400]   Glorious board. He's he's standing up, but yeah, so that the anyway
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:52.760]   So yeah, so the government you know the big thing is is that Rwanda has a lot of their focusing
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.440]   They're fiber through the entire country and they're almost zero corruption
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.120]   They have you know and they're building really fast over half the population is under 15
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.300]   So they have a lot of education to do and so they need to build videos to
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.000]   Educate the population and so we're gonna start training
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.120]   I think we'll have up to a hundred people next year and in truth
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:15.240]   That's just the beginning because there's many nations that would love to have this guy and it's interesting because you see countries like
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.760]   Rwanda who didn't have any infrastructure kind of leapfrog
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.640]   Stages that we went through for instance in the internet and telephony and just go to the next generation
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.620]   Yeah, there's no they're not gonna finish the hard lines to every location
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:35.360]   No point max. It's all you know, it's fiber to the central locations and then and then out and the government is moving
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.040]   I mean it's you can notice the difference every six months that you know when you visit there
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.280]   And I'm gonna have to visit a lot more often, but it's it's but it's hard
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:48.920]   You know you we were I was I had dinner with the minister of education after after the launch and we were talking about how we've never
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.600]   Seen a country move as fast as Rwanda
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.680]   I mean, you know like you have a whole country moving the same direction at the same time without a lot of a lot of what we're used to here
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.840]   in the United States and
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.360]   You know his response was yet took a genocide to get that happen like
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:11.760]   Everyone's moving there they never want to go back. Right so the but it is so the so the piece
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.400]   So it is very very fast. It is a democratically elected government now or yes, and it's peaceful
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.680]   They've the it's super safe. I mean you you can you really never feel like you're in danger
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.320]   There's you know, I've walked around with my 5d and the genocide night was 94
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.400]   I mean that's a long years ago a long time ago
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.520]   You know and they you know obviously they are very vigilant
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:36.560]   As a country to make sure that they but one of the things that you know kagami has really worked on is is getting rid of the term
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.440]   You know who to or to its in really we're all Rwandan there they're they're working to develop
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.600]   You know it for everyone make that avail make the opportunities available for everyone
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160]   You know and so it is
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.160]   It's definitely
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.400]   Something they're focused on so they just today sentenced
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.120]   Victor in Gabriere to
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:04.600]   Jail after living abroad for 16 years. He was part of the genocide. I guess so that's well
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.400]   It's it's it's something that's constantly, you know, it's it never you know
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.320]   I mean it's hard to get over that even 18 years later
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.360]   It's just and what's surprising is how people can operate at all. I mean, you know that the fact that they are
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   working so hard on it and
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.120]   Producing so much is is it says a lot for the the government and for
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.640]   You know for that process and it's not done
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.760]   It will take you know a generation or two. Yeah, you know to get that sorted out
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.320]   And it's not usually I think they usually say it's two or three generations to get through a lot of that stuff
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.320]   And but but I've never seen any
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.880]   Country work as hard as as that I have met kagami someone was asking and but not in Rwanda
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.080]   I met him in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.280]   so
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.200]   I was not staying in the
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:51.480]   That's the meek-leen it's actually the meek-leen is actually tell Rwanda, but it's not called that
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.800]   It's no what you know, it's called the meek-leen and and it is about four blocks from the school
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:01.000]   So what they what they call and it you know, I said and it's I hear it's a nice hotel. I haven't
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.680]   Haven't been to it so so there was also a big storm are still is going on Becky
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.720]   He's told though. It's I guess tapering off now and a lot of things went down
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.240]   You were you were starting the list Renee Richie gizmodo or actually all of gocker was down, right?
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:20.120]   I've always down for a short amount of time square space. You just had before rebooted
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.400]   I was they kept it's interesting. They kept their servers on overnight
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:30.920]   But then they decided I guess to for maintenance reasons to reboot everything and it canceled a Google event that was scheduled
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:36.480]   Yeah, it was New York was I think that pictures of taxi caps kind of floating down the streets
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.320]   It was also a lot of pictures of things that didn't happen
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.580]   There was no apparently the shark pictures that Twitter was inundated with
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:51.240]   There were no remember that from I remember that from Irene last year. Yeah. Yeah, people love that stuff
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:59.640]   There there's a Alex Alexis madrigal on the Atlantic did a really good job of debunking a lot of the
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:05.280]   Twitter pictures and then there's also a Twitter feed or what tumblr I should say feed called Twitter
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.280]   I think it's Twitter is wrong
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.880]   That just and and this is probably one to keep around is Twitter wrong dot tumblr
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.120]   Dotcom
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:21.400]   It's a good a good tumblr to keep around because Twitter apparently posts. There's a lot of posts on Twitter
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.000]   that really for instance lots of pictures of
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.640]   Thunderstorm cells a certain kind of thunderstorm sell cells cell thunderstorm or something
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:40.240]   Supercell citation needed. Yeah, and these pictures are real, but they're not but they're actually something much less
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.680]   destructive than sandy
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:49.280]   Problem with the hurricane is it's kind of just boring. It's like it's just kind of clouds and wind these are all if you're lucky if you're lucky
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.780]   It's boring
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:57.400]   This is this is posted on Twitter as an amazing photo of sandy meeting the Statue of Liberty. Of course not. It's a super stuff supercell
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.200]   thunderstorm
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:08.220]   That's a nice nice job taking a picture from the day after tomorrow and adding the NY1 live cam
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.340]   Lower third onto it. So these are this is good
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.720]   But now this is real and some of this stuff is
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:19.720]   Devastating this is the one of the shark pictures and they still Alexis madrigal has published this at the Atlantic monthly
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.480]   And they're trying to track it down. I suppose there's no reason why you couldn't have fish
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.600]   But I think sharks and other fish would probably try to stay out of that that one's obviously fake
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.720]   You know first one look really good first one is a good fake if it's a fake it could be done
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.720]   You could fake it sure sure and that one this is close
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.160]   This is actually the first thing you find if you search for shark fin
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:46.600]   Google image search and then there was a Mac pro cited in a storm that would be unbelievable. Yeah, I'd love that, huh?
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.920]   There's another shark. I can say it's well done. Yes swimming along on the West Side Highway there
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.920]   I commend you for the creativity. Oh
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.400]   We've now
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:00.040]   Apparently sir. This has been a fake. This is a fake. I think I think you can see the transition
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.600]   So right past the house you can see how the color transitions and the size of the size of the
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:11.520]   The ripples I think that that was probably where they made the transition you could make a good living Alex Lindsay as a
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.600]   Photoshop
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.600]   fake detector
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.480]   I mean really that'd be like mythbusters except for photos. We should okay now. We're gonna do two new segments
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.040]   We're gonna do fact-checking on commercials and and then Photoshop
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.240]   Fakes I think we could this could be in this is okay. This is a good one. This is a good fake
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:36.800]   Sharks in the mall. Oh, no, that's Toronto's Union Station
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:45.640]   Okay, these are all fakes those famous Toronto sharks this one's real and that's a little scary
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.840]   There's one of the
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.000]   Water flooding the path station in New Jersey. That's real
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.240]   some pretty dramatic stuff anyway
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:00.160]   You can't believe everything you read. However, Andy you're you're on the spot and obviously it was nothing
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.120]   Had you experienced a sneeze at you'd not experienced anything like that. I'm sure
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.000]   Irina it really depends on where you are, you know
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.320]   I've been through a couple New England storms that were a lot worse than this
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.080]   Most of them were snow events. It really depends on course where you are
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:22.800]   There's a I just heard this morning at breakfast went breakfast out. I've just decided drive a while away to
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.040]   Be with friends and have some hot food
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:34.280]   Restaurant that proudly had this little like lot rebuilt after a 1994 storm that had proudly had mounted like about chest high around the restaurant
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:40.200]   This is where the flood waters were when we were destroyed in 1994 and that restaurant got destroyed in this storm, too
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   so
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:47.800]   That's why I always when one of the one of the other photos that tends to get forwarded around as a meme is
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.440]   When a picture. Oh my god, though look at all the hurricane disaster
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.880]   And there's a picture of one patio chair that's on its back on the porch
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.560]   Yeah, yeah, not everybody got off quite so lucky
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:05.480]   There are some people who are now completely wiped out with their businesses and homes, but hey funny funny photo. Yeah
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.400]   Yeah, I don't want to make light of it in any event certainly I have family members there and
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.160]   We wish everybody well
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.440]   And what's interesting is how much it did affect the internet
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:22.480]   It's how much stuff comes out of New York City and how the power being out our our good friend at dicty Bartolo
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.480]   of course lives on the
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:30.680]   The Upper West Side in New York City his boat is just a few blocks away at the boat basin there
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:37.920]   He says the worst storm I've ever seen in New York City the highest tides ever and if in some of us were watching
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.240]   his his drop cam of
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:46.960]   The of the boat and eventually went dead because power went out there
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:53.200]   But he says his his workboat did make it through the storm of course Dick himself survived and there's a great bunch of posts
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.480]   at gizwiz.biz on his blog
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.040]   That you might want to take a look at
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:06.000]   It's amazing how many people stayed on the internet even without power and even with the rain coming in and there was a tweet from the New
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.600]   York I think was a New York fire department saying please don't tweet us disaster reports
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.600]   Please call 911
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.120]   To it in fact I even saw an article how did it continue to use Twitter when the power goes out?
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.080]   It's like this has become our bread and butter, right?
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:25.400]   Well, it does change the technology has changed the way that we respond to these disasters
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:30.920]   I remember the the blizzard is 78 which for anybody above the age of 35 who grew up in England is one the large
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:37.400]   Is one of the the hallmark memories of childhood where the main like four lane highway two lane four lane highway
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.200]   That connects all of Eastern Massachusetts was covered in snow for two days
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.220]   My dad actually brought in a state trooper
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:50.520]   Whose car broke down and we had him over for lunch one of the days were snowed in it was a just a huge sense of community
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:56.760]   Everybody everybody on their sleds on route one, you know trying to get from town to town to check on relatives now
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.280]   like I said
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.280]   I've got
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:06.520]   Surrounding me right now. I've got about 23 24 hours worth of battery backed access to the internet
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.920]   And so I can still email people I can still tweet people
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.360]   I can still text find out if people are okay if I needed to I could even have done this show
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:20.560]   From my house without any power and I've got the HD camera on the iPad. I've got LTE that would work just fine
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.200]   And so maybe unfortunately maybe it's that's turned us from people who
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:31.000]   react to these natural disasters by tightening our bonds to our community who people who tend to do that by
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.160]   Hunkering down a little bit tighter inside our houses. Yeah, I agree
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:39.240]   We're gonna take a break because I know the big story the lead and I'm burying the lead
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:46.800]   We mentioned it at the top is Scott forest all out at Apple and and in the process of this a lot of reporting being done by Nick
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.040]   Builten at the New York Times Oh mallock at giga ohm
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.120]   John Gruber
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:59.120]   Fortune about what it's like inside Apple right now and some interesting revelation
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.920]   So we'll talk about that in just a little bit, but first we want to welcome back our friends at pond five
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.440]   Haven't heard from them in a while pond five is a let me make sure they're slight as up
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.920]   But yes it is before we before we go there
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:16.560]   Pond five is a great place the world's stock media marketplace if you're a media creator and
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.560]   You use stock footage stock images stock
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.560]   Illustrations music tracks or sound effects even after effects projects
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.440]   You've got to know about pond five but also if you create any of the above in fact
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:34.400]   I remember talking to the pond five guys at CES last year and they said you know what's in or maybe it was an
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.120]   A B. It was an A B
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.280]   He said what's interesting is most the people who have accounts or many of the people who have accounts of pop up both by
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.200]   Ansel because if you know if you're somebody like Alex and you know you've got a
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.080]   5d and you're shooting amazing videos
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.520]   This is a great place to go you set the price
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.480]   Especially if you're behind a lot of them a lot of times you want to put you want to post them because it offsets your costs right?
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:22:00.680]   Yeah, it could end up costing here's this week's free stock footage is kind of appropriate storm cloud time lapse
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:06.200]   Look at that so every every week they have a free it won't have the watermark on it
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.280]   They have the free download and just add it to your cart
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.640]   Pond five is kind of amazing. I mean look at the count
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.720]   I got to go back to the front page because every time I go here
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.480]   I look so they have 1.3 million video clips 11,000 new ones this week alone
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.020]   They have 8 million photos 37,000 new ones this week alone
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:31.520]   718,000 illustrations almost a thousand fresh this week 75,000 music tracks
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.900]   That's nice for if you're a podcaster or you're looking for theme music
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.480]   269,000 sound effects
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:46.080]   476 after effects projects and there's hundreds new each week in each category in some cases thousands new
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:51.120]   They are this is by the way a lot of times people are wondering where they're gonna whether you're doing a presentation or you're building a video
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:56.520]   And you want to figure out what where to find photos a lot of people mistakenly go up there and they just download whatever they find on Google
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:03.840]   Don't do and you know that's opening yourself up to a lot of trouble also finding finding ways to get images that are copyright
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:10.480]   This is what they call royalty free. Yeah, and so yeah, and so it's so and getting that royalty free means that you're in legal
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.800]   Goodstead right I'm definitely the way to go and it's a it's a good way. It's a fair way to do it because
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:20.960]   People who sell on pond five are getting the largest royalties in the business

[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:46.520]   I was gonna say I'm sure we'll have something for next month, but I'm not I don't actually know so pond five use Mac break 10
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.520]   This month only
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:54.600]   I was kind of shocked when I started seeing on the Twitter yesterday for stall out
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.800]   Scott for stall is
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.480]   One of the original next employees a good
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:08.520]   He was a very good friend of Steve Jobs jobs brought him over when Apple bought next and and acquired in a trade
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.360]   acquired Steve Jobs for a player to be named later
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.200]   and
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:18.280]   For a long time was considered the you know inside track for CEO now
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:24.320]   It turns out that might not be the case that maybe the only person who thought he was on the inside track for CEO was Scott forced all himself
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.320]   because
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.200]   Is that oh no you didn't
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.320]   appropriate I don't know
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:39.920]   People have been saying for instance. I can't remember who somebody said there there people are going out to bars and celebrating
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:45.200]   Upon receiving the news at four stalls out. That was oh Malek had that in his report. I think oh said that yeah
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:53.200]   It's interesting how fast the knives came out after the press release was very interestingly timed it came out when the stock markets were closed when the storm was hitting
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:26:00.440]   After Apple had just shipped an unprecedented amount of devices both iOS 6 and mountain lion head ship
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.780]   So Apple's cleared the deck for the year the stock won't be traded for a few days
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:09.200]   The press release comes out doesn't even thanks Scott forest all for any amount of service
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.600]   Just basically says this is the new guard. We're dividing up all design is Johnny
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:20.800]   I've all internet and services is eddy q all the new technology division is Bob Mansfield all software engineering is
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.760]   Craig Federighi
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:28.320]   And then a couple hours later the usual sources in New York Times fortune
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.440]   Started getting these reports about him being and these were seated
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.200]   I think I think we discussed this last time we owe a few for a couple of months
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:40.060]   There's been reports coming in magazines about or newspapers about forest all being hard to work with butting heads with Johnny
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.060]   I've having a lot of ambitions
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:47.560]   And then all the reports just came out and I think they all a lot of them focused on him
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:53.000]   Refusing to take responsibility for maps and refusing to sign the apology letter that Steve
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.520]   Sorry that Tim Cook eventually signed as being sort of the last straw at Apple
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:03.960]   That's kind of the interesting gossip was that that I would guess the Tim Cook has decided or you know
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.180]   It as a team the executives said look we got to do something about this maps debacle
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:16.480]   Okay, can we just put can we just put one thing out there though that rumors are you never the results of a reporter?
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.680]   Doggage with doggedly pursuing an idea and proving proving a hunch
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:25.200]   They're always the result of somebody who wanted to talk to the press and get a piece of information out there
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.880]   So it could have been just as simple as someone inside Apple knew that the writing was on the wall
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:35.800]   Had had bad dealings with this person and was eager to be the first one to you know put to make sure people knew exactly
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.920]   What was happening in us a couple weeks? It could be it could have been something else
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:43.080]   I mean unfortunately I don't I have I have sources inside Apple, but they're usually friendly sources
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.800]   They're not like news sources, so I can't really say one way or another
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:53.600]   But really every time that I hear a rumor the first question that you should ask is why did somebody decide to release this piece of
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:28:00.460]   Information and why did they choose that person to say it to that usually colors how you will interpret that how that how that information comes out?
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.640]   Thank you for saying that because that is
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.320]   But I'm gonna now gonna read the rumors
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:11.940]   And they're all a lot very a bunch of very similar rumors given to a bunch of well very usual sources
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:17.580]   I think and he's and he's point is well taken that we don't really know this is all just so good
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:23.420]   In fact, oh Malek wrote there's been a lot of talk about Scott forest all being asked to sign an apology letter for the Apple Maps tobacco
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:27.980]   He refused none of my sources according to home none of my sources were able to confirm this
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.540]   although the New York Times Nick built in
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:37.800]   And Nick Wingfield of the New York Times writing that they had heard they had heard that from multiple sources
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:43.380]   Makes sense. I mean, it's Tim Cook who signed at the CEO would normally size Steve Jobs would have signed it
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:49.220]   He has he has done something similar in the past put a open letter on the front page of Apple comm
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.320]   Although Bob Mansfield did the EP letter most recently it wasn't
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:59.600]   apologizing of course of course he but of course he didn't stay out of Apple for very long that's one of the story but that's
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:05.420]   Well in fact, he's a big he and Johnny Iver the big winners here Mansfield for the first time ever
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:12.300]   At Apple has responsibilities in every area. He's in charge of a new team called technologies
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:19.220]   Right, which according to the release covers every area of Apple including mobile as well as desktop
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:23.180]   And one of the things he's particularly CPU's internally CPU development
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.780]   Well, I think one of the things that's really important
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:33.140]   And I think encouraging about what Apple's doing is that they are cutting away what they consider deadweight and they're doubling down on what they consider talent
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:38.260]   So you're seeing that they basically let him redefine his role let him because he's someone who makes a difference in the company
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:42.740]   They took two people that they didn't think were shaking out and move them out
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.020]   It also underscores the way that Apple tends to run their business
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:52.740]   They tend to see themselves as makers of one product and that is everything that Apple makes and so now there's a more there's a more explicit
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:57.180]   Management style that says that this guy is not responsible for just one product
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:02.540]   He's responsible for one feature that we now articulate across mobile and desktops
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:09.780]   I almost think that there should be a new new name for a certain type of senior Apple executive title that is that is czar
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:17.420]   Like you are you are the user experience czar you are the manufacturing czar you are the embedded technologies are because it's not as though
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:23.620]   You're just gonna be focused on music apps. You're going to be focused on every possible place where this wonderful technology and this
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.780]   aesthetic can be applied with an Apple logo on it. It's interesting
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:31.580]   That
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:38.660]   Mansfield came back what a couple of months ago and Curtis B is asking in the chatroom. Do you think that?
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:45.460]   That was part of the conversation that Tim Cook had with Mansfield, which was a Bob just between us
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:50.740]   There's gonna be some changes. There's gonna be a reorganization and we have an expanded role for you
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.020]   Would this be enough to keep you this and two million dollars a month?
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.860]   You know, I think that I bet you the con I mean we're all making this up now
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.820]   But but I think that the conversation yeah, we are and I'm and he is your point is so well taken
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:06.500]   This is all we're beyond rumors now. We're sure we're in it. We're in it. We've we've that's what we do
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.900]   I'm just and we're moving to speculation. It's a job. This is you know
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:13.860]   So we are like we are like the view for technology. We're the view your barber wall
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:21.020]   I'm whoopi Goldberg or a little oval table. You're that we talk that old lady what's her name?
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.420]   And you're the beautiful blod Renee Richie go ahead
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:28.780]   But I think that I think that one of the things I think we're seeing in Apple is that you know
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:32.620]   a lot of this pushing is is typical if you see a family where they're heavy-handed
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:37.620]   Patriarch who ran the family for a long time made everything work and is now gone and suddenly all these
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:43.820]   Festering you know things that no one was able to say when he was around is now coming up to the surface
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:48.360]   Well, and that is certainly the case that this is now no question Tim Cook's Apple Scott
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.820]   Forstall who was absolutely in Steve
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:57.100]   You know one of Steve Jobs close friends was probably protected by Steve Jobs if it's true that he wasn't well liked it
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:02.860]   Apple didn't matter because he was Steve's guy right with Steve gone Tim Cook is clearly putting his stamp on Apple
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:10.140]   This the the cause for celebration with a lot of people is that Johnny I've has been put in charge of what they call human interface
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.500]   again across the board and
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.860]   Many people said again. We don't know that the skeuomorphic
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:20.060]   Design that I hate so much in Apple. I mean look at Game Center
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:26.140]   I mean just disgusting was a Scott Forstall and that Johnny I've you know there was one interview with Johnny
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:31.700]   in the British newspaper the telegraph where they asked him about it and he
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.860]   politely, but it was clear his
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:42.540]   He was polite and didn't criticize it, but it was clear. He wasn't thrilled with that it wasn't modern and
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:48.820]   Certainly designer, you know most modern designers agree that that is kind of we don't need to do that
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:50.820]   We don't need leather and stitching anymore
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:56.600]   There's a big debate in the design community about and a lot of stuff that's called skeomorphism isn't skeomorphism
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:02.860]   Skeomorphism is when you use a real life analog to try to make an application more accessible where something like Game Center
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:07.160]   Or find my friends is just a skin. It's just they put a leather stitch other skin
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:14.100]   Yeah, and it's not that isn't even skeomorphism. That's just generally that that's a skin. It's an art job
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.340]   And that rifts Johnny I have if you listen to his videos
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:22.580]   He's very very much about minimalism and about sort of a digital authenticity
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:26.420]   Which really isn't the vibe you get from a lot of the iOS products
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:32.660]   And I think Matt Drance from Apple insider framed it really nicely when he said that a lot of companies as they grow
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.980]   Especially as the founders are no longer with us
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:41.900]   They tend to fall into small fiefdoms and they tend to get bigger than they become manageable and this looked like a move from Tim Cook to
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:48.420]   Make Apple saying again because now you're eddy cues just in charge of all the services including Syrian maps and Johnny
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:54.080]   I was in charge of all the design including hardware and software and everyone has a very clear very instead of being
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:59.140]   Siled is no iOS guy and OS 10 software guy now everyone has their cross-company purpose
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:04.380]   Nick Donnelly who's a designer writes a blog called usability hell
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:10.660]   Actually last week October 15th published a blog post saying fire Scott forest all
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:13.420]   Because of skeuomorphism and
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:20.820]   Jobs loves chemorphism. It's not all apparently Steve liked it and he he also reports on you know
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.180]   this issue of
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:26.520]   Johnny I've and Scott forest all not getting together according to a
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.060]   Omelik
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.020]   They wouldn't even go to the same meetings together somebody who was
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:38.940]   Pitching something to Apple had to go to two different meetings because I wouldn't appear in the same room with Scott forest all again
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.680]   Pure rumor. There's a wonderful tom blog. I think this is it that
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:46.580]   highlights bad skeuomorphic design and
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:51.220]   Defending the leather design philosophy of Apple
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:55.580]   You know, it's just this is a good example, which is apples notes
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:35:00.000]   App which has a leather binder this doesn't add to the functionality
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.500]   It just takes up room on the screen
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:06.080]   I personally think people would like it better if the if the actual quality of the skeuomorphism was better
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.080]   You think it's badly done?
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:14.620]   You know the tape tape machine in the podcast ads pain make the podcast app work
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:20.480]   First then spend energy on having the reels have the right amount of tape on them
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:25.360]   Well, like for instance like that the perfect example is that is the podcast app with that little red line is
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:30.040]   Impossible to grab on to you know, it's you know, it's all these things that are you know, yeah
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:33.520]   dribble is another great place DRI BBL
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.960]   E
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:38.400]   With designers website. They have a lot of great skeuomorphic
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:44.120]   Yeah, I heart skeu here's a good example. I heart skeu morphism with actual heart
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.760]   Instead of the I don't want to be the defense keu morphism guy
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.600]   But the the school of thought forward is if you take find my friends
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:55.960]   It's a drab database app and the leather from Steve jobs is airplane couch was thought to you know
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:01.040]   Make it a little friendlier if your mom or your or your father or your you know, you're non-text savvy kid
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:06.360]   Just given Samsung ammunition to say the iPhone is designed for your folks. I think you know
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:14.320]   How are you feel about Microsoft and Windows Microsoft's clearly responding to this with Windows 8 and
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:21.400]   This Metro interface which has not only no skeu morphism. No rounded corners. No drop shadows
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:26.240]   They're just in squares no gradient and that I think this is more modern
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:34.920]   They call it and extends to applications to I mean translates really nicely when you get an app developer who really gets it and
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.680]   wants to extend this to basically any metaphor. They want to use it for me. This is a Twitter client and
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.200]   it's
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.360]   I'm like I'm liking it a lot for exactly that reason
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.360]   I mean, it's not at all there's there's nothing here that is that has a direct analog to the real world
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:56.760]   But it's just a really good context for a really good set of legos to snap together to build a user interface from I
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:03.440]   wonder if how long before new versions of game center and notes and I think that I
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:09.440]   Yeah, I honestly think that by January at the latest
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:16.080]   We're just gonna see incremental updates in which the real to real is gone in which the felt in the game center has changed
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:23.440]   Something a little different. I mean, it's I agree with you and that what's really galling is when you have an app like like the podcast app
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:29.960]   And you realize that oh god. Wow. What a beautiful what a beautiful real to real that hey look when starting to play
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.240]   Then there is more tape on the left reel than on the right wheel
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.400]   Yeah, but when it interrupts the download it never completes and there's no way to reset it
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:42.820]   On play podcast just spent a little more energy, you know
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.920]   And then you can dress it up for the listeners
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:52.080]   Podcast play the podcast then you get to go. It's like it. No, it's like Olympic skating
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.000]   There's the compulsory part of the competition and then once you nail the compulsory
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.640]   Stay anything enter the freestyle part of the competition
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:07.000]   Playing the podcast is the compulsaries, you know, and I'd love to see from our from our listeners is ideas about how the podcast app should look
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.120]   You know like they should post them well, and I agree look design is very trendy design styles change
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:17.320]   That's why you can look back at mad men and see the unique style
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.840]   That's fine
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:26.880]   But but it's I think there's general agreement that we no longer need to have
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.560]   real-world analogs
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:35.000]   Forced on us in design, especially if it takes up space if it doesn't add to the usability
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.840]   We get it we understand this is a digital medium now
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.480]   I don't need to see my desktop and
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.280]   Torn paper at the top of my notepad to know it's a notepad
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:51.200]   It's interesting though because you have like iOS is is meant from the beginning from the way they design the products to be a screen
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:58.160]   That you can fill with anything they deliberately make the device disappear as much as possible and that gives us a lot of benefits because
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:04.400]   Designers can literally make anything they want to fill that screen and we get stuff like polter refresh and we get apps that come out
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:12.080]   Like tap bot apps or apps that are very influential in design community where windows 8 or windows 7 before it windows phone 7
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.360]   Especially it's it's a much more elegant experience
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:22.000]   But it's a much more uniform experience and you're you are constrained to that what they call digitally authentic experience
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.200]   Which is great for people who are digitally native who are used to reading websites and used to all those other things
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:32.560]   But it's not so great for people who are like digital immigrants who are coming in our new to technology and like having their
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.660]   Newspaper laid out for them fake as it may be on the screen
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:38.800]   There's a good post on the verge from last month
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.200]   Hold on a second. I'll just I just want to show you this mountain lion without skeuomorphism
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.640]   This post which I put point people to on on the verge
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:53.520]   Shows you how to remove all these little design elements there there are mods for all of these so that you can just get
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.160]   Very clean simple you are
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:00.960]   I bet I bet that was like the beginning of the game for some person's career
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:08.960]   The number the number three paid app on the app store is an app that removes all this skeuomorphism on all of these apps
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:15.840]   Yeah, no more linen no more leather clearly. We're not we're not reaching a lot of people with these design elements. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead Andy
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.840]   I'm sorry. Oh no, I was just I
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:21.840]   This could this could this could lead to a distraction. So I'll make it quick
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.480]   There the the flip side of the coin what we're name was talking about though
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:29.920]   Is that when you have a blank canvas that means that there is no there's no consistency across experience
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:34.880]   And this is what I'm preparing part two of my my surface rt review
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.800]   And one of the things I'm trying to enunciate clearly
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:47.280]   Is that I like the idea that there is there are easy ways to make a multi-touch operating system where the user knows how to get at the
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:54.480]   At a menu command where the user knows how to get to the settings and app after app after app where they don't feel like they have to relearn
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:01.360]   Every single app. You look at the difference between the way that on the on the iPad two of my favorite ios apps
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:07.200]   So if I ever come up with a list of the five absolutely killer must have uh, iPad apps for me
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:13.040]   One of them would be iPhoto the other one would be keynote and they're so completely different in the way they work where iPhoto
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:20.240]   They had to really just simply say we there's no way to make a powerful photo editor without putting all these controls on the screen
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.320]   We'll just hope that it sorts out
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:29.200]   iOS iPhoto, which is exactly iOS iPhoto then there's keynote in which it's a very very minimalist blank canvas sort of app
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.960]   Where it took me a while to learn how powerful it is because so many of the features
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:38.240]   There's not a menu. There isn't a button you have to really learn how to press and hold onto things just to see what happens
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:41.280]   Uh, so they're both fantastic top drawer apps
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:46.960]   I wonder what how they would be different if there were a way if there was a design language for the developers to make
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.200]   menu structures and like under the surface commands easier to find
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.760]   So it's just it's just two sides of the same coin
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:59.840]   I would love to get a link to this but apparently johnny ives bachelor's thesis was
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.600]   Uh in in design was a phone that looked like a question mark
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:09.920]   I don't know if that's a skeuomorphism or not. I don't think it is i think it's it's
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.600]   It's
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.400]   You're a beer bong that that johnny i've designed when he was in college that must have been the most beautiful
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:22.080]   Elegant simple and functional beer bong any college they've never made i did that beer bong actually it was
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:27.920]   Announcing johnny ives taking over design at apple i think immediately
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.240]   Settle down everybody and any fears you would have about scott forestel not being there
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.960]   Yes, you just hear the word johnny ive and you're immediately calm
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.440]   He's currently the superstar is he not
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:42.160]   And bob man'sfield may be too because uh production is so good and tim cook who was
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.640]   You know before he was ceo was really responsible for production
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:53.520]   Uh, that's why you can see these apple devices in so many countries right out of the box where they're able to crank them out at such high speed
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:58.400]   Uh and to do stuff like the iphone five, which is so detailed and you know
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.440]   Perfection in design
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.000]   Now one more firing by the way
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:11.920]   Uh, the uh guy in charge would just been brought in john brow it had just been brought in for a retail in april
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:19.680]   Uh, he was the guy who announced and then had to retract the announcement that he was going to cut the number of retail employees
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:25.920]   Um, he had come from a british firm called dixons, which was kind of down market and some people it's really down market
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:31.520]   I think he really down market. They said universal reviled. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, basically like the wrong guy
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:35.440]   Um, so this is it's clear that what's going on. This is tim cook
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.080]   Uh saying, okay
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.280]   It's been a year
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.320]   This is how I want the company to be run putting his house in order
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.200]   He's putting his house in order and time will tell
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.520]   Uh, if he's made the right choices or not
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   Uh, times are a little challenging for apple and and already they've got a broad variety of skews when one of the things steve
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.920]   Jobs was famous for was, you know simplifying the product line. They've got i
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:02.160]   iPads up the wazoo. There's confusion between the ipod touch and the ipad mini
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:10.080]   Um, there's some things happening that maybe in fact some have said maybe uh, or start to show the wheels wobble a little bit
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:16.480]   Um, not talking about the question is apple fraying around the edges are they doing too many products at once and now
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.120]   Johnny ipod man's field craig federiki
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:27.120]   They all had a ton of things on their portfolios already and now they all have extra things and those people as fantastic as they are
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.880]   Are only human
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.240]   Uh, and I think john grouper noted this too that was interesting by the absence
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:37.040]   There was no mention whatsoever of phil shiller in any of these announcements or stories
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.680]   He's not uh been moved up has he?
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:45.840]   Or move there was some feeling that he's behind cook now that he's the the number two guy at apple
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.600]   And that that's why he's not involved in any of the lower down politicking
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:56.720]   Really is it is it is it a really nice coincidence that you're over the shoulder? There is pelp a team behind beta on a poster
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.920]   Specifically andi and I thought you might notice
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:09.200]   Um, I also don't know that any of these guys have much experience with cloud architectures cloud services software as a service
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.920]   These are all things apple does not do very well right now
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:16.480]   Um, and I would like to see somebody these are hardware guys for the most part, right?
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:21.040]   They're hiring cloud guys like crazy. I mean they're there. I think there was a report
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.040]   They went to a jobs fair looking for them a while ago
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:26.320]   Yeah, that that's where you find the superstars
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:32.560]   Go to the jobs fairs somebody also pointed out and I wish I could find the article and i'm sure the chat room will tell me
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.840]   I know I bookmarked it um that apple has moved
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.400]   into a new
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:42.400]   Way of shipping shipping on schedule as opposed to shipping when it's done
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:46.560]   I don't know if this is the case or not actually the reason I bring it up is to ask you guys what you think
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:50.560]   But they this article posited that the reason maps
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:56.000]   And siri under forest all were such failures is that they had to get them out at a certain time
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.640]   And that they weren't really done
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.120]   Well, I think one of the challenges
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.400]   When we look at when the iphone was released the iphone five is that while the
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.640]   We only saw revenue from the first week. I think that that was important for I mean
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.720]   I don't think apple necessarily always pays attention to that
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.880]   But I think it was important for their quarterly earnings
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:19.120]   Right, you know to have a chip, you know, and so and you know, I phone you know you have a lot of things that are all tied up in that
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.480]   um
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:28.080]   That's a significant chunk. Yeah, I mean it happened before I mean everything said it's this would never have happened under steve jobs happen multiple times
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:34.800]   Under steve jobs mobile me wasn't ready the ipad the iphone two so the iphone 3g plus app store plus mobile
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:42.000]   Me was far too scheduled a shipping date and you can go through example after example of things that apple put out probably when they shouldn't have
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.400]   So I mean it's maybe true that that tim cook is a logistics guy an execution guy
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:51.840]   And he does make schedules for things where steve jobs was more of a passion is sort of gut-feeling guy
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:57.280]   But in an entire executive team that stuff mostly gets smooth out and rounded out before a product hits
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.080]   Yeah, yeah
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.520]   Also maps and siri have a common denominator between between the two of them
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.240]   There are both apps that were never going to be complete until millions of people started using them
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.560]   At some point they were just going to have to swallow that that tablespoon of cough syrup
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:15.760]   Uh grimace for harlot's gonna take to grimace and just you know stick it through until they get it actually right
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:20.800]   There's there's was what's the old saying that there's no such thing as final release candidate
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:26.960]   There's just the wider beta test when you finally release a product and that's syrian maps of the sort of things where they're gonna stink
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.360]   The first two or three months no matter what
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:34.400]   Here's a problem with that is that is that with maps uh, I you know, I knew some beta testers
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:40.240]   I wasn't beta testing but I knew some that will remain nameless who all when they when they saw that it was about to be released was like
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.200]   Well, hopefully people won't beat up on maps too much
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:49.280]   I mean it was clear that they knew that there were problems with it when they released that's got have done better had he not said
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:58.320]   When introducing maps, this is the best map app ever and if he had said this is beta and well after saying that what would what really would have helped
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:02.560]   Is for him to sign the apology. I mean, I can tell you right now as a ceo of a company
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:06.320]   If I told someone after it was their product that screwed up that they should sign an apology and they said no
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:10.480]   He's gone. They'd be gone. Well, we again. We don't know that that's what happened
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:17.440]   That's just a rumor, but you're absolutely right. That's that's kind of impolitic like I would just be like, okay, you're you're fired. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:22.240]   Yeah, you're gonna make me take the fall. Yeah, I will but that's your last act and
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:26.240]   Let's not feel too bad for scott forestall. I mean this guy has been at apple since
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:31.520]   the mid late 90s. Um, he has probably enough stock to never have to work again
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.520]   And if he decides if he decides to work for google or microsoft
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:40.240]   They will hire him with a pepsi salary immediately, which is why apple's gonna keep him as a consultant for
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:48.560]   The undisclosed future by the way, it was home. It was an ome Alex analysis that he he was the one who said this moving to this schedule was
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:49.520]   gonna be
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:55.440]   A problem long term. He says from a long term point of view. Oh, and i'm i'm not sure
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:00.720]   I'm not sure if I they're they're apples now big enough in pocket of there too many eyes on it
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:05.760]   That now they would be a huge huge deal if they did not come out with a new iphone at least once a year
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:10.640]   They can move it around the schedule if they want to but they have to come out with a new iphone every year
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.520]   That's called what's really a business. There's nothing right exactly
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:19.120]   But I mean I think what's really gonna be biting them in the butt is that a lot of the language that's been coming out from these
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.440]   media events has been
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:29.760]   For lack of a better word needlessly superlative where the mini the ipad mini looks like looks like a fantastic humility guys
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:33.600]   Nobody no, well, let me let me let me let me get to where I want to say yeah
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:40.160]   It's it's it's a beautiful device. You know, it's gonna be extremely well designed. It's gonna run ios ipad software
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.920]   So you know, it's gonna be fantastic
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:49.200]   When you then decide to keep running with it and start saying about how the nexus seven is terrible because it has a plastic back
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:56.640]   That hey, look if you even if you factor in only the amount of screen and a web browser that has web browser content why it's
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.600]   400% larger screen than the nexus seven
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:05.440]   It's some it's apple makes superlative products that largely can speak for themselves
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:11.120]   And I think that where they get into trouble where they've gotten to trouble in the past is by saying as you referred to earlier
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.480]   This is the we think it's the best map software ever made
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.880]   At which point have not not just like, you know, uh, wiry tech journalists
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:24.960]   I'm talking about everybody just arches and eyebrows saying it's really the best map software ever
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:29.120]   It's it's like saying that this this this this new kind of dishes
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:34.080]   Indestructible it is impossible to break this or this this ship will never sink
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:41.920]   Exactly next step. Let's see if we can break it right and I do think that I kind of even I will watch a lot of these events and kind of roll
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:47.200]   My eyes when you hear the best uh in all the superlatives. I mean you you really I do think that apple could
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:53.440]   You know tone that down a little bit as they start to release these because there's a lot of great stuff coming out right now
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.360]   And I think that and they produce a lot of great things
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.360]   I think that I I definitely think that
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:02.880]   Leading with the the product is something that's easy for them to do and there's not a not a real reason for them
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.120]   I guess it's also trying to maintain the
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:11.760]   Uh, uh, you know the distortion field, which I think steve was able to maintain, but I don't think it necessarily works for everybody else
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.480]   Take it does take a take a certain skill. Yeah
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:18.320]   Of a swagger. Yeah, certain powerful personality. Yeah
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.280]   Uh, all right. Go ahead
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.680]   Maybe it was the turtleneck

[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:50.640]   but

[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:47.680]   It's not a purse. It's a european carry-all. I think you need a hat yet
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:52.160]   Speaking of and we have a title speaking of mini pads
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:55.840]   What do you what do you guys think?
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:59.680]   A week afterwards. I presume we have all ordered them
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.240]   I'm still behind. I was in an
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:07.360]   I was like Alex on a plane. I was shoveling coffee down every 30 minutes to stay awake long enough to get to the pre-orders at 3am
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:10.800]   Eastern time. I did that and did you yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was on another
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:16.400]   comment. That's my excuse. Do you know what I'll have one Friday? No, we're gonna get like fine. You can come over Friday. Okay. I'll check

[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:22.720]   Should we do it? Should we get banned?
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:26.080]   Once again, we don't want to really stream on youtube anyway
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.080]   I
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:32.160]   Love it that Conan has he clearly knows he has a tech audience because he doesn't
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:35.200]   he doesn't hide
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:39.680]   The tech right he does he does stuff. Well here it is the first iPad
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:45.840]   mini TV ad from a conan yesterday apple announced the release of their new iPad mini
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.560]   Yeah, and yeah, and add out
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.600]   For the new product
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:54.000]   Descending take a look
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:57:01.200]   Spend your money spend your money spend your money spend your money you will buy
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:05.840]   Anything that we put into the store
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:09.280]   No matter how minute the chain
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.600]   just
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.840]   Are to the free bs model?
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:17.120]   Trying to fill the empty void in your
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:24.320]   So he makes a point which a lot of people are making right now, which is
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:30.160]   What it doesn't it's not it's not retina. It doesn't have a good camera. It's got it
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:35.520]   I mean, it's okay camera for camera not the iPhone 4s camera or the iPad camera
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:38.160]   um, it's
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:41.760]   It's you know, you've got your iPad touch your iPad touch has
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:44.800]   I mean retina
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:49.120]   There there's there's a long list of things that Steve Jobs was wrong about or at least was
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:56.000]   During a keynote fervor trying to over-hype the current product about and that was about the failure of a seven inch tablet
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.080]   At this point all of us have a chance to use like seven inch and eight inch tablets
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:03.920]   And there really is something more intimate about the way you operate with them
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:09.200]   But I think one of the best features of the kindle fire HD is this really cool smart cover that they have
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:14.640]   Where you flip it open you're holding something now you're holding something in your hand that really does feel like a book
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:20.160]   And you snap the cover closed like a book and you have all the extra screen real estate that makes
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:24.640]   Reading stuff on a phone so impossible, but it's still small enough that you feel as though
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:28.800]   It's a personal item, which is something that a 10 inch tablet can never really deliver
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:33.760]   So when you start to combine like the most accessible simplest cleanest
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:40.720]   Multi touch operating system on the planet with a form factor that you will be you won't be quite so scared about to use
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:45.680]   On a bus or on a subway. It's something you feel like you know, you can stick in any pocket. You don't have to carry
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:47.120]   you know
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:50.560]   My own like little european like you know men first
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:58.320]   Dear dota bag to carry tablet round in that is I think that's it is it does seem like it's a simple thing to make
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:02.880]   But I do think that it's going to be a transformative sort of device within the ipad
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.840]   Yeah, I think that I think that I will more
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:10.480]   More likely walk out the door with a mag with the ipad mini than I will with the regular ipad really
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:13.120]   Yeah, for me. It's yeah, I think that for me a lot of times
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:17.520]   I walk out with my iPhone with instead of my ipad because the ipad is bigger than I want it to be
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:22.240]   You know and I and I have a nexus 7 which I like a lot as far as the form factor goes now
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:26.400]   What's different about this is it's a four by three. It's kind of right different shape
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:33.280]   So it's interesting for me as I made the realization that there's sort of two classes of people and and the different ipads will appeal to the different ones
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:36.800]   For example, I almost always have a macbook with me because I need it
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:40.640]   There are certain things that I just can't do with iOS like open vpn and other things
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:44.640]   So having an ipad mini will be lighter and I can still use this an lte hot spot
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:46.160]   And I can still use it to read
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:52.160]   But if you really don't want to take a laptop with you then you might like the full-size ipad with the keyboard because then it becomes
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:56.080]   A laptop replacement. I definitely get it. I go ahead. Go ahead
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:58.720]   I was gonna say I have a nexus 7 and
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.000]   I just I don't like it. I do not think it's a good tablet
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.360]   To me, it's a large ipad touch and if I wanted a larger ipad touch
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:09.520]   I definitely get it, but I think apple is absolutely correct when they made the pitch that
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:13.520]   Running tablet class software on the device makes a big difference
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:16.800]   You know you can talk about the different screen size being a little bit of smoke and mirrors
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:21.680]   But the ability to run multi column ipad apps to me is a huge advantage over
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:27.760]   Um, the nexus 7 and the kindle fire again is it's a paperweight outside of american most countries. So the
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.720]   For me the ipad mini just becomes a no-brainer
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:37.280]   Well, see that it depends on that that is an excellent point. That's that's something that i'm amazed that even after this much time
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.920]   Google still doesn't have an answer to the question of where are the apps for google tablets versus
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:48.000]   Versus google android phones, but you look at what when you look at what people are buying a smaller tablet for
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.480]   It's possible that really what they want is they want the kindle app and that's a full screen app that works
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.440]   Just as well on the nexus 7 really as it does no
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:00.160]   Actually as it does on the ipad they want to use
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:05.200]   They're there a whole class of apps that work just fine on a 7 inch full screen that aren't
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:11.200]   That much better when you put it into a multi column or a more ambitious user interface
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.200]   I think that when when I write my when my review finally does appear whenever it does appear
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.720]   um
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.600]   One of the questions that I really am going to be wrestling with is
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:26.960]   $30 more the people who are going to be who are the people who just don't want to spend more than 200 or 250
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:32.720]   Dollars for a tablet because they're not interested in a post pc device with with sophisticated tablet software
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.960]   They really do want something like a hundred
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:40.720]   $130 kindle that actually has a whole bunch of extra things that can do because it has a good processor and a color screen
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.040]   I do have to say that you know
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:48.080]   Kindles on everything right this is the windows surface rt and on a 16 9
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.840]   Uh, it's a little weird to read in the portrait mode
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:58.880]   On a kindle it's such a such a tall screen and then of course in landscape mode. It's it's just wrong too. So
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.760]   So five is like that a little bit because it's also 16
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.240]   Yeah, I don't like the iPhone 5 is a little weird that way too. I guess we could get used to that
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:10.240]   Yeah, it's it's tough. I don't think this I don't this isn't surface today
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:14.400]   But uh, I I don't think the surface is really designed to be held that way
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:20.960]   It's just just like when you feels weird feels weird just like when I've been I said in part one of the review last week is that
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.400]   when you
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:28.720]   When you you can hook up a keyboard to an iPad and it will do a really good job as a keyboard or computer
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:33.760]   But every every three minutes it seems to be telling you wouldn't you rather be holding me in your hands
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:38.800]   It would be great in your hands. I think it's the exact opposite where yes
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.680]   You hold it you can't hold it vertically, but saying oh man
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.400]   Did you try flipping up my kickstand because when you put a table? Oh boy, are you gonna?
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:52.160]   Don't even use it in your lap. I mean you really this is this is is kind of has to be on a flat surface
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.800]   Uh, again, I'm trying not to detour the whole thing in this well
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.600]   It's germane only because there's a lot of look there's this is what's interesting. There's a lot of choice now
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:05.920]   There's a lot of choice in the apple realm and outside the apple realm. There's amazon
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:10.240]   I mean android amazon apple and microsoft all are making tablets
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:15.360]   And there's a variety of shapes and factors and os's and finally the I think I think we really are moving to the
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.360]   Truly into this post-pc is as all these companies start to that's what that's one
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:25.440]   That's the lesson I got from this surface which is microsoft realizes windows 8 isn't really about a desktop computing system
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.920]   This is really a tablet and it's meant for touch
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:33.200]   Yeah, and for what the average person we want to look at what the average person does with their computer when you ask people
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:39.360]   What are you doing with your computer? They're not the you know, I these these tablets these tablets are plenty fast
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:43.760]   Yeah, they are plenty powerful now heavily figured out all the I the the interface
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:49.120]   Like I don't know if I really want to open numbers and try to build a document from scratch in numbers
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.600]   I have to do a lot of spreadsheets
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.480]   And um called me this morning and just said she got to watch the view in bed with her coffee on her ipad
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.800]   And it was the best thing in the universe for her at that hour
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.240]   When I work with a lot of I mean I work with um
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:06.880]   A lot of government officials from a variety of different countries and the one thing that I'm noticing
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:13.760]   Uh across all the countries is how many of them are running their business like running their personal business all on ipads
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.400]   You know, these are guys that never really spent a lot of time on computers
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:21.440]   I think what microsoft's realizing and they're saying this is what this is the future and his supposed pc era
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:25.920]   Marco armada has a hysterical article about his experience
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.560]   Uh at a microsoft
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.960]   Store looking at the windows rt launch
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:36.880]   Um and and he really does make it painful. He does make the point he says the store is creepy
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:43.680]   So many elements are embarrassingly simp similar to the apple store on the next floor microsoft even ripped off trivial elements
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:48.080]   Okay, easily have been different things like the blue t-shirts and employees wear
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:53.360]   There's a huge elephant in the room. We can all see it, but microsoft still implicitly denies it look at the wood floors
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.000]   That I mean they have instead of a genius bar
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.200]   They have wakim what they call it, but it's a genius bar kind of like they couldn't think of anything better wizard bar or something
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:05.200]   Uh, it's a it's a fun article to read. I it's a little
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.240]   Overly anti negative
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.960]   It was it was heavy handed, but you you you are
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:15.120]   Good points. Why why can't you do something different? Yeah?
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:20.000]   Well, they can't do anything better at this point. I think they'd rather be hit for being a copy than being a failure
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   So they're doing they're doing the mock they're doing the market leader exactly at this point
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.160]   I disagree with that. I think they do some several things as well as apple does them
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:36.160]   Uh, I think but it's it's just as just as uh apple doesn't do themselves any favors when they over promise and overpray
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:40.640]   They're on products microsoft doesn't do the many favors when a they copy the apple store
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.200]   So so so closely and secondly when they
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:48.960]   They leave off like that final little that that just like a good contractor
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.240]   The final walkthrough of the house before he turns over the keys
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:57.360]   Just looking for a little nail heads that are sticking up looking for spots of paint that got missed
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:01.120]   It's that extra 1% that often turns around and experience
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:06.880]   Microsoft can take a product at 99 percent, but they're really aren't good at making that final that final step
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:11.600]   Yeah, and yeah, it's it's fun article. It's it's shall we say it's slightly partisan
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:18.160]   Well, this is the new trend by the way and I we often get slammed for not being partisan enough that
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:22.240]   Uh, you know, you notice your your reluctance Andy to even talk about surface
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:30.400]   On a mac break weekly, but and so only because it's so so you a I know my own failings that when i'm enthusiastic about something
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:37.120]   I tend to blabble all about it long and long long and suffice and also i'm i'm in i'm deep in writing my next
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:43.840]   Thousand words about it mode. So essentially all three thousand words and 43 minutes of talking about it would come out into this microphone
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.800]   I think I think I think it's a very very solid product
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:52.240]   I don't think that it deserves most of the slams that it's getting I I essentially think that
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.440]   uh
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:58.880]   the the the the pull quote from the the part one was really that with between apple
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.720]   Between the iPad and surface rt it really is a yin and yang sort of thing
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.720]   I don't think that one is
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:11.120]   Conceptually better than the other because there are things that the iPad is just not really very good at that the surface is exceptional at
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:15.360]   And then there are things like again anything that involves sitting in comfortably in a sofa and holding the device
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:18.320]   Uh in that sort of a familiar puppy dog sort of way
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:22.080]   The the surface surface rt is like a cat. It does not want to be held
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:28.720]   It'll bite back. Yeah, it's it's pretty clear is that uh each
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:34.400]   Company uh, I don't even include Amazon in this has something to add to the conversation
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:39.280]   A conversation might have been started by apple and apple gets credit for that although
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:43.600]   Microsusband pushing tablets since 2000. I know they couldn't make a good one
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.000]   Uh until apple said no no try this and then they said oh
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.880]   Uh, but but everybody's adding something to conversation and for for customers that is really good
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:59.920]   I'm almost i'm i'm really practically giddy about all the choice about this. Exactly
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:07.120]   And android ten inch tablets are absolutely boring because there is nothing that it's trying to do except for be
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:11.600]   Something like the iPad only not as good as the iPad and just as expensive as the iPad
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.760]   It's wonderful when you see
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:19.200]   Amazon come out and say well, what if we developed a tablet that was more designed towards reading and content consumption
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:20.960]   We're willing to make it that
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:25.520]   Not as good at everything else if we make it just the best thing possible for content consumption
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:28.160]   And so you have that option and then they have surface rt
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:34.560]   Which is well, what if you have people who like a tablet, but they still really really want something that's more notebooky
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.240]   That really is better
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:40.400]   At being handled with a keyboard and a mouse than the iPad is now people have that option
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:46.720]   I that's why it's sort of disappoints and frustrates me when people try to make this out into a field of winners and losers
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.240]   That right thing is not as good as the iPad and therefore it's a failure fail
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:53.360]   And I think it is I think we have all the
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:54.880]   Go ahead. All right
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.880]   Because we have all the shades of gray now you can go from an iPod touch to an iPad mini
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.960]   To an iPad to a surface to a macbook air or ultra book
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.280]   And you really can pick exactly as much device as you need for the situation that you're in
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:11.280]   The question is of course is when we get into a decision paralysis, you know
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:15.120]   I mean at some point within the companies and also with all the other pieces of trying to figure out
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:19.760]   Uh, you know, which one you need I know that for me the hard part is you walk into a phone store and you
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:24.160]   You know if you weren't buying an iPhone from a Verizon store, there are so many phones
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.800]   I like to make that choice. I mean, yeah
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:31.920]   I get like that I have a you know a galaxy and I have an iPhone and then you know an exis and but I don't have a
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.640]   But I'm not you know, I'm not all the other ones. I don't there are
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:38.160]   I'm trying to classic consumers. It just wants to be told that's the one get that right
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.720]   And but that's not anybody who watches any of our shows
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:46.320]   I mean, I don't think exactly what Tim Cook said about the surface when he was on Apple's conference call last Thursday that
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:53.760]   He that they didn't make any tough choices that releasing products is about tough choices and he found the surface message confusing and
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:59.120]   That that Microsoft didn't decide we're gonna make an rt version. They're doing the rt version and the pro version
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.400]   They're doing metro and the desktop. They're doing the touch
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.360]   Keyboard and the clickety clack keyboard
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:10.000]   Which I think is is a is a good example of the different cultures that it still exists in both companies
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.360]   And you can say the same thing for android choice over is preferred over
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.840]   monolithic
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:20.960]   Lead the way strategy and that's what apple's famous for and uh, and apple does a good job of that
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:24.160]   And if you like the apple way then you're gonna be very happy because
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:30.320]   You know johnny. I've will lead you to to the promised land or or white heaven
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:35.280]   Well, I think we'll end up with a and I think that no one's I think we're definitely moving quickly to where no one's a winner
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:38.080]   And a loser, but really everyone's got 20 or 30 percent of the market
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:45.360]   For instance google just released today a new google search for ios that has very has serie like capabilities
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:52.160]   And so google now it's an interesting thing that google because google has a as a foothold in ios
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:11:00.480]   Rapidly dimension foot hold in ios, but it can start doing things like you can say what's the weather like in san francisco on the google search app on iphone
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:04.480]   And and it will give you an as serie like response
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:10.240]   Uh, what's the tallest building in san francisco? I mean this is kind of interesting that we some
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:18.640]   One that we have to do is download it and do the same question with the exact same words and see what we get with each one because I think it's gonna be very interesting to see
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:24.720]   Uh herbs that will first is that other guys put them both in isolation booths. Yeah, that's a good idea
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:28.160]   Again another one I want to do I want to do someday
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:33.200]   We gotta do this fake check has to be kings with that road forces and has the letter h in their names
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:37.920]   Of those king the names of their horses and the ears of their reign
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:42.000]   Do do do do that be very interesting wouldn't it? Yes
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   Um, let's take a break come back lots more to talk about andi and not go is here from the chicago
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.320]   Sun times at a undisclosed location looking somewhat like johnny. I've heaven
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:56.640]   This we think this is the best podcast
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:03.120]   Renee richy from i'more.com
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.280]   You can finally take a break from the rumors for at least a month
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:11.360]   And then it all starts almost as all over again. Oh god
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:17.840]   And uh and a great pleasure to have alex lindsey and studio back from his travels back from rwanda
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:23.680]   Clyde to beer. We will talk more in just a little bit about all sorts of things
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:28.800]   But first a word from our friends at ford motor company
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.800]   Uh, they're having an event. I'm gonna miss it because i'm in uh, australia next week
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:37.280]   They're showing the new ford fusion energies the 2013 energies and the cmax
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:42.240]   Their latest electric cars in san francisco. They'll be available soon
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.160]   And one of the things i'm really pleased to see ford has announced
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.160]   That ford will offer ford sink on every
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:53.040]   2012-2013 ford vehicle sold in the us
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.760]   Including the 2012 focus the 2013
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:59.280]   Uh fusion and in many cases it'll be standard equipment
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.960]   That's a good thing because sink is good for a couple of reasons one it's safety
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.840]   It's a way of interacting with your car without taking your hands off the wheel or your eyes off the road
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.680]   You don't have to look down at a screen the car
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:14.560]   And you can have a conversation with ford sink and it understands what you're saying you could say
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:18.240]   Things like, you know browse your effect if you go to ford.com/technology
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:26.320]   They have a great they just added this page on talking to sink sink is like syri for uh for for ford
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.760]   Um, so let's go to the sink page and i'll show you
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.640]   They have what what can you say?
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:35.920]   What can you say to sink?
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:41.920]   And it's so fun all the different things uh, you can say sink speaks your language. It's a sharp looking car
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:47.120]   Oh, that's my new car by the way. Did i tell you that did you get it not yet because it's not available
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.760]   But i'm i've got a i've called scott mottie and said
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:52.400]   If there's any way you get me this before anybody else
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.280]   I want i want the 2013 fusion
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:00.160]   But it's you know, it's it's a big deal for me to trade in my mustang like 2010 mustang which i love which has sink
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:07.520]   And i love the v8 engine. Mm-hmm, but i think it's time to be a little more responsible more carton more you it's more comfortable too
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:12.320]   Um anyway, so here's the here's the sink speaks your language explore the commands
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:17.360]   And you will be your mind will be blown by all the this is very much like that google search or like syri
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.840]   You could say climate temperature 70 degrees
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.480]   You could say i'm hungry
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:28.880]   And if you say i'm hungry to syri it will sink i'm sorry sink. It will say
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.800]   Uh
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:37.680]   Here's the nearby restaurants. You can also say find a grocery store find a pizza parlor find a soul food restaurant. It understands that
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:40.480]   Listen to a text message
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:47.600]   It'll do that if you're listening to a song on your mp3 player and you can say what is this and it will tell you nice
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.440]   It will also you could say play similar music and it will say
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:57.280]   Yeah deal and then we'll just create a playlist for you. You can ask it for a five-day weather forecast
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:04.000]   You i mean it's really cool at play with this at ford.com/technology. Of course you can call people
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.600]   It's blue. You know it's bluetooth dialing, but it also can speak to your
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:15.200]   Entertainment devices voice control music on a smartphone by a bluetooth streaming a usb drive you can take a thumb drive put songs on it
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.480]   Plug it in every Ford sink vehicle has at least one usb port you plug it in
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:21.040]   And you can play it at index is it and you can play it by name
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.680]   Of course your ipad your ipad
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:29.760]   The iphone 5 works great with sync. I can i can vouch for that. I have a lightning cable just plug it in usb port at index is everything
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:36.720]   And there's iTunes tagging if you're listening to a song on the hd radio you could say hey save this and when you get home buy it on itunes
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:41.760]   Just really needs to rent it a i rented a afford
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:48.480]   I don't know what state or city, but i was wondering i was thinking about how hard is it going to be to sync up my iphone and then when the phone rang it rang in the car
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:52.400]   Well, I guess evident i don't know that happened. You didn't ever tie it together
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:57.600]   That's pretty cool. I guess it's pretty cool. Brown's all audiobooks
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:01.920]   You could say fm 94.7 and it tunes to that the whole point is not to
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:06.640]   You know this is the most dangerous it happens all the time up here people in cars not ford cars
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:11.600]   Are looking down at their radio fiddling with it instead of paying attention and they run into some
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:19.840]   Um, play podcast episode three play. I would say replace that command with play mac break weekly of course episode whatever
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:24.720]   Um just really cool stuff. I want you to try it. We tested it
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:29.040]   I'm asking people to do this and I wonder I have to call my local four dealer and see if anybody's doing this
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:33.360]   I I say go to a four dealer and say I want to test drive the ford sink and see what they say
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:37.760]   They'll say well you have to take a car too. Well, any car. I just want to test drive the ford sink
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:44.800]   Bring your smartphone or your mp3 player music player too so you could uh bond it and see how it goes
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.320]   It really is awesome
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:52.400]   Uh, I would I will not I'm so spoiled by sink. I will not buy a car with that sink and I am actually really excited about this new
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:58.720]   2013 it's a plug-in hybrid so I'm gonna club that now that I have a house I could put the charging station
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:02.800]   It uses 120, but it's really fast with the 240 so you plug it in
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.920]   If you're I think within 30 miles is all electric, right?
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:09.680]   Unless you get on the highway and you want to go 80 miles an hour, but it only goes a what is it?
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.760]   85 something like that in electric
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:17.120]   So you're really fast the gas engine kicks in but if you go into the airport the gas engine kicks in and that way I'm
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:19.040]   I never because that's actually I was looking at a leaf
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:22.640]   But I was looking at yeah, and how far can I get with the leaf before I have to recharge?
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.560]   So this is not a hybrid. It's not always hybrid
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:30.400]   It's electric within the short range and then so you're you've you may never buy gas if you just drive around town all day
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:34.080]   I'm so excited. I just saw ford and david pog two of my favorite
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:38.160]   My one of my favorite people and one of my favorite companies
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:43.920]   But on tv last night they were talking about how ford is spending a lot of data pog, you know has his pbs show
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.360]   Yeah, no, it's a pbs
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:50.400]   Not no, but it's a science thing, but it was um it was about how ford is moving a lot of their plastics to um
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.320]   You know
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:57.760]   Biodegradable it's amazing. They're growing stuff on the roof that they can make seats and making seats out of soybeans
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:03.120]   Yeah, so I gotta say that's what I was just thinking it's cool. Yeah, it's very cool. Thank you for your support
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:06.400]   So we got ford american express. I think we're on the right track here. Yes
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:11.920]   All we need to do is hire katie kurick and this is a major television network
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:16.720]   No, you don't have to worry
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:19.440]   Please don't because i'm not pretty enough
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:24.320]   I remember most on a tv network. We have been hiring pretty people lately though, but that's just because by chance
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:29.600]   I'm glad i'm glad that i'm being grandfathered in for a new quiz. I was gonna keep beating me to it
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.920]   Thank you. It's good. We got in early. You're grandfathered in the ugly people are grandfathered
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:38.800]   I can go I can go order some fubu if that'll help is
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.600]   You need to get hip if you could wear that baseball cap backwards. I'd appreciate that
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:50.080]   Oh, no, as as you all know if you want to track the youth culture, you must adjust the brim of your bowl cap thus late. Yes
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:53.520]   I've been on a chain and a tv
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:58.800]   My uh, my son gets mad at me because apparently there's a way to curve the bill
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:04.800]   And and I don't or uncur I don't know. I'm not oh, it's all about the flat bill now, right flat. That's what it is
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:08.480]   I curve it and he says no you just ruined the hat. I said what?
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:13.680]   Yeah, that flat bill. I'm sorry i'm too old for that. The first thing you do is it's too weird
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.720]   so um
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:23.440]   Did you have you downloaded a letter press yet and played it? No, it's so fun. Andy you've been playing it
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:27.600]   Um, i've been playing it. I just don't like the idea that i have to play against humans
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.720]   So this is the loren britter's new game. Remember last week he hadn't shipped it yet
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:37.200]   He was going to come out the next day loren britter is the guy who did tweedy and sold it to twitter
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:41.840]   twitter immediately eviscerated it poor loren, but he made a lot of money i guess anyway
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:46.560]   He had some time on it. Yes some time and he's been writing an ios game works great on the ipad and the iphone
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:50.880]   Um called letter press and it's a it's a very challenging fun
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.080]   Head-to-head kind of scrabble crossword like game
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:58.880]   But apparently brought game center down the day it came out game center just stopped functioning because it uses game center
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.200]   The tie people together that was his big mistake
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:07.600]   He used it for everything he trusted game center to do every bit of heavy lifting in his app and it turns out that
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:11.200]   Game center is something that apple doesn't dog food. They don't have a single app
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.680]   In ios that uses game center
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:19.280]   So they have no vested interest they have no skin in that api game and i think we this was a perfect example about
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:26.320]   Exposing the weaknesses and the things that apple doesn't get or doesn't do well. They don't get they don't seem to get um cloud
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:30.880]   Sir cloud and gaming and these are the confluence of both those things. Yeah
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:40.320]   Anyway, it's been mostly up since but uh, i tried again and it was down again like over the weekend so it's a but it's a good game
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:44.960]   And uh and apparently it broke game center
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:47.600]   i cloud nevertheless
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:50.000]   Now has 190 million users
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.680]   Uh up from 150 million last quarter and steady growth this is during the q4
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:57.680]   We didn't talk about the earnings call yet. We can go through that
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:03.360]   But one of the things apple announced on its earning call on thursday was that 190 million people
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.960]   40 more million people are using i cloud
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:10.240]   Because it's just kind of built it you can you you can't even not
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:13.840]   Hey, this is like if you have a device you kind of immediately start using it
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:17.520]   But i guess you could say the same thing about like g plus or anything else where you know
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:20.320]   You just kind of give a lot of people that are just part of it. Yeah
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.160]   Um, well, let's talk about the earnings call there was a lot of a lot of headlines
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.400]   um
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:32.960]   Both uh cfo peter op and hymer and tim cook took a moment to defend ipads
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:36.160]   pricing in the face of uh
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:40.880]   You know lower priced competition. They don't think it's too high
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.200]   Um
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:48.560]   When we set out to build the ipad mini sit op and hymer we didn't set out to build a small cheap tablet
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:54.720]   We were trying to give you a high quality experience
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:59.440]   Well, our our opinion at apple is that the 47 per second go screw them
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:05.360]   Apple will not make a product someone may feel good about the moment they're paying for it
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:09.440]   Could you imagine those rough workmen like hice touching a laminate?
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:12.640]   Is not what we're going to make
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:15.360]   He died now. This is a good point from tim cook
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:19.360]   He said we don't want to make you feel good when you pay for it and then feel lousy when you get at home
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:25.040]   Right that's a good that's actually a very good point. I was making this point on wednesday about uh, uh,
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:27.760]   The new chrome books from google. Yeah, they're cheap
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.400]   But when you get them home, are you going to use them?
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.960]   They're so limited
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:36.160]   When you're at home they actually aren't limited. It's when you go somewhere that they're home
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:40.480]   You mean when you're at i think i think that was part of the point was that you'd have extra laptops or extra pieces and
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.720]   And when you're at the house, it's great
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:45.760]   The flip side of that is that i i do wish that apple were
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:53.760]   Extended its mandate for improving the world, uh towards the direction of making a technology affordable for a wider range of people
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:58.960]   One way of describing a hundred ninety nine dollar tablets to say that's cheaply made and it's not as good as the ipad
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:04.000]   Another way of describing it is that there are a lot of people for whom that extra hundred thirty bucks is a really big deal
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.720]   At just they're just whitens the pool
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:10.800]   Uh, I I don't fault them for not for not going there, but I just think that
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:13.600]   There's two sizes everything
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:17.440]   We heard originally that there was going to be that uh two hundred dollar two hundred fifty dollar
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:21.360]   Model that was going to be an eight gigabyte and that skew just dropped off apple
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:25.360]   Basically wiped out all the the eight gigabyte devices across the line
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:31.200]   I don't know that's whether that's because oasis or getting bigger or the feeling was that if you have any amount of content at all
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:34.000]   People will regret just getting eight gigabytes
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:40.480]   Uh because it was cheaper, but that's why I think we had that nexus comparison the nexus seven comparison on screen was
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:45.920]   Fillshiller making the case for why they believed they deserved a higher price than
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:52.960]   The incredibly cheaply priced especially now with the 32 gigabyte model nexus seven apple
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:24:01.200]   Made revenue of 36 billion dollars in fiscal q4 profit 8.2 billion dollars
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.680]   Um
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:07.920]   Earnings of eight dollars 67 cents a shared all of this disappointed the stock market
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:13.200]   iPad sales were not high enough. They did not sell enough billions of ipad specific and apple gave an
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:18.480]   Advisement that their margins would go down and uh as a result earnings would go down next quarter
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:22.320]   I'm glad that the analysts are finally holding apples free to the fire
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:27.920]   Do you realize this is the fifth quarter in the row in a row that people have bought more eggs than ipads?
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:30.080]   That's not acceptable not okay
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.960]   It is not excused that eggs are only three dollars and 29 cents
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:37.520]   And an ipad is three hundred and 29 dollars. Uh, they still should be selling the same number
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:42.480]   So, but if you look go ahead that next next quarter is going to be a week
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:47.840]   This year that was last year and they made a lot of money in that extra week last year q1 is usually a big
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.320]   Quarter for apple if you look at the graph
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.000]   Um, this is uh apple's graph on a performance
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:01.680]   Uh on the left revenue, which is you know kind of been going down and profit on the right which is clearly going down
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.000]   Uh all four quarters
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.040]   Although
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:09.760]   Quarter to quarter, uh, they're up 6.6 billion in uh q4 11
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:14.560]   8.2 billion q4 12 and you have to look quarter to quarter. You can't look
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:18.320]   Over the year they had an amazing first quarter this year
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:23.280]   So you think rene that their advisement is don't expect the same kind of first quarter next year
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:28.720]   They always say that they always try to drive expectations down as low as possible. It's like scottie on the enterprise
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:31.280]   You know, that's a reputation as a miracle worker
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:36.480]   But they so they want to blow past expectations, but they were careful to say that again that one week is going to be missing
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:43.440]   And also I think the ipad mini is if you look at the ipad line is going down the ipad touch is still roughly 50
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:49.040]   Percent of the ipad line, but it's 50 percent of less and less every quarter and the ipad mini
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:53.920]   I think is supposed to sort of take that place in a growing sector and the ipad is continuing
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:59.840]   It's nice little hockey stick climb up the charts. Yeah, iphone sales up 58 percent thanks to the iphone five
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:05.680]   They sold 26.9 million iphones 14 million ipads
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.960]   4.9 million max and
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:12.320]   5.3 million ipods
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:18.320]   They still sold more ipods despite dropping ipod sales still so more ipods and imax
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:21.360]   Um, but that that's a solid
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:24.000]   Quarter in terms of sales
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:29.280]   Uh, gan, and has on had a loss. So I mean, it's it's all comparative. Would you look at right right again?
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:32.880]   You know if you look at it, I do think it was interesting they pointed out that uh, um that amazon
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:36.800]   Uh that apple now has more cash in the bank than amazon's market cap
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.440]   Here amazon has wow
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:46.800]   Apples more cash they could buy amazon in other words in cash garage cash cash um, but again
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:51.520]   the hardware sales felt short of the analyst expectations
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:56.800]   So the analysts get pissed like you proved us wrong
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:01.440]   Actually, it was interesting because almost all the analysts said this is a buying opportunity
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:07.600]   They said no, no, this is good apple's gonna do fine. Bye. This is uh, this is not the time to dump apple
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:12.240]   By any means well one of the things I think was interesting in some of the articles we were reading as we were prepping
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.920]   I thought that uh
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:18.480]   One of the ones that was interesting is looking at the cash on hand versus the their market cap
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:22.160]   You know, I think that there was a comparison and hundred twenty one billion dollars in cash
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.320]   And so after they give it a dividend away
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.560]   After it's good thing they gave that away
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:30.160]   Uh
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:32.960]   And by the way, uh worldwide too
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:38.480]   Strong they could buy the space station by the way. It's the other comparison
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:42.400]   They're building their own space station. It's called the new apple campus. Yeah
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:46.880]   Yeah, um there it is. There's the graph that I thought was interesting
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:48.080]   So
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.840]   It's cash represents more than 20 percent of its market cap yet the ratio
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:59.760]   Of cash to market cap is going down and it's been going down consistently for since uh pretty much the now that's 2000 is that
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:02.240]   Is that meaningful?
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:05.840]   Well, I think it's interesting that it just shows how stable they are compared to their market cap
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:08.400]   But I also think that it does when you talk about using the money
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.040]   I think it
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:12.400]   I think most analysts think that it gets risky if it gets if that ratio gets too low
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:17.600]   You don't want to have too little cash on hand or you don't you don't and sometimes you don't want to um
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:22.480]   Have too much cash on hand. Yeah compared too much means you comparison to your market cap because then you become
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:28.480]   I mean, I don't know how how someone you normally you would say that they become an acquisition target because of the cash that they have on hand but
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.120]   With apple. I don't know who would
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:35.840]   You know be able to do that, but you're right. They've always played this game where they uh sandbag basically the analyst
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:36.960]   They say no
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.960]   Q1's gonna be terrible
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:42.480]   Uh to save our money for buying color labs again, whatever then the next one
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.080]   Yeah color labs
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:47.600]   This is interesting. Thank you. Uh somebody in the chat room gave me a link to estimate
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:50.160]   Estimize.com
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:53.280]   You can create an estimate consensus
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:59.760]   Wall street consensus and actual over a period of time and there was a real disequilibrium
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:06.240]   Uh in that first quarter where the wall the analysts really didn't expect such a massive first quarter
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:09.280]   And of course that helps the stock price quite a bit
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:11.520]   When they outperform
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:15.040]   But what you'd what you'd like to do is be close what?
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:18.240]   I'm sorry
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:24.320]   Okay, well this is this is a rattle in a distraction. I just I love that go ahead go for it
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.240]   Sometimes sometimes people have
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:30.080]   You keep it on the chat room for people who are commenting on the show. I keep an eye on twitter
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:37.360]   Someone sent me a link to a article on the hollywood reporter that disney is buying lucas film for 4.05
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.680]   $1 and there will be a new star wars movie released in 2015
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:47.680]   Well, so it's been raging on the irc and then I tweet tweeted trying to figure out if there was any kind of uh confirmation
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:50.800]   And I think right we right as my tweet went out cmbce put something up soon
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.960]   So that's a big story
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:55.760]   That was definitely an outburst sort of holy holy mother of god
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:58.880]   So disney, which is of course
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:00.640]   Uh
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:05.280]   This seep jobs estate is a major stock. Oh number one stock holder. I think in disney. Uh, yes
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.400]   uh
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.400]   buying uh lucas film
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.880]   For a mere four billion
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:14.080]   Apple could have picked up that like wouldn't even have felt it
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:18.400]   And when you really think about it, how cool would it would have been for apple to buy lucas film for yeah
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:22.560]   Things all star wars would have been uh on the iTunes for free
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:24.960]   Bob that's what they should have done for nothing
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:31.680]   Bob iger chairman and ceo of uh walt disney says lucas film reflects the extraordinary passion vision and storytelling of center george
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:36.720]   lucas this transaction combines a world-class portfolio of content underscore that
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:42.480]   I think that's what they're buying. Yeah, including all the rights to all of those names and all those pieces and all the
[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:45.520]   I mean there there's a treasure trove of things that can be done with that
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:51.680]   You know with that uh george lucas says it's now time for me to pass star wars on to do a new generation of filmmakers
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:54.960]   I've always believed that star wars could live beyond me
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:58.480]   I thought it was important to set up the transition during my lifetime
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:03.600]   Have george lucas to kick around anymore now kathleen kennedy who is
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:09.440]   Is a long time executive producer for both spilberg and george lucas was moving along with this
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:13.680]   So she's going to be leading lucas the lucas film division. That's very interesting
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:19.360]   It's like marvel and and star wars all together now disney owns every character from my childhood
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:23.120]   Well, the good news is that copyright will now never lapse
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:27.520]   It is now they are now owned by the mouse the mouse
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:33.520]   Mickey mouse beta movie micky mouse and jar jar in the same movie just just consider ponder
[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:36.960]   With spider mr. Ponder that yes, that's kind of inevitable, isn't it?
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:44.400]   Now do I want to try to wangle my invitation to the just skywalker ranch before the flying t-cups ride gets
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:51.440]   Oh, hey wouldn't it be nice if there's a new disney land right up here in northern california. Mm-hmm lucas land
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:54.240]   They'll finally update star tours
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:01.520]   I mean you could now yeah, you really could you have lucas skywalker could join the avengers
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:06.960]   Yes, there you go. You'd have chewy to be there. You know so you have you could have the hawk and then chewy be over there going
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:09.840]   You know
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:18.640]   I'm surprised. I'm surprised that wasn't in the press release star tours will now be updated. I think I really thought that should
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:23.360]   Interesting
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:26.240]   I thought it was very interesting what tim cook said
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:33.280]   about the microsoft surface he said as you had already pointed out and he was confusing because
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:37.520]   They microsoft didn't make any of the tough choices
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:42.000]   He also compared it to a car that flies and floats like why would you want that?
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.920]   Excuse me, but I will take that car if you don't want it, Tim
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:48.800]   I don't care if it's not the perfect car
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:52.080]   Uh, but if it flies floats and drives
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:54.880]   I I say go for it
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:57.120]   I don't think that's really good. Yeah, the most metaphor
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:02.560]   I think that would be awesome. I mean I've been using a three at least three or four hours a day for nearly a week now and
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:06.720]   It's it's it's not a refrigerator toaster. No, it's a it's a cool thing
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:12.080]   It's a it's a cool. I agree with you any my review of the surface art is coming up actually I'm before you buy
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:16.400]   And as I said before the show begins, I'm still in a quandary because there's things I love about it
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:20.720]   That really and it is impra I tweeted hey microsoft innovating who to thunk
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:24.720]   Um, they're famous for gen one. I mean they'll nail surface gen two or gen three
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:30.400]   There's little things like that the touch targets are pretty small. I mean I I have a hard time typing on an iPhone though, so
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:39.360]   Maybe i'm not the guy apple store now has good news lightning to hdmi and vga adapters for a mere $49
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.240]   Holy smokes
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:44.480]   Oh wait, no, but worth every penny
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:46.080]   Um
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:49.040]   So what's the number of trims everywhere? It's a little line right here next to the vga
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:52.320]   That's uh
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:54.400]   Oh, is that is that the is that the lightning out?
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:59.040]   You can do lightning pass through that's where the electrons come out. Oh, it's lightning pass through. You're right
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.400]   Is that is that what it is?
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:04.160]   Looks like like the old one is just instead of the dock has got the lightning so you still have the pass through
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:05.760]   Right
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:10.960]   So you could charge it and watch something on your tv or whatever it is you're using for there's also a new
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:14.640]   A $19 which is a nice price 12 watt power adapter
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:21.040]   For the lightning solves the because it took so long to charge the yeah the ipad 3 which is it was an overnight charging deal
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:24.960]   Yeah 12 watts mix well, it's 20 percent faster. Yeah, it'll uh
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:28.880]   All those I don't even use the small adapters that come with the iphone anymore
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:32.960]   I just plug them all into yeah because yeah, you can you can use your iphone on it or whatever everything
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:36.720]   I mean everything I charge I just have all I have is faster wallwards and I the little ones are just that
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:39.680]   That's been my advice for a while is to check the uh
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:45.040]   The uh wattage of your uh wall work because they vary widely, you know, everything's five volts
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:48.960]   But it's the amperage you want to look at some are point five amps or less
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:56.160]   And uh so the app the uh old ipad one was five times two two amps right and I guess now it's more
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:00.080]   So I anyway, that makes it that makes does make a big difference
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:04.800]   I mean your iphone will an iphone in a 10 watt will charge in like 40 minutes, right?
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:09.120]   You know, it's just like it just it's fully charged the more the more watts the better
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:12.080]   More amps for watts at it. Yeah. Yeah
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.040]   It's what you want
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:23.200]   All right, we got the ad campaign
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:31.520]   So according to courts, which I love by the way, it's it's the it's uh the new freebie business journal htmo five business journal
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:34.880]   Uh by the guy who bought uh the atlantic
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:40.480]   Women are the target of apples ipad mini advertising strategies that right
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:45.120]   Three people who sell advertising for media companies say that apple is primarily buying
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:49.040]   Space for mini ads and publications or tv shows at kater to women
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:56.800]   Um, let's watch the actual apple ad and see is this this is is there a gender specific tie?
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:01.840]   So they're playing heart and soul on a ipad and ipad mini
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:06.080]   So woman's fingers compared to a man's fingers. Yes
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:11.840]   So maybe that's it mini you want to see you want a smaller finger make it look more expensive, would you?
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:14.400]   Yeah, can you can't really tell the gender of the finger
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:18.720]   Hark is back to the tomhanks movie big which as we know all women have a soft spot for
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:22.240]   That's it. It reminds you of big
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:25.760]   heart and soul
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:27.760]   um
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:29.440]   It's the size
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:35.200]   It fits in your handbag. It's if you have smaller fingers, maybe it works better. I don't know. Is that makes sense lighter?
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:38.880]   It's it's lighter pocket pockets more portable the mini chicks dig it
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:41.680]   Sold out too
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:43.280]   black and white
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:45.280]   Too late evidently, uh, no one liked it
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:50.960]   You know, that's meaningless though. Uh, this the surface sold out as well and it's meaningless
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:53.600]   You don't know how many you don't know how many maybe they had a 50 of them. We don't know
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:55.760]   Yeah
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:37:01.280]   50 ipad's gonna fast. Okay. Um, I knew they shouldn't have had a main in america
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:08.880]   Phil shiller says customers are not asking for built built-in blu ray players. So don't ask
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:13.280]   I don't want any more blue ray. I know I felt bad. I was working for someone who actually makes blue rays
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:17.040]   That was like I'm kind of post-plastic. I mean, yeah, the idea of like buying something now
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:20.320]   I want when I buy it. I want it available on every device
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:25.440]   You know, you know, it was like I walk across the living room and stick a disc in something then walk back to the sofa
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:31.840]   And your kids put the quarters in the blu ray disc and you know stick so did anybody notice this the Beatles apple core
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.640]   logo
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:38.480]   Now a registered trademark of apple talk about skeu morphism
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:44.880]   I think looks exactly like an apple. They finally so where they've been going back and forth over this for decades
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:50.400]   Uh the Beatles suing apple over the apple trademark apple said well, we'll never do music
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:53.280]   And then a few years later. Oops
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:55.840]   Well, maybe we'll do some music
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:57.280]   um
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:59.280]   they settled in
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:01.120]   2007 and uh
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:07.600]   All the trademarks related apple would be owned by apple which would then license them back to the Beatles apple core for continued use
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:10.480]   and so now
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:12.480]   uh apple owns
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:18.960]   In in canada too apple owns the apple core logo. I guess they won't be having that argument anymore
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:22.480]   It's kind of isn't he owns star wars apple owns the beetles. Yeah
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:27.120]   Up is down black and white dogs and cast living in the fringe universe and
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:32.480]   Paul McCartney issuing a public statement that yoko ono had nothing to do with the breakup of the Beatles. I just don't even know
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:35.840]   Scott forest all is not at apple
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:42.720]   Uh, you know, I just want to point out that apple could buy disney with cash
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:50.080]   What's disney's market cap? This is market cap is 89.86 billion apple. We just have plenty
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:53.360]   There's 30 billion left up for over. Let me let me write you a check here
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:58.240]   How much do you want how much do you want to be shorter to come up the list of things that apple could not buy with yes
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:04.480]   I'm not for sale if a newborn child with the amount of cash they have on it
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:07.360]   How much for the how much for the kid?
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:09.280]   um
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:11.280]   You're the
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:13.280]   Baby soul said him to be
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:16.720]   Can't me tell me wife your son
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:19.920]   Send your family
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:27.280]   A google employee leaves the new nexus for phone in a bar in san francisco. What is it about san francisco bars?
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:30.560]   Everything that's I know that's just copying
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:33.840]   That's the same launch strategy buzz marketing
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:40.960]   Have you seen steve jobs yacht so we learned about his yacht in the walter isakson biography steve said i'm not going to stop
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:43.040]   Designing this I know I may die before it's done
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:47.280]   But if if I stop working on it, it'll be an admission that i'm going to die
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:50.240]   Uh, it was built. It's christened venus
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:55.120]   It's pretty awesome really I think it's like a floating apple store
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:58.000]   It's a luminous it's the lightest thinnest aluminum yacht shell ever
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.640]   And they had the the apple store guys designed the glass so it's structural because as you know
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:08.000]   When you get into a perfect storm you want 10 foot tall sheets of glass around the bridge house
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.320]   Uh, seven of what look like brand new i'max on the deck. Yeah
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:18.720]   Not the new ones they steer it with oh, they don't have the thin ones you got the old fast. Uh bring it back
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:26.160]   It's disgusting you guys will just set far to it and by the way did johnny i've designed a seat because i'm not sitting on that
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:29.600]   I think it's a two
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:33.600]   Stand there and shake like star trek hell you're not supposed to sit down you're supposed to stand and work
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:37.520]   What the hell kind of chair is that that's just a lean when you're tired
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:41.040]   Maybe it's not done. See what what I like what I like about
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:46.560]   What I like most about steve jobs is that he never stopped being that that lovable hippie
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.440]   Just wants to go to an ash rarum and
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:53.280]   And then here's here's the two shot of 80
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:56.320]   $800 million you got you're sitting and wrong
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:03.120]   Here's the uh, here's the butt of the boat, which is remarkably ugly. I think well. You like that. I like it
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:07.760]   All right. See I know it's what are you surprised by all of the like hard angles and right corners there
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:09.520]   Just
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:13.040]   It looks like it's made out of lego like I would buy that on a lake make that out of lego
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:14.960]   Yeah
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:19.840]   Anyway, I you know, I don't know I wonder if loreen and the kids will keep it or if uh, they'll sell it
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.640]   Um, I sure like to keep it
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:24.480]   Sailing around an ash
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:27.200]   Huh? They were there that weekend. They were when it launched. Oh
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:32.560]   You know, it's his leg in many like many things. It's his legacy and this is the
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:35.600]   You know, they got Philippe stark to do the interior
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:41.840]   And boy was his design aesthetic consistent across every single product. Yeah, it's very uh starky
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.960]   Starks the word
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:47.360]   Pentagon's buying iPhones
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:50.480]   And android and android
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:53.680]   I think the important part is they're not by not blackberries blackberries
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:59.520]   I think they've decided they would not where they don't want to be the last one out. I think that's the key to the operation here
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:02.720]   uh
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:08.560]   Apple will apple do an online radio service to challenge pandora in 2013 bloomberg says so
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:11.440]   Is that credible we keep hearing that rumor
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:13.840]   even I know
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:18.320]   I maybe alice and speak the licensing issues better than I can but they've been trying for years and when you interview any
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.240]   Slacker or pandora type they tell you international licensing is an absolute
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:24.880]   nightmare and when you look at how far apple and
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:30.720]   Google and microsoft some of the biggest strongest toughest companies in the world have gotten when it comes to licensing content
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.520]   It's just it looks like an unimaginable nightmare
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:39.840]   I think the other thing is the music industry is very afraid of letting apple any further into the industry as then it already is
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:42.880]   And so I think that there's this you know, they they want to keep on making more money
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:47.760]   They want to do all those things but they want the because of apple was able to get not so much a panda
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:53.680]   Pandora is fine, but if they got a spotify like service, I think that would be the end that's what's missing
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:58.320]   That's the subscription service. That's what yeah, I mean that in what I really think like a
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:04.720]   I really think a service if apple was able to have a spotify like subscription service and then allow you to buy up and buy all the
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:07.680]   Other things that you might want or the things that aren't available
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:11.600]   To add to that service I think it would be kind of the perfect mix of the two because I know that
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:16.000]   Was spotify for whatever reason my credit card number changed and then they cleared my entire
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:22.960]   It cleared my whole spotify because I changed my credit card number. Oh, you know, I didn't notice it and suddenly I wasn't there and said, oh, you know, it ran over the
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:24.400]   Your cash
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:26.800]   And so what it's just a cash. It's not you know, but that stuff
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:31.760]   Well, but I had I had it was 450 songs that suddenly disappeared and it has taken me three weeks to rethink
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:34.480]   Because it keeps on stopping because it says you're not using it
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:37.360]   I'm like the reason I'm not using is because I'm waiting for it to finish and
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:41.520]   I think the new thing here was that they would apple would might be agreeing to do ad revenue sharing
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:45.920]   None of the other companies have done so far. You know pandora is tim wester gonna pandora points out
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:51.600]   55 of their revenue goes back to the artists. I mean they pay big checks to the artist one in pandora by the way
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:52.960]   I don't think has any
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:58.400]   Agreements so what they're doing is there in the united states at least they're there's a sad exchange which is they're using right?
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:04.240]   But they're using the rules that already exist as to because they're not because you that's why you can't control every track
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:10.160]   Right, you know and so which is why I have to admit that I don't use it. I just want Spotify just download my I like it
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:15.240]   There's times when I want a radio station when I just say yeah some of this you know what else is good is songza
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:17.760]   Songza so ngza
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:22.880]   They give me say so instead of saying an artist you say a style right style
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:26.600]   I'm getting too old. I think so again
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:28.720]   Really and door I just updated their app yesterday
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:33.560]   They announced a new app and I think for windows they announced windows support at the same time they updated their iOS
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:41.080]   You're gonna get with I shouldn't say this please don't hate me windows phone 8 you will get a year's free Pandora subscription
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:44.920]   If you live in the US well, what do you want? You're in Canada?
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:48.240]   I would like some Pandora's luok. Do you send me a box of Pandora's no
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:51.800]   But songs that does work in Canada so there yeah, and so does slacker
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:54.840]   Did you just call us a slacker?
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:57.400]   No the slacker music. Oh the slacker music
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:04.480]   Afro-frient that a music service is called slacker
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:10.880]   Anyway
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:17.640]   Yeah, that's I thought that was interesting windows Microsoft very being very aggressive with windows phone 8 and that is a pretty strong selling
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:22.680]   Play they have to I think that this is they gotta play hard. I mean I don't think I think Microsoft while they're really big
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:24.680]   And they still have some cash momentum
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:29.280]   They are slipping quickly. I mean they have to they have to turn this over
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:33.040]   So I think this is an all-in-nothing kind of deal when they move over our picks coming up in just a second
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:35.480]   But first a band iPad mini promo. This is
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:38.320]   Running up the charts on YouTube
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:43.760]   John Alaric and his team do band you know they did the band iPhone. Here's the band iPad mini promo
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:49.120]   This just shows you what people are thinking maybe iPad was designed to be very powerful and very capable
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:56.120]   So our goal was to take all of the amazing things about the full-size iPad and pack them into a product is so much smaller
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:02.240]   But not as small as the iPod touch and that's exactly what the iPad mini is
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:08.840]   Wait the iPad mini is not the iPod touch. I want that sound confusing
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:11.720]   Processor they are different
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:13.960]   Yeah, I put touch has read a display
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:18.440]   iPad mini is the thinnest iPad we've ever designed surprise surprise
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:22.920]   It's point four millimeters thinner than the iPhone 5 which was just released a month ago
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:29.880]   So as usual each product is thinner than the last it's always going to be thinner except with the third generation iPad
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:32.040]   Which is now the old?
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:34.920]   New iPad and not the retina display iPad
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:39.760]   Not to be confused with the iPad mini which does not have a retina display
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:42.600]   But it's thinner in iPad mini
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:50.160]   We also redesigned eyesight with new HD cameras that allow you to take amazing photos in HD video
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:54.400]   It doesn't have an 8 megapixel camera like the iPhone 5 or the 4s
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:57.400]   But neither does the iPad 4
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:00.360]   Which at this point
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:03.520]   I'll take whatever I can get
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:10.500]   The biggest challenge we faced was incorporating all of the great features from the iPad minus the retina display
[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:12.500]   It's a much smaller design
[01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:19.920]   iPad mini has the largest and thinnest single-cell battery we've ever designed and a smaller mother board to house the powerful two-year-old
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:22.960]   A5 chip plus it has the new lightning connector
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:31.440]   Which is also pretty neat if all we had done was take the original iPad and reduce it all you would be aware of is what was missing
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:34.280]   like two cameras
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:40.640]   Man that still gets to me. I had many is the lightest iPad we've ever designed. It's also the most affordable
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:44.360]   So there's that too with all of the many advances
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:52.040]   You probably expect to pay more than double the price of the full-size iPad with this amazing device is a hundred and seventy dollars cheaper on every level
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:55.280]   Yes, you heard correct you get more for less
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:58.960]   minus the retina display and faster processor
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:06.080]   All of these efforts combined create a product with an exceptional level of fit and finish and the result is an extraordinary iPad
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:13.720]   one that'll be used until a faster processor is developed as well as the technology to put a retina display in such a tiny device and
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:20.200]   A higher megapixel camera, but who knows when that'll be that's at least seven months into the future
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:22.200]   Ipad mini is the future
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:25.720]   It's the future until May it is
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:28.520]   Probably more like the end of May
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:30.920]   Or more than likely June
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:36.000]   iPad mini is now the future until then
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.320]   Thanks again for watching guys. I think it's pretty fun. That's John O'Larrick and and he does a whole bunch of

[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:30.720]   I got it. I got a I got a slip schedule
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:37.120]   Let's take a break. I got a rock. That's the wets it right. I got a rock
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:42.240]   If you are interested in getting I probably shouldn't do this ad right after that
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:47.760]   But if you are ready to get the new iPad mini maybe you want to get the you know a lot of people have an iPad
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:55.920]   Third generation and saying I want that faster processor. What's the best way to get some money for the old and bring in the new gazelle
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:02.160]   calm they buy iPhones iPads iPods Macintosh computers and
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:08.960]   And screens they'll even buy your old blackberry HTC LG Motorola Nokia or Samsung phone
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:12.680]   So that you can train up to the newest stuff. Let's say I you know
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:15.880]   I've got I really do want to get the new fourth generation just because it's faster
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:21.360]   So I've got a iPad third generation 64 gig LTE. Well, whatever 500 bucks
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:26.320]   That's great. Yeah, you gotta do it quickly though, cuz it's only gonna be that way for the next. Oh, here's the beauty
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:27.360]   This is good for 30 days
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:32.600]   So do it now and then you when you get the new iPad and you transfer everything over then you put it in the box
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:35.720]   They be shipping on anything worth more than a buck Apple should buy gazelle
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:39.880]   No, I'm just because this is a thing you buy something every you buy something every year
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:44.800]   And you got it and then this just gives you that discount that you need to keep on buying because that's actually you're absolutely right
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:50.640]   Yeah, cuz it's because it yeah, cuz it's recycling the easy way somebody wants that iPad third generation and
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:52.560]   This and gazelle well
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:54.880]   They their data experts will wipe the data for you
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:57.040]   I have to think about that they pay the shipping for you
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:01.240]   And they then send you a check you can get a PayPal credit or an Amazon gift card
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:04.800]   And they bump the Amazon gift card by 5% there. I think they're giving you back
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:07.280]   I would guess they're giving you back the affiliate face, but that's great
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:11.440]   So try it all you know there's no obligation. It's good for 30 days
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:13.740]   Just see what your stuff is worth go to that drawer
[01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:17.520]   You know that messy drawer with the old phones and iPads and stuff in there just go to that you know
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:21.840]   I know you got one. Let's go to that drawer take out everything go to gazelle
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:27.160]   You may be amazed at how much you can get from gazelle and then just throw it in a box
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:29.240]   They pay the shipping and boom there you go
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:32.880]   G a z e l l e gazelle
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:37.220]   Dot com the best way to trade in that old gadget so you can get the new one
[01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:41.880]   They send you a box, you know that they ship. It's nice then they all the instructions and really do a nice job
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:48.520]   Very high a high quality company, but I think they've paid almost 50 million dollars now to over 40,000
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:50.520]   I'm sorry 400,000 customers
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:53.280]   over the last couple of years gazelle
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:56.640]   Dot com Disney's gonna have an investor call in five minutes
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:00.120]   We might go to that briefly just to listen in if we can
[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:06.840]   As after we finish up Mac break weekly. Let's finish it up in fact starting with your picks of the weekend
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:08.280]   Do you not go? What do you got? Oh?
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:12.600]   He's silent did you sit on something?
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:19.380]   I've got rather I've got an obvious pick for my circumstance the rail back LED sportsman
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:24.720]   Which I bought I bought one of these last year for I rain as soon as it arrived
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:29.880]   I bought two a couple more because they're so good and of course I've been using them for the past 24
[01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:33.120]   24-28 hours since I lost power again
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:39.140]   These are if you have not replaced like your emergency lanterns like since you left since you were a teenager
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:44.640]   Definitely you want to see these really wonderful high illumination white LED lanterns
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:48.880]   They cost about 25 bucks the bet they run on three D size batteries
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:53.040]   They will light up an entire room and the battery will last it has two brightness modes
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:58.920]   If you have it on the dim setting it's still plenty to like let you get around the house by and the batteries will last
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:05.280]   90 hours now nine zero hours and if you want something really really bright like bright enough to read or cook by
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:07.720]   That's only four hours of battery life
[01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:12.880]   Matter of fact I after last year's storm forgot the power back
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:18.720]   I pretty much put them away and even like didn't replace batteries to do anything took them out like yesterday
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:22.000]   And they're still good to go. So I've other batteries
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.920]   I've other batteries like in storage, but like I haven't had to switch them out because these these are just so handy
[01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:28.920]   They're also really so well designed
[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:32.960]   We're there flip up handles you can hang them off of anything. They're really really great
[01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:37.180]   They're small compact can't say enough about you're channeling the gizwiz right now by the way
[01:53:37.180 --> 01:53:42.480]   We will have a gizwiz show this afternoon the power is on at gizney land. So we will do that show in just a few minutes
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:44.320]   That's that's good news
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:47.520]   All right. Thank you, Andy. Mr. Renee Richie your pick of the week
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:54.040]   I have to go with letterpress Leo. I've been waiting to pick this every week. Yeah, oh you knew about it
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:54:01.040]   I was an early beta tester for it. So I've got I've had a lot of time to play it against a lot of people and really try it out
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:03.640]   He's tweaked the rules and it's keeps getting better and better
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:09.460]   The release version is fantastic. I love the animations that he puts in for the little letters
[01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:16.560]   Lauren Briccher was originally at Apple and then he made Tweety and he's like this warrior priest of designer coder who comes up with all these
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:21.080]   Great interfaces and great ideas and I had a chance to talk to him about this app
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:25.000]   And he had his wife for just playing I think it was called spell tower at the restaurant
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.400]   And he was upset they couldn't play competitively
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:30.880]   So as you or I might you know cook something on a hot plate
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:37.200]   He decided to make this entirely new app just to beginning to play with his wife and kept building it and now I
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:43.240]   Think it's safe to say it's a smash hit. I don't know anyone in our tech circles who isn't playing it
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:48.440]   People are checking it before they check Twitter in the morning now. It's crashing game center
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:53.840]   It's it's just remarkable. He did an excellent job. It's it's a very fun game. Yeah, and it builds your brain
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:57.280]   It's not some dumb thing highly Rick and it's free
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:54:59.720]   Yeah, he's gonna do in-app purchases
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:03.920]   There is one so if you do the in-app purchase now it opens up the wordless
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:05.760]   You get the complete list of words in the game
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:11.360]   You get the ability to play multiple games at once and you also get a variety of different themes
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:17.000]   So you can play WordPress in pink and black if you so desire I knew that I bought it because I just wanted to support him
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.180]   It's it's not it's two bucks three bucks. What was it? I can't remember. Yeah, it's a dollar
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:28.640]   It's worth it. Yeah, but it's free so you don't have to do the in-app purchase and you get most of the functionality
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:29.320]   I'm a lot of it
[01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:33.640]   I mean you certainly playable for the biggest functionality is if you're if you're a pro player
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:37.880]   It opens up the ability to play like more than five people at once or something
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:43.360]   That's what it was it's uncertain. I don't want to play more than five people at once and the people who are getting really good at it
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:48.480]   Now there's a new term called smurfing where they try to get every color letter on the board to turn their color
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:50.840]   Wow, and that's just that's the ultimate in victory
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:54.600]   That's the Mortal Kombat fatality of I need to do and maybe Chad you can help me
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:59.320]   I need some instruction on the strategy of this so that I cuz I'm just a little more complicated than you
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:04.000]   I'm just spelling words. I don't and I know that I'm doing it. There's got to be more to it. Yeah, made a change
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:08.600]   Before he released the game originally you just picked letters, but some of the games would go on and on
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:10.720]   So now we added the ability to protect letters
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:14.480]   So if you can right surround a letter in your color the opponent can still play it
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:16.160]   But they can't change the color of the letter
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:21.680]   So it's got almost like a little tower defense sort of strategy built into it where that's how you can slowly start
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:25.000]   Eating the board away from your opponent
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:31.600]   Alex Lindsay one minute to the Disney investor call. I'm sure you're fast and as a former Lucasville employee. Yes, yes
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000]   So spec has finally released
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:39.520]   Who covers where's mine? I ordered it. No, because we ordered all of them. You took them all
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:44.800]   We literally cleared Amazon mine should come recently. Yeah, we had like okay
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:48.400]   So I should get one because I ordered that I was wondering where it was good. There was an excitement
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:53.160]   We use the spec cases. We love them. Yeah, but they didn't have it for the retina for a long so they're out
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:55.720]   That's my picker. I you we put these on like every computer
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:57:04.080]   Plastic shells that don't make the computer bigger, but definitely protected. Yeah, and mine already started getting beat up because it's been getting so much work
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:07.360]   So anyway, and I have to say I was really prepared for an iOS tip
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:11.020]   I'm just gonna give you really quickly because someone gave such a great. Oh good. Yes. This is a
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:16.080]   Siri, you know, so there's one thing that really drives me crazy about Siri and that is that you can't
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:24.640]   That you it comes on really loud no matter what but you accidentally hold the button down while you're recording an event and suddenly goes
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:27.000]   Bloop you know does a little everything yeah
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.240]   So if you hold the Siri down and one series opened yeah
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:35.080]   If you you can now change the ring or if you change the ring or volume you can make it silent
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:38.840]   So if serious open you can change series volume exactly
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:44.800]   But if he's not open you'll just be changing the ring exactly and and that was a that was very embarrassing for me recently
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:47.920]   So I was very glad that that that was sorted out
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:49.700]   So and I apologize
[01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:52.640]   I don't have the person who put it on my tweet, but but I
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:59.180]   Really appreciate it and I do have to think that the new Google search will be my pick for iOS because that does add Siri like features
[01:57:59.180 --> 01:58:04.200]   It's free and you can get it now for iPhone and iPad alright. We're gonna go live to the Disney call
[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:07.940]   We want to thank you for joining us Andy and I'm glad you're safe and sound
