[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   This is Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, the show that brings you everything you'd ever
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   want to know about Mac and Tasha's and probably a little bit more.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I'm Leo Laport, your friendly host and joining us.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   On the call today, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Merlin,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Truck Spank Man.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Truck Spank.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   I've been going with Pony Boy.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   That's my new latte name.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Pony Boy.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   It's my Curtis.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   If you haven't heard Merlin's podcast, you look nice today.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Go to ulooknicetoday.com and listen to the current episode,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Truck Spank.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   But don't delay because it's pretty quickly becoming the podcast that
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   if you didn't hear the last 10 episodes, you really aren't going to
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   follow it.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   You're not going to know what's going on.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I can't follow it and I do it.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Apparently a lot of things get recorded that I don't remember saying.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It's adults only, but I'll tell you, I was listening this morning at
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   breakfast and my wife started listening and she couldn't stop.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   She started laughing and just couldn't stop.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   She loved it.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   You got a good one there, Leo.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   It was a great show.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Ulooknicetoday.com.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Also here, Andy Inako, the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Andy's also a regular on the Apple phone show and many other fine
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   programs.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Good morning, Andy.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Good morning.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Now, Merlin, if people go to your regular strip club and ask for
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Pony Boy, are they going to get the old Pony Boy or are they going to
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   get you?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   My strip club?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Oh, have we started yet?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Oh, God.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I was role-tapely of that.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Okay, let me just switch that off every wine.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Corps.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Hello.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Who was about to move to my neck of the woods, I think.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   That's the weirdest thing ever.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   We've been looking now that way.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   As soon as you have a kid, sometimes you decide that San Francisco is
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   the place for you.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And so it's not really the kid town.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.600]   And so we've had -- we have a list.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.000]   You're talking to Merlin, man, who's living there with his child.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   But you notice, Alex, you only see infants and teenagers.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Have you ever noticed that?
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   There's no seven-year-old kids in the town.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   There's a gap.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   There's a gap where a whole bunch of people decided this just wasn't
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   going to work with it.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It sent them to Tiburon or something.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I don't know where they go, but you don't see elementary school-age kids
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   here.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   It's extraordinary.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It is.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   It is.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It's very odd.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Maybe they come back.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   They bring their kids back once they've gotten over the certain age.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Yeah, it's just goes full of a lot.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   It's like, you know, just bust them out.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   You know, and so we were looking at, you know, Santa Fe and Albuquerque,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Austin, Portland, and a couple of places that we could possibly be.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And so I figured, you know, Petaluma's really nice for a lot of reasons.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I mean, you know, and --
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Well, the irony is you came up with Carlita, your wife, on Sunday.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And by yesterday, I'm getting emails with houses.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   She's going to be looking at tomorrow.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Well, she's going to be looking at them.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.720]   You know, the thing is, is that once Carlita gets going, I just try to keep my hands and
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.720]   feet away from my --
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.360]   I have to tell you, this is how we moved up here, though.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.680]   We had a one-year-old, and we wanted to buy a house.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.000]   You're probably not going to buy, but we wanted to buy a house.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.480]   And although this is, I think this is probably a good time to buy.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.520]   And so we came -- we started driving north because you can't afford a house in San Francisco.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.520]   Then you get to Marin.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.120]   You can't -- you know, Tiburon, Sausalito, San Rafael.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.680]   You can't afford a house there.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.520]   And so we just kept going north until we could afford a house.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.520]   And that's how we ended up up here.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.520]   But you know what?
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.520]   This is a great place to raise kids.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.760]   I've been very happy here.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.000]   So we came up to wander around, and we did that.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.120]   And then before I know it, yeah, she's trying to mean these lists from Craigslist.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.200]   And so she's going to be looking at houses to either buy or rent for a short period of
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.520]   time so she can feel it out.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.520]   That's a good idea.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.200]   You know if we're going to spend a bunch of money, I'd kind of like to sit in there for
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.200]   a little while.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.200]   Yeah, get to know it first.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.280]   Yeah, no, I think that's a great idea.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.560]   So it's a great mix of between the art side of, you know, the art side that she likes
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.400]   and kind of more of the excited that I like.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.920]   Well, and you could just come right over here.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.920]   You need a TV studio.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.920]   We got it.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.920]   We're ready.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.920]   Exactly.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.680]   So anyway, so we are definitely spending more time at Aluma.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.680]   So that's the panel.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.400]   I'm trying to get Scott born.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.560]   He was going to be here.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.360]   And I probably threw him because we were thinking of doing this via iChat.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.600]   We may still next time because I want to get video of you guys for the live portion
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   of the show.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.000]   Anyway, we don't have a video.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.280]   You'll just have to imagine Merlin and his...
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.200]   I turned my nose here just for this event.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.720]   I know, I'm sorry.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.480]   Did you go back to the Dunscap lab or are you at your mom's?
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.480]   I'm at mom's house.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.600]   I'm actually now at mom's house studio C because it's raining outside.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.600]   So we had one of those like folk rock bands in.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.360]   So we got the echo panels down.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.800]   So we might have a little bit of a rattle and hum here.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.800]   Sounds good.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.800]   I like it.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.800]   That tube analog feel to it.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.080]   Well, since my baby left me.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.600]   I found a new baby.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.720]   Can you still add the birds and post?
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.720]   Yes.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   We've been doing that for the last four.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.040]   Oh, it means never mind.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.080]   Actually, Annie's also looking for new housing as we mentioned last week.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.080]   And it sounds like you found somewhere where you could actually do the show from the forest.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.080]   Yes.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.840]   I've been bringing all kinds of different technology to this.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.000]   One of them was to basically put up a floor plan of what I was looking for on Flickr.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.120]   Because I got a whole bunch of followers on Flickr.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.680]   And also I have like several thousand people following me on Twitter.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.880]   Basically saying if you've got any ideas, let me know.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.120]   I got a lead on this place that happens to be right across the street from a 50 acre
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.000]   nature reserve in Park.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.800]   And I took a look at the place last weekend.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.640]   It's a really nice place.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.640]   I'm looking at the apartment.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.760]   I'm thinking, you know what?
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.920]   If I put an antenna on a corner, this corner of the house, I've got clear line of sight all
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.480]   the way to the tree line all the way over there.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.480]   So we could start.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.680]   It could be like Uncle Andy and his Woodlands friends talk about XML.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.360]   Oh, you're making people so excited, Andy.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.600]   Can't wait.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.200]   And he called it a Twitter apartment.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   Twitter.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.200]   Twitter.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.200]   Twitter.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.200]   Twitter.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   The Twitter part.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   Twitter.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.200]   The tweet vowels in order to be webtoofunoder.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.200]   Or it means you can't access it most of the time or.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.200]   Yeah, it's mostly down.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.800]   I say that because I love.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.800]   I say that out of love.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.800]   But you gotta make it.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.800]   Well, it is.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   Well, it is.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   Well, it is.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.800]   That is a very appropriate thing for real estate because once I get like my once I get
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.520]   my plateau funding, I'll be able to move on to the next phase of living, which is getting
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.520]   a real house.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.520]   But you don't want to.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.520]   I just want to.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.080]   I'm doing this apartment as a proof of concept to prove that I can be trusted with a four
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.080]   or five, six bedroom.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.080]   That's why you made it out of rails.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.000]   It was easy to get it up.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Exactly.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And it's open source.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.960]   Now, of course, you have to really nail those doors shut because if there's an open
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.320]   port anywhere in the house, you know, they're going to find it.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320]   You got all these script kitties.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.320]   You got to restart.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.120]   You got to restart the web brick.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.520]   And you know, I have for a while I was I had a house made out of flash, but it was just
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.520]   taking too long to let.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.520]   But it was pretty.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.520]   I was just.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.520]   Skip intro.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.520]   Skip intro.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.160]   You're just tired of, you know, one is settled down on the sofa, but there's like a big missing
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.120]   puzzle piece icon where the sofa used to be, you know, TV just says skip intro.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.120]   That's no way to live.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.680]   I'm living in the cloud and I find it wonderful.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.880]   Let's move on to our top stories and actually before we began Merlin asked for the low down
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.160]   on the iPhone.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.280]   And of course, we're now one week away.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:10.400]   I think what we're going to do, are you going to be going to the WWDC keynote Alex Lindsey?
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.040]   You know, no one sent me an invitation yet, but I, but I, I'll let me see if I can get
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.440]   you in because I can't leave this chair anymore.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.520]   I'm actually physically glued into it.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.760]   It's on Monday morning, right?
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.240]   So are you like, I mean, burn iron size?
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.240]   Yeah, I am.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.240]   This is more like that.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.720]   The person who like didn't leave the toilet for two years and had to be basically up for
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.720]   the dinner.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.920]   I can't move and, but I'm very comfortable.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.280]   So, uh, I've got a rag on a stick for all my sanitary needs.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.200]   I was thinking, or everybody's video version of this starts next week.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.680]   You'll be able to see me with my rag on the stick.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.680]   I'm comfortable.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.680]   I've got a padded seat.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.400]   So I was thinking that since Andy can't get to the conference and I can't get to the
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:56.320]   conference, maybe, you know, and last time he did this great couch version of the keynote.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.960]   And I thought maybe he could do the couch keynote on Twit Live.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.680]   So, uh, and I actually asked you Merlin, but I guess it's too early in the morning for
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.680]   you.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.680]   I don't know.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.680]   So, but you're welcome to join us.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.680]   So 10 o'clock on Monday, uh, we...
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.960]   I was, I was live streaming for a while, but I went to a really good doctor.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.680]   And now I can hold it for as long as an hour at a time.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.400]   You know, it's funny how many, you know, I just assume that anybody who does these shows
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.160]   with me is completely open to the notion of perhaps, you know, putting their life online.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.520]   And it turns out that's not the case.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:32.920]   I, I think with the help of an editor and, uh, and I can make my life interesting, but
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.920]   without an editor.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.320]   Oh, ye of little faith.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.480]   I think you're plenty interesting.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.320]   But anyway, and that's what we have camera angles for anyway.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.560]   So just to keep it interesting.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.680]   And I've got, I've got, I've got all sorts of transitions, you know, dissolves so we
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.680]   can do all sorts of...
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.680]   Take away tickets.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.680]   Beards.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.680]   Can you live stream all the things?
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.680]   I could do anything.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.680]   I could put you in a double box, triple box.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.680]   I can go away.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.200]   But anyway, my ten o'clock, I guess the keynote begins ten o'clock Pacific, which is 1
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   p.m. Eastern time.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.080]   And that's 1,700 UTC.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.920]   So Andy and I will kind of gather to do this live.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.080]   What we'll do is we'll do like everybody else is doing, we'll be refreshing and gadget.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.960]   Unless we come up with a better way.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.960]   I don't know what a better way would be.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.960]   I can figure it somewhere.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.160]   I can, I can, well, if you could live blog it from the conference, that would be great.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.360]   I'll find out if we can get, if we can get in.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.080]   Well, we'll, yeah, we'll try to get you in.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.360]   I'll send an email out to Apple today.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.960]   Maybe you and Scott could go.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.560]   And then so Andy and I will kind of hold down the fort during the conference.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.720]   And then after the conference, you could join us and give us your analysis.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.880]   So Monday, we're going to do a special Mac break weekly.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.360]   And that will be for the WWDC keynote.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.760]   And I think everybody expects that at the very least, we'll see a new iPhone, right?
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.760]   Yes.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:52.320]   Yes, I would be, I think we would all be painfully surprised and dismayed and suicidal, I think.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.280]   One analyst, probably because, you know, it's a long shot, but if you got it right, he'd
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.240]   become famous, said, no, it's not going to be an iPhone.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.800]   They're not going to announce a new iPhone.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.960]   Wow, I'd be really painful for Apple, I think.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.200]   This is why the expectations are so hard.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.200]   Expectation is, you have to have male answer syndrome in order to have like a blog nowadays.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   Absolutely.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.040]   It's still okay to say, I don't know, you know, or null, no, no, no, you can never say,
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.040]   I don't know.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.720]   I kind of want to stick to my guns and think that they're going to show it on Monday, but
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.080]   they're not going to release it on Monday.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.480]   But I'm seeing more signs in the past week than I have in the past month that there's
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.240]   going to be release on Monday.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.160]   But it still just doesn't it make more sense to have it on its own event rather than because,
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.080]   no, no, no, no, well, this would be a good place for Apple to announce that actually
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.680]   they've been using sham billing to inflate the stock price.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.280]   They're actually have $18 in the bank.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.120]   They'll be out of business in four months time because if they follow that with a demonstration
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.000]   of the shiny, shiny new iPhone, they'll never know.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.240]   You know, whatever, remember whatever was said before it.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.560]   We haven't sold an iPod in six months.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.760]   It's all a sham.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:01.320]   We've been selling hostess pop cards in every single box.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.320]   I think that's a reasonable guess.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.040]   You've doubled the number of stickers in every box.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.800]   So people haven't complained yet, but hey, that's going to bite us in the butts soon
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   enough.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:14.440]   The real question, I look, you know, we know AT&T employees have been told to know vacations
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.520]   starting next week.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:21.280]   There's those mysterious new containers coming across the ocean.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:27.240]   I've heard from a number of people who have contacts at these Chinese and Japanese, well,
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:32.920]   I guess they're all Chinese companies that make electronics for the Apple company and
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.000]   they're telling me, oh, you know, they're those iPhones are in the country.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.760]   So I think it's very likely we'll be able to get them pretty quick, like maybe even Monday,
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.120]   which would be pretty cool.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:48.360]   The real question to me is, will there be anything else?
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.240]   Andy, will you think there's any any you're stupid?
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.480]   The one who's been lobbying for this tablet.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.520]   I really think it's definitely not.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.000]   There's no chance in hell that there's going to be a tablet.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Really?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.560]   That's for the next week when we say, hey, look, everyone's enjoyed the new Apple tablet.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.440]   The thing is that would be something that they would release if they're going to release
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.440]   it in 2008.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.560]   That would happen in November when it's time to start selling stuff for Christmas.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.040]   This is not a time to do anything that could sabotage the sales of a 3G iPhone because
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:20.040]   this is this is the time when they're trying to bring in all the people who wanted to buy
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.240]   an iPhone last year, but were scared off for one reason or another.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.200]   One of them being lack of 3G.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.360]   And if you basically tell them that, well, here's an option.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.680]   So please, if you had your if you had the 500 bucks in your pocket for the 3G iPhone,
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:39.160]   consider spending it on the $599 iPod touch tablet instead.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.040]   Or what if it's a 799 big iPhone?
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:49.040]   Let's make it like a 3D BB on the kernel of the B-style.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.640]   But just keep unfolding and unfolding until you get to walk through.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.680]   I'm also not convinced that at this point, they would know how exactly they want to market
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.200]   it and how they want to sell it.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.000]   This would be a great thing to show off in January when it's time to really dazzle people
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.840]   to something that they're not expecting and not really waiting to see.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.840]   They also need the time to get all the infrastructure for the application development ramped up even
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.840]   further.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.760]   Right now, people are designing for these small screens.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.600]   They need to find a way to tell people how to design for these larger screens.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.960]   As we've seen with the rollout for the development kit for the iPhone, Apple's willing to show
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.000]   its cards when it comes time to preparing all the developers for what they need to do
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.400]   as yet they have yet to show any demonstration of what a large screen iPhone touch application
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.480]   would work.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.280]   So that's another reason why I just don't think.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.440]   It's fun to speculate, but that's absolutely not on the boards.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.680]   I mean, what I find so funny about all the speculation is that at this point, even like
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:51.280]   tech blogs, even respected tech blogs are making announcements as though it's a given.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.280]   I mean, it's a given.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.280]   There's going to be a 3G iPhone.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.640]   We can be safe about that.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.880]   But a lot of people think that it's a given that's going to have GPS, a given that's going
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.360]   to have a different kind of 3G radio than we all think it's going to have and all this
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.360]   other sort of stuff.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.240]   I think the only given is a 3G iPhone sometime in June.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.600]   I just don't see any numbers or any evidence that people are producing to say that they
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.360]   know that it's going to be a GPS in there, for instance.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:18.080]   What about, here's a rumor that's been flying around and I give credit probably on this
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.680]   to a John Gruber and others, MobileMe.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:27.520]   This is the idea that they're going to rebrand.mac and call it MobileMe.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:36.680]   A lot of that comes simply from DNS filings and basically seeing which domain names have
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.960]   been registered and what Apple is doing with it.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:48.280]   There must be an order of monks out there who just like 500 years ago, they were willing
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.840]   to spend thousands of man hours per week illuminating manuscripts.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:56.840]   These people are willing to go bite by bite by bite into a hex belt.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.600]   Every single piece of code that Apple releases to find some sort of word that might tip things
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.600]   off.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:07.080]   The thing that they've figured out is that all references to .mac in Apple software have
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:12.680]   been replaced not necessarily with the Me service but basically with a placeholder so that
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.280]   on the fly, Apple can simply push a simple update that simply says replace this random
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:23.800]   token we've inserted with Me service or whatever sponge or whatever they want to call this
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.800]   new thing.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.520]   That's definitely interesting but it's also the sort of thing where it's a very consumer
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.960]   sort of service and they really want to make that announcement at WWDC.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.600]   Everyone's expecting an iPhone announcement.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.160]   If there is an iPhone announcement, is anybody going to pay attention to this on Monday?
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:45.400]   The one thing to think about is if I'm no expert on Steve Jobs but it seems to me that Steve
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.600]   Jobs is not a guy who's going to go guess what?
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.880]   Thing you kind of already knew, 3G without going and here's how you're going to use it.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.120]   You're going to give you 3G and you're going to need it because now you're going to be
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.840]   pulling down this amazing stuff.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:59.840]   You know what?
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.840]   You don't need a Mac to do this.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.840]   That's why we changed the name.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.400]   What would be new in Mobile Me, Merlin to make that name make sense and to make Steve
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.000]   be saying something of importance?
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Well I'll be that guy and reference something we talked about a while back in the post that
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.520]   I wrote talking about the possibilities of Mac that haven't been tapped and I think,
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.080]   you know, I don't know anything about any of the stuff all I know is what I read from
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.960]   John Gruber on the gray.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.680]   But I would know what I would say is if they put me in charge of that or brought me
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.880]   in with a whiteboard and said, "Tell us what to make."
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:36.600]   I would say, you know, bandwidth or no bandwidth, I think what you need to do is I think wireless
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.040]   sinking would be great.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   I think having more ways to be able to kind of like wire a thing.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.760]   That makes sense with an iPhone, sure, especially if I have high speeds.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.360]   And any kind of service where if we do get any of this location based stuff that people
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.960]   talk about, it would be pretty neat to figure out ways to leverage that.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.200]   We talked before about advertising, but I think there's a lot more to it than that.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.200]   Did you notice Andy?
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.320]   I don't know if you saw this, just a short rattle, but that wonderful reverse engineering
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.840]   site, I think it's called reverseengineeringreverseeverything.com, I think, has a great series on the
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.840]   Kindle.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.320]   And there's an undocumented feature in the Kindle where you can hit a button.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.640]   It's not working right now, but there's an undocumented key command you can hit and
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.480]   it'll find nearby gas stations.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.480]   Very much.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.480]   I've used that.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.480]   It's really cool.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.080]   Very much the kind of thing that I was talking with Scott about a couple weeks ago.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.360]   Anyway, long story short, I think what they do is they take the baby steps toward making
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.240]   .Mac the center of your digital world.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.520]   That's my fantasy anyway.
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:33.280]   And I see that being starting with, I don't have to sync my contacts over a quote wire.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.680]   And then there would also be--
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.480]   Basic basically, some kind of-- I'm one last thing.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:41.400]   Just a some way to have-- this is so simple and probably so hard because syncing is hard
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.400]   to begin with.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:49.000]   Somewhere in my .Mac, my iDisc area where I could put stuff that would get onto the phone
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   without having to sync.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.160]   A special folder that says iPhone.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:57.320]   Something somehow that lets me-- for me, and maybe I'm being Alex here and I'm telling
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.400]   you what I want rather than what the world's going to get.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.840]   But I would love to have my little folder of text files available on the phone.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.840]   That would be so huge for me.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.040]   So anyway, I guess I think it's something that takes the iPhone and makes it something
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:17.920]   that a normal, even non-Apple lover starts seeing as a way to think of Apple as being
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.080]   in this kind of web business for the first time in a long time.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.320]   Well for our iPhone users out there, there's already something-- there's already a way
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.320]   to do that.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.600]   If you get a subscription to box.net, you can actually just have-- it has a really nice
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.600]   iPhone interface.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.320]   So you can have just a folder on your desktop.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.320]   And every time you drag-- exactly.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:39.320]   Every time you drag a PDF, drag any file that is compatible with the iPhone browser.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.640]   And if you've bookmarked your box in the iPhone, you just tap it.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.640]   Here's a list of all your files.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.840]   Tap on the file and you can actually start reading it.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.800]   That's one of the many tidbits available in iPhone, fully loaded by Andy and NotGo.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.360]   Available at popular prices at Amazon and other places.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:59.160]   But yeah, I mean, I've always-- I'm now at the point where I have to sort of compress
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.560]   these long screens into one sentence.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:07.680]   I've always said that .max best implementation would be a way to project my experience from
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:12.080]   whatever computer is my main computer into any electronic device that I have.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:17.160]   So if they were to do that, I'm thinking of-- if the iPhone does have GPS, and if one
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.680]   part of this initiative is to make sure that every computer has a sense of where it was,
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.080]   that is also a really good tweak for security.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.160]   If I'm standing in front of just a random Mac at the Apple Store, I've always imagined
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:35.560]   this sort of thing working as where the iPhone would identify me simply by Bluetooth.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:41.720]   But if it could simply say, OK, if the iMac-- if iMac had the ability to ask .max, OK,
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.920]   there's this guy who's claiming he's Andy and NotGo, and he's claiming that he wants
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.760]   me to use back to my Mac from this terminal, should I trust him?
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:54.480]   .max can say, yeah, actually, Andy and NotGo's GPS says that he's about two feet away from
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.680]   you right now.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.080]   So at least unless he's stolen his iPhone and knows his password, then I'm guessing you
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.080]   can trust him.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.080]   Anything else--
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.160]   Anything else we're going to hear on Monday-- I know we've asked this now every show for
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.160]   the last three weeks.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.160]   There are a bunch of stuff.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.800]   One of the more interesting things is non-technical in nature.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:15.160]   I've heard a rumor that Apple is going to start offering incentives on the iPhone to
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.960]   new subscribers, where you can get 100 bucks off with a contract.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.480]   You can get 200 bucks off with a contract.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.840]   Which is interesting, because as you know, they're having trouble moving these things.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:32.760]   It sort of twists people's arm, you know, because there's a Motorola with a camera phone
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:36.640]   and Java, you know, that's available at the AT&T store.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.560]   Yeah, for $69, exactly.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.560]   Exactly.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.560]   So--
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:46.480]   Laptop Magazine declares Steve Jobs, the second most influential man in mobile technology.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.800]   And you're talking to number one, baby.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   Sorry, Steve.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.800]   After God.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.480]   Well, number one is Dan Hesse.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.480]   No, me.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.480]   Mm-hmm.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.160]   You got to know what he's doing.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.160]   Dan Hesse.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.160]   He's the--
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.160]   Citation, citation needed.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.160]   So, we're going to talk about the next step.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:28.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:52.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:14.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:21.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:28.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.160]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.

[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.160]   There are a couple of models I can't talk about that again.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:13.160]   You think about how close -- if you have an iPhone-ish scale,
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.160]   just like the MOS scale of hardness,
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.160]   how close to iPhone-ish does it have to be to get people to say,
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.160]   "You know what? This is close enough for me."
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.160]   Also, I like the idea of having a slide out mechanical keyboard.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.160]   I do like that.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   There are at least two or three that, again,
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.160]   they don't have the sort of experience that I want to have
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.160]   because it turns out that the iPhone is just about perfect for what I want.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.160]   But I could see a lot of people making that decision
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.160]   and thinking, "You know what? I've looked at both of these phones.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.160]   I don't see that much of a difference for what I want a phone to be.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.160]   This one is 149. This one is 399.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.160]   I'm going to walk out of here with some more money in my pocket."
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:54.160]   Another story that is gaining some traction about WWDC is what they call "Snow Leopard."
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:59.160]   OS 10 10.6, the first preview, according to the ultimate Apple web log,
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.160]   t-u-a-w.com.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:05.160]   Apple may be working to seed developers with an early build of 10.6
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.160]   at this year's conference.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:13.160]   Not any significant new features, unlike Leopard,
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.160]   but Apple is focusing solely on stability and security.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.160]   Stability would be great.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.160]   Just stability would be a good start.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:25.160]   I'm not worried about security right now, but the craziness that I love,
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.160]   Leopard, it's better than anything I've used before.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.160]   But there have been some crazy freezes and stuff.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.160]   I mean, this is the most unstable computer I've ever had.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:42.160]   According to t-u-a-w source, it will be a fully 64-bit clean Intel only OS 10.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.160]   I think they've been moving that direction for a while.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.160]   I mean, we've had a lot of bugs.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.160]   We're ending up with bugs with like Apple ProRes
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:53.160]   and other things that are only occurring on the power PC,
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.160]   the handful of power PC computers we still have here.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.160]   And so, you know, the Intel ones are fine.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:02.160]   So we have to actually view stuff and work on some stuff only on the Intel.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.160]   So I think that that's kind of a process that's already in the works.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:13.160]   I guess if you leave behind power PC, you can stop doing universal builds.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.160]   Right.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.160]   At some point.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.160]   That's got to increase stability in some ways.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.160]   So they have a poll on the site.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.160]   What will 10.6 be named?
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:26.160]   They've kind of run out, be honest, they've kind of run out of big cats.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:32.160]   So they're suggesting perhaps Garfield, Snow Leopard, Lynx, Lion, Felix, Cougar.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.160]   I don't think Cougar's going to work.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.160]   Civit.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.160]   Has there been a Puma?
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.160]   Has there been a...
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.160]   Yes, I believe the first OS 10 was Puma, was that?
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.160]   Yeah, I believe so.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.160]   10 or 10.1 was Puma.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.160]   These are called the Gear.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.160]   Another early one, wasn't it?
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.160]   Lynx?
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.160]   Yeah, I think Lynx is done.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.160]   Civit.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.160]   That was 10.2 with Panther, 10.0.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.160]   Is a Civit a feline?
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:02.160]   Is that cat that eats the coffee beans and then is done with the coffee beans?
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.160]   Well, it's also used in perfumes.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.160]   Civit's secretions.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.160]   As I substitute for whale vomit.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.160]   This is why you're a pro, Leo.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.160]   Well, you've got your amber-gris.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.160]   You're able to tone it down, you know, but then you know how to turn it down.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.160]   You're taking it down, and I really...
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.160]   So anyway, they do need a name.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.160]   Gruber is using Snow Leopard, I think that's not going to work.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.160]   Nah.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.160]   Nah.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.160]   Although they're very beautiful Snow Leopards.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.160]   I think Beguira.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.160]   Beguira.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.160]   Beguira.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.160]   Isn't that the cat from...
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.160]   Kipling, from...
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.160]   I like your Ricky Tiki Tavi to hear by the way.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.160]   He's got a Kipling root here.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.160]   Yeah, I like...
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.160]   I'm going to Kipling...
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.160]   I always walk up on a Kipling side of the bed.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.160]   He's one of my favorite writers, it sounds like a gerund.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.160]   Kipling, I've been Kipling all morning.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.160]   There's nothing better than eggs and Kipling's for breakfast.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.160]   There's just a better really old joke about that, and the punchline is, "Oh, dear gentlemen,
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.160]   how did you know that I kippled?"
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.160]   [laughter]
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.160]   Umm...
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.160]   Leopard.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.160]   This is hard.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.160]   This is hard work.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.160]   You've got a really look stuff up on Wikipedia.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:17.160]   I think you're going to see a lot of routine complaints, suggestions on complacing.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.160]   Obviously, you've not played a D20 edition of Dungeons & Dragons.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:26.160]   If you did, you would realize that a Squiffern is a half cat, half Link's, half Shine-era.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.160]   It has a plus 20 ability of Charismut.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.160]   Has a...
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.160]   Hey.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.160]   Somebody...
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:38.160]   Mr. Chin in the chat room is suggesting, I think, a good one, Saber-tooth.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.160]   Saber-tooth.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.160]   That's a kind of tiger.
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.160]   Yeah, well, it's a big cat.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.160]   It's an extinct big cat.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.160]   Yeah, that's...
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.160]   I think something from the fiend folio would be kind of badass.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.160]   Something from...
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.160]   The fiend folio.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.160]   I don't know.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.160]   In the Monster Manual, too, has something to do.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.160]   It's a DNA thing, Leo.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.160]   You wouldn't understand it.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.160]   I guess not.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.160]   Okay.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.160]   I'm trying to think of my name.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.160]   What's your name?
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.160]   I picked my name.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.160]   In the future, until Apple declares a code name, it's going to be Catwoman.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.160]   I was going to say that.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.160]   It's going to say Selena.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.160]   That's what I thought that was too nerdy.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.160]   It crunches up.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.000]   I'm talking about the current run of Catwoman, not like the...
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.520]   From the Michelle Pfeiffer movie, not from anything like that.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.160]   We're talking about the one who's trained with Batman, has Wayne technology.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.160]   Takes names to...
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.280]   It's just to be clear, though.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.360]   You're not saying words against the Michelle Pfeiffer Catwoman, though, right?
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:32.040]   I'm going to say the following words against the Michelle Pfeiffer Catwoman.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.040]   It's...
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.040]   She's silly.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.400]   She doesn't have the sort of combat edge.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.400]   She's really...
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:41.840]   She was directed by Joel Schumacher, which I think closes the entire argument.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.600]   I don't think I need to say another word after saying she was directed by Joel Schumacher.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.080]   No, I don't think you do either.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.280]   She squeaks when she walks.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.280]   You understand?
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.280]   She's adorable.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.280]   She's adorable.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.280]   She's so...
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.280]   She's so...
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.280]   She walks?
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.280]   What does that mean?
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.280]   Exactly.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.280]   She...
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.280]   The costume is made out of vinyl raincoat.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.280]   She leaves herself open to ambush.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.280]   No, you're right.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.280]   There's a lot of problems.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.280]   And I think the shoes don't work.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.280]   That just doesn't make sense.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.280]   It's not...
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.280]   It's not...
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.280]   It's not...
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.280]   You're kicking.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.520]   Selena Kyle, is that her name?
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.520]   Is that right?
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.520]   Yes.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.520]   Okay.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.520]   All right.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.520]   All right.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.520]   Unfortunately, go ahead and cue the music.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.200]   I don't know where to go here.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.520]   I'm completely at sea.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.400]   Have we come up with a name or did I miss...
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.400]   Did I miss that?
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.040]   Did we actually come up with a name?
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.040]   No.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.040]   We decided.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.040]   We've decided.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.040]   So, what the...
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.040]   The idea becomes true.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.040]   I was...
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.040]   I miss...
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.040]   Radho!
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.440]   Thank you.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.920]   I missed the beginning part where you said what the version was.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.920]   This is going to be...
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.920]   10.6.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.920]   For real...
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.560]   They're saying at WWDC we're going to see a 10.6.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.480]   No, we're going to see the first developer seeds.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.640]   It won't come out till next year.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.400]   I really hate looking at developer seeds.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.400]   How about thundercats?
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.400]   Thundercats.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.400]   Thundercats.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.400]   That's pretty good.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.960]   Thank you, Brian Lyle and the chatroom.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.960]   Thundercats.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:56.960]   I like it.
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.960]   I think we've got a winner.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:02.520]   Oh, if it's named after a Thundercat, I'm starting to look seriously at Windows 7.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.520]   Okay.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.360]   Let's see.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.400]   What other stories do we have in the Mac world?
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.800]   macOS Lion O for God's sakes.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   We will never...
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.040]   We're starting to get some of our cool back.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.960]   We would never live that down.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.600]   Australia getting its first Apple store in a couple of weeks, June 19.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.040]   The Sydney store opens.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.240]   They are very excited in Australia.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.440]   Apple has signed SoftBank, who actually used to own Zif Davis, which means they used to
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.520]   own ZD TV.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.200]   They're going to be the iPhone distributor in Japan.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.840]   So there are only a few countries left.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.040]   Japan was one.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.120]   I think China was the other.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.040]   They're in talks with China Mobile.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:53.440]   Apple also recently signed Hutchison Telecom, aka 3 for Hong Kong and Macau.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.680]   They're pretty close to getting worldwide distribution for the iPhone, and that's going
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.600]   to help getting to your 10 million.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.600]   Hello?
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.600]   Yeah, okay.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.600]   It's got very quiet in here.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.600]   Hello?
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.600]   Is this thing on?
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.520]   Are you there?
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.800]   Sometimes Skype does that, just hangs up.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.000]   And then sometimes I just put everybody's sleep.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   So sometimes...
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.160]   Yeah, sometimes I do that, and I do it on the regular phone, and I find out it's been
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.160]   15 minutes.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:25.800]   And eventually I just say I haven't gotten a compliment in a while.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.400]   I say, are you there?
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.240]   You haven't said anything nice about me lately?
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.600]   I used to do that with my mother, you see.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:36.360]   She'd be working away, and I'd be talking, and I would just stop talking mid-sentence
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.160]   to make sure she was still on.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.160]   You know, she was still listening.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:44.600]   And if she didn't ask me what I said, I just would just leave.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.080]   So I've learned that John Moltz has a podcast.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.320]   That's actually what's shocking me now.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.400]   He's a very funny man.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.920]   Technology whiskey sexy.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.280]   He's a brand new podcast.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.360]   He's a brand new podcast.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.720]   So now we really must get him on the show.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:04.640]   I sent him, I did him, I did him on the Twitter and told him of this potential offer.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.640]   Good.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.640]   Good.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.360]   Because he's a podcaster now, so it's official.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.360]   And I think he's very funny.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:14.480]   I mean, after lonely sandwich hot dogs ladies and Scott Simpson...
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.600]   No, lonely sandwich would be another great one.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.360]   He's the author of that amazing video of what copy and paste should look like on an
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.360]   iPhone.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.360]   That was him.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.360]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.360]   So he...
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   He's a hardcore.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.320]   And actually him and Alex could totally hang.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.120]   He just lives in Final Cut all day.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.120]   You know what?
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.120]   I want to get the...
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.120]   I think he's a big...
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.120]   I want to get Deepak on from the circuit.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.120]   Deepak Chopra?
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.120]   Oh, Deepak Chopra.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.120]   D'amap Chopra.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.120]   D'amap Chopra.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.120]   D'amap Chopra.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.120]   From the Mojo.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.120]   Or whatever.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.120]   That is a funny show.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.640]   The only thing is that I think that if he was on with Merlin, I think that there may
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.480]   be kind of one of those...
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.920]   It would just break down.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.040]   The whole thing would merge into some kind of...
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.520]   I don't like being on a show with me.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.520]   So...
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.480]   Can I bring up a potential?
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.360]   It sounds like you're looking for ideas here.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:58.360]   Can I bring up?
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.920]   Did anybody try the 10.5.3 sync with Google deal?
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.400]   What's your address?
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.400]   It has a sync with Google in it?
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.400]   This doesn't really be dull.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.400]   I was really excited.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.400]   I got the 10.5.3.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.400]   It came up.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.480]   I have not done a lot of due diligence about it.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.200]   I was excited because I was like, "Okay, great."
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:18.200]   You know, Google's a little bit weird about like very promiscuously adding people to your
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.200]   contact book that you don't necessarily want in there.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.720]   Like suddenly I discovered there's all these people who can see me online.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.080]   Is that because you've sent messages to them and so it just dies?
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.080]   I'm thinking...
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.080]   Yeah, I've got to put a map.
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.080]   I think that's what it does.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.080]   That's a Windows thing.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.800]   So I'm looking at the sharing tab now on my address book.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.320]   Does that mean I could share with Google?
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.320]   Oh, well, well.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.320]   Let me save you some trouble.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.320]   Uh-oh.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.320]   I'm just curious.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.320]   First of all, Andy, anybody else?
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.320]   Did you guys try this yet?
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.320]   No.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.320]   And I got a really ugly...
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.720]   You know the orange, spinny sync thing for you.Mac users where it's going to try and match
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.720]   stuff up?
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:53.800]   And I, it was trying to add 600 contacts and got confused and really bogged down.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:59.000]   And now as I'm surfing around, I'm looking at, I'm seeing here on Gizmodo, the headline,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.160]   Apple and Google combined forces to explode your address book.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.360]   All right, I'm doing it right now.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.360]   I don't care.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.280]   So before you do it back up, your first thing is...
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.200]   You know, the address book has a very easy, very handy backup.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.200]   Like I...
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.200]   A very easy...
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.200]   And you should do it.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.200]   Like all backup, you should do it every time you think of it.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.560]   And then you have these great...
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.560]   What is it?
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.560]   ABU or...
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.560]   ADR or something?
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.560]   And so you can always go back.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.560]   So let me do...
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.160]   Let me back up and then I will try this.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.360]   You know, I think any time you sync with another system, you're going to...
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.360]   It's going to be a mess.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.520]   I remember one of the first attempts at this that I got very excited about was I used to
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.800]   actually be a big Yahoo mail guy back in the early aughts.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.920]   And I was really excited when they came out with a conduit that would sync your palm
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.680]   contacts with your Yahoo contacts.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.640]   And I was so excited because I was living in Yahoo.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.360]   I'd really encouraged my entire team to start, you know, a little ahead of the curve trying
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:52.800]   to use all of our calendar and do it all on Yahoo, do everything in one place.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.120]   And man, that's the first time I think I heard for somebody to use the phrase "syncing
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:00.240]   is hard" because "syncing is really, really hard."
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.240]   It is hard.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.240]   And you give you the option.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.240]   They don't give you the option.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.960]   I wish they did to say, "I want to replace everything."
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.960]   You know, it's...
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:08.960]   It doesn't give you any options.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.960]   It's just going to sync.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:10.960]   Not Mac will do that.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:11.960]   Not Mac.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.240]   I mean, this is the sub-nuclear option.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.640]   The ultimate nuclear option you don't even want to have me describe to you.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.640]   Well, I'm a Yahoo too because I can do Yahoo too.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:21.800]   Well, if you're you doing Mac sync, you do have always the option of going to advanced
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.920]   in the preference pane and then saying "place."
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:24.920]   Oh, yes.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.400]   And I've done that like a thousand times.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.720]   Oh, no, it's become a hobby.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:28.720]   It's like, filatily for me.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:29.720]   I...
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.800]   Explain what it is that you do, Merlin, so that people know...
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.520]   Okay, so, "syncing is hard."
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.360]   That's step zero.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.480]   Step one is if things get really messed up, let's say for example you're like me and you've
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.840]   got a third Mac that you don't use all that much, but then you do turn it on one day,
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:48.000]   like weirds, capital W, capital S, weird stuff will happen and you get a lot of challenges.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.840]   You can get the dreaded three column panel where you have to sync between three different
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.840]   pieces.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.840]   Oh, yes.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.800]   That's when you know like there's a really good chance you might want at that point restore
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.800]   from your best copy.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.720]   So, but I would suggest is whatever your primary Mac is, do you make a point of however you
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.080]   do that, mose your what have you automatically back that up frequently?
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:10.400]   Do you a back up the minute you think of it and then you go to your Mac.Mac preference
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:18.920]   pane, go to advanced options under sync, fascinating, fascinating radio.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:24.200]   And then you'll have the option to say reset sync data and say either A, replace all of
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:28.440]   this stuff on .Mac with my computer's information or vice versa.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.560]   And if you've got a little time, you can actually do that any way you want with any
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:36.600]   of the various, you can do contacts, you can do bookmarks.
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.840]   And so anyway, it's the sub-nuclear option.
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:42.200]   The nuclear option is to destroy everything on every computer and start over from one
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.400]   good copy, which you will have to do this month probably.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.360]   Well, I just made it back up.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.640]   It did ask me on the Yahoo.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.080]   It said, do you want now, what do you want to do?
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.080]   You want to merge?
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.640]   You want to replace with this computer's copy?
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.040]   That's probably good for a first one.
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.040]   Replacing is probably not bad.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.600]   Yeah, I did emerge, which is the worst thing.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.880]   So I'm starting now with 489 contacts.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:01.400]   And that's how I know when it goes, you know, like to 12,000 contacts.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.600]   I know that something's gone wrong.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.040]   Well, and you know the funny one, if you're me and you go, oh, that didn't work right.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.480]   I better force quit and start again.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.480]   Oh, you know.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.040]   But I'm going to force quit again and start again.
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.760]   And you get, you know, you get 15-pede Alcorns.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:18.200]   Well, and the other thing that actually, there are 32-sink conflicts.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.200]   Oh, oh.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.880]   And that's the thing that happens that I really hate.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.080]   I don't mind if I have duplicate-pede Alcorns.
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:27.760]   What I hate is when somehow, and actually, I think the Apple is doing this, not these
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:31.280]   other ones, you get one person's name and another person's phone number.
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.240]   Because then you'll, that happens all the time and then I'll call somebody and it's
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.240]   the wrong person.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.240]   It's terrible.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.840]   Yeah, or it would say like, "Pulp library," and it's actually like my ex-wife or something.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.680]   Like, that's a word, you know.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.920]   Word, a word.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.280]   Is my pickup ready?
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.280]   Excuse me?
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.280]   Who is this?
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.080]   The tests in?
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.520]   Oh, I got the three pain.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:54.920]   I also get, do you get the one, do you do dot Mac Leo?
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.920]   Okay, so, a couple of things.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.560]   Are you, are you mean mobile me?
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.560]   Oh, no.
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.560]   Yeah, right.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.560]   Mobile me.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.840]   But do you get the one where it looks identical, like a male rule, will want to sink, and it
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.480]   looks totally identical?
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.480]   Have you ever gotten that?
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.480]   Yeah, I'm getting it right now.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.360]   These are exactly the same.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:13.520]   I'd wear this equals that and I'm like, "It's exactly the same."
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.040]   Yeah, why am I supposed to choose?
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.440]   Or the worst one when they don't match at all.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.200]   Did you get the outage?
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.800]   The last, have you had slowness and non-existence of dot Mac the last few days?
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.440]   No, has that been going on?
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.440]   Oh, God.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.440]   Really?
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.920]   Well, this is what made a second wave of predictions come out.
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:31.920]   Is because it was, you didn't hang.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.760]   It wasn't, it wasn't responding.
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:34.760]   It was not available.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.800]   You go to the website and nothing would come up.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:41.760]   All sync broke and you know, the best place you see this first is in male dot app, where
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.600]   it'll ask you for your password again for the dot Mac account.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.960]   Do you ever have that happen?
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.880]   And you go like, "Oh, it knows the password."
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:48.880]   Yes.
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:49.880]   Because it's down.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.320]   Hey, I found a really good fix, by the way.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.680]   I don't know if this has ever happened to anybody.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:44:00.040]   But if, for some reason, when one of my computers, it keeps asking me during the sync process
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.360]   to supply the password for a computer, a Mac I haven't used in years.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.480]   And it would be a really, really old password.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.560]   And I don't know what the password is.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:10.160]   I can't give it to it and it just comes up every five minutes.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:14.760]   So finally, I had a search I found on Apple's message board's a long terminal command that
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.680]   essentially resets the keychain sync parameters.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:22.120]   And you start from scratch, you're going to have to say a few allows additionally, but
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.280]   it got rid of that message, which has been plaguing me for months.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:29.560]   I had a very similar problem and I, it was driving me nuts.
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.960]   I was constantly, you get that pop up, you've got to constantly do.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:32.960]   Yes.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:33.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.440]   The other one, there's other stuff you can do.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.920]   I will probably get this wrong.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:41.280]   But I think one of them is to just double check what's in your login keychain.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.880]   But a lot of times the system go away to get what do you have for a second?
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.560]   I went from 489 context to 950 contexts.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.480]   That's a lot of people.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:50.480]   That's not good.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.480]   I'm going to Pete Alcorn.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.480]   I'm going to Pete Alcorn.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.480]   Let me see.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:54.480]   Because yeah, Pete is a good example of that.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.160]   I have three Kimberly quands.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.160]   Let's see.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.160]   No Pete Alcorn.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.160]   So it actually succeeded.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.160]   It got rid of all the Pete Alcorn entries.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.160]   Like Pete.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.160]   I'd miss him.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.000]   Let me see if I got any Merlin's in here.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   No, only one Merlin.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   So that's good.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.600]   I think there are a few duplicates, but not too bad.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.600]   And they're different emails.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.600]   So that's all right.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:15.600]   So you know what?
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.600]   I didn't.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.600]   That was a good tip.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:21.920]   I wonder who Misty 228739 is though.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.520]   Probably don't want to save that in my address.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:27.560]   So I really don't know about the whole like work home email.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:28.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.600]   Like getting the right kind of app-a-lage and for what that is.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.600]   Right.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.560]   Hey, we're going to get your tips in just a little bit as we continue.
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:42.280]   But I do want to absolutely mention our newest sponsored Drobo DROBO, which stands for Data
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.280]   Robotics.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:49.640]   It's the Drobo is the robot backup solution.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:53.560]   And we have a very special Mac break offer off for your Drobo.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:56.440]   Who wants to ask you Alex?
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.440]   Do you use Drobo's?
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.440]   I mean, that's do I.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:01.520]   You'd use a lot of Drobo's.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.080]   The main thing, what I'm doing right now, I mean, the process of at the moment is that
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:09.960]   I've got a, I've got one Drobo and I basically put all of my personal like everything.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.720]   Anything that's important to me is now all in one place.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.760]   And while I was doing it, you know, I thought, oh, two terabytes will be enough because it's
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:16.760]   not like video files.
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:18.160]   It's just my stuff, you know.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.880]   And so I started throwing it on and I immediately, you know, had to start replacing drives.
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.920]   And what was great is that I could just pull a drive out, throw another one in and then
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.920]   just keep on going.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:30.560]   I swapped the drives while I was copying, you know, and it was fine, you know, and so as
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.040]   far as I know.
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:35.040]   So anyway, the, so I've been putting all that stuff in and organizing it.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:38.920]   And then what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to sync this to another Drobo.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.600]   So have them both be the same.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:45.920]   And then I'll have one at the house and one at the home and the office and then have them
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.560]   our sinking back and forth.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.360]   And what for the over the internet?
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.600]   Yeah, lever overnight.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.440]   So I have to get them all to the same place.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:59.160]   Both are going to it now looks like I will have basically three terabytes of storage total
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:04.160]   when I when when the dust settles and in both of them, but it'll have all my movies, all
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:07.160]   my music, all my, but also all of my photos and all of my stuff.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.760]   And it's and it's backed up.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:12.800]   It's it's in two different places and it's in the Drobo because it's kind of this because
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.760]   everything, you know, the drives themselves are backed up.
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:21.240]   You really have as much security for the stuff that means something to you as you do.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.240]   I love Drobo.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:25.320]   So needs it's and it's so easy to use.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.240]   The advantage the other advantage of Drobo, unlike I say a RAID 5 network attached storage
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.480]   is you can take any SAT a drives you already have.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.080]   You don't have to match and you get available.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:38.560]   You get the, you know, it uses all of the drives instead of just saying, Oh, I'm going to
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.560]   take the lowest.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.120]   This is the smallest drive and we'll just multiply that by four.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.120]   So if you have a hundred sixty, a hundred and eighty, a two fifty and a five hundred,
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.120]   you put them all in it and it's additive.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:51.000]   Now it takes about what about a third quarter to a third for redundancy.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.680]   So you never lose anything.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.960]   But it also gives you a huge amount of storage.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:00.520]   And I love that, you know, they've got a little Drobo app that runs.
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.760]   It'll alert you if you get low.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.280]   There's an orange light will come on you have four green lights, which tell you the status
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.160]   of the Drobo drives when one goes orange.
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.520]   It means, Hey, we're starting to fill up replace this drive.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.960]   It's your smallest drive.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.640]   Yeah, it's super.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.880]   The thing for me is that I'm not, I don't, I'm very technical in some areas and this
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:18.520]   is not an area that I'm very committed to being technical in.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.520]   You know, I don't want to know.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.320]   All I know is that I wanted to work when I, you know, I just wanted to be backed up.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.320]   I want to know it's safe.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:24.320]   I don't want to know anything about raid fives.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.000]   I don't want to know anything about any of the, it's great.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   It just works.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.840]   Can I propose a combination of disclosure and experiment?
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.840]   Yes.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:36.120]   I was that guy, whatever a week or two ago and I hate being that guy, but I was that
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.400]   guy that let, let them know that I'd be interested in.
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:40.960]   Oh, you didn't really?
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:41.960]   Did you?
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.120]   And Scott Scott set me up.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.320]   So Scott talked to them.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.320]   Thank you, Scott.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:50.120]   So I will soon take incredibly generous ownership of a jury.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.120]   Well, I think that's fair.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.120]   You're doing that for us.
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:53.120]   No, it's, well, it's cheesy.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:55.120]   I don't want to be that guy, but it's, it's, I mean, I was something I really want.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.640]   My ready NAS took a dirt nap.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.880]   I have no, I remember ready NAS will not even power up.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:48:59.880]   Oh, that's bad.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.880]   It powers up late and then dies.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.880]   So like I've got a terabyte of stuff on there that I, I don't know if I'll ever see
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.880]   again.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:05.880]   Nothing gets ready NAS.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:09.440]   It could be pilot error, but anyway, I'm, so first of all, disclosure.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:12.040]   I'm getting free stuff very generously.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:17.240]   And second, I would be happy to share with you the way starting, you know, step zero
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.080]   and meeting with Mark, Mark, right?
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.560]   Yeah, Mark, yeah.
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:21.560]   Alex Mark, the Drobo dude.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.520]   And we're going to meet today and he's going to tell me what's great about the Drobo.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.520]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.520]   I'll be happy to share that with you guys.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.520]   Well, please do.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:27.520]   So here's the deal, the Drobo deal.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.520]   By the way, Drobo is DROBO.com.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.760]   It stands for data robotics.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:31.760]   That's the company.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.640]   It's very, the guy's really, is it Mark who invented this?
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.400]   It's very clever, really neat.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.920]   And if you've got a couple of people there that are putting it together, it's a little
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:39.920]   company though.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:40.920]   You think of it as like, oh, yes, Tynse.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.440]   It's making it, it's a couple of people that have, I mean, a handful of people that-
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.440]   They're just brilliant.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:50.000]   And so it's not this, you know, it's not something new from, you know, IBM or something.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.080]   It's a really cool, well thought out, you know, process.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:57.520]   Well, and they became famous when the inventor did a YouTube video and said, look, this
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.520]   is how it works.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:59.520]   Look, isn't this cool?
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.520]   And everybody went, wow, that's great.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.920]   There is a video now on their front page with Kelly Lewis that explains how it works.
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.440]   But here's the special deal we've got for you.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.640]   $50 off at time of purchase.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:11.800]   Now everybody else can get $50 off with a mail and rebate.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:16.000]   But if you use the, if you go to the special page, you'll get $50 off right away.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.840]   Now let's face it, nobody ever mails in a rebate check.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.760]   So this is a, this is a rebate you get at time of purchase.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.000]   A lot simpler.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.080]   DROBO.com/MacBreak.

[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:40.320]   And also Stu, Stu Mashworth said I went back and forth trying to figure out how you feel,
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.600]   the feeling that you have when all your stuff is.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:43.600]   It's a nice feeling.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.720]   Drobo and we've decided it's groovy.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:46.720]   It's groovy.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:47.720]   You feel very droovy.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.720]   Because you just know you're safe.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.600]   There's not, that's a really good way to put it.
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:53.800]   You just know you're safe.

[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:08.440]   So if you're listening to this show in September, I'm sorry, you missed the boat.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.080]   You ever do that when you get a comic book and you want to fill out the form and send
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.080]   something in?
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.080]   Have you ever wanted to do that?
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:17.360]   You get an old Richie Rich and you want to send in.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.360]   Have you ever ever...
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.800]   Still sell those X-Ray glasses for 50 cents?
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.800]   That's what I want to know.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:22.800]   Yes, sir.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.800]   I'm quite interested in your fart powder.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.600]   Please send just a dressing coat.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.440]   Here's my five cents.
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:32.320]   Ask your Merlin man.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.320]   The X-Ray specs.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.320]   That's the one with the lady walking by.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.320]   The lady walking by.
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.120]   And the guy's going, "Whoa!"
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:42.400]   Or Charles, that could definitely, you know, I'm constantly getting sand kicked in my face.
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.000]   That's the funnest part of the comic books is the old stuff.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   All right, let's get to our Mac picks of the week.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   I don't know.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   Did we cover all the news?
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   It seems like we've gone very quickly on this show.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   I think we've covered it though.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.120]   We actually might be under five hours this week.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.920]   I think next week we'll be busy.
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:51:59.920]   Oh, I know.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.240]   I just mentioned that Canada and the UK got iTunes movie rentals today.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.240]   Oh, nice.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.880]   I like to say it for our friends in the Canada and UK.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.320]   And now, so we get it for 24 hours.
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.080]   They get 48 hours.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.680]   So they're on Mac.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.880]   See, they're already learning.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:15.880]   It's metric time.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.360]   It's material hours.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:21.160]   I knew we were going to get screwed.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:24.280]   So it was worth waiting, England.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:28.840]   Movies for 20th Century Fox, Disney, Paramount, Warner Brothers, Universal, MBM, and Maple
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:32.680]   Pictures, which must be a Canadian thing.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:37.640]   All the goodness of Maple in every movie.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:43.800]   And in the UK, they get Disney, Paramount, Warner Brothers, MGM, Lionsgate, UK, and Sony.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:44.800]   Price is a little higher.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:51.160]   They're going to pay a little more in the Canada 499 for a movie, 1999 to buy it.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:54.360]   Well, they do have the earlier harvest up there.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.360]   That's right.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:57.640]   It's the crisp winters.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.400]   They spend more time in bed in Canada.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.400]   So that's good.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.960]   Yeah, I'm very happy for our Canadian friends.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.960]   I feel that's a...
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:11.320]   Because I got to tell you, I stopped going up there now, but going up there every month
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:15.280]   as I did for several years, they feel really left behind.
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.760]   They can't get the books.
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:17.760]   It's ridiculous.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:21.400]   I mean, once you meet the Canadians and you visit with them, you realize they're very
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.400]   much like us.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.400]   There's not that much difference.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.400]   I mean, sure they have the...
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:27.600]   They're not good for us because it's...
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:28.600]   Less violent up there.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.080]   They have better health care, so they do live longer.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.840]   But what kind of a life is that going to be?
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:34.840]   Exactly.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:39.480]   Well, we died bleeding in the streets, stabbed to death by school children at age 53, 54
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.400]   at the latest, but damn it, we live life.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:44.080]   We live it because we can rent movies on iTunes.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:45.360]   And I think that that's really...
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.680]   That gap has been closed.
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:50.840]   That in the softwood agreements.
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:51.840]   I fix it.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.080]   I don't know why somebody sent me this.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:58.480]   I fix it, Mac and iPod parts and upgrades.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.880]   Oh, that's kind of neat.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:01.880]   These are...
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:05.200]   This is apparently not an authorized Apple repair service otherwise they wouldn't be
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.960]   actually able to fix anything.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.400]   Can I ask a question since we got some time?
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.880]   Did you install your ATV stick?
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:13.880]   I did.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:14.880]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:15.880]   I knew I had something to talk about.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.880]   Because you know, I went out and ordered one.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:18.880]   And then they cancelled you ordered, didn't they?
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.880]   They cancelled, but now they made it a download.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:21.880]   They're back.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:22.880]   They're back.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:23.880]   But I'm just curious.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.120]   I installed it.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.120]   I rebooted it.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:27.120]   Show.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.120]   So yes, effect.
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:29.520]   So was that my pick last week?
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.520]   What?
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.520]   If you remember, sir, it was.
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.520]   So I think I had already done it.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:34.640]   I wouldn't pick it if I hadn't already done it.
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:35.640]   Let me give you an update.
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.040]   Oh, I do have an update for you.
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.080]   Because you asked Merlin if the MKV files would play.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:44.600]   And it does in fact say it supports MKV not well.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.520]   I've ended up...
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:51.480]   Every time I try to play an MKV, it starts, it stutters, and then the Apple TV crashes.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.080]   I think it's not enough horsepower.
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:56.080]   Well, you're talking MKVs, especially if you're doing 1080.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:57.720]   Sorry to use your term there, Alex.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:01.640]   If you're using 1080i movies, that's one of the things.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:04.040]   Maybe it's the particular files I'm getting.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:05.040]   That could be.
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.040]   I only tried it with two or threes.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.520]   But then, so I just visual hub them.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:09.520]   Everything else plays great.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:13.640]   I'm loving Sapphire, which is you have actually several choices in the EA.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:16.400]   And I presume that the stick that they're offering for download works pretty much the
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.720]   same.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:18.720]   I don't know what they said.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:23.080]   There was some file in there that there was debate about whether it was freely distributable.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.120]   I imagine a file from Apple.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.240]   The patch stick, which is the open source version of this, and by the way, you can do
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.280]   this for free with patch stick.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.880]   But you need a tiger disk.
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.120]   Well, that's funny because it's funny to say that.
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:38.280]   I don't know if this is how it was before, but the last chapter of this story is I have
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.680]   had no luck installing it.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:43.080]   But the first chapter is when you do the install and you run some units commands, it
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.080]   does...
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.520]   The command that you're running from the shell is create patch stick.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.520]   So I'm wondering.
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.520]   So it really is open.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.840]   Yeah, I'm assuming.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:52.840]   So, okay.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:53.840]   So mine...
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:54.840]   Oh, so I didn't know you got one.
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.880]   Well, I bought it, but then they canceled my order because they stopped doing it.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:01.520]   And then a couple days later, I saw that it was available for download and I bought it
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.520]   and I've had no luck burning it.
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:04.240]   I don't know if my drive's too big.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:05.240]   What?
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.240]   But...
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:07.240]   Try putting it on a flash drive.
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:08.240]   I did.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.240]   No, I was dead on a USB drive.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.040]   I spent half a day trying to do it.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.800]   So I'm going to borrow one.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.520]   So it's applecorellc.com.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:17.360]   Well, since you already bought it, I'll send you mine.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.360]   Because I have the original one.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.360]   It worked flawlessly.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:24.200]   You put the USB key in the Apple TV.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.920]   First you reset the Apple TV.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:27.920]   Well, but they also...
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.480]   And maybe they didn't tell you this.
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:31.400]   You want to restore it to original factory condition.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.800]   Yeah, I did restore and then update.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:33.800]   And then you full update.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:36.960]   So you basically have a clean version to Apple TV.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.280]   Power it down, put the stick in, power it up.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.280]   It boots up.
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:44.680]   As you say, it runs all these Unix commands, which is essentially what I think patch stick
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:45.680]   does.
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:49.880]   And then you power it down again and take out the stick and power it up.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:50.880]   And it installs.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:53.520]   So the first command set up the install.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.200]   You take the stick out, everything's on the drive.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.560]   It does the install.
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:58.720]   It worked flawlessly for me.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:04.000]   Sapphire, which is one of the programs it puts on there, it does something really cool.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.680]   Not that I would do this, but if you download video from the internet, whether BitTorrent
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:13.040]   or news groups or something, it comes kind of in an oddball way.
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:15.040]   It's not the names aren't there.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.240]   There's no meta file information, meta tags.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:19.680]   This Sapphire goes out of coast IMDB.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:24.480]   It gets all of the, it can tell from the file name, it says, oh, is this the wire episode
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.000]   series, season five?
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.640]   And you say, yeah.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:32.160]   And it not only does it populate it with images, it does show descriptions.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.520]   You can turn off the spoilers.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.000]   You can say no spoilers.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.080]   Otherwise, it gives you a full show description.
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:39.080]   Who was in it?
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:42.240]   It tells you everything, it's so much more complete than what you get from the iTunes
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.600]   store.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   It divides them up.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.600]   I was spending a lot of time kind of renaming.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.600]   You do that for an episode.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:52.960]   Like if so, you do the conventional, I understand where you do like name dot whatever and whatever.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:56.960]   Apparently it knows the convention or at least it can deduce enough from the thing.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.480]   Sometimes it'll say, okay, well, what show is this?
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.280]   And you have to pick from IMDB's list.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:06.000]   But once you pick, it makes folders, it renames the, you know, puts in the meta file data.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:10.240]   I don't know if it renames it, but it gives you, it puts it so that it looks incredible.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.920]   It's like what you would have done if you were really, you know, anal retentive and wanted
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.920]   it to be just so.
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:16.720]   It was a great job.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:17.720]   Did you do that?
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:21.840]   There's one service where you can go and it's, I am talking on my butt, but it's like a hulu
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.800]   type thing where you can go and watch movies.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:25.560]   Is there something like that?
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:26.560]   Yes.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:28.800]   And we talked a little bit about that because all the movies are indie movies and there's
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:29.800]   a lot of.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.800]   But you get Bollywood.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:31.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:32.800]   I can't remember the name of it.
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:33.800]   That's one of the things on there.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:36.520]   So I'm not sure why it's not working for you, but yeah, Apple core.
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:38.640]   It still feels like an Apple TV.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:39.640]   Love it.
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.360]   It's all still there.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:44.120]   It's made my Apple TV much more functional.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:46.400]   I have RSS feeds out of the, I can subscribe to.
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:50.560]   I can, it's really basically I stick with Sapphire though, because it's what it does mostly
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:55.000]   for me is it kind of organizes all those disparate files that we're not.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.840]   So that's, yeah, that's an update on that.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:00.520]   The day after I recommended it last week, they pulled it off the market and canceled
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:02.840]   everybody's orders, including Merlin's.
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:03.840]   But one week later.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.200]   I did pay for it for the downlets.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.280]   So if I do borrow somebody's stick, I won't feel too bad.
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:09.360]   Yeah, I'll send you mine.
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:11.920]   I mean, I presume it's the same thing.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:16.160]   And then if you really don't want to pay for it, it's 60 bucks.
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:17.160]   You can get the.
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:20.320]   Awkward TV has all this stuff on their way.
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:21.320]   That's the patch stick.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.720]   And it's, you know, if you look at, if you, you can actually just Google patch stick,
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:27.200]   you'll find awkward TV.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.160]   If you go, it look at the instructions.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.240]   To me, it's exactly what I was talking about last week.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:36.080]   Oh, another update.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.080]   Boca.
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:38.560]   Andy, do you want to address this?
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:39.560]   I feel terrible.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:40.560]   Oh, no.
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:41.560]   You don't want to say a word?
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:49.760]   So, and I'll tell you, let me explain why.
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:51.600]   I'm desperately thirsty.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:55.520]   I've been looking at this bagel for the past.
[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:56.520]   Go ahead.
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:57.520]   Shout out.
[00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:58.520]   I'll read the emails.
[00:59:58.520 --> 00:59:59.520]   I'll read the email.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.520]   That's from Oliver Wagner.
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.240]   He says, hi, Andy.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:06.440]   First of all, I want to say thanks for making Boca your Mac pick of the week.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.240]   Second, I heard Leo's comments about Boca today.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.320]   And I just want to clarify a few things.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.620]   This is the, you know, just for the folks who missed last year, you were, you were
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:19.160]   barking about paying 17 bucks, right?
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.160]   I was, I was, that was my pick of the week.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:26.080]   I said there was a wonderful, wonderful suite application because I'm a supporter of independent
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.560]   developers, wherever they are.
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.160]   Well, I buy a lot of shareware.
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.160]   Unlike Rita.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.440]   I buy a lot of shareware.
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.240]   I pay for every piece of shareware.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:40.320]   But having written software myself and distribute, I never charged for any of my software.
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.320]   It was always free.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.320]   This was when I was a young man.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.800]   I'd still have brain cells, but it was always free and always open source.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.840]   I would give away the source before there was such a thing.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.160]   That's how long ago that was.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.440]   So you know, I know a little bit about this stuff.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.480]   And sometimes I look at the software like this and I say, you know what?
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.040]   That's a Unix command.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:02.160]   They're just wrapping a Unix command in a cocoa interface and calling it a day.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.040]   And I don't want to pay 17 bucks for that.
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:09.160]   So he says, no, he says, maybe you could forward this to Leo, which, but Jandy did.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.840]   No, Boca is not an Apple script, though we have put in the effort to make it Apple
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:18.560]   scriptable, which I know is non trivial.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:22.000]   How it competes with nice, that nice is the program that I suggested you could probably
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.040]   just use nicer, nice.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:28.360]   This was useful when the default system scheduler wasn't as advanced as it is now, but you'll
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:32.160]   find it doesn't do much more than always 10 does already.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.920]   Boca does not use nice.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.440]   It sends pause signals.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.040]   And by the way, in order to do that, you have to write a C program.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:45.120]   I know that also Boca is a fancy front for the terminal and brings functionality users
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:49.360]   who might not know how to use Unix or would just rather to click a button, prefer automation
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.640]   and like streamlined integration into their daily computing experience.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:57.680]   So I guess he's kind of saying, you know, it is a terminal.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.320]   You could do this in a terminal, but we've made it.
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.720]   But yeah, I mean, the thing is, let's be honest, what is visual hub?
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.800]   Yeah, visual hub is that right.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:04.800]   Right.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.400]   Have you ever tried to use as an FFmpeg from the terminal?
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.400]   Oh, I've used it.
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.960]   Do you know how many flags?
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.320]   You know how many Alex will tell you, do you know how many flags there are for FFmpeg?
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:17.920]   Like I, I have to say, but no, but I would have to come to.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:23.800]   But no, I have used FFmpeg and I've even written bash scripts to incorporate it into workflow
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:24.800]   and everything.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.080]   So yeah, I'm familiar with all that.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.840]   And there's absolutely times when I don't want to do that.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.320]   And I think actually, patch stick is a very good example.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:39.560]   You could do exactly what the ATV does with yourself for free for patch stick.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:43.160]   And after looking at all the stuff I'd had to do and how easy it would be to mistype
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:47.400]   one thing and get it all wrong and hose my Apple TV, I decided I'm going to buy.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:54.320]   I'm going to spend 60 bucks on what is also a repackaging of a simple Unix bunch of Unix
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.320]   commands.
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.560]   I mean, you can't really just say it's a repackaging because Boca, he had to think of
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.840]   a way to make it useful to make it to make it a really important.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:03.840]   Oh, no, I was talking about patch stick.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.840]   I agree with you.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:08.200]   I'm saying it in general when you talk about stuff like that.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:12.240]   I mean, I tend in general, unless it's just your typical, you can always tell when something
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.000]   is just a simple Apple script studio project.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.040]   Because you can see it's just a simple set of popups, a simple button.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.080]   You can see this just pulling a command line and that's it.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:25.240]   But when you see a really well done app, like the ones we've been talking about, it's more
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:29.600]   like those change machines outside the supermarket that count your money, but they could charge
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:30.800]   you eight or nine percent.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.800]   Right.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.000]   They withhold eight or nine percent as a fee.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.880]   And yeah, it kind of sucks that you're spending, you know, you're dumping in $100 and you're
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.800]   only getting $91 back.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:43.640]   But then I think how much would I charge one of the kids in my street to count this big
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.080]   jar full of change, roll them up, put labels on them, let them back.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.080]   So I would give them $9 for that.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.880]   That's a good user interface for the problem.
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.800]   That's an excellent, excellent point.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.480]   So I will pay for Boca right after this show.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:00.240]   And actually, Merlin, I'd like to hear an update on what's going on with your ATV.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.000]   I mean, if there's, if there's, if that can't make that work.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.840]   No, I mean, my friend, gosh, what is his real name?
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:09.200]   He's Louis O'Matte on LDU, M-A-T on the Twitter.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:13.560]   He, I was kind of watching him as he was live, Twittering his progress on it.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.240]   And I was like, oh my gosh, I didn't even know this thing existed.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.240]   So I went and I got it.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.080]   And it's, it's not, I mean, if you know, if you know a little bit of command line stuff,
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.080]   it's not hard.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.080]   You can copy and paste terms.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.160]   I mean, it's easier, easier than installing Drupal.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:31.400]   And you just basically, you CD in to this directory and then you, you run this thing,
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.560]   you know, from a, a sudo, this command.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.560]   And I got it.
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:35.560]   I created the thing.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.640]   It's just not booting for me.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.960]   So now that I'm that guy, and I officially am a loser who asks people for help.
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.560]   If anybody knows any reason why I would create a disc, but it wouldn't then boot.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.560]   That's interesting.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.560]   Yeah.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.860]   Cause that's, I didn't even know that you could do that on an Apple TV, that you could put
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:50.760]   something in that USB port and it would boot.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.120]   That's pretty, I thought the USB that I thought it wasn't connected.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.120]   Didn't I?
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.120]   I did.
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.120]   I know it to me too.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.120]   I thought I was, I thought it was ornamental.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:01.480]   Somebody keeps asking me a number of people ask me, can you put an extra hard drive in
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.960]   that USB port and then have the Apple TV see it?
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.920]   And I don't think you can.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.920]   I don't think that this allows that to do that.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.280]   Do you know what you're thinking about Andy?
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.680]   I think that's going to be a non-addressible, a fluegle port probably that's going to have
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.440]   a lot of your shninking on the flipping.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.720]   Do you, is that, cause I really, if you want to get that thing enabled, you're going to
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:19.240]   have to flip the bit on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:24.480]   the problem with having a free, repolarating dingle arm is sinusoidal, or plantaration.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.480]   You always have to mount it.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.400]   You have to isolate it by putting on a base plate, usually of amylite, but if it's amylite,
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.400]   it has to be pre-framing.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.400]   And it makes, it makes a lot of heat.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:34.080]   You got to make sure not to touch the snickety, it's not.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:38.360]   And if you touch the stickety, you're going to get a watch, I'm going to call it.
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:40.680]   I think he's not that that's a candy from my childhood.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:41.680]   I think.
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.560]   Well, it's, it's also a very important connector inside of your,
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.120]   it hooks up to the Johnson.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:48.920]   Know that the clip will be Clinton administration's EPA director, Bass,
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.360]   Nickney, start from domestic use.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:53.240]   You can still export it, but you cannot sell it domestically.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.240]   That's still true.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.400]   I think they still make it in the Philippines.
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.160]   I'm surprised you don't already know that.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:03.120]   If you were following the, yeah, the Snickety's not user group, you would know that this
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:06.040]   was no longer an issue.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.880]   But you're, they never, they've never made me like that.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:12.840]   I would say to learn that you're disseminating a well-known.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:16.680]   You're Mr. Lin say.
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:19.440]   Please let me know when I look forward to.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:22.280]   He's been saying things that are wrong.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.880]   I expect it to be credited with the correction.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:28.520]   You know, I just think it's a whole lot of environmentalists who just, just don't understand
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:29.520]   Snickety's not.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.520]   I think that's really the problem.
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.520]   But it's lonely guy.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.000]   All right.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.840]   We are going to get to our picks in just a second.
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:35.840]   But before we do that.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.000]   We're going to podcast today, aren't we?
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   No, not at all.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   Let me start.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   Let's start the show.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   What do you say?
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.500]   Rolling through.
[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:45.320]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:48.240]   You could just disregard the last hour and a half.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.720]   That portion of your life now is officially gone and lost.
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.920]   The only already have.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:55.720]   We're going to get to our picks in just a second, but it is time to mention our great
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.960]   friends at audible.com, audible.com/macbreakweekly.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:03.080]   These are the folks that give us the incredible audio books.
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:07.480]   Andy, did you get any feedback on your God delusion rant last week?
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.480]   Rant?
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:11.640]   It was a very seasoned, very rational story.
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.640]   Very deliberate.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:19.400]   I got a lot of people who I was very pleased with the feedback that I got.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:24.800]   It pleased me that I got one or two emails from people saying, "You know, atheists like
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.360]   you will never understand."
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:31.440]   I got just as many one or two emails from people saying, "The problem is that you're
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:36.480]   irrational because you still believe in this deluded idea of a giant invisible friend in
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.040]   the sky who gives you presence."
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.960]   By far the most, I got 30, 40 emails.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:46.960]   Most of them were just from people saying, "Gee, I'm glad to see that you're recommending
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.440]   the book, even though you agree or disagree with it.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:53.920]   I think the general consensus of the people who emailed me were that it's a great crucible
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.920]   for discussion.
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:58.600]   Yeah, it's not there simply to tell you that you're right or to tell you that you're wrong.
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:01.760]   It's a good thing for you to bounce your own beliefs off of."
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:06.560]   And as I said, I do recommend it because it is a really good process.
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.560]   It really does get you thinking about how you believe and why you believe.
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:10.560]   I think it's fascinating.
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:14.200]   Part of the problem is that I think like the mid-east, people don't realize you're talking
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.480]   about religion if you're not screening.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:19.200]   And so I think it was deceptive in that sense.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:20.200]   Or singing.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.200]   Or singing.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:24.840]   If you were having a very measured discussion about a topic that's volatile, it's really
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.360]   a wild but very interesting.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:29.680]   So are we going to recommend the portable atheist this week?
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:33.760]   I've been a recommendable called Everybody's Wrong but Me.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.960]   I read it.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:41.240]   The best presumptive book was actually suggested in a Charles Schulz peanut strip, which is
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:45.400]   a book called, "Has it ever occurred to you that you might be wrong?"
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:46.400]   It's never.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:49.040]   I would spend $24.95 for that book.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.320]   That's an author who's definitely got something going on.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.920]   Whereas the Fire Sign Theater once said, "Everything you know is wrong."
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:09:00.440]   You can, by the way, if you are a believer, if you're a Christian believer, I should say.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:05.720]   Actually, I think probably almost every religion, you can get these great books on audible.com.
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.920]   They have an unabridged Bible, read by, "Are you ready for this?"
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:09.920]   Gregory Peck.
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:10.920]   That's good.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:11.920]   That would be good.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:12.920]   Let's hear it.
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:13.920]   I got to play.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:15.920]   I got to play a lot of this.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:16.920]   Gregory Peck reading the Bible.
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:17.920]   Oh, no.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.920]   Oh, no.
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:24.400]   I could have left the horns at.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.360]   Sounds like an episode of "Davy and Goliath" now.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:28.360]   I'm afraid it's...
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:29.360]   The Bible.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:30.360]   The New Testament.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.360]   Get to the Gregory Peck part.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.360]   Performed by Gregory Peck.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.360]   I'm getting all those durbs.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:41.000]   And then it got said, "Look, they're being white."
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   And it was still dark, but now you could see it.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.520]   I think this would be worth getting, though, really.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:52.200]   Just to be a graven image.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:56.720]   The Gospel according to St. Matthew, chapter 1.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.960]   The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.160]   Oh, no, no.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.160]   Now we're not laughing at the Bible, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.160]   No, no, no.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.160]   No letters.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.160]   We could get...
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.160]   If we could get Charlton Heston reading it, I would totally, or Chormak Lourine.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.480]   I would totally do.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:15.480]   I think Gregory Peck's like the next best thing.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.480]   We do have...
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.400]   Okay, all right.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.160]   You don't want Gregory Peck.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:23.760]   There are actually, believe it or not, Audible.com.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.840]   There are choices for everyone.
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.840]   How about, do they have Studs Turkel?
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:29.840]   That one.
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.680]   I really enjoyed your fat bae.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:33.840]   We got Fred Deckady.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.560]   Abraham, we got Isaac.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.080]   Let me add this is James Earl Jones.
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.080]   I interviewed Isaac.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.880]   Here is your ex from that interview.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:40.880]   I was 75 with John.
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:41.880]   Wait a minute.
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.880]   Listen, James Earl Jones.
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.880]   When Herod the King had heard these things, he was troubled.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:48.280]   And all truths were in him.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:51.480]   They could leave the cheesy music out of the background.
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:52.480]   That's too bad.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.880]   It's got piano in the butt.
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:54.880]   This is Genesis.
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.080]   I wonder if he does...
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.080]   Oh, God.
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.880]   Let's see.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:00.880]   There's many choices.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.880]   There's many choices.
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.880]   That's one part.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:03.880]   I think it might be in the...
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.680]   He spends 40 days in the desert and meets Darth Vader.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.440]   All right.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:14.200]   So we're going to just recommend, you know, if you want the Bible, there are a lot of
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.960]   different ways you could listen to this.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.960]   Just this is...
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:17.960]   This is...
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:18.960]   You're recommending the Bible.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.960]   Is that the recommendation?
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:20.960]   The Bible is my recommendation.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:21.960]   But the...
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:22.960]   Look, here's the point.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:23.960]   How many times have you...
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.960]   Let's have the Bible benefit from that Mac Break Weekly bump.
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:27.960]   You know, it doesn't...
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.240]   Because it doesn't sell that well here.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.240]   I hear the...
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.080]   You're fine, the Bible, you know.
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.080]   There's Oprah.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.680]   There's a Colbert report.
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.080]   And then there's Mac Break Weekly.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.200]   You'll want to get us to talk about that book.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.000]   If you can get on it, that's the deal.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   Audible.com.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   Yeah, you know, okay.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   I'm going to recommend it.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   The Bible.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   I'm going to repeat.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   I'm going to be more specific.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   I'm going to repeat.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   Okay.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   Here's the only thing I have to say about the...
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   Wait a minute.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   Merlin, go ahead.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   I'm going to repeat my recommendation from...
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   You look nice today.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   If you're going to go with the gospel, John.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   John's a good gospel.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   John's a good gospel.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   I think that's the go-to gospel.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   The thing I have to say...
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   I like Mark.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   I'd be honest with you, Mark's, I think, my favorite.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   Mark was a physician.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   Is that right?
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   He was a doctor.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   There's that Luke.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   Luke was a doctor.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   I want to go with one of the Coptic Gospels.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   But what I'm really interested in finding out about is the legendary missing gospel.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   Because the way that these Gospels were written, there's a theory that there's one common source that all the apostles were reading and commenting from.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   So the one big canonical gospel is supposedly out there in a pot somewhere in the desert waiting to be found.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   Wow, really?
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   I didn't know that.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   I'm not a Bible talk with Leo and Leo and Ian Marnell.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   But it's cool because they're trying to figure out in what series were these...
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   These are supposedly the eyewitness accounts of Jesus's life.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   Let's try to figure out...
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   The theory is that one guy wrote the first gospel and then passed it around and then Gajama would say,
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   "Well, no, actually it wasn't like this.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   It was more like this."
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   Because one of them is very, very journalistic.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   Here's what happened.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   Here's what happened.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   Here's what happened to what sequence.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   Mother is more lyrical.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   Here's what people were thinking.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000]   It gets more and more lyrical as the gospels progress.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   One theory is that, again, it was written in a specific order because people were reacting to the journalistic version.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   I know this theory.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   I actually had a note to read more about it because it seems more interesting.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   You have the idea on the Jesus Seminar version of the gospels because this is a group of all different historians.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   Yes, yes, that's right.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   That's a fascinating book.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   The idea is, you've seen, for example, red letter editions of the Bible where all the Jesus' words are in red.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   The Jesus Seminar goes through and based on their...
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   They sat down and they really talked about the gospels.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   Their highlighting system, if memory serves, is we're almost positive.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   There's almost no doubt that Jesus said this and that's in this color.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   If there's a pretty good chance that Jesus said this in a different color.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000]   Am I getting this right, Andy?
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   Then there's like...
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   He probably didn't say that in a different color and then there's like no way in hell did he ever say this.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   From what I understand a lot of that had to do with the thing that's probably the most accurate of all the things in the New Testament is actually what he said.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   All the stuff in between.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   It's commentary.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   A little less sure of.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   But they said it's probably somebody's.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   There was somebody there who said those things.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   Describe it, scratch, stuck it in or something.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   Yes, and I should mention, by the way, not just the Bible, but all the holy books are available on Audible.com.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   I think a great way to listen.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   It's really worth going through.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   The one thing to be careful of is that a lot of times you went to Sunday school and you had a certain view of the Bible.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   The Bible is really something that's closer to PG-13 maybe or even are in places rather than the G version that we got.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   If you actually read the entire thing, and there's some clips I won't talk about on here,
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   but there's my favorite thing from the entire Bible is in Judges where you have an after-ehood came Shamgar who killed 600 Philistines with an ox code.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   He too saved Israel.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]   And then it just goes on to the next one.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   He also, he was there.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   He got a life something for the sequel.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   You got to keep them coming back.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   But it was so funny.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   You had this long thing about a judge and then you have this short thing where you have, you know,
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   You've got to talk about them.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   I mean, the guy killed 600 people in ox code.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   A lot of people get a really idea because they all they know is the Cinemaxes version of Esther after dark,
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   which is not completely distributed to original text.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   All right.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   All right.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   The same.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   It's the same reason why they put Samuel L. Jackson and Iron Man to get you that hook for that means that I have to go.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   Hey, by the way, thank you for telling me to stick around through the credits.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   Go.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   I had no idea.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   I mean, I'm sitting there and it's not like, wait a minute.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]   Let me finish the ad and then we're going to talk about that.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   I guess exactly.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   Money in.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   Money in.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   This is why these ads end up being eight minutes long.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000]   It's not because the ad is eight minutes long.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   It's just spread throughout a variety of rentals.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   Your best media by dollar, ladies and gentlemen, is ads based on Mac.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   That gets true.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   If you can, you know, if you could tolerate the stuff in between.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   So we do, you know, there's a lot of obviously there's a lot of great stuff.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   What's great about Audible is, and you could see this in the panel, we love ideas and it's, that's what it is.

[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000]   Hey.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000]   So, I just, I literally signed up last week.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   No, that's good.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   Just send me your sign ups because I know you're all members already and Audible says we'll comp all of them.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   Audible, dude.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   Audible, dude.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   69.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   Can I say something to any executives at Audible who might be listening?
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000]   Number one, thanks so much because I'm going to abuse the hell out of this.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   I want to tell you the story about when Mac user gave me a free, uh, copy server account.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   And, and I, and my first question was.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   You found the, you found the Betty Page room.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   No, no, no, I'm just, I had a conversation with the system in and I said, oh, well, how much, what's my monthly budget per month?
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   And he said, oh, well, for God's sake, you know, it's, we, we got so much money around here.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   You know, it's, we, we got a great deal with them.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   We exchange their content.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   It's almost virtually impossible for you to spend so much money that they get a flight.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   And two months later, I got it.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   You know, we'd like you to keep it under $2,000 if you can.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   You know, I have my first free copy server account.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   I discovered colossal cave and I was on that 300 bod modem.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   I had acoustic coupler and I was on that thing probably eight hours a day exploring colossal.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   The phone, like, where you put the phone in?
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   Rubber cups.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   You dial, you would dial the phone with, you know, you'd hold up the phone, you dial it.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.000]   And then you go, and you jam it in the coupler.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   And then you could be on and play colossal cave.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   You are in an alley.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   Plug, plug.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   So, uh, yes, enjoy your, your cop account, Andy, for as long as it lasts.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   So everybody, if there's some bandwidth issues and downloading books from Audible, but as soon
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   as I get that email from the company saying, you know what, how about one a month?
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   Then you'll be able to talk about that.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   Not go, not go effect.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   I'm, I'm buying that entire, like, speak, speak, speak Hebrew and innate lessons or less.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   That's the most expensive one I've seen yet.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000]   So that's fine.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   We thought he was busy.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   We had no idea he could listen to that many books.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.400]   You know, I did, uh, one of the things that we did that was really fun is, you know, we're,
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:41.000]   we're doing this podcast with a woman who's rowing across the Pacific, uh, Ross Savage.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.800]   And she, by the way, it's going great.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:48.560]   And I gave her my iPod with 323 books, but I underestimated how much listening she
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:49.560]   would do.
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.840]   She's rose 15 hours a day.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:55.760]   She went through Bleak House in, in, in, in, in like two days.
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:56.760]   She's.
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.160]   She's rode to Bleak House.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.160]   She's, yes.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.880]   Now she's trying to cry in punishment.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:02.880]   She did the entire.
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:03.880]   That's crazy.
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:07.800]   She says, she says, the great book to be in the middle of the ocean.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.080]   She says, here's why this works.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.080]   Stop in a caratina.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.120]   She says, this is why it works.
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:15.360]   Cause she goes boy, it could be worse.
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.920]   I could be an Russian prison.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.160]   It could be worse.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:21.040]   So, uh, she, no, she went through the whole disc world thing.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:25.680]   I gave her 323 books and I'm thinking I should have, I should have given her more.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.160]   I, I wasn't thinking she loves those books.
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.880]   It's really kind of cool.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:30.720]   Um, all right.
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:34.040]   So what was I, what did I say we would talk about, but not in the middle of the ad?
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:35.040]   I've forgotten.
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.040]   Oh, the Bible.
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.200]   No, no, come on.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.200]   Pics.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.680]   We're going to do our picks in a second.
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:44.680]   All right.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.680]   Let me ask the chat room.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:46.680]   Iron Man.
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.680]   There you go.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:48.680]   Yes.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:49.680]   Thank you.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:50.680]   Chewy 67.
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:52.080]   And I'm pretty upset about it.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.080]   Here comes.
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:57.680]   Uh, first of all, they do play the Aussie Osborne lick.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:02.760]   Yes, it sounds just like that.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.320]   Um, I don't know.
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.320]   I'm out of town.
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:06.320]   Acoustic guitar.
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:10.560]   You know, one thing I like about you like look nice today is those intermets.
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:11.560]   Those little guitar.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:12.560]   Yeah.
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:13.560]   Yeah.
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:14.560]   That was a good way.
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.040]   That's a good way to kind of say, okay, now.
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.800]   Irish full tune from this week.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:18.800]   We had a little Irish full.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.480]   Yeah, a little penny whistle thing.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.480]   It was very cute.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:28.600]   If you don't listen to that podcast, you're missing probably the funniest show anywhere.
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:32.200]   I mean funnier than daily show, funniest show anywhere.
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:36.160]   So Iron Man, who told me stick around through the credits because you were right.
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:37.720]   It might very well have been me.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:42.800]   It seems like some pointless and nerdy that the entire I'm sitting in the theater.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:45.600]   Everybody's left but me and one middle aged lady.
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:50.240]   I mean, literally everybody is gone and because it's not like sometimes they, you know, like
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:54.040]   it's smoking the band it, they play a little bit of the credits and then they, you know,
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.040]   then they do the bloopers.
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:56.280]   It's not like that.
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:59.960]   You have to watch every grip, every best boy, every bottle.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:03.960]   But the yachos, the yagracy has one of those two goes on and on and on and on.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:07.040]   I'm sitting there going, I hope this is, I hope Andy wasn't kidding me.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.040]   And there it is.
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.040]   And boy, it's a stunner.
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:12.120]   Is it, will be a spoiler if you tell us what it is.
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.120]   Oh, it's a total.
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:14.120]   I can't write Andy.
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.120]   I can't say what it is.
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:20.080]   It's more if you read the comic, it will basically say, Oh my God.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.080]   I'm sitting here.
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:25.880]   It's like I'm going to be first in line to buy the next movie.
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.200]   Yeah, it set up the sequel.
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.160]   I guess that's enough to say that.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.160]   Yes.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:33.120]   But, but, and I'm not, I didn't, I never read the comic.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:37.200]   However, I have to say it really made, to me, it kind of the movie went up a whole notch
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:38.200]   at that point.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.440]   It was like, yeah, it was great.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:40.440]   I thought it was a great movie.
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.440]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:46.720]   Will Harris, I think actually also told me to stick around through the credits.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:50.040]   Let's give him credit and let's give Rickster and our chatroom credit for that.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:53.240]   So it is time for our picks of the week.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:58.480]   Ladies and gentlemen, let's start with Mr. Andy Ennaco.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:03.840]   I'm going, my pick of the week is something that arrived just this morning.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.640]   Sometimes it's like Christmas morning being a technology columnist.
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:10.960]   You run downstairs in your pajamas to see that men in brightly colored costumes have
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:13.720]   delivered colorful packages on your doorstep.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.760]   This was no, this is no change.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:19.240]   Flip video sent me their brand new flip mine.
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.240]   What do you think of that?
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.400]   Oh, I love it.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:27.240]   It's like the iPod nano version of the flip video in that it's a lot slimmer.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.920]   It's a lot narrower.
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:34.680]   It's more like a, I don't even want to say a cell phone because cell phones are now bulky,
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:36.480]   like, you know, big, like the iPhone.
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:41.440]   It's about the size of like the tiny little packet of crayons that you get in the sizzler
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:44.680]   when you ask for the children's menu and the children's placemat and you get four crayons
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.680]   to color with.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:47.160]   That's about the size of it.
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:50.360]   And it has just about all the regular features of the regular flip video.
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:54.240]   It shoots 30 frame per second 640 by 480 video.
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:23:00.320]   They gave me the black one and that has enough for something like, I believe an hour of video
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:06.760]   at least the, it's a lot slimmer, which is good in that it's a lot slimmer.
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.360]   That in that it no longer runs on two double a battery.
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:13.000]   So you can't just go to a drugstore or gas station and get more power for it.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.240]   However, the battery, the built in rechargeable battery lasts for four hours, recharges through
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.560]   the USB port.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:23.600]   They did check, they did hold on to the flip out USB connector.
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:27.520]   The really, really cool thing is that they added a tripod mount to the bottom of it.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.520]   Oh, so, yeah.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:29.520]   Exactly.
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:32.640]   And I had it was literally a situation where I came downstairs.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:36.240]   I had like 90 minutes, like two hours to go out, run some errands.
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:39.280]   This is Wednesday's so I had to buy my new comics, all of the sort of stuff before I got
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.280]   back in time for them for the podcast.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:45.640]   But it's like, oh, I'm going through like these little, this little box of little tripods.
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:49.120]   And yes, I found the little suction cup screw mount tripod mount.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:53.600]   And I'm like, oh, if I ever want to pretend that I'm on an episode, I'm on the good side
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.520]   of the fence on an episode of cops.
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:59.600]   You can just, you know, hundreds, 179 bucks for this little camera, maybe $15 for this
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.080]   little suction cup window mount.
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.920]   Just put that on your dashboard.
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:08.680]   And you can, you know, you can even better, you can be like chef Gordon Ramsay saying,
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:12.200]   the sizzler on Route 14 and way myth is in trouble.
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.960]   They don't, they have an old menu.
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.600]   They've got a staff that doesn't even care.
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:18.680]   Let's see if we can straighten them out, you know, do all these really cool drive and
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:19.680]   talk videos.
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:23.280]   But it's, it's where do you post those just out of curiosity?
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:27.800]   Actually, I post, I do have a YouTube account that I haven't updated for a couple months
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.760]   now because I haven't had time to do real videos.
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:30.840]   I'm going to start that up again.
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:37.480]   I actually put a sample video and the unboxing or turn around video on my Flickr account.
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:41.360]   You go to flicker.com/photos/andii.
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:43.160]   You will see photos of the device.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:48.040]   You will also see pictures I shot, a video I shot walking into my favorite comic book
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.040]   shop in Malphane, Massachusetts.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:55.360]   Warning though, realize that that video has been transcoded twice now because I had to
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:59.480]   transcode it once to convert it into quick time and then transcode, it got transcoded
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:02.040]   again when you upload it to Flickr.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:07.240]   As with every, every flip video device, the best purchase that you can make for it is
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:12.600]   the 20 bucks for visual hub because it does come with software built in that will edit
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:13.960]   and play video.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:18.040]   But you really want to, if you buy visual hub, you can just drag this AVI file straight
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:21.680]   off the flip video when it's plugged in, drag it right onto visual hub.
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:25.840]   It'll be converted into an MP4 that you can then put on a YouTube, put into an iMovie,
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:26.840]   put into whatever.
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:29.880]   It's just the one, if I'm going to get a flip, because I haven't got a flip on it.
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:33.720]   I've heard you and Merlin both recommend these inexpensive video cameras.
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:34.720]   Is this the one to get?
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:35.720]   Is the mine out?
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:41.560]   I think, if you want these tiny, used anywhere cameras that you're not expecting for, you're
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:44.040]   not expecting camcorder performance, then yes.
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:48.680]   The problem with all the flip cameras is something that you will see if you check out that video
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:49.680]   on Flickr.
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:52.680]   Obviously, it compresses the hell out of the image.
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:58.920]   So any video that has lots and lots and lots of movement, like if you're doing a walk
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:02.320]   and talk, if you're just holding in front of you and walking down the street, that's
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:06.760]   probably the absolute worst quality video you can possibly shoot with it.
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:11.160]   But it does have great advantages and just the simple fact that you will toss it.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:14.600]   If you're on a cruise, maybe you're not going to take your SLR with you, maybe you're not
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:17.600]   even going to take that little compact camcorder with you.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:18.600]   But what the hell?
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:22.800]   You will toss this little tiny cigarette, half a cigarette pack size thing into your pocket.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:26.240]   And then when there's something that you really wish you had a camera for, you've got it.
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:32.920]   And for purchases of Merlin and Andy's famous internet tactical pants, there is a pocket.
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.280]   There's a pocket on the left side.
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:36.560]   That's the perfect, it's supposed to be for an ammo clip.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.280]   It's the perfect size for the iPhone.
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:40.280]   I did test it out this morning.
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:46.840]   It fits the new flip video fits perfectly in that tiny little pocket on the right above
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:47.840]   the main size.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:50.560]   It's astounding how exactly an iPhone fits in there.
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:51.560]   It's almost disturbing.
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:52.560]   I almost see.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.000]   Actually, you know, this is the first real deal.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.080]   It is tight, but it does go.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.600]   Well, no, but it fits well.
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:01.880]   I'm going to go off on this very quickly.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:04.960]   I just have to mention that, you know, this is going to be one of the next videos that
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:06.200]   I shoot for YouTube.
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:10.600]   It's almost as if they got every cool piece of technology and given to the tailor and
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:14.960]   saying, make sure every pocket is a perfect fit for this because I have just, I had to
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:15.960]   try it out.
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:21.080]   I've got this stuff in my drawer, these technologies, these most of my drawer.
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:24.480]   So it's like, okay, so iPhone, yep, it's perfectly in there.
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:25.480]   Flip video.
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:26.720]   Okay, if it's perfectly in this pocket.
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:30.240]   Okay, the Kindle fits perfectly into the back pocket.
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.400]   How about the Asus EPC?
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.800]   Yep, it's perfectly in the other back pocket.
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:34.800]   You can walk around with like-
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.960]   It's as if they knew somehow.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:41.880]   You can start global thermonuclear war circa 1993 with all the technology you can carry
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:43.520]   just in these ones set of pants.
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:47.000]   So but this is about the flip video, mine-o.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.800]   And like I said, it's really, it's really an improvement on the other one.
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:53.320]   It costs almost nothing more than what the old version cost.
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:58.320]   It has just about every single piece of capability and yet it's smaller, it's cuter, it's lighter,
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:59.320]   it's nicer.
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:03.720]   Let me ask you, because Sparky and Corona is asking in the IRC chatroom, in the past he's
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:08.560]   had trouble importing his flip video into his iMovie.
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.720]   Does this work pretty well with iMovie?
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:15.680]   Like I said, the best purchase you can possibly make is to get visual hub.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.680]   As a matter of fact-
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:17.680]   Do you do .tv?
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:18.680]   Excuse me?
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:22.320]   Do you do .tv file?
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.680]   So talking about the workflow, so you take-
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:28.920]   You plug in the USB key from the flip video, you copy the video off to your desktop, it's
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:30.080]   an MP4, right?
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:31.080]   We got it, it's a little bit-
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:36.280]   What happens is you plug it into a USB port and it appears as a USB mass storage device.
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:42.560]   You can just, the videos that land on the flip video as, as a V.I. files, MPAG compressed.
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:43.560]   Okay.
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:46.640]   You do have to have it now technically if you're going to go buy the numbers based on the
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:51.040]   manual, you have to install a special codec to make it work with QuickTime.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:55.200]   I've never used it because it's just not as good as simply, again, 20 bucks for visual
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:59.200]   hub, drag the file directly onto the icon, it'll convert it into whatever format you
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:03.800]   want, just convert it into an MP4 and then I can edit it in iMovie.
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:05.200]   All right.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.080]   That's why you want visual hub.
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:09.400]   That's, again, it solves the-
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:14.200]   Installing a codec slaps at the problem, converting it with visual hub solves the problem.
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:15.200]   Right.
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.200]   All right.
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.200]   I think I'm going to get one.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:18.200]   I've been putting it off.
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:22.600]   I think the fact that it has a tripod mount means you, for a GorillaPod and so forth,
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:24.880]   it sounds like a great choice and you want the tripod because you don't want a lot of
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:25.880]   movement.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:27.720]   The compression will do much better with less movement.
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:28.720]   Exactly.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.680]   If you're doing the sort of thing where you just sort of stick it on the wall and you sit
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:34.480]   in front of it and talk, the video is extremely good.
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:40.200]   It's probably just about as good as any VHSC or even SVHS camcorder your dad might have
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:42.560]   used like five, six, seven years ago.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.560]   That's the irony.
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:46.720]   I mean, we're all becoming video snobs, but frankly, you know, this stuff is better than
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:48.720]   the stuff you were using a few years ago.
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:51.800]   And Andy, is there an analog out because there's an analog out in the original?
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:52.800]   Yes.
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:57.160]   There's still an analog out your basic headphone jack style plug on the side of it.
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:01.160]   So if you want to have RCA connectors, you can plug it into any TV, the software or you
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:03.000]   can click on a button or DVD.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.920]   That's really sick side of me that wants to basically take three of these little phones
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:10.640]   and put them on little tripods and then run them into like a little analog mixer and then
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:15.440]   out into the computer and you have your own little three camera shoot that costs you about,
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:16.440]   you know, 500 bucks.
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.520]   Oh, you're way behind sir.
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:22.560]   Again, I'm cleaning up my office because I'm preparing for a move and you just realize
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:29.120]   that my God, I've collected a stupid number of like these inexpensive little consumer camcorders.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:32.120]   And yeah, I did decide, you know what, it's the me show starring.
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:33.960]   Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, me.
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:37.960]   And just set them up like just with Velcro like on every single surface and I've gotten
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:43.880]   me from like seven different angles, some to anywhere from like 320 by 240 to 720 by 480
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:44.880]   or whatever.
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:45.880]   Can you switch to them?
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:48.160]   I do have Adobe Premiere.
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:52.200]   What you do is you do the old fashioned trick where either you get a camera flash and you
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:55.880]   get every camera running and then you simply manually set off the flash so you basically
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:31:00.640]   get sort of a, you know, sort of a visual slate that helps you sync up every single one of
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:02.480]   these seven different sources of video.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:07.480]   And then from there Adobe Premiere, you can just say, okay, camera one, okay, hold, hold,
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:09.560]   hold on camera, camera four, go.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:13.960]   You know, you're like, you're, it's like you're directing the Grammys or something.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:16.560]   I want to see this video.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:17.920]   I can't wait.
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:21.400]   That was how that was how I tried to learn Adobe Premiere a few months ago.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.400]   Wow.
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.400]   Crazy.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.200]   Not with this, not with this exact set up.
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:26.200]   Boy.
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:27.200]   You know, let's get three cameras and see.
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:28.200]   Okay.
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:30.320]   And remember, go to the white shot and wait for the reaction and go.
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:34.880]   I'm just thinking about how much I spent on these Canon XL two cameras, the TriCaster
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:37.800]   switcher, the studio lights.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:39.240]   And I could have bought three flips.
[01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:40.240]   There you go.
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:41.440]   Would have been just as good.
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:43.080]   Actually, actually come to think of it.
[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:46.680]   I could have bought more like 3000 flips, but that's another matter.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:47.680]   All right.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:52.120]   I'm going to do my pick right now, since we're talking about video because I'm really excited
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:54.520]   about this and I've been using it in the studio.
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:59.360]   Have I mentioned, have I talked about my ITV plus in here yet?
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:00.360]   No.
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:03.160]   I, you know, this is the Elgato device.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.880]   I really like this thing.
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:13.040]   It is a, it's just a little white box that has on one side, it has the S video connector.
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:17.280]   It has actually, I'm sorry, on one side, it has a cable connector and then it has a little
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:20.720]   dongle that you can attach to it via what, you know, looks like an S video cable that
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:25.960]   gives you composite in or S video in.
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:29.880]   So it, it, it, it, and then it plugs into the Mac via USB.
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:36.360]   I have to admit, when I first saw that, I went, oh, that's not good because the USB, you know,
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:39.280]   it seems like USB would not be fast enough.
[01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:41.200]   But I have to tell you, it's plenty fast enough.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:46.200]   The ITV 250 plus, you hook it up to your cable.
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:48.720]   So the first thing I do when you hook it up to the cable, like you would with any cable
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:50.800]   device is you scan the channels.
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:55.000]   Now we have a, you know, a Comcast business class cable, you know, I have paid 10 bucks
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.440]   more so I get CNN, but I don't know if they know this and I hope Comcast isn't listening,
[01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:03.880]   but I have also high def digital channels, you know, 700, 700, one, 700 or two.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:07.720]   I have a bunch of high def channels in here.
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:10.120]   So, and it, and it looks great.
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:13.240]   I make it go full screen on my 37 inch LCD.
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:15.160]   They look free to air.
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:16.480]   Well it's cable air channels.
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:17.480]   You can get air channels.
[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:19.680]   This has a, this has clear QAM.
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:24.400]   So you can get air channels if you have an eight, if you have a tenant, it has an ATSC
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:25.760]   tuner in it.
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:29.960]   So it works with your cable, it unencrypted digital cable using clear QAM.
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:34.520]   It uses analog free to air HD TV.
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:37.720]   It has a Tivo like recording capabilities that are fantastic.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:42.520]   In fact, as you're watching something live, you can press pause just like on a Tivo.
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:46.360]   You can rewind is it not only goes through the channel, it goes through everything you've
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:48.680]   watched since you turned it on.
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:50.440]   So it's recording in the background.
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:52.720]   It allows you to make your own recordings.
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:54.400]   It allows you to burn to DVD.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.600]   It comes with Roxyotost 8.
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:59.280]   So you can, you can immediately make a DVD.
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:00.720]   You can use it for an 80D converter.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:03.920]   If you've got VHS tapes, you connect it up.
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:07.360]   And they'll do the conversion.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.520]   This is the greatest way.
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:12.880]   I'm connecting my Mac mini now to my TV.
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.960]   And it's working fantastic.
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:18.360]   So I picture in picture right now, but I can also go full screen with it.
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:22.480]   It comes with its own little remote control that will let you turn on the controller.
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:28.520]   It has a cable guide built into it, which is free right now.
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:32.640]   It looks as if at the end of the year that situation is going to change.
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:36.680]   So I'm not sure what they're going to do at that point.
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:40.080]   But right now, I really like the ability I have to switch.
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:47.000]   In fact, I'm showing on the feed, I'm showing people the controller.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.320]   It's really, really cool.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:56.280]   So I'm going to show the smart guide, which looks a lot like a Tivo playlist, a program
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:57.280]   guide.
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:00.080]   And I guess it gets that from, depending on where you, what country you're in, it gets
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:03.160]   that from different services that are free.
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:06.320]   You can just double click a show just like you would on Tivo and you could say, add
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:09.000]   it to my schedule and it'll add it to your schedule.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.400]   I mean, this thing is really, really slick.
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:13.920]   I've got all your cable network.
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:16.480]   All your cable, everything unencrypted.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.360]   Now if you hook it up to digital cable box, I guess it would do that.
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.360]   But I don't have a digital cable box.
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.960]   I'm going right directly to the cable.
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.960]   So Titan TV provides the directory right now, although I said, I think at the end of the
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:27.320]   year that's going to change.
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:29.120]   But this is set up to work internationally.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.920]   We have a very, you know, pretty much any country in the world is a work with program
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:35.640]   guides that are local to that country.
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:37.160]   This is kind of the ultimate TV device.
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:38.640]   I've been very happy with it.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:43.000]   And as I said, you know, if I pick a channel, it's a high def channel and go to it and then
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.840]   go full screen on my TV, even though it's coming in through the USB port, which I thought,
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:49.720]   well, that's not going to work.
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:50.720]   It works.
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:52.640]   It looks really, really good.
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:54.040]   It's really high quality.
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:58.920]   I think this is the year for a lot of people to consider using their computers as their
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:35:59.920]   TV devices.
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:03.760]   I mean, just full out is let's not go with a regular TV set.
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:07.800]   Let's have a Mac that just works as a TV because a lot of people are going to be in
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:12.840]   that position where obviously you got the big honkin 42 inch LCD or whatever in the living
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:15.760]   room and that's not that's all set and that's not going anywhere.
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:19.800]   But this is a chance for you to take, you know, the Sony 19 inch that you bought for
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:25.400]   your dorm room eight years ago, you know, that's that's made three moves already that is now
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:27.760]   absolutely not going to work for you when they make the transition.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:28.760]   You have digital credit.
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:32.440]   But I have to, I agree with you, but I have to say I'm putting this on the big screen
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:34.960]   and it's it's the way I watch TV now.
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:37.840]   No, it works great in any application, but I'm saying that there are a lot of people
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:41.480]   who aren't willing to say that they aren't willing to turn their live their big living
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:43.880]   room TV set into a computer screen.
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:44.880]   Right.
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:48.520]   But there are certainly willing to say, well, you know what, I got this quick silver Mac,
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:51.360]   but you know, I got this older Mac that's in the closet.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:56.040]   It has a good 19 inch display that I haven't been able to use or haven't been using.
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:37:00.520]   I'll use that as my new, you know, as my new kitchen computer, excuse me, I'm a new kitchen
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:04.120]   TV or my new bedroom TV and it box like this.
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:08.880]   Well, I will say that the best digital TV experience that I've ever had continues to
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:11.400]   be these boxes that you can that you plug into your computer.
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:13.160]   Well, this is the first thing I've seen.
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.640]   It's better than a TV.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:18.160]   And when I go through the program guide, you know, if I press the down arrow on my
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:22.240]   keyboard, I start scrolling through my channels, not only to get the channel, I get what shows
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:23.240]   on this channel.
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:27.680]   So I mean, it's it's it's frankly the best experience I've had of watching cable ever.
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:29.280]   I'm really fond of this thing.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:31.400]   I think this is an amazing device.
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:35.440]   I have to say, I'm going to do some of the earlier versions and it's really, really great.
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:39.840]   And we might actually have to break down and get cable because of the whole election thing.
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:42.440]   Well, you don't because you live in San Francisco.
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:45.840]   So all you have to do is get an HD TV antenna.
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:48.760]   No, we're on the side of the hill.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:51.000]   It's really hard to get over the air HD.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000]   Is it?
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.840]   Yeah, it's when you get it, it looks gorgeous.
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:59.600]   But but we're on the side of knob hill that is kind of in a radio shadow.
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:00.600]   Oh, that's too bad.
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:01.840]   Well, then you might have to break down.
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:03.360]   By being less to twin peaks.
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.640]   Yeah, you might have to break down this.
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:09.240]   I would highly recommend this even if you're on cable.
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:14.440]   But if you if you have analog HD TV, this is a fantastic solution to give you, you know,
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:16.160]   basically full Tivo capabilities.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:17.640]   I was a I was a I'll be honest.
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:18.640]   I was a Tivo bigot.
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:23.200]   I thought nothing can compete with Tivo until I started it's still a part of started playing
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:24.200]   with this.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:26.240]   And this thing to me is better than Tivo.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:33.640]   This is the El from Elgato, E L G A T O. It is the I TV 250 plus and it comes with their
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:36.640]   I TV software 200 bucks.
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:38.000]   But you're using and you need a computer.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.920]   I mean, this runs very nicely on my Mac mini.
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:41.920]   I've been very happy with it.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:45.000]   I think it's a really, really good choice.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.840]   I can I'm recommending it highly.
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:51.320]   And I was kind of surprised when I was able to get all these clear quam stations that
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:52.640]   I didn't even know I was paying for.
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:59.160]   I probably wouldn't have ever known if I hadn't put in the I TV and I hope Comcast isn't listening.
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:01.240]   So that's so that's my pick.
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:02.240]   Let's move along.
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:03.760]   Andy did his I did mine.
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:05.080]   That means it's your turn.
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:06.880]   Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:10.360]   So I have one that it used to be something that you get on the web, but now you don't have
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:11.360]   to go on the web.
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:12.600]   And I'm kind of liking it.
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:16.400]   So it just came out, I believe this is Pandora.
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:17.720]   Now, have you guys used Pandora?
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:19.000]   Oh, love Pandora.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.400]   So Pandora is really, really cool.
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:27.600]   And they now have an air app and I'm super excited about the air, you know, Adobe's air
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:28.600]   technology.
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:31.440]   And so basically now what this is, is it's an application.
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:34.520]   So you have to download and install air, but that's worth it.
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:40.080]   And then, and then after that, you can you can download Pandora and it's an air application
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:43.720]   and it's a little standalone now and you can do the same things that you had before.
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:48.920]   So what you can do is essentially be playing music and deciding, oh, I like this or I don't
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:53.240]   like that or set up channels that are all like I have one that's like Delamie Tree or
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:56.400]   one that's like nine inch nails or one that's like, you know, these different things that
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:01.040]   different bands that that I like and there's a whole if I just in that mood, I can, you
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:05.640]   know, keep on telling it what I like and don't like or things like, you know, and, and it's
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:07.880]   it's just great playing in the background.
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:11.280]   It's internet radio, but it's, but it's so much smarter.
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:12.280]   We've actually to you.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:13.280]   Right.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:17.080]   Because it listens to what you like and then clone, you know, kind of craft station that's
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.080]   just for you.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:21.480]   It finds, it's just fine songs and it's very expensive for me to listen to Pandora because
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:25.240]   generally what happens is is that it finds songs that I haven't thought of for years or
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:28.960]   things that I have never heard before that are like that are nothing the range.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:31.160]   You know, this is something I have to own.
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:34.200]   And the next thing I know is I'm buying more, you know, more music.
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:35.880]   So it's expensive in that way.
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:36.880]   It's free.
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:39.080]   It makes you want stuff.
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.200]   It's like this show.
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:42.760]   It's free, but it makes you want stuff.
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:43.960]   The thing is you can't really save it.
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:44.960]   You know, that's the whole thing with Pandora.
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:46.280]   It's kind of, it's kind of going by.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:49.080]   So you're like, Oh, I got to buy that so I can listen to it again.
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.880]   So it's, it's, it's pretty nifty.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:54.760]   So I think they recently discontinued their service internationally because of these,
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:58.600]   you know, restrictions that the music industry wants to put on them.
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:59.600]   I just love it.
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:03.080]   We've interviewed the, the guy who started at Tim Westergren, I think on net at night.
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:05.960]   And it's just really, it started with the music genome project.
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:11.000]   It started with this project to, they got a bunch of professional musicians in listening
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.320]   to music.
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:18.680]   And the idea was they categorize music by, you know, it's genome.
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:21.800]   So, you know, and what you do is you say, if you say, I like Bob Dylan, they'll go,
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:28.000]   okay, the genome he likes are acoustic, folky, male singer, songwriters, and then they'll
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.360]   make recommendations based on that.
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:32.320]   It's better than that, obviously, but that's the idea.
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:37.560]   Break spricks, everything you listen down into these genres and then, and then applies
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:40.200]   that genre to other songs to see what you might like also.
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:42.240]   Does a good job, do you think it does a good job?
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.240]   Alex?
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:44.360]   I think it does a great job.
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:47.560]   You know, especially if you're skipping through it and if you tell it things that you like
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:51.880]   and don't like, you know, if you just sit there and listen to it, it doesn't okay job.
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:54.720]   But if you're somewhat active and go, you know, I don't, I don't really like that.
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:55.720]   I do like that.
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:56.720]   And you're pretty hard on it.
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:02.280]   It can, it can, it can zero in pretty accurately where it gets to a point where I just, I just
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:05.080]   generally enjoy most of the stuff that's going by.
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:07.960]   It's kind of like dictation software.
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:13.560]   There is still last FM worldwide and I think that it's not, it's a little different.
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:14.560]   Same kind of idea.
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:16.760]   It's more of a social network than Pandora is.
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:22.560]   I was very sad when the, it was that whole copyright thing on music and the, and I think
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:26.520]   essentially they said we can't afford to do this anywhere outside the US.
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:28.680]   So we're just going to restrict it to the US.
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:30.480]   It's kind of sad.
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:33.920]   Finally, Merlin, man, your pick of the day.
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:37.800]   Uh, I think Andy has already made the Kindle a pick before probably.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:39.440]   Oh, you love your Kindle.
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:41.360]   I'm enjoying my, well, I'm, you know, it's funny.
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:45.360]   I started, I sat down finally, I started posting again after a little break on 43 folders and
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:47.840]   I was starting to write my big Kindle post.
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:50.600]   And it's funny because for everything that I love about the Kindle, there's, there's
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:53.280]   two mitigating things that I kind of hate about it.
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:55.080]   The net result is I'm very excited about it.
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:58.520]   Although it's, I won't go into a lot of detail except to say that it's much better for some
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:42:59.760]   things than others.
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:03.640]   It's not reading the Sunday New York Times on the Kindle is not nearly as much fun as holding
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:04.640]   it in your hands.
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:07.720]   It reading the Atlantic is not as much fun as holding it in your hands.
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:13.960]   But so depending on how you want to cut this, I either have a, a, a pick of the week that's
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:16.000]   half an Alex or it's zero Alex's.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.240]   The half an Alex is that if you read a lot and if you read a lot of old books, the Kindle
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:21.240]   is great.
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:23.120]   And now my specific free one, everybody knows that.
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:28.280]   I want to talk specifically about why and where you can get old books for free.
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:33.640]   I want to talk about three sources because there is something that I, you probably mentioned
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:37.600]   this in your article, Andy, I once again, I just cannot highly enough recommend Andy's
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:42.560]   article on the Kindle on his site, which we should put in link to and show notes because
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.240]   it really inspired me to get it.
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:46.720]   But so what's great?
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:47.720]   Okay.
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:48.720]   So it's kind of cool.
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:50.720]   Like you get, you go to Amazon or, you know, it's blah, blah, blah.
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:53.720]   It's got to have built in so you can buy books on the fly, which is awesome, right?
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:54.720]   You're stuck on the tarmac.
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:55.720]   You can buy a book.
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:56.720]   Very cool.
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:58.000]   They're not crazy cheap.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000]   They're not like nutty cheap.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000]   Well, it's what you buy.
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.680]   I mean, if you're buying New York Times best sellers, 10 bucks.
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:07.080]   Still, I mean, yeah, it's a third of the cost of the cover.
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:10.760]   But I, anyway, I don't find that to be an amazing bargain.
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:12.520]   You think it should be cheaper even than that?
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:14.360]   I think it should be cheaper even than that.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:18.520]   And I think it's, I'm, again, I'll be all Alex here and say, I think it's something
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:23.400]   we're having some kind of an audible like model of all you can eat would be a great
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:24.600]   idea to get negotiated.
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:27.960]   That said, there are so many books that you know in the back of your head.
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:28.960]   You should read.
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:32.000]   And I'm not going to use that horrible bucket list.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000]   Phrasiology.
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000]   But there's a lot of great books that are worth reading and there's so many that are
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.680]   free and out there and people have gone to an extraordinary amount of trouble to make
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:40.920]   it very easy for you to read them.
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:43.520]   So I'm going to recommend three things in order of awesomeness.
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:45.320]   And I'm sure Andy will have others to share.
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:49.120]   Number one, the big, the big gorilla in this space, obviously, is Project Gutenberg, which
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:50.120]   is great.
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:53.880]   She can go in and there's all kinds of ways you can download in HTML or text versions.
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:55.200]   It's easy to read on a phone.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:58.120]   You can read it on your trio or what have you.
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:03.480]   It's not super optimized for the Kindle, but Project Gutenberg has so much stuff at
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:04.960]   Gutenberg.org.
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:06.240]   What's better?
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:09.160]   And I have to imagine they're getting some of the stuff from Project Gutenberg.
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:10.160]   minibooks.net.
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:16.080]   M-A-N-Y books B-W-O-K-S.net is amazing.
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:20.000]   It's got, it could be a little better taxonomically, but it's got so many fantastic books.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.520]   I downloaded a John Carter of Mars book.
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:23.920]   I haven't looked at it in years.
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:29.880]   I downloaded Dante's D'Mine comedy, all these wonderful books, hilarious old books, books
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:32.240]   on housekeeping from the 1800s.
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:34.040]   What makes this awesome for each one of these books?
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:35.240]   You give those to Mad?
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:36.240]   Oh, I do.
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:38.760]   I read them aloud to her.
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:42.040]   After you've made a good toilet in the morning, you could move about and observe the movements
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:43.040]   of the servants.
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:46.600]   Then you go and pay your visits.
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:47.880]   But anyway, lots of great stuff.
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:51.000]   Silly stuff, fun stuff, Edgar Rice Burroughs worth it for the price right there.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000]   And the price is free.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:57.000]   On a page for Princess of Mars, you select from a drop down what version you want.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.560]   You select Kindle, you hit a button, and it downloads to your little computer.
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:01.560]   That's cool.
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:02.560]   That's really cool.
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:03.560]   So that's the second one.
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:05.480]   So let me ask you how well that conversion goes.
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:08.080]   Because I've been a little nervous about getting non-kindled books.
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:09.080]   Here's the deal.
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:11.160]   Project Gutenberg and it's pretty good.
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:13.160]   PDFs are dicey.
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:16.280]   I'm going to give you one of my last final secret tip is about PDFs.
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:17.560]   But PDFs are okay.
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:19.080]   It's not super well supported.
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:21.120]   But the beauty part is minibooks.net.
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:25.520]   It has it in the native whatever M-A-Z-M or whatever.
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:27.040]   Oh, it has it in the Kindle format?
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:28.640]   No, you literally download the dot.
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:29.640]   What is it, Andy?
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:31.200]   Dot-A-Z-M or something like that?
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:32.200]   AMZ.
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:33.200]   Something like that.
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:35.280]   You download it and it's good to go.
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:36.280]   Now you got two routes.
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:37.280]   I like that.
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:38.440]   Two routes you can go at this point.
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:42.480]   You either mail it to your secret Amazon address that sends it straight to your Kindle.
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:44.680]   Which would be MerlinMan@kindle.com.
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:45.680]   Whatever.
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:46.680]   I've got it.
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:47.680]   But no, it's mostly looking at where your from addresses.
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:50.120]   It actually doesn't matter because, yeah, you can give it out.
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:51.120]   It finds the LaPorte Kindle.com.
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:52.120]   That's it.
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:53.120]   Good tip.
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:54.120]   Good tip.
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:55.120]   There's two ways you can do that.
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:57.240]   You can send it right to your Kindle or you can do the free version where it just sends
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:46:59.360]   it back to you as an Amazon book and you upload it to yourself.
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:02.880]   My trick, I wait until I have about five of them that I want to send.
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:05.240]   I zip them up and then send them.
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:06.960]   And next time I turn the Kindle on, they're all on there.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:07.960]   So that's one.
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:09.440]   It costs you for one mailing.
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:11.280]   Or attachment.
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:13.680]   So one zip and they don't have to unzip it?
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:14.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:17.000]   You send 50 of them in a zip and it's a dime.
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000]   That's excellent.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.840]   And I have to tell you the truth because I'm a big money bags.
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:23.560]   I frequently, I'll tell you my tip before I get to this last one.
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:29.080]   My tip also is what I do is the PDF menu inside the print dialogue.
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:31.880]   And so you can pull down, say you're on the print version of a New York Times article
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:32.880]   you want to read.
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:36.960]   Say you want to read the awesome Lou Pearlman article in Vanity Fair, you go to the print
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:37.960]   only page.
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:40.560]   You say PDF, mail this PDF.
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:45.080]   It throws it in a PDF form over to Mailbot app because it's a very simple PDF format if
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:46.840]   it's a print only page.
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:47.840]   And I can set right to your Kindle.
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:48.840]   You're good to go.
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:50.240]   For a dime now you get to read this article.
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:52.360]   And the wrap and everything is fine.
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:53.360]   It's not too bad.
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:54.360]   It's not too bad.
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:55.360]   You know, and...
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:57.200]   Because word wrapping is always a difficult thing to do with.
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:59.080]   Well, and also repeated words sometimes.
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:00.640]   The PDFs are imperfect.
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:04.480]   But so finally, and I promise I'm going to shut up after this, this is the money shot.
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:06.000]   Feedbooks.com.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.680]   You go to Feedbooks.com which is accessible from your mobile device as well.
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:13.880]   And there is at Feedbooks.com I believe/mobile/kindle.
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:22.040]   You can download a huge ass Kindle book that contains links to bajillions of books inside
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:23.040]   that document.
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.040]   So what does that mean?
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:25.360]   Show me the top 10 downloads right now.
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:27.400]   Okay, click 1984.
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:28.760]   Now it's on my Kindle for free.
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:29.760]   So you're out there.
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:31.640]   Because you're just getting it as a download.
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:32.800]   It's basically it's a huge ass.
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:35.720]   I mean one thing to understand about the Kindle that helps it make a lot more sense.
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:36.720]   Learn the back button.
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:38.080]   The back button is your friend.
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:41.240]   The Kindle, rather than thinking of it as a book reader, think of it as a book writer.
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:45.120]   Wait a minute, give me the, because I'm getting free Christian educational resources.
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:46.120]   Feedbooks.com.
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:48.360]   Feedbooks, not free books.
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:49.600]   No, feedbooks.
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:50.600]   Feed as an F-E-E-D.
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:51.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:52.600]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:56.080]   If I was to go to the home page, I'm guessing there's a link to the Kindle area.
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:59.920]   But anyway, you download this huge ass document on your Kindle.
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:00.920]   It's on your home page now.
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:01.920]   This is cool.
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:02.920]   You browse that.
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:04.640]   Also, you know, get really comfortable when your Kindle get comfortable with the search
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:05.640]   functionality.
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:06.640]   Oh, this is cool.
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:09.040]   Because once you start using the search functionality, get comfortable with that.
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:12.520]   The search functionality plus the back button will have you fly in all over the place and
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:13.520]   doing stuff.
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:14.920]   It's faster than browsing through the home page.
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:16.320]   Anyway, so you go and find a book.
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:18.240]   I want to download Babbitt by Sinclair Lewis.
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:19.240]   Boom.
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:20.240]   And it's on your Kindle for free.
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:21.240]   Oh, this is fantastic.
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:22.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:26.320]   And you can download, of course, as you know, you can also put Audible books onto your Kindle.
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:28.600]   You can put MP3s on there.
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:29.600]   It's not for everybody.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:32.000]   It's way too expensive for normal people.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000]   But if you got all the lessons--
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000]   Oh, it's not.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.000]   This isn't free.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000]   No, no, no.
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.000]   I'm saying the Kindle's expensive.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000]   Oh, the Kindle's expensive.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000]   This is free.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.800]   But I am loving this.
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:57.880]   And I read my daughter a chapter of Edgar Eisboro's Every Night,
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:18.760]   Thoris, as drawn by Frank Cho.
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:21.280]   I'm just buying books.
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:22.280]   It's good.
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:23.280]   It's good.
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:24.280]   And I do it and I want to support that.
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:26.160]   And I bought stuff-- oh, my god, the Jack Handy book.
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:27.160]   So funny.
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:28.160]   I bought the--
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:29.160]   That's on Facebook?
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:30.160]   Oh, Jack Handy's.
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:32.160]   No, I paid nine bucks for that, but it's so worth it.
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:34.560]   So tell me one more time because I'm stupid.
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:35.560]   Yes.
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:37.760]   They do have a help file on here, which I'm looking at.
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:40.600]   But what you're saying is I don't download the book.
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:43.560]   I download a search.
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:47.720]   Think of it as downloading an HTML document with links to PDFs, metaphorically.
[01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:49.920]   And then I just click the book I want.
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:51.440]   I get something in your Kindle.
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:55.600]   My Kindle's not in front of me right now, but I think it says something like whatever
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:58.760]   Kindle, Kindle, feedbooks, book guide or something like that.
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:50:59.760]   You surf into that.
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:02.680]   Kindle guide, feedbooks.com/kindle guide.
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:06.080]   Once that's on there, you see a link for George Orwell in 1984.
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:07.080]   You see Anna Karenina.
[01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:08.080]   You see whatever.
[01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:09.360]   You click it and you're good to go.
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:11.880]   It downloads it right to your Kindle for free.
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:12.880]   Wow.
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:13.880]   You're going to save me some money on this one.
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:14.880]   That's amazing.
[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:15.880]   And there's so many great books.
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:18.720]   I mean, now, like you said, Bleak House, not my favorite Dickens book, but there's a
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:20.720]   lot of fantastic books.
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:22.560]   What is your favorite Dickens book just so I can--
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:24.040]   You know, I like Oliver Twist.
[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:27.000]   I keep meaning to read great expectations and I haven't.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.000]   Tell it to cities.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.000]   Yeah.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000]   Yeah, sure.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000]   Sure.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000]   But they're all on there.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.080]   And books up to and through Freud, you know, stuff, there's stuff out there from the early
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:40.080]   20th century, plus people like Cory Doctorow who are good enough to put their stuff out
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:43.200]   there in free-ish, free and free-ish formats.
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:48.600]   So the guide that you're downloading, which is a .moby file, that has everything in it?
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:49.600]   Links to all of those.
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:51.400]   So every book that they have, basically.
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:54.400]   I believe stuff.
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:55.400]   And then you would update that periodically, I guess.
[01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:57.400]   Last one is from, I think, last month.
[01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:58.400]   Wow.
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:51:59.400]   I believe.
[01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:01.440]   But anyway, I want to make sure all three of those are great.
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:03.560]   If you're at your computer, minibooks.net is fantastic.
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:09.520]   Obviously, big ups to Project Gutenberg, but having the feedbooks on your Kindle, it's
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:10.520]   a game changer.
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:11.720]   And I think you're right.
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:15.680]   I would guess that all of these come from Project Gutenberg because Gutenberg has made
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:16.680]   such an--
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:18.680]   They're just repackaging open source.
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:19.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:23.120]   No, it isn't a big deal because that's what Gutenberg's about, is getting this stuff out
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:24.120]   there.
[01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:29.600]   And I think this solves that problem of taking that big text file or PDF and getting on your
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:30.600]   Kindle was non-trivial.
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:31.600]   This makes it much easier.
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:32.600]   Yeah.
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:33.600]   That's great.
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:34.600]   What do you think?
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:36.440]   What do you think Andy, do you use any of these?
[01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:38.000]   I don't use it on Gutenberg.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.760]   Everybody needs to know about Project Gutenberg because that's the place.
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:42.760]   They're good people.
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:43.760]   They're also doing important work.
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:47.960]   They're taking works that are in the public domain and they're reconceptual.
[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:53.240]   They're recontexting them into a way that everybody can think that they're relevant.
[01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:57.880]   They take books that otherwise would be dead or only be available in interest to grad students,
[01:52:57.880 --> 01:53:01.040]   which is as good as being dead, creatively speaking.
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:04.280]   And they make it just as vibrant as any other electronic book that's out there.
[01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:08.600]   I mean, there are all kinds of humorists who were just kicking butt and taking names in
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:10.160]   the 1870s and 1880s.
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:11.120]   And you read them.
[01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:13.800]   And so many of them are just as fresh as today.
[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:14.800]   Now, admittedly--
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:15.800]   You read Jonathan Swift.
[01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:16.800]   You read Jonathan Swift.
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:17.800]   Jonathan, I'm not at its proposal today.
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:18.800]   It is still falling apart.
[01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:19.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:21.120]   And let's be honest.
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:22.920]   There are a lot of them.
[01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:27.440]   The style of text, you can smell the mustache wax with every paragraph.
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:29.920]   But otherwise, they are really great.
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:34.880]   What surprises me, what I would not have guessed after my second week using the Kindle, is
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:39.480]   how many actual books I'm buying through the Kindle store.
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:42.880]   My review, which I think I wrote after about two or three weeks with it, said that, "Oh,
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:45.200]   okay, yes, it's nice that you can buy books to the Kindle store."
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:49.480]   But the real meat of this is that it has a really great mobile web browser.
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:53.560]   It's great for using Google-- for using a Google group-- excuse me-- Google Reader
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:58.680]   in for basically being the electronic book that you read every single blog on because
[01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:02.280]   you just type in the URL for Google Reader, the mobile edition.
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:06.160]   You can catch up on thousands and thousands and thousands of worth of pages of really
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:08.080]   cool, really interesting, really current things.
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:10.400]   You have to read anyway because you're a tech geek.
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:13.840]   And it costs you nothing for life because the internet service is always free.
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:14.840]   And it feels snappy.
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:17.840]   I think it's the Java that it feels low-key, but the connection is pretty snappy.
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:18.840]   Exactly.
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:24.720]   And yet, there have been plenty of times over the past few months where I just had an interest
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:26.160]   in a certain book.
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:29.920]   And so I just wanted to see, well, how much is it on Amazon so that when I get home, maybe
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:30.920]   I'll actually buy it.
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:32.320]   So I've got the Kindle nearby.
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:34.080]   I look for it on the Kindle store.
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:36.920]   I see this $24.95 as paperback.
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:39.000]   It's $10 on the Kindle store.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.400]   I said, "Well, and then you push one button and you can download the first chapter or two."
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:46.200]   And then you read the first couple chapters, which takes you a couple of hours maybe.
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:48.200]   And then you actually want to see what comes next.
[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:50.760]   So it suddenly makes sense to spend $10 to have it.
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:56.000]   And now that's sort of my default position when buying current in-print books.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.600]   I mean, books that I read just for pleasure.
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:01.400]   I tend to buy them off the Kindle store.
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:05.160]   And after I finish them, if I think that they're so good that I actually want to add
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:09.760]   them to the permanent and not-go archives, then I'll send out for the paperback version
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:13.360]   or if it's in hardcover, I'll wait for the paperback to come out and then buy that.
[01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:19.440]   It is a very plain sort of reading experience, but it took me surprisingly little time to
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:23.440]   get used to the experience of reading this three, four, five hundred page book just by
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:25.440]   tapping a button next next.
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:28.640]   Also, Andy, Ninja move that I'm sure you're doing already.
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:29.640]   This is huge.
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:31.560]   And people apparently aren't doing this.
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:32.560]   Samples.
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:36.320]   You can go and get the free beginning of the book.
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:38.360]   Which is if you go and like, who was I talking to?
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:39.960]   I'm talking to my friend Rob Testman yesterday.
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:40.960]   We're talking about this.
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:42.960]   He's like, "You know, are you getting ready to go on a plane?
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:46.920]   Go and like, you know, grab 15 or 20 of these free, I think they're unlimited.
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:47.920]   I don't know if there's a limitation."
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:48.920]   No, I think there's a limit.
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:50.080]   I get a bunch of them.
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:52.040]   I did that with the Jack Handy book and I love it.
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:53.960]   Yeah, and then he said, "If I like this, I'm going to get some more of it."
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:54.960]   And you don't have to leave the page.
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:55.960]   Right.
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:56.960]   It doesn't replace it.
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:57.960]   You do get two copies, which is a little janky.
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:01.040]   But there's a link right there at the point where the text ends.
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:02.040]   You're ready to buy this?
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:03.040]   Yes.
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:04.040]   Boom.
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:05.040]   Isn't that great?
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:06.040]   Hey, we got to wrap this up.
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:07.040]   This is rapidly getting to be another two.
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:08.040]   I've been two hours, Leo.
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:11.040]   I try every darn time.
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:13.040]   I have every time.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:15.560]   Leo, one hour since you said, "Gee, we didn't seem to have much to talk about this."
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:17.120]   Oh, well, it's exactly.
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:18.600]   You know what gets us every time on this show?
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:21.240]   And maybe we should just eliminate the news and just do the pics because the pics we end
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:22.400]   up spending an hour on.
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:23.400]   And they're great.
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:24.400]   I'm not saying we shouldn't.
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:25.400]   Make it two shows a week.
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:26.400]   Maybe it'll have to be two shows.
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:27.400]   Maybe we'll divide it up.
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:28.400]   They can cut in two episodes.
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:29.400]   Yeah, I could do that.
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:30.400]   We could just do it.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:31.400]   That's the U.S. that you look nice today.
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:32.400]   Make break a pics.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:35.800]   Is that how you do your record for eight hours and then you say how many shows you're going
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:36.800]   to get out of it?
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:37.800]   Drink.
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.800]   Talk for three hours.
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:41.840]   That's how the sandwich works for two days cutting it up into two episodes.
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:42.840]   Sandwich works hard.
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:43.840]   He's a hard working man.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:44.840]   That is a real...
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:45.920]   I mean, that's basically why we do what we...
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:48.320]   The way we do, which is really cut and run.
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:52.320]   Record it and get it out the door because otherwise you spend days.
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:53.760]   This stuff is a lot of work.
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:54.760]   All right.
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:55.920]   Well, I want to thank you guys.
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:56.920]   You're the best.
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:56:59.440]   Do listen to You Look Nice Today.
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:00.600]   Youlooknicetoday.com.
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:02.160]   Not safe for work.
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:03.160]   Not safe for work.
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:04.400]   Not safe for work.
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:05.480]   But simply the funniest thing.
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:06.840]   I'm not going to say the funniest podcast.
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:09.520]   I'm going to say the funniest thing anywhere.
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:11.160]   It is really great.
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:12.160]   A must listen.
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:15.280]   Merlin is the star of that along with Scott Simpson and Lonely Sandwich.
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:18.220]   I feel like if you take a fart joke and add a Voltaire reference, it really takes a
[01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:19.220]   time.
[01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:20.220]   That's really a very good description of it.
[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:23.040]   It's exactly what it is.
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:26.040]   It's bathroom humor, but it kind of bias these.
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:28.000]   It says bathroom humor with a master's degree.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.000]   Yeah.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000]   There you go.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.000]   I think that's a good slogan.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.960]   Of course, you can catch all the great work that Mr. Alex Lindsey does.
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:36.400]   Soon to be a Petaluma, I think.
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:38.400]   We're going to turn this into a media center.
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:39.400]   Exactly.
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:40.400]   You and me alone.
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:41.400]   Yeah.
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:42.400]   It's up there.
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:43.400]   You know, go to pixelcore.com.
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:44.400]   That's a beauty.
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:45.960]   You don't have to know where Alex lives.
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:47.920]   You just have to know where to find him on the net pixelcore.com.
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:52.480]   And for the podcast pixelcore.tv this weekend, photography excellent.

[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:26.000]   I was wondering now we were talking about that and I hadn't gone up to Twitter.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.000]   Holic for a while.
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000]   I was wondering.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:32.000]   Now that now that Barack Obama is the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party, I can safely
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.520]   say I have more Twitter followers.
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:36.520]   But Kevin Rose.
[01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:40.640]   I think I think he should start talking to you about you know, there's a VP position.
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:42.520]   I think I should be VP.
[01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:45.440]   You have you have this following that he has to be ready.

[01:58:52.280 --> 01:58:54.000]   He'll be the VP.
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.520]   I think I think Twitter should be like that's how you vote.
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:58.520]   Yeah, I think it's great.
[01:58:58.520 --> 01:58:59.520]   I hope that's much.
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:01.520]   The people have spoken.
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:04.520]   It's me and Kevin Rose going to run the country.
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:05.520]   Oh, that is scary.
[01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:08.480]   It's got beaten by CNN CNN.
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:09.480]   What?

[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:11.480]   They're coming back.
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:12.480]   That's okay.
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:13.480]   I got all the followers I need.
[01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:14.480]   I don't need anymore.
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:16.520]   That's not because then you get into people who read the bars raised.
[01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:18.280]   I need to I'm lowering expectations.
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:21.280]   I can't tell you you're you think you're being silly.
[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:22.760]   You're absolutely right.

[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:26.720]   I think every time I say something 40,000 people are going to see it.
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:29.080]   That's completely claimed me up.
[01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:32.320]   You know, for me, it's not about the number of followers.
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:36.800]   It's about the amount of value and service that I can give to the people who've entrusted
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:41.360]   this time during the day towards following my 140 character tweets.
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:42.360]   It's a covenant.
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:43.360]   God bless you.
[01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:44.360]   God bless you.
[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:46.440]   And for your important work, God bless you.
[01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:47.440]   God bless Twitter.
[01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:48.720]   God's following me on Twitter.
[01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:51.040]   I know he's on my side.
[01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:52.040]   That's over.
[01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:53.040]   Over her.
[01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:54.040]   I totally created the universe.
[01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:55.440]   That's by the way.
[01:59:55.440 --> 02:00:00.160]   Twitter.com/the God as opposed to the phony God.
[02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:02.200]   Make sure you follow the right God.
[02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:03.200]   Totally different guy.

[02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:07.480]   He and Stephen Colbert.
[02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:11.920]   You know, I think what was what major magazine thought that Stephen Colbert on Twitter was
[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:14.880]   the real Stephen Colbert and then they had to issue a retraction.
[02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:18.440]   All right, we're going to take a break, but we'll be back in about five minutes with
[02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:22.200]   the with ours five and six of Mac break weekly.
