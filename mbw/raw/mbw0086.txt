[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.720]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the time we get together every week
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.320]   with Macintosh Insiders to talk about what's going on inside Apple Computer.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.840]   Around the round table today from the Chicago Sun Times and the Celestial Waste
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.160]   of Band with CWOB.com, Mr. Andy, I have no idea how to spell his name in NOCCO.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.320]   >> Hello there, Leo.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.120]   >> Ironically, that's a mnemonic for how to spell your name.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.640]   >> Exactly.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.320]   Although the word mnemonic is also a mnemonic because if you pronounce it mnemonic,
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.800]   you will remember how to spell it.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.080]   >> Oh, so let's say mnemonic from mnemonic now on.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.160]   >> Yes, a bonus syllable for adding extra value for our podcast listener.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.440]   >> One extra syllable for absolutely nothing.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.840]   What a--
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.240]   >> And passing the savings on to you.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.640]   >> Exactly.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.800]   >> That's the kind of guys we are.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.480]   >> That's Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Corpse.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.440]   >> Hello, hello.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.680]   >> And DP Matt is now out.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.320]   >> We just released it today.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.680]   What is it?
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.480]   >> So DP Matt is basically taking the stuff that we were doing with DV Matt.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.920]   So all the video green screen stuff and we put it into aperture.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.000]   So now you can-- if you shoot someone in front of green screen with a still camera and you're
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   in aperture, you can put them over the background, you can knock the green screen out really,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.240]   really easily and quickly and even blur the background a little bit so you get that perfect
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.640]   little portrait look.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.320]   And it's pretty nifty.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.840]   I mean, we--
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.680]   >> Can I get an NFR copy?
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.520]   >> Of course.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.040]   >> Of course.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.440]   >> How many Alexes is it?
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.600]   If you don't have friends at PixelPore.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.560]   >> Sorry?
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.520]   >> How many Alexes is it?
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.040]   If you don't have friends at PixelPore's.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.040]   >> Yeah, so it's-- but it's pretty--
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.320]   >> How expensive-- you can't hear me, can you?
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.240]   How expensive is it?
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.360]   >> Oh, you were breaking up.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.080]   So I heard--
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.560]   >> Well, first of all, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.240]   >> So it is $69, but we're going to--
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.440]   >> Wow.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.160]   >> --for the next 10 days, it's going to be $49.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.200]   >> It's a 10th of an Alex.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.600]   Wow.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.280]   >> It's very inexpensive.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.440]   We really wanted to make this-- it's the first plugin for aperture.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.960]   So we're very excited about the plugin architecture for aperture.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.000]   >> Yeah, you got a lot of cooperation from Apple, of course.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.480]   >> We did.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.160]   We-- a lot of cooperation.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.720]   I mean, I think that's one of the benefits of jumping on early.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.680]   >> You did.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.480]   >> No, no, we did.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.680]   We were going back and forth going, oh, can we have a little bit of--
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.160]   >> Oh, wow.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.800]   >> And we got tons of support from Apple.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.000]   >> That's kind of unexpected.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.440]   That's good to know.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.120]   >> They're really aggressive about getting this plugin architecture ready to go
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.920]   and getting it out there.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.680]   And so-- and they've been super supportive of what we've been doing.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.640]   So in fact, I think, if anything, they're pushing us along.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.960]   You know, to get it out quickly.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.760]   So I think they're very excited about the SDK, and I'm very excited about it.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.160]   I think we're going to see-- I mean, the cool thing about it is,
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.200]   is that it's really just cocoa.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.000]   You can put an entire application into aperture.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.240]   And I think that that's going to be-- we're looking at getting conduit in there.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.000]   Obviously, we have HDR toner coming out, probably in May.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.960]   And we have a ton of other applications, because we can pretty much do anything we want.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.200]   You know, it just sits inside of aperture.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.440]   And so we get the photos from aperture and send it back to them.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.080]   It's really-- it's a really open-- >> Oh, that's a nice architecture.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.080]   >> --vesti-k.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.640]   >> Oh, that's--
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.840]   >> Yeah, I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.240]   >> And the guy who's biting his tongue, because I haven't introduced him yet,
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.800]   and just wants-- is dying to get into this conversation.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.920]   Mr. Scott Born from pedango.com.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.560]   And he's, of course, the host of the Apple Phone Show and the new TWIP,
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.600]   which is a-- I was on this week, this week in photography.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.800]   Hello, Scotty.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.560]   Hey, I wasn't biting my tongue.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.600]   I was trying to recognize and understand all those acronyms, Alex.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.280]   He has a company-- besides the Pixel Core, there's a company called DV Garage,
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.200]   which is actually how I first got to know you,
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.440]   because you were coming in with DV Garage applications.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.480]   >> Right.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.080]   >> Inexpensive 2 and 3D applications for video,
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.080]   and I guess for stills too now.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.120]   >> Right.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.920]   >> And their MAT program is absolutely killer.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.360]   I mean, there's nothing better out there.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.160]   >> How was it the first DV Garage meeting I want to point at?
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.960]   >> Were you?
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.000]   >> It was.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.800]   >> I mean, like this is what we're going to do meeting.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.160]   >> Scot's been there for since literally day one.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.360]   >> I've been an advisor.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.040]   >> I didn't know that.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.600]   That's so good.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.720]   So that's how you know Scott.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.000]   >> That's how I know Scott, because you know Scott,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.480]   and now I know Scott, because you introduced me to Scott.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.920]   And actually, Scott and I met a year and a half ago at Macworld Expo,
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.960]   and at that time, you were an aperture expert.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.240]   I think your timing is a little off.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.400]   We met like two and a half years ago.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.080]   >> Aperture was just coming out.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.000]   >> Right.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.520]   >> That's when we physically met, although we lived a parallel life
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.680]   where we nearly bumped into each other first.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.080]   >> Yes.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.560]   >> Yes.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.360]   >> Actually, he and I are really the same person.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.400]   >> Twin sons.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.640]   >> I think someday we should recreate the nocosseo experience for.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.600]   [laughter]
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.080]   >> I don't know.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.120]   I don't know if I can handle it.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.520]   I think my DNA is now permanently altered.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.320]   >> That could be the name of a video game.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.400]   >> The nocosseo experience.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.440]   >> Oh, I like it.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.400]   >> That's good.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.880]   >> I get junk mail address to Enochio.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.080]   >> I like to think of Scott as the Tommy Bahama version of Leo.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.280]   >> I love Tommy Bahama.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.760]   I'm becoming the Tommy Bahama version of Leo myself.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.720]   >> I know me too.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.640]   >> When I was in Vegas at NAB, I dropped about a new store.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.600]   >> Wow.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.000]   >> I got Tommy Bahama-Kafay there now.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.200]   >> Oh, man.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.240]   >> Oh, is this?
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.280]   >> I got you.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.680]   >> So basically, it's the middle aged male version
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.120]   of the American Girl store.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.920]   >> Exactly.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.880]   >> Yes.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.480]   >> I'll go even further for you, Andy.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.840]   What it is is it's the old guy's version of grandimals.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.000]   [laughter]
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.880]   >> Exactly.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.080]   When you have prints and patterns that don't match with anything,
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.920]   they technically match with everything.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.720]   >> If you buy stuff, Tommy Bahama always works together.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.520]   So you don't even have to bother with the frog, frog,
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.160]   you know, a bear, bear, giraffe, giraffe model.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.640]   >> And just like at the American Girl doll store,
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.880]   the middle aged man at Tommy Bahama's,
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.720]   bring their dolls with them.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.440]   They're walking talking dolls, but just as lovely.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.320]   All right, let's move on to some Mac news.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.720]   As usual, we move the show to Wednesday.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.880]   Apple moves its news to after the show is done.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.200]   >> Yeah, well, to the conference call after the show,
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.280]   Apple quarterly results will be announced
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.640]   after the close of the market today,
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.960]   which means right when the show comes out.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.000]   Gosh darn it.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.480]   It's as if they're targeting us.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.840]   >> Well, I can summarize for you without hearing it.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.320]   Do you know?
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.560]   Well, now first of all, what are the analyst expectations?
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.160]   I don't know the exact numbers, but everybody's very high.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.440]   They're putting the put number on the stock
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.760]   as all the way back up around 175.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:27.760]   >> Really?
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.480]   >> This is a Thompson Financial surveyed, the analysts,
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.120]   they say on average $1.07 a share earnings
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.640]   on $6.95 billion in revenue.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.120]   This is for the three-month period ending in March
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.680]   compared to management's guidance.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.560]   As usual, Apple underselling its performance of $0.94
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.760]   cents and $6.8 billion.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.720]   Consensus estimates for Mac, iPod, and iPhone unit sales
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.040]   are respectively $2.1 million,
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.280]   Macs, $8.5 to $10 million,
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.480]   iPods, $1 to $2 million, phones.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.280]   Does that match what your expectations are, Mr. Scott Bourne?
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.400]   >> Yes, it really pains me that I no longer own Apple stock
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.920]   because after I sold it at $2.99 or $1.99,
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.360]   at the peak, I might add,
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.720]   I wish I could have bought back in at about $1.30 and $1.35.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.440]   I certainly would have, but legal reasons, I can't do it,
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.000]   but I got to tell you, I'm just dying here
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.280]   because I think they're doing fine.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.600]   >> Piper Jeffries target, $250.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.240]   >> Yep.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.440]   >> City groups target, $212.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.560]   Those are the highs.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.840]   There are some as low as $160.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.480]   That's a--
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.680]   >> The basic price is about $1.85 and that's realistic.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.080]   Puts pretty much reflect what,
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.680]   I mean, that's the market's collective wisdom
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.040]   on what it's going to be, right?
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.600]   >> Right.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.520]   So we figure it's going to hit there,
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.800]   and I would say that makes for a conservative estimate
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.680]   of what they could do,
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.400]   but the bottom line is they're reasonably healthy
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.520]   in a down economy when a lot of people are struggling
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.760]   and for people who like Mac and Tasha's,
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.360]   and I'm guessing most of our audience do,
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.800]   since they listen to this show,
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.680]   I think it's good news,
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.560]   their market share numbers are what have me kind of pinging.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.240]   They've just really increased the market share consistently.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.800]   >> Yeah, actually, what I find interesting in general is that
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.840]   tech is actually doing pretty well in this down market.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.960]   Dell and Apple sales up dramatically this past quarter.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.520]   This information came out last week.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.000]   >> Well, that's because Dell went lying about the fact
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.280]   that you can no longer get XP.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.800]   [LAUGH]
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.920]   We'll sell XP.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.600]   We'll sell whatever you want.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.000]   Apple didn't well in the US as usual with Apple.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.240]   International sales are not great.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.880]   That's a real place Apple could grow, isn't it?
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.200]   >> Yeah, it's kind of interesting,
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.600]   especially the iPhone stuff has looked a little weak
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.960]   in some of the foreign markets.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.560]   So we heard that they're going to go into Italy now
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.560]   with a subsidized phone.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.200]   >> Another thing to realize though,
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.160]   is that when you look at Apple exporting their hardware
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.120]   to a lot of these other countries,
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.800]   and I deal with this in Africa,
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.680]   is that because the computers are not being made locally,
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.960]   what you end up with are some very high prices,
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.000]   comparatively.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.520]   >> Ah, the exchange rate.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.320]   Now that the dollar's so weak though, that should improve.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.920]   >> That should even out, but it's not just exchange rate.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.880]   It's the way Apple handles resellers, I think.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.640]   A lot of times there's a one stop.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.840]   So for instance, in Africa,
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.840]   Apple sells to this company called Core,
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.440]   and then Core sells it to the,
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.640]   and everybody's getting their little 25 or 30%.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.040]   And so it ends up, you end up spending,
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.360]   it's 50% more or at least 25 or 30% more
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.840]   to buy something in some of these foreign markets,
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.840]   which I think, and then when you talk about PCs,
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.280]   people are just building them.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:43.920]   You know, there.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.040]   And so you can buy a PC for $800 or an iMac for $2,200
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.640]   or something, and it's just painful.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.840]   So I think that's probably what Apple's--
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.080]   >> That's something to underscore.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.400]   PCs are basically a commodity.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.200]   By which I mean, brand is irrelevant in the PC marketplace,
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.760]   just like, you know, bacon, you know, workbellies.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.200]   It's a commodity.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.560]   It doesn't have a branding.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.920]   You can buy componentized parts, put it together,
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.680]   and you've got a beige box.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.040]   >> Well, you got a beige box that works
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.320]   until the next service pack update.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.280]   [laughter]
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:15.920]   I mean--
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.880]   >> Well, yeah.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.560]   >> Are you-- do you think that it's better
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.160]   if you're a PC buyer to buy a brand name?
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.440]   >> Especially if it's a brand like HP,
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.000]   which has now their printer support kind of bites.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.080]   But when it comes to supporting desktops,
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.120]   I have HPs here in the office that are three years old
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.240]   that had a driver issue,
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.680]   and I was able to go to the website,
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.760]   find exactly the solution that I needed,
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.840]   download all like the copyrighted software
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.080]   that I needed to make it work again and get it working again.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.160]   Whereas if you're in a build to build your own situation,
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.280]   or if you're going by someone who just got their six-month degree
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.720]   at a junior college and sold you a machine out of $300 discount
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.920]   off what you can get it best by,
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.680]   you'll really be up a creek because there's so many situations
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.080]   on a Windows machine where it's gee,
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.520]   I can either have the next eight weeks of my life back
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.040]   and a working machine for eight weeks
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.920]   and just buy a new machine, or I can try to troubleshoot this.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.760]   >> I usually send people to Dell for that reason,
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.640]   just because it's kind of--
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.800]   they seem to all kind of be working together very well.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.920]   >> Dell and HP are really good.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.600]   I mean, we don't really appreciate what a really great gift
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.880]   we have as Mac users.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.640]   We have someplace within driving distance
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.400]   for almost everybody in this country.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.600]   We can drive someplace,
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.760]   and someone will try to fix our machine for free.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.040]   >> But that's a change, isn't it?
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.120]   I mean, that's a 180 degree change
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.160]   from the way it was even five years ago in the Mac marketplace.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:30.960]   >> Exactly.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.120]   Well, it's very free at the Mac marketplace,
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.800]   even now, I mean, it's just such an aberration that, again,
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.840]   I'm just very, very glad that I have like two or three different
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.680]   PCs here in the office because there have been times
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.240]   when I've gotten an old machine out of the closet
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.800]   because it's not something that I could fix within two hours.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.040]   And then eventually I realized that I'm not going to take it down
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:54.960]   to the freak squad and pay them $130 to, again,
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.080]   take a look at all my pictures, take all my MP3s,
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.160]   and then instantly fix my video grab.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.680]   >> I read an article, by the way, this weekend
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.840]   that that's exactly what they do.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.320]   >> Yeah, that's not new.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.960]   I mean, you have to sort of expect that everyone gets-
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.280]   >> Anything on your hard drive now belongs to them.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.080]   >> Yeah, no, you have to actually, it's not a joke.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.200]   You have to expect that if you take a PC down to,
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.600]   let's not tar one service.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.480]   Let's just-
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.600]   >> Anybody.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.320]   >> Let's also insulate ourselves from litigation, perhaps,
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.280]   by saying that you have to sort of expect that if you take a machine
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.400]   and one of these services, everything that's on that machine
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.120]   is up for grabs, period.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.840]   >> So I just got an email, we were talking about this in security now.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.040]   Well, actually, we will talk about it in security now tomorrow
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.600]   because we prerecorded the show from a mechanic
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.480]   who says, "I work for an unnamed mechanic shop in Southern California,
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.720]   but just want you to know, the first thing the mechanics do
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.440]   when they get a car in is they rip all the CDs,
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.200]   they check if there's a laptop in there, they see what he says,
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.440]   "The mechanics I know have huge collections of software
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.320]   they've taken from laptops, music they've ripped from seat."
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.440]   >> This is a car mechanic?
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.320]   >> Car mechanics!
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.840]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.960]   >> So just be aware.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.360]   >> Alle, you need a valet key for your car.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.600]   >> Yeah, and put everything in the trunk and valet key, you bet.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.240]   Anyway, I know I blank out my computer anytime I take it in.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:16.720]   >> It's a good idea.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.040]   >> Even if it's Apple, I'm just like, yeah.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.200]   >> So PC sales, this came out,
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.160]   Gartner Group's analysis of this came out a week ago,
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.200]   ahead of the actual announcements from Apple.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.520]   But according to Gartner Group, Dell sales up 21.8% worldwide,
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:38.240]   Apple sales up 32% in the US last quarter, 32%
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.320]   according to Gartner Group.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.120]   >> Crazy!
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.080]   Crazy, man.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.240]   >> Now they didn't give worldwide sales for Apple,
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.360]   basically I think because it's just a non-entity, right?
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.080]   And worldwide.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.440]   >> Well, and here's the thing, I believe,
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.640]   now you guys can correct me, I'm not sure if this is just laptop,
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.560]   but last number I saw was the laptop market share was 20%.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:58.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.160]   >> No, I think that--
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.480]   >> Well, I have to say you really see it in the airport.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.920]   When you're in the airport or in a plane,
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.280]   you just see max everywhere.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.560]   >> They're now estimating that in January,
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.760]   Apple's market share was 6%.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.800]   >> 6%.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.400]   >> February sales grew 60% year over year.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.560]   >> That's overall market share.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.040]   >> Overall market share, not laptop only,
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.080]   but overall market share.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.400]   And I think you're right, I think in the laptops,
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.240]   Apple's even more--
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.840]   >> Yeah, the last numbers I saw about a week ago were 20%
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.840]   of the laptop market was that.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:29.920]   >> That's great.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.640]   >> Now, are we seeing the Vista bump here?
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.360]   >> Yeah, we might be.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.960]   >> I mean, I think--
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.560]   >> Should Apple be cutting a check to Microsoft
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.280]   for helping it to sell so many more machines?
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.040]   That can't be a coincidence that the year that Microsoft
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.040]   tried to twist everybody's arm into switching to Vista
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.400]   is the year that Apple has had one of the most valiant
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.880]   and wonderful leaps forward in market share
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.800]   in the past five or six years.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.560]   >> You know, I think it might be the straw
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.400]   that broke the camel's back and it glotted--
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.720]   >> Yeah, you also have to send a check to the hackers.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.320]   >> I mean, I think I would--
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.640]   I would bet you that any market share growth Apple's
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.360]   experiencing at least 90% of it comes from people
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.840]   who are just sick to death of spyware and viruses
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.120]   on the windows side.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.200]   >> But I know it's not just for me, it's not just PCs.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.480]   I mean, when I--
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.360]   for my VMware, you know, I went out and specifically had
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.200]   to look around a little bit to find the--
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.400]   to avoid Vista.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.000]   >> Yeah, Vista doesn't run well in emulation, I don't think.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.280]   >> I mean, I just didn't--
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:29.760]   I just didn't--
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.480]   >> XPS better.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:30.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.760]   >> I was like fine.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.320]   I was just fine with XP, you know, to do that for me.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.360]   >> Yeah, I'm stuck in the--
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.640]   >> You guys scared by-- you know, you--
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.000]   I think we talked a little bit about--
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.200]   maybe I was in Australia, but that Ponda owned contest.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.720]   They had a Cansec West in Vancouver.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.120]   They took three machines, a Vista machine, a Mac machine,
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.920]   and a Ubuntu machine, unmodified, you know,
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.440]   stock machines with all the updates,
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.240]   but no additional modifications.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.720]   And they said, look, if you own it in the first day,
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.200]   you win 10,000, you know, hack it, take over, root it.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   If you own it, I don't say root it much
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.640]   because I understand in Australia,
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.160]   that means something completely different.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.040]   But if--
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.000]   >> Leo?
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.720]   >> Yes.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.160]   I said thank you.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.600]   [laughter]
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.040]   Although it really doesn't mean anything different.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.720]   It means exactly the same thing.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.600]   But if you've--
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.400]   [laughter]
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.520]   If you've rooted--
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.160]   if you root the machine in the first day,
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.800]   you get the machine and 10 grand, I think it was.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.240]   Second day, you just get the machine.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.560]   Nobody could hack it--
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.680]   but in the first day, you have to do it
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.440]   only with the operating system.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.480]   >> It was--
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.160]   >> Second day, you could do it with operating system
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.920]   and applications that come with it.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.760]   And that was the day the Mac got hacked.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.080]   A fellow used Safari to surf to a website
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.920]   he'd prepared with a known exploit on it.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.880]   And actually took over the Mac--
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.640]   Mac was actually the first to get hacked.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.480]   Vista got hacked on the third day
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.960]   with third party apps using a flash exploit.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.520]   But does that--
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.160]   I mean, now Apple, by the way, on the last patch cycle,
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.080]   did patch that Safari bug.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.120]   But I don't think--
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.920]   does it worry you guys that we may be living
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.960]   in a fool's paradise saying,
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.080]   "Oh, we're so secure here?"
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.400]   >> Well, I've always said that--
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.200]   I've always thought that one of the worst parts of the Switcher
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.600]   campaign has always been the greatest security
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.640]   of the Macintosh.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.520]   And that is very true.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.320]   I mean, you don't have to really deal with viruses and spyware
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.240]   and all that sort of nasty stuff.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.480]   But a lot of that is simply due to the fact that
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.000]   writing malware is a classic marketing problem.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.200]   They run this like a business.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.800]   And if you want to create a product--
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.560]   and you put hundreds of thousands of dollars
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.600]   in developing this product,
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.400]   i.e. a really, really good exploit
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.120]   that will get--
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.200]   that will create a build a zombie network
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.440]   and steal credit card numbers and that sort of thing.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.960]   If you want to put all that investment
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.000]   into creating this product,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.640]   do you want to deploy it on 80% of the machines
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.960]   out there or just 8% of the machines out there?
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.920]   And that's always been the biggest asset
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.920]   that we've had protecting us as Mac users.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.360]   And Apple, although they're doing a good job
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.840]   creating an operating system that's resistant to attacks,
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.040]   they're not as good at shutting the door on weaknesses
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.000]   as soon as they're exploited.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.400]   I mean, they're--
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.320]   >> Well, it's just--
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.560]   I think this is where Apple's lack of engineering
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.880]   or not lack, but Apple doesn't have as much engineering talent
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.520]   as they'd like to have.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.240]   I think that's pretty--
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.560]   >> I think it's more of a cultural thing
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.360]   where they don't have--
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.480]   they're so used to the idea that Macs are safer
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.760]   for whatever way of that.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.520]   They don't have that big stable.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.680]   Look, we got eight really bad MFers in Apple
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.000]   whose only job it is to find weakness.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   It's in the OS and shut them down.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.600]   It's more like, well, we'll put this in the queue.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.520]   There are a lot of things we want to fix for the next bug fix.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.440]   And of course, we will shut down this quick time exploit
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.040]   when they should really be saying,
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.240]   no, we found this on Monday.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.880]   We found a fix for Tuesday and we're pushing it out Tuesday night.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.000]   >> Scott, Borne, you're--
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.440]   I think the only one of all of us--
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.080]   maybe Alex, but it doesn't use any Windows machines.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.840]   Are you afraid that the security you've had in the Mac world
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.280]   is soon to slip away?
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.280]   >> Well, I mean, I'm not afraid,
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.000]   but I mean, I'm cognizant that I've had it good.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.960]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.240]   >> And I do wonder, you know,
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.560]   I'm one of those guys where, you know,
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.680]   they could probably beat me and I wouldn't know I was being beaten.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.160]   I mean, they've busted through to my blog servers a couple of times.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.320]   Of course, they're running Microsoft.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:08.880]   But--
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   >> Well, I'm running Apache and PHP and believe me.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.800]   You know, WordPress is vulnerable.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.720]   If you don't keep it up to date, there's plenty of--
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.200]   look, in the open source world, there are plenty of vulnerabilities.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.480]   Apple is subject to--
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.040]   most of the vulnerabilities I think on the Apple side come from
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.240]   Darwin and BSD and old Linux utilities on there that haven't been updated.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.760]   >> I think Safari--
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.120]   >> I mean, Unix, I shouldn't say Linux.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:31.600]   >> Unix.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.600]   >> Safari has been the common weak link.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.800]   >> Oh, well--
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.760]   >> Let me tell you something.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.240]   In the world in general, the browser is now the vector.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.600]   Used to be email.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.800]   It's the browser now.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.720]   >> So what I've done is I've been searching for these more secure browsers,
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.640]   like Camino and I'm doing--
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.280]   that's sort of my most proactive thing is using it.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.360]   And I'm being very careful about--
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.560]   all my data sits on external drives now, for the most part.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:04.000]   So, you know, I try to isolate stuff that way, and I do wonder about it.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.200]   But the main stuff, like my Ant-phase computer getting bombarded with blue screens and
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:16.320]   all kinds of Adware and malware, I'm not seeing that in our future because you have to open up
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.720]   the Apple architecture quite a bit more than it is to get that done, I think.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.920]   I will say that I tried to, after not being able to talk Ant-Fay into a Mac,
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.400]   tried to buy her a PC, and I did call Dell.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:33.440]   And the guy sat there and lied through his teeth saying XP is no longer available.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.000]   >> Oh.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.040]   >> Can't get XP.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.120]   In fact, Microsoft cut it off six months ago.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:37.600]   >> Oh.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.720]   >> Did I fist--
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.200]   >> No.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.280]   >> And I say, well, look, I'm on the Dell website, and I see you sell XP right here.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.600]   And he was one of those guys that, you know, has always recorded during one of those events,
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.560]   like what happened with Vinnie, when it was a AOL cancel thing.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.920]   They just say, screw you, I'm telling you what it is and blah, blah, blah.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.920]   So of course, I didn't buy the Dell, but they are pushing VIST to hard.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.800]   I don't know if that would or would not have made things more secure, but I went with XP for her,
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:08.480]   and I installed the best software I could find to block that stuff.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.440]   But I do appreciate that we don't have to worry about it right now.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.720]   What's coming around the corner?
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.680]   I don't know.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.960]   >> Well, you realize that what he was saying was at least partially true.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.200]   Microsoft was trying to scare people into abandoning XP by saying, look, we're not going to support
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.080]   this forever.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:27.280]   We have a cut-off date on days that you cannot buy XP in a box package anymore, and a date in
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.240]   which we will no longer be pushing anymore service pack updates.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.760]   And so it was rather revolutionary.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.440]   It really was just this week that they pushed out service pack three.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.120]   Now, they're sort of covering their butts by saying that, well, it's not--
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:44.000]   we're not really continuing to support XP, but we realize that they're the micro PCs,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.960]   like the EPC that work better with XP, don't fist us.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.200]   We're supporting it just for those little machines.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:55.040]   Also, it looks like they got a little bit of a win in that the XO, the one laptop per child
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.640]   PC is now going to be a dual boot machine that runs XP or open source software.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:00.880]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:07.120]   >> But I mean, it was incredible that last year, the year before, I was thinking, you know,
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.520]   this could be the most vulnerable year that Microsoft has ever had, because they're coming
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.120]   out with this operating system. That's a good step forward, but not big enough.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.040]   After five years of laying fallow, the very year that Apple is rolling out,
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:23.760]   yet another really good major update to their operating system, the same year that
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:29.600]   Debian-based Linuxes are becoming usable by normal people, they got to really
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.040]   stick that landing hard or else they're going to find themselves in a situation
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.200]   where they're selling products that no one wants to buy.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   And that turns out to have been pretty much the case.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.800]   Vista is just laying there.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.440]   >> Perfect storm.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.400]   >> Jim Kramer says, "Bap, bap, oh, stop trading. Buy Apple."
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.520]   >> Whatever he says, he says it loud.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.320]   >> He's really loud.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.200]   I wonder how many cups of coffee he has before he's shown.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.040]   >> It's great. You know, it's one of those shows you watch once and go,
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.600]   I can't believe this, but would you watch it every time?
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.000]   Because I just, after a while, isn't it great on you?
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.200]   >> I can't.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.000]   >> I'm listening for information about what to do with my retirement fund, but
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.760]   instinctively I want to start yelling, "Jerry, jerry, jerry, jerry."
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:16.000]   >> At what point does he go across the line into just comic and who would try?
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.880]   I don't trust him. However, he said on his stop trading segment on Monday on CNBC,
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.560]   there is, quote, "a grudging recognition," end quote in the market,
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:30.000]   especially after Nokia's cautious guidance that the iPhone will continue to win among smartphones.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.680]   He said, quote, "The iPhone is huge. And when we get the next iteration, it's going to be game
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:40.400]   set match. There's no stock for sale. They keep buying it up."
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.840]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.640]   >> What do you mean? You couldn't buy it today?
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.520]   >> You can't.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.840]   >> No, he meant you can't buy an iPhone.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.680]   Oh, I thought he meant Apple stock.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.960]   Oh, there's no iPhone in stock.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.400]   >> He tried to buy one as a giveaway at the Apple phone show this week.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.600]   We went down to the main flagship store on Stockton Street,
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.720]   and the guy said, "We ain't got none."
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.200]   >> Apple's finally learned from Nintendo. Don't make so many.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.200]   He also said that a new Mac product, "Conversation."
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.320]   Have you guys heard anything about this?
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.200]   We'll bring Apple to the forefront of instant messaging.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.640]   Kramer said, "The product will be--"
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.040]   I'm reading the article from thestreet.com.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.240]   "The product will be similar to the iPod and its impact."
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.040]   Quote, "The analysts don't see it because the analysts don't use it."
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.480]   >> I don't use it.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.040]   Do you use it?
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.560]   >> He said, "I think this is a gigantic product. What is conversation?"
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.760]   >> Is he thinking, is he thinking iChat?
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.560]   >> What is he thinking?
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.360]   He says, "A new Mac product."
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.880]   I think he's talking about the new iteration of iM for the iPhone.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.920]   >> So Apple's doing something--
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.760]   Mr. Apple Phone show should know this.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.440]   Apple's doing something for the iPhone called "Conversation."
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.320]   >> That's a code word I haven't heard,
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.440]   but they are doing an iM thing for the iPhone.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.640]   Yes, that's a fact.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.880]   And in about six weeks, you'll know that for yourself.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.520]   >> Do you think it's a social network?
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.920]   >> I don't.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.680]   I haven't heard enough about it, truly, no,
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.920]   but I know it's some kind of--
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.720]   they're trying to do some kind of Mashable Meets.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.800]   iM Meets, Twitter Meets, whatever.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.520]   I don't know.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.880]   >> But now that would be interesting,
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.720]   kind of a more Twitter-like iM, huh?
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.720]   >> That's what I'm hearing, but of course,
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.480]   we won't-- it's all rumor until we see it,
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.280]   but I believe we'll have the phone in our hands in six weeks.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.040]   >> So it'll be part of a new phone experience.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.720]   So he says it's bigger than an iPod,
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.840]   which kind of implies to me that it's not just software for the iPhone.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.680]   >> Yeah, I think it could be something that they,
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.680]   to use my friend Andy's word,
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.600]   transmogrify across the line.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.240]   >> What about a sidekick-like device?
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.240]   >> That would be good.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:38.720]   I don't know.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.400]   >> Why would they bother?
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.320]   >> The kids loves the sidekicks, though.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.080]   That's what the sidekick is really about communicating more
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.840]   in typing than in phone.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.800]   And the kids love it.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.520]   I see 20-something--
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.680]   just a lot of them love these sidekicks.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.840]   >> I saw one walk into a pole while sidekicks.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.640]   >> Yes!
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.200]   It's the Blackberry for the younger set.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.840]   >> I don't find myself I need one.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:07.520]   What I need from an iPhone is video and a better camera.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.560]   >> Although I have to say, I would love to see--
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.440]   now that I'm starting to do this live streaming flash stuff,
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.120]   which is imminent the next week or so,
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.760]   I would love to see flash on the iPhones
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.200]   so people could watch this stuff on the iPhone,
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.400]   and they're not going to be able to watch it.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.080]   >> Right.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.120]   If we stream QuickTime--
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.040]   >> That's what you need at H.264 stream.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.160]   >> Well, we could do H.264 flash.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.120]   It looks great, by the way.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:31.680]   We tried it.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.800]   Oh, boy, does it look good.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.160]   >> Well, if they're already converting the video to H.264,
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.400]   you should be able to watch it through a QuickTime player, can you?
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.640]   >> No, it's still flash.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.240]   It's played in a flash wrapper.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.080]   So what it sounds like we should be doing
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.320]   a streaming QuickTime version as well.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.680]   Would that be visible on the phone?
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:49.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.200]   >> If it's just pure H.264, that's recognizable by--
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.080]   >> I'm--
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.760]   >> You know, the iPhone--
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.800]   >> We're thinking of buying--
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.080]   I was going to do this all with Wirecast from Vera software,
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.760]   and I know Alex, you like that a lot,
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.560]   and I know Cali uses it, but it doesn't output flash,
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.120]   so we'd have to output it to another computer.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:07.920]   >> Right. It exports--
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.760]   >> It'll output H.264.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.000]   >> Right.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.680]   >> Which we would then send to another computer
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.040]   to make a flash stream out of it.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.000]   >> It's a new tech thing.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.720]   It's so cool.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.440]   Then you can have--
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.000]   >> You can have--
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.880]   >> That's what we're going.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.080]   >> You can't--
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.440]   >> You are going with the--
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.240]   >> The--
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.000]   >> Tri-caster broadcast--
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.800]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.080]   >> It does flash.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.240]   Will you hire me to push all the buttons?
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:26.720]   >> You want to?
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.760]   Come on, come on up.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.120]   I sat through three presentations--
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.720]   >> Yeah, you sent me a note saying you loved this.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.920]   Tell me about the Tri-caster.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.160]   >> I sat there--
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.640]   I had no interest when I walked by,
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.840]   but I said, you know, I'm tired,
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.520]   I'm going to sit down for a minute.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.600]   I sat through three presentations of things.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.960]   It was mesmerizing.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.320]   For 10 grand, you can do what,
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.680]   like millions of dollars were the equipment used to do at NBC.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.440]   >> I just have to say that I was that.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.840]   I'm not even nameless, but at another--
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.600]   >> On internet, you know, network.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.240]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.520]   >> It was using a Tri-caster,
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.360]   and it was just like--
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.880]   >> Ah, it works.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.440]   >> It--
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.800]   >> I'll name names when it works.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.360]   >> I'll name names.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.240]   I'll name names.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.720]   Patrick Norton used it on DLTV, and they went--
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.440]   >> All done.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.240]   >> They've redone it.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:08.880]   It's got--
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.160]   >> You had an older one, yeah.
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.000]   >> Oh, man, it was just cracked.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.920]   >> So the Tri-caster broadcast takes up to six inputs,
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.520]   plus a computer.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.160]   I need that because I'm going to have at least three cameras.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.520]   And if I had six, I could have cameras all over the building,
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.160]   plus the computer so I can have screenshots,
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.720]   and then outputs anything, including flash, including quick time.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.800]   >> Well, they were showing it, and it's fairly intuitive.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.040]   I mean, I don't know anything about television switching,
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.720]   but I was able to figure out what to do.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.200]   >> Really?
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.840]   >> And I don't know, obviously, it's a new product.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.240]   I don't know if it's stable, but I have to say,
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.240]   it sure looks very cool for $10,000.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.560]   >> It ought to, for $10,000.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.880]   >> I mean, that sounds like a lot of money,
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.120]   but in comparison to not for it's a million-dollar board
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.080]   that you're replacing.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.720]   >> Yeah, I mean, I used to have an office in Minnesota
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.560]   right above Grass Valley switcher.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.560]   >> And they sold effects for the switches for a million dollar.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.040]   >> Right.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.640]   >> That's not the switch before.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.880]   >> No, I just want to put it in perspective
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.600]   that the switcher, the hardware switcher,
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.040]   that's being used up at--
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.000]   that was being used for the lab with Lea, it was 18 grand.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.720]   >> That was a cool little switcher, too.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.320]   >> That was an amazing switcher.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.480]   I mean, it's, you know, and the thing is,
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.160]   is that there is a reason why the software,
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.400]   you know, why you don't use a software switcher,
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.480]   and that is if you have to have it going in and out.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.640]   And if you're doing little podcasts and stuff like that,
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.040]   it's fine, but if you're doing real work,
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.640]   if you're doing real work, the problem is,
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.400]   is that downtime becomes an issue.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:36.640]   >> Right.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.080]   >> You know, any 25 hours--
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.000]   >> 25 hours a week.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.800]   >> Right.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.520]   >> Right.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.160]   >> I mean, it's the downtime of the thing not working.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.760]   That's why people get hardware switchers.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.400]   >> Right.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.000]   >> You know, the hardware switcher always works.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.200]   You plug it in, you turn it on.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.200]   When I'm pushed into a corner of,
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.040]   I know it has to actually get mixed down.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.960]   I have to admit that I don't use software switcher.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.160]   >> But remember, the hardware switcher--
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:56.640]   >> The data vision.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.360]   >> The first--
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.800]   you know, the TriCaster does the whole thing,
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.160]   the hardware switcher,
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.880]   then I need to output that to something that will encode.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.640]   >> Well, that's easy.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.520]   I mean, you go--
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.640]   >> That's the computer, I guess.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.440]   >> I mean, you're--
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.560]   'cause you only have SD.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.840]   >> Right.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.200]   >> You know, so you have a data vision,
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.800]   you know, you can get a data vision hardware switcher,
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.800]   and then have it just go out to a-- I mean, DV.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.200]   It's not--
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.720]   you know, that's not a very expensive--
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.800]   >> Alex laughs like that,
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.280]   because his big brain understands something that--
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.160]   >> I know.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.240]   >> Well, that hardware switcher is about $5,500,
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.440]   and then it's just a hardware switcher,
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.080]   and then it just works.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:28.960]   >> Maybe I should just do that.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.200]   Alex, will you come up here and consult me?
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.000]   >> Yes.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.840]   >> I'm completely baffled.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.720]   I do not know--
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.800]   >> If you get the TriCaster, I can run that one.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.920]   Anything else, I won't know.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.400]   >> Well, you know, I can be funny,
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.000]   is guess who's going to be running it?
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.760]   >> Me, while I'm doing it.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.800]   >> Oh.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.760]   >> I think--
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.080]   >> I think--
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.920]   >> I want to be like that guy on SC-TV.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.960]   What was his name, Jerry?
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.320]   >> Jerry Todd.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.120]   >> Jerry Todd.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:51.920]   >> Jerry Todd.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.480]   >> Jerry Todd.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.600]   >> Play the video for you.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.560]   Here it comes at you.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.480]   >> Oh, wait, I think the Chrome was a little bit off.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.680]   Let me just adjust that right here.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.800]   >> I'm going to be that guy.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.040]   I'm going to be that guy.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.480]   I'm going to be doing my whole TV station.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.360]   I got locked down cameras.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.080]   I'm going to have the switcher.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.280]   It's going to be me, all by myself.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.240]   >> Wait a minute.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.120]   Are we going to have--
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:07.840]   >> Are we going to have--
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.160]   >> Sundays with Leo the port.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.000]   It's going to be a great show.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.440]   Coming on up with just a bit,
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.920]   Scott Borden, Alex Lindsay will be joining us.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.360]   But first, a little music video.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.040]   >> It's coming to me, I think.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.080]   >> Rick Astley.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.600]   >> We're going to rename your studio, The Bunker.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.240]   And it's going to be like the old Charles Groden show in CNBC.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.360]   >> That's exactly it.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.280]   >> You just picture him just putting that little camera
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.160]   on a tripod and then--
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:30.720]   >> It's exactly it.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.920]   >> --solving in the studio for two hours.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.320]   >> Yes.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.560]   >> Uh, oooh jee.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.200]   >> Yes, I'm going to say--
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.800]   >> If you don't donate $5,000 in the next half hour,
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.080]   I'm not going to talk.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.040]   >> No, no.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.600]   >> No, my cat will be strangled.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.440]   >> People think they're doing that.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.360]   >> All right, back to the Mac news.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:47.920]   PayPal--
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.200]   >> Hey, right about news.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:49.760]   >> --back news.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.000]   PayPal was considering blocking Safari users
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.440]   from accessing their website due to that Pwned Own
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.480]   I was talking about.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.560]   Actually, here's why.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.920]   And this is interesting.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:04.000]   You know, this new extended validation certification
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.360]   program that everybody's using,
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:11.360]   an IE7 Opera, Firefox 3, all support this.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.160]   When you go to--
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.040]   go to PayPal, https, colon slash,
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.160]   slash PayPal.com.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.400]   You get a green browser bar because it validates
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.440]   the EV certificate.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.080]   It says, "This is a higher level of validation.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.280]   It's more trustworthy.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.880]   Safari doesn't do it."
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.000]   Now, PayPal has decided they backed down.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.120]   They said, "We're not going to--
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.400]   we're not going to ban Safari,
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.640]   even though they are going to ban other browsers that don't do it."
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.440]   But it raises a good issue,
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.600]   which is when is Apple going to add EV certificate support to Safari?
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.880]   Everybody else does it.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:45.120]   They are blocking IE4
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:50.720]   because on Windows 98, because it is unsafe.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.240]   So do you guys know-- we talked about-- again,
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.680]   this is something we'll talk about on security now,
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.920]   tomorrow, but I didn't know this.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.520]   But GoDaddy will give you a certificate.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.240]   You know, SSL certificate for like 40 bucks.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.760]   And all they do is validate that,
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.800]   yeah, you own that domain.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:03.920]   But you could be anybody.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:04.880]   You could be a phishing site.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.600]   You could be a hacker.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.640]   You could be anybody.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.280]   And because so much of this stuff is now coming in over the internet,
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.840]   over websites with malicious hacks on them,
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:16.720]   there is a need for a higher standard of identity on these things.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.760]   I think people assume they see the lock on the browser,
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.720]   "Oh, it must be safe."
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.400]   Doesn't mean it's safe.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.800]   But now this green bar will.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.120]   And Safari doesn't do it.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.680]   I'm not sure why Apple has not yet supported this.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.040]   Everybody else does.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.040]   Yeah, that's odd because if you look at--
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:37.200]   there's a great website that's supported by the WebKit
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.600]   development team at Apple called Surfing Safari.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.040]   If you go to webkit.org/blog, you'll find it.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.240]   And you read about all these really cool extra goodies
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.280]   that they're wiring up Safari.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.560]   And all these really great--
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.840]   if you hit this blog with Safari,
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.320]   you will see all these cool positioning effects
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.960]   and drop shadow effects and text effects
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.520]   that only Safari supports because it's such an out-there,
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.920]   CSS style that they're the first ones out there.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.160]   And you wonder why they're not first on the scene to support
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.720]   these services that will actually prevent people
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.800]   from stealing all your money and making you go home crying.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.560]   Yeah, so it's surfingsafari.com?
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.120]   Is that what it is?
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:13.600]   Surfins--
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.600]   No, webkit.org/
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.320]   Oh, I love WebKit.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.440]   So are using WebKit or using Safari?
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:24.480]   I'm actually using Safari as a daily browser.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.040]   Basically, I'll show you all these effects.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.280]   If you have Firefox going side by side
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.800]   with just the stock version of Safari,
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.840]   not like a nightly build,
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.560]   not the nightly push of WebKit,
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.200]   you will see the difference between what's possible
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.000]   when you dope up your CSS styles to support Safari browsers
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.080]   versus what gets seen by the ones that are limited
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.080]   to just supporting the styles that have already been ratified
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:48.960]   and really locked down.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:52.080]   Again, there's so many times when I'm just going through
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.320]   my CSS styles and I'm thinking,
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.680]   "Well, geez, I'll just wire this up for--"
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.240]   I know how many people visit my blog from Safari,
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.040]   so it's worthwhile for me.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.480]   So you make it look better in Safari?
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.640]   You make it look really, really cool in Safari.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.280]   But my point is that when I hear about things like this,
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.720]   and when I hear about things like this,
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.000]   that again, it's a really cool--
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:08.400]   It's a really cool--
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.760]   It's important than gradient backgrounds,
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.800]   I gotta tell you.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.280]   And it's, I don't know.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.480]   As a matter of fact, I just hit the site because I was hoping
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.280]   that there'd be some sort of explanation on the blog about,
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.480]   "Well, yes, you heard about this,
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.120]   and you heard about the scare about what PayPal is doing,
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.680]   but here's our reason why we're not doing this just yet,
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.920]   or here's our timetable for implementing this."
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.200]   Because if it turns out to be a stupid Steve thing,
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.240]   where it says, "You know, the motif--"
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.880]   The picture picture me strolling in sandals with my hands
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.520]   sort of pressed together lightly on the edge of the stage.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.840]   "When you think about the consistency
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.600]   of the brushed metal interface,
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.280]   we have to ask ourselves,
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.840]   what is implied by a green bar inside the address window?
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.000]   And we have a better way."
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.520]   Exactly.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.480]   Exactly.
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.560]   But how about you have some high school kid
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.640]   spend 45 minutes putting this in and let us--
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.600]   Do you get--
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.600]   Let us use it the bad way until you come up with a better way.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.880]   I think it's pretty easy to implement.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.200]   I think the SDK is out there, the API is out there.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.800]   It's a very straightforward thing.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.760]   And, you know, I might think it's a fad or not useful
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.120]   if, except for the fact that Opera 9 does it,
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.240]   Firefox 3 does it, and IE7 does it.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:16.640]   It's like--
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.200]   Well, I mean, it could be a hearts and minds issue too,
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.400]   because remember that Safari is the most popular browser
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.120]   for the Macintosh,
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.760]   but the Macintosh is not the most popular computer out there.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.480]   And if someone is spending all of their time on Windows machines
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.440]   and they have learned to trust the color of that address bar,
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.480]   and now they spend a little bit of time on Safari
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.800]   and they realize, "Wait a minute, I'm not seeing that secure thing.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.000]   This must not be as secure a browser as when I'm using a Microsoft."
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:40.800]   And they'd be right.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.920]   But it's not--
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.840]   Now they're also trying to get on the Windows platform
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.640]   with Safari 3.
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.160]   I mean, they really pushed that hard.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.640]   But that's more long range.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:53.680]   I think I'm convinced that the whole idea of having Safari on Windows
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.000]   is just so that they can get a whole new set of APIs,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.040]   a whole new development platform going so that they could basically
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:04.080]   build applications that will run consistently on both the Mac and the PC.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.560]   The idea of having iTunes deployed essentially
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.960]   as a really cool, really slick web page,
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.360]   instead of having to build two different code libraries.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.480]   So two different--
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:16.000]   Oh, so that's why they're encouraging Windows users to do with 3.1.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.800]   I really think that the ongoing development of Safari for Windows
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.840]   is a Trojan horse.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.600]   The nice kind where the people who pile out of the Trojan horse
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.560]   have cakes and cookies and will help you set up your flat screen TV.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.000]   The cake is a lie.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.680]   And they're wearing Tommy Bahamas.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.000]   They actually have all backed down a little bit on that.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.280]   Did you see they changed the way that they pushed the new Safari?
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.400]   If you don't-- it says new--
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.760]   Install new software now.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.040]   It still offers it.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.000]   By the way, Microsoft is coming out with their new browser.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.600]   It has a Helen Keller edition.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.320]   Oh, please.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.000]   What does that mean?
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Has a Helen Keller edition, Scott?
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.720]   Yes, it does.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.440]   And you can't see anything.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.920]   But it's safe.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.040]   It's safe.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.800]   That's the most important thing.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.520]   Did you see Apple?
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.360]   You can't click on it.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.480]   What does this mean?
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.160]   All right, get your crystal balls out.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:13.120]   According to Forbes, Apple just bought a chip manufacturer,
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.280]   actually designer, PA Semi.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.520]   They make PowerPC chips.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.600]   iPhone.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.400]   iPhone.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:20.880]   Exactly.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.560]   PowerPC has always been--
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.680]   from day one has been promoted as a really good mobile processor.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.040]   So who cares?
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.800]   That's the best stuff you're holding on your desk,
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.800]   having your desktop, this stuff, you're going to be carrying your pocket.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:32.880]   Yeah, you don't.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.920]   But they're saying up you to.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.360]   Up yours to Intel, aren't they?
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:41.040]   Well, I think what they're doing is they're either doing an incredibly big gamble with which
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.520]   to go to Intel and say, now, what were the prices again?
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:47.600]   Or they're saying Intel, you're not giving us what we need.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.280]   So we're going to buy somebody who will.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.840]   That is a well-known mobile processor.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:56.000]   And that kind of money invested in that makes me think that iPhone 3 or 4
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.400]   might indeed have some new kind of chip.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.280]   This design apparently is very efficient.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.120]   It's a dual-core chip, 264-bit out-of-order PowerPC processors,
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.960]   two memory controllers, a host of a system on a chip features,
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.360]   including PCI Express and Ethernet controllers.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.160]   This is all on a chip.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:16.320]   And the 2 GHz version only uses 5 to 13 watts.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:16.880]   So you're right.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.440]   This would make more than an iPhone.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.480]   You're talking to ethernet here.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.840]   You're talking to PCI Express.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.520]   This would make a great little handheld computer.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.000]   Not bad for a slight...
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.760]   The new just coming back!
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.120]   Interesting.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.000]   Now with a 4-bit display.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.640]   That press is a miracle.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:42.560]   Well, it's interesting to see Apple getting into chip kind of pulling some of that back
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.400]   into the mothership.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:53.280]   It obviously gives them a chance to, I think, create stuff in their kind of secret environment
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.160]   that they like.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.600]   But it also is pretty risky as far as falling behind.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:01.920]   If you don't, Intel is focused on one thing or fairly one thing.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:08.800]   But that Intel commercial that they did when they announced the Intel relationship is no good
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.200]   anymore.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.640]   And I kind of like that commercial.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.720]   It's very interesting.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.720]   I just like the CEO coming in that big suit.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.120]   They spent 200-7, I know.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.080]   Can we get them back in a bunny suit?
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.040]   I just love that.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.280]   I mean, yeah, when you have $18 billion laying around those,
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.880]   $278 million.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.120]   Chum-chum-chum-chum-chum-chum-chum-chum.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.240]   But if your argument is they're trying to get a better deal from Intel, boy,
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.600]   it'd better be a lot better deal.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.520]   Yeah, well, I mean, I don't really think that I just said that in just.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:45.120]   I think they're planning to take a shot at doing this in-house
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.640]   for iPhone 3 or 4.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.280]   That's just my...
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.840]   I mean, when you spend a quarter of a billion dollars...
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:52.800]   That's a lot of money.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.200]   That's not something you do all well.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.560]   I just got some money laying around.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.920]   I think I'll buy a chip designer.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.040]   And what else?
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.360]   I mean, if it's not going to be the iPhone, Andy's right.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.000]   I mean, it's not something you put in a desktop machine.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.280]   So it's going to have to be some sort of handheld device.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.320]   Well, I think...
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.600]   People might be bored about me keeping on about this.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.000]   But there is a tablet in Apple's future.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.360]   It is not a Macintosh.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.160]   It is like...
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:16.800]   Is it yellow?
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.360]   It is? Well...
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.040]   Oh, it's going to be a little...
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.800]   It's like a contact cold pill.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.880]   Lots of little computers built right in.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.480]   Just breaking apart, shake it over the problem.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.240]   Do they still sell that crap?
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.120]   I mean, that thing.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:30.400]   It was a great commercial.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.600]   No, I don't think so,
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.360]   because that would be an easy thing to basically put nasty killer stuff inside.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.000]   Remember all the people who had it?
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.680]   Oh, the fact that didn't they do that?
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.120]   Or was it content?
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.120]   That was some sort of aspirin.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.000]   That's really cool.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.680]   There was a brand of aspirin that I mentioned.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.640]   Yeah, yes.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.160]   Yeah, they probably are going to sue me now.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.920]   But it actually happens so they can't.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.960]   Exactly.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.200]   Okay, very interesting.
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:51.840]   Very interesting.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.080]   I have to say, I think that might be the story of the week.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.320]   In terms of...
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.320]   People do so much analysis of Apple's patent applications and stuff,
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.120]   but this is real.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.760]   This is a quarter of the billion dollars on some hardware.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:09.600]   But we're still talking about turning the wheel of a really huge tanker ship.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.560]   And we're not going to see where it's actually staring for another year,
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.240]   two or three in the future.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:19.120]   I don't think we ever know where the Apple tanker ship is going.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:22.160]   I think we're all just kind of on it going, look, there's an island over there.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.440]   I've learned that lesson.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.640]   Boy, stay away from the puffin colony on those rocks over there.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.160]   Just please, please, please, Apple.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.920]   We coated a lot of creatures with oil in the 80s and 90s,
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.120]   including a lot of my friends.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.480]   So please, please, please.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.440]   That doesn't mean anything.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.880]   Steady hand, steady hand.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:40.640]   Apple is driving the Exxon Valdez and they don't care where they go.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.680]   And we're all along for the ride.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.560]   I think that's really true.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.120]   I gave up trying a second guest, Steve Jobs.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:47.920]   You just can't.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:54.160]   Well, the only thing you can really count on is that Apple is telling a story of really
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.600]   good well-tailored consistent story with its product line and product.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:58.560]   Yes.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.440]   The character.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:04.640]   So when you talk about, when you speculate about, let's say, a sidekick like device,
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.240]   you ask, well, don't we already have a character like this and the cast of characters?
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.520]   What role would they play in the ongoing story they're trying to tell?
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.720]   And then you realize that, well, no, that's an extraneous character that we get cut from
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.080]   the first draft of the screenplay.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:20.400]   And that is literally every time that I think that I need to decide,
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:26.160]   every time I think I need to figure out what Apple's going, what usually helps me out is to
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.040]   think in terms of, again, a really good writer writing a screenplay.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.720]   You cut out things that are unnecessary.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.960]   You only do things that promote the main storyline.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:37.120]   And Apple, it's delivering content and producing content, pretty much.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:41.360]   And that will pretty much give you a guideline as to what's absolute rubbish
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.200]   and what has a really good chance of being true.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.080]   Yeah, you've said that before.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.440]   And I think you're absolutely right on.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:52.000]   I think that that's actually a very that has been a useful trope so far anyway.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.760]   And that much, I guess Steve Jobs is consistent on it.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:00.720]   I just, I think I'm not saying his vision is inconsistent or odd.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.080]   I'm just saying it's in some way so innovative that sometimes it's hard to.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:04.880]   Oh, exactly.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.560]   I mean, the biggest mistake you can make with Apple is thinking that you know what they're
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:13.200]   going to be doing two years from now because they always have cool stuff that's on the docks,
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.040]   ready to go if they wanted to pursue this.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:19.120]   I mean, this is not the first time that Apple, the iPhone was not the first time that Apple
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.560]   decided to do a handheld device.
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:23.120]   It was just the first one that made it out of it outside of Cupertino.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:23.280]   Right.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.200]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.840]   Come back with our picks of the week.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.880]   I'm sure all of our cast members have some great ones.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.680]   If you've been wondering where Merlin Mann is, he took the week off.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:38.080]   I think he had baby stuff, but he will be back with us next week on the show.
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.560]   And right now though, time to talk a little bit about audible.com.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.840]   Audible is our great sponsor.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.840]   We love audible for its audio books.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:50.560]   Everybody here, you know, some of the shows I have to say there's people like Steve Gibson who
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.800]   like reading on e-book readers.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.800]   Everybody on this show seems to like audio books.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.800]   I think if you listen to podcasts, it's kind of a natural listening.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:04.400]   Once you get those ears going, listening to books is just a great way to get reading done,
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.120]   much more reading done to get those books you've always wanted to read.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.920]   Read in a most pleasurable fashion during those times when you can't do anything else,
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.880]   like when you're stuck in the car, you're at the gym, you're gardening,
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.360]   you're, you know, I listen because I don't drive as much.
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.080]   I don't commute as much.
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.240]   I listen walking to work and I love it.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:24.400]   Gives me 40 minutes a day that I get to listen to my favorite books.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:31.040]   We encourage you if you've not yet tried Audible to take advantage of our special offer audible.com/macbreak.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:34.960]   If you're a new member, you sign up, you'll get a credit toward a free book.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:41.600]   And Annie Inako has some sort of scam. He wants to, he wants to, yeah, usually when I think of a
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:45.360]   book to recommend, I'm either recommending something that I've read recently or I'm looking on my own
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:49.680]   shelves, something I read like in past couple years that I like enough to keep around.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.600]   I decided to take a different tack this time.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:56.640]   If you go to the Audible.com site, you can actually search for the most expensive audiobooks they
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:03.280]   stock. You can search by price. You can search, there's a pop up, a series of like pop up rich
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:07.200]   form you can put in. And you can just simply say the only search term being,
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:12.320]   give me stuff that's at least 40 or 50 dollars. Give me content that's at least 20 or 30 hours
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.760]   per book. And so just going to the advanced search, I see.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:20.160]   And knowing that you get a, is it a free book or just a really big discount?
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:24.800]   It's a credit. Here's the deal now. This is the deal. It's a credit. So if a book is really
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.400]   expensive, it might take more than one credit, but you could tell by adding it to your card,
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.120]   it will tell you what is the most expensive book you can get.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:37.520]   Well, the most expensive one I found, because I got to a certain book, I said,
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:42.560]   oh God, I am so totally recommending this one. But the first, the most expensive one I saw before
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:47.200]   that was like $73, $74. Really? There is a huge like Learn Hebrew.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:51.360]   Oh yeah, the language stuff is expensive because that's many, many, many hours.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:57.520]   You know, we get so much email from our audience, people who would like to learn Hebrew. So that's
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:04.000]   a good pick. Hey, you know, Scoble was just in Israel. So with JD Lassica and a bunch of my other
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.840]   friends, in fact, they invited me and I was in Australia. I couldn't make it. But I think it would
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:13.040]   be useful to learn Hebrew. You better not see people want to learn. Yeah, you're mocking that,
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:19.040]   but I'm serious. I'm just saying, we've just come through this really good, really effective lyric,
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:22.640]   you know, description of how wonderful it is. We're taking your daily walks, your morning
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:27.440]   community. Enjoy the great classics. And now we're talking about scanning audible and learning.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:36.080]   Please open the window. It's a bit cold in here. Don't knock it. That's useful. Please close the
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:44.080]   window. They have a lot of language stuff, actually. That's I would never even mention that.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:49.280]   But what is your recommendation, Andy? There's a book that I just, it's a big one. And it's
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:53.920]   one of the classics among classics that I just finished about a month ago. And it took me about
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.280]   two or three years to get through it because it's one of those things you sort of dip into and out.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:02.400]   But it's you've heard of it. You've heard the title. It's the decline and fall of the Roman Empire.
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:07.040]   Oh my God. Edward Gibbon. You were probably, if you're unfortunate, you were probably forced
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:12.320]   to read bits of this in school. Being forced to read something in school will never get you to
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:17.280]   enjoy the book itself. But I picked it up at a bookstore because it's something that I've
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:23.680]   always heard about, never actually read. And just kept delighting in the language. It was written
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:32.560]   about 100 years ago, I believe, and it has this really wonderful, formal, highly crafted language
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:37.840]   in it that you just want to reread a page you just finished because you've just read something
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:42.720]   that's so pretty. I'm going to read to you. This is just three sentences from the first chapter.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:46.640]   And it's probably, if I had to come up with a list of the 100 most beautiful things I've ever
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:50.400]   written print. This is it. And this is this is not fiction. This is nonfiction. This is how
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.440]   interesting true story and how entertaining history can be.
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:59.760]   Sorry, as after a war of about 40 years undertaken by the most stupid,
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:04.400]   maintained by the most dissolute and terminated by the most timid of all the competitors of all
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:09.200]   the emperors, the far greater part of the island submitted to the Roman yoke. The various tribes
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:14.000]   of Britain possessed valor without conduct and the love of freedom without the spirit of union.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.640]   They took up arms with savage fierceness. They laid them down or turned them against each other
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:23.920]   with wild inconsistency. And while they fought singly, there is excessively subdued, neither the
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:28.320]   fortitude of a craicicus, nor the despair of bodacious nor the fanaticism of the druids could
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:33.120]   avert the slavery of their country or resist the steady progress of the imperial generals who
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:38.240]   maintained the national glory while when the when the throne was disgraced by the weakest or the
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:44.960]   most vicious of mankind. I love that. There's a lot in there. Just that one sentence tells you an
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:50.720]   awful lot about why the Romans were able to subjugate Britain. That's fantastic. Exactly.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.040]   And you could you could change a few verbs around and put that into a blog post and you get linked to.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:00.000]   Finally, man, someone understands the way things are today. Well, when you started,
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.840]   I thought it was a description of the Iraq war, actually, but I'm glad you it changed.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:09.920]   Yeah, I mean, if you're right for living, the message of that paragraph is I suck as a writer,
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:16.000]   because it's just so again, you just time it. One of the reasons why I took me so long to get
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.120]   through it was again, because it is a long book. This is a $42 audiobook in the volume one.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:24.720]   That's volume one. That's just volume one. If you want to get the abridged version,
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:29.920]   that's still 22 hours long. Wow. But 120 hours for the first three volumes.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:37.040]   This is real, sit in the car and just touch the previous track button. And I just want to hear
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:42.080]   the last two minutes of this read to me again, because it is just such wonderful language.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:49.520]   Very famous quote when Gibbon gave the second volume of his book. I think there's seven or eight
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:56.880]   volumes total. When he gave the second volume to the Duke of Cumberland, after writing it,
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:01.520]   very Duke of Gloucester, I'm just guess very famous quote. He says scribble scribble scribble
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:07.200]   a mister given. But more than scribbling, it sounds really good. So you would recommend listening
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:12.160]   to this? I recommend listening to it. I did read it in print and I'm sorry, I was off by only
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:18.480]   about 130 years. It was written in the mid 1700s, believe it or not. Boy, it sounds more contemporary
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:21.840]   than that, I have to say. Exactly, which surprise the hell out of me? Because I've read a lot of
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:26.960]   literature from the 1600s and 1700s. And it's like, it looks like it was translated back from
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:31.440]   some one of those butterfly effect worlds where it's English, but not quite English, as we understand
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:37.600]   it. And I did wind up actually downloading parts of it, parts of this audiobook. They do pretty
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:41.840]   long samples you can listen to. And I did find myself just really again, leaning back in the chair
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:47.440]   and just enjoying the language. It's read by an narrator by the name of David Case. I'm not
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:53.360]   terribly familiar with him, but it is a really good reading. And again, you're not, and we're
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:57.680]   also glossing over the fact that it actually does teach you about one of the most important
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:02.800]   empires in human history. Well, I think it might be timely. I mean, I often think, I often wonder
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:09.600]   if we are at the stage of decline of the American empire that the Roman Empire was at towards the
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.520]   end, I often wonder that. Yeah, this week's episode. This week's episode. Go ahead.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:18.880]   Well, let me also say that this is the, you know, the United States is the oldest surviving
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:24.320]   government right now. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of reason to pay attention to books like this.
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:30.400]   I just, I just heard a statistic. We have more people, more of our population in prison than any
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:37.280]   other country in the world by a factor of like five. Well, you know, someday in a perfect world,
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:41.280]   according to some people, everybody will either live at prison or work at prison.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:45.920]   We're getting there, you know, in Germany, which I don't think the Germans are, is it
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:51.760]   their less law? I don't know what it is, but the Germans are 66 people per 100,000 citizens are in
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:59.280]   jail. In the United States, it's 275 per 100,000 citizens. I mean, it's four times greater. And I,
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:04.960]   I often think maybe we are at some sort of era of decadence. This would be very, that's why history
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:10.800]   is so important. It's just, it's just the drug laws. I mean, that's, well, I suspect a lot of them are,
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:15.280]   no, it's the free medical care. I mean, have you looked at what it costs to go to a dark?
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:19.760]   It's cheaper than the prison. Get three square meals a day and then medical care.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:23.840]   There's that, there's that Edward Gibbon, the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, Andy has
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:32.480]   picked an amazing 41 hour tome. And just to build on that, I am still digging through the Spartans,
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:37.680]   you know, the audio book. And I have to say that it is, I'm gonna have to listen to it like three
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:43.440]   or four times, I think. And I'm quite happy to do so. I mean, it really is a fantastic audiobook.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:48.880]   And I'm really, really enjoying it. I think we talk a lot about fiction, but nonfiction is
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:54.320]   really good in audio and onable.com because, you know, it's, it's, you really feel like you're
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:58.640]   learning something, you know? Yeah. I'm guessing that people will listen to a 41 hour audiobook,
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:05.120]   because this show often goes 42. We prepared them. We trained them. We're working you up to it.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:09.920]   No, but think about it. You know, I had a two hour commute. I would read this book in three weeks.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:17.200]   You know, it's, it's not, or months, you know, it's not coming down to my studio more often.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:20.800]   You can get it done, Leo. I'll show you no kidding. Come visit, come visit Scott. I could finish the
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:25.520]   decline and fall of the Roman Empire, all three volumes before the summer's over. There you go.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:29.040]   If you want to get this, I think this is one credit. I don't know. We'll have to check. But if
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:35.440]   you want to get this or credit toward this or any of Audibles, 45,000 plus books. Yes,
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:40.880]   of course, it's got classics. It's got fiction. It's got lots of history, lots of nonfiction,
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:46.240]   too, things like blank in the tipping point. I mean, it's a library. It is a library in your
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:50.400]   browser. And if you find a book and you like it, you could download it in minutes, put it on your
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:54.800]   computer and listen on a CD and listen. Yes, you can burn them to CDs. So you can put them in your
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:59.120]   car. You can also put them on almost any portable device, including all the iPods and the iPhone
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:06.400]   as well. It is just a great way to get a wonderful, wonderful books. I can't say enough for Audible.com.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:12.320]   We love having them as a sponsor. Audible.com/MacBreak to get your free credit. We thank them for
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:17.840]   their support. And thank you, Andy, for a great recommendation. I've had that full, whatever it is,
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:23.520]   five, six, seven, eight volume set on my shelf for most of my adult life. And I've only dipped into
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:29.040]   it. I haven't read it. It's overwhelming. Yeah. That's why audiobooks tend to help out. I mean,
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:34.080]   there's no reason to be ashamed. I stared at that brand new copy of Ulysses on my shelf for nine
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:38.160]   years before I said, Andy, I mean, I've got a nose limitation. It's time to give away the
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:45.360]   yeah, I would say I'm the ultimate master of the first four pages of Ulysses. I can, I can almost
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:50.560]   quote it. I felt as though I was living a lie by having that on my shelf. So there was the day
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:55.440]   that almost ceremoniously just took it down, put it, gave it to Goodwill, realizing that
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:59.120]   son, it ain't just it's just not going to happen. You'll be you'll be a better man for admitting that
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:03.440]   you're never going to get past page 10 of Ulysses. Leo Paul Bloom has shaved his face in my life
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:08.160]   about 80 times before. And that's it. You know, no, it's a wonderful book. And then you read the end.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:12.640]   The yes, yes, he said yes. And that's worth it too. Actually, there's a part of Gibbon. I think
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:17.040]   it's in the second volume where he talks about everyday life in Rome, that even if you don't
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:22.480]   want to hear about the wars and the emperors, the everyday life stuff is just fascinating to see how
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:29.360]   they lived. It's really great stuff. This has become such a scholarly show.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:35.600]   I was looking back at my picks for the past three or four weeks. I want to get the listeners
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:39.760]   ready that next week I have especially chosen a trashy novel. Good.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:48.160]   Time to talk. Talk about like chanting, you know, Jerry, Jerry, I've chosen a trash novel for next week.
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:53.280]   Well, I quit. I quit looking for Stefan Audible dot com as soon as I found out they had Playboy.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:56.720]   Do they? Just kidding. That'd be funny, wouldn't it?
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:03.280]   Okay. She's sort of leaning back there. I got the the the handle of the door on her left hand.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:10.160]   I don't know if I press that. There is there are you can't get Playboy for the blind.
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:13.680]   But I don't think they describe the pictures. I really don't.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.840]   But I remember seeing that. I think lighthouse for the blind offers Playboy.
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:23.200]   And when you when you read Playboy that way, you really can say I get it for the art.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.160]   For the article. It's really true. I used to be writing the articles.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:31.040]   Which really put my mom in an odd position. I'll tell you that. Did you write for Playboy?
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:36.720]   I was I sold a feature to them about every five or six months for a couple of years until my
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:41.520]   editor decided to move on to greener pastures. So yeah, so I in my office right now, I have a
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:46.720]   box of nothing but like unopened copies of Playboy that are just copies of issues that I have stuff
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:52.080]   in. And it was tough for my mom because it was it's cool writing for Playboy because they sell it
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:56.800]   to like every international edition and no kidding. The most popular article I wrote for Playboy was
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:01.360]   read by what was put. Let's just say that it was delivered to 25 million people worldwide. I'm not
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:05.520]   sure if it was read by 25 million people. And so my mom was trying to figure out how to how to boast
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:11.360]   to the church ladies about. That is extremely prestigious writing for Playboy. I mean,
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:18.400]   I'm I had no idea Andy. I wrote two Playboy once. Those letters I know. Yeah.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:25.200]   That's that Mr. Born. That's a different magazine. Sorry. What did you what what what
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:28.640]   features did you write about? What did you run about for a place? Mostly about technology. I
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.920]   would give them like a different pitch like every four or five months about things that are going
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:36.240]   on. Things are that hopefully it will be still valid in the next six or seven months. I was writing
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:41.760]   about new operating systems that are on the horizon when open source really started to get it for its
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:46.160]   first dig. I was writing about how well it's see if people are really really what's the difference
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:50.400]   between a commercial piece of software in character and a piece of software that everybody builds.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:55.200]   What's the weakness of it stuff like that. It's it's it's when you write articles for certain
[00:59:55.200 --> 01:00:00.000]   editors, it usually starts off with a really cool phone conversation. Right. And then you wind up
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.920]   at the end of like 90 minutes realize that Oh, I suppose I should write this down and send it to
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:11.600]   you. Yeah, you should. You got it. Oh, that's great. Well, well, wow, I have a new respect for you.
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:19.120]   I really do. Let's get to our picks of the week and who show a hands who really wants to start this
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:23.120]   one who's so excited or maybe has something that they're afraid the other guys are going to pick
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:29.440]   it so they want to go first. I got a good one. All right, Andrew. And it's a free app. And after
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:35.680]   after stuck in so much about a $10,000, whatever for doing whatever involving the TV box. Here's a
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:42.400]   free here's a freebie that and it's probably it's probably the best. It's a good fit for our
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:48.320]   conversation about about Windows Vista. When you upgrade to Windows Vista, things stop working.
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.800]   You know, at the worst possible time, the worst possible moment, this is an application called
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:01:03.040]   freedom for the Macintosh. Freedom. I'm sorry. Freedom. And it meant to them. And it's a very
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.360]   simple application that does all it does is it turns off all of your networking on your on your
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:12.000]   on your Mac. It turns off the Wi-Fi. It turns off the ethernet. It means that you cannot access
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.240]   email or the web or anything or instant messaging anything. It's you double click on it. It actually
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:23.120]   it doesn't look like a slick sophisticated application. It looks like some Unix command line stuff that
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.760]   has an Apple script studio friend and on it because you launch it and you just get a little
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:33.040]   dial a box that says quote, please indicate how in minutes, how long you would like to run freedom.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:37.520]   How many minutes of freedom would you like? And you type in I want to I really got a crunch on this.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:41.680]   I don't want any distractions. Please turn off my internet for the next two hours. That's a great
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.880]   thing. And turn off all your network connections. You cannot just quit the program prematurely and
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:52.080]   get it back. The only way to turn off your internet access again, it turns your back on again is to
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:58.320]   either wait for the timer to run down or to or shut down and restart. So oh, you can't just turn it on.
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:03.040]   You can't just you again. It's if you keep getting if you keep finding yourself getting distracted,
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:07.600]   if you think the internet and all the network services are really cutting into your productivity,
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.680]   this will essentially put you on a desert island for however many minutes you designate. And it
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:15.360]   doesn't make it easy for you to circumvent it. But if you do want to circumvent it, if you are
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.560]   willing to shut down all your applications and restart, okay, it'll turn everything, you know,
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:23.360]   everything will be turned back on as soon as you restart. But it's it's a fun, funny application
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:28.160]   that you download and say, huh, actually, it was cool. It actually works. But then I actually
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:32.160]   find myself using it for real the other day, because there are just too many people I wanted
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:37.200]   to talk to on iChat and there's too many ideas I had for things to post on Twitter. And then I
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.200]   thought, Oh, wow, Mark of Anya has probably filed his report from the York Comic Con. I want to read
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:46.320]   that and realize that no, tell you what, let's unplug everything, let us put the chastity belt on the
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.360]   on the ethernet port and see if we can't finish this column. I tell you, I need that with Twitter.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:57.040]   I think I need I think I need freedom. Isn't that sad when we actually have to get like a
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:02.000]   Nazi third party application to keep us from getting us to get in. I would work I would more
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.640]   convert a pair to a Skinner box where you know, we just will keep tapping that button to keep
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:11.120]   getting that food power. We have pill if we get shocked every third time, that's okay, because
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:16.640]   we still keep getting the food pellets. That's a good point. I have to admit, I'm now finding myself
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:20.560]   Twittering between sets at the gym. Yeah, that's that's bad when you're doing that. That's when
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.000]   you know, you're trouble. Well, I mean, I got a minute and a half to burn, you know, so
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.920]   to rest. So I figure, you know, it's time for Twitter. Freedom. Where do we find freedom?
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:36.000]   You can find it at ibiblio.org/fred/freedom. Freedom. Freedom.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.520]   All right, I'm going to give it to Mr. Scott Borne. What do you got, Scotty? I Twitter myself
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.600]   reminders, so I don't forget things. You can do that with Sandy. Do you know about Sandy?
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.920]   I do, but I use Twitter because then everybody else gets to know how bad my memory is. Sandy has
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:56.560]   a Twitter, Sandy has a Twitter interface. So you could Twitter to Sandy. And she's your personal
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:02.400]   assistant. Yeah, go to iwantsandy.com. And then she has, she's on Twitter. So you say,
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:06.000]   Sandy, remind me to do this or something like that. And then she'll Twitter you back when it's time.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.880]   I like that. Is that cool? Yeah, I want Sandy.com. But what do you have, Mr. Borne?
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:16.880]   Photomodico. Photomodico. And I know you might be sitting there thinking, well, we've got
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:23.440]   slide show software and iPhoto and all this other stuff, but more like it. Serious photographer.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.080]   And you have to do lots of slides shows. And I do sometimes you want more control or sometimes
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:34.560]   you want really cool features. And I've kind of fallen in love with Photomodico. It's not terribly
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:41.200]   expensive. It's between $49 and $129, depending on whether you want the basic version or the pro
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:48.080]   version. The thing I like about this is it very heavily integrates for Mac stuff. It's got iPhoto
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:54.640]   integration built in. It's got aperture built in. It's got drag and drop built in. Very
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:00.880]   very rare to see those kinds of things in a third party slide program. It exports his web
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:05.680]   movies as OS 10 screen savers, which is a really cool feature because I can sell those.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:15.440]   It exports to iPhone, Apple TV, QuickTime. It's just really dialed into the Mac and the transitions
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:20.240]   you can get and the cool features that you can do are very nice. There's a nice little template
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:24.240]   thing that comes up and asks you where you're going to show this. Is it going to be on a TV?
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:31.120]   Is it going to be on an LCD screen? And it helps to format it for you properly.
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:37.600]   I'm very very impressed with it. And also even has iChat theater support, which is crazy.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.320]   And a couple of other quick things.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:44.560]   When you say iChat theater support, you mean you can use it as a backdrop in iChat or?
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:49.360]   I mean, you can you can present over iChat. Oh, that's neat. You can present your slide show
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:54.400]   over iChat. It's wild. I tried it the other day. So you're saying this is this is so good. It's
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:06:00.240]   worth the 50 bucks over say the free iPhoto slide show. So good that I've got the Pro version,
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:07.600]   which is like 129 bucks. Wow. Now, another cool thing, if you're a pro and you do your professional
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:11.840]   photographer and you want to exports to Blu-rays, they'll help you do that. That's neat.
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:19.200]   Got Elgato Turbo 264 support. I mean, it's very sophisticated. Now, this is obviously not intended
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:24.240]   for somebody who does the occasional slide show. You can get by with iPhoto for that. But
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:28.160]   if you do a lot of slide shows and you want to do the cool things, I really think that the
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:34.800]   screensavers are cool. That's kind of fun. And the extended things like presenting over iChat,
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.720]   it's certainly worth it. And here's the best thing. You can download it for free. Just ask
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.920]   them for a demo license. They'll give it to you for free. You can try it out if you don't like it.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:49.600]   Don't buy it. It's at boinks.com. B-O-I-N-X.com. It's a German company. I like it a lot.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:55.200]   They do iStopMotion, which is really cool. They do it. Yeah. So I would trust them.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:59.120]   And I trust you, which I mean, I would have said, wow, why would I want
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:03.680]   to buy at that price, especially a slide show. I'll tell you why, because your audience will
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:12.960]   never fall asleep again. I believe you. I believe you. Photo is F-O-T-O-M-A-G-I-C-O.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:17.200]   Thank you for pointing that out, because before I put the little icon in my doc, I was always
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:23.040]   looking for P and never could find it. Didn't I pay for that? So now in continuing on,
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.640]   everything has to begin with an F. We've got freedom, photo-magico.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:32.800]   Let me think if I could think of anything with an F. Alex's podcast was brought. I'm thinking
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:40.320]   the letter F and the number two. I wasn't going to say something with the letter F.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:47.520]   I was going to say something. Has anybody done a geofoto yet? Did you mention that somewhere?
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:50.560]   Someone? Do you know what I'm talking about? From OvoLab?
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:53.520]   I know what it is, but I don't think it's the automatic tagging software.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:57.280]   Yeah. Have we mentioned that before? I don't think we did, but go ahead and talk about it.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:02.240]   I can't remember. And I was looking for something and just showed you how bad my memory is. So I
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:06.400]   come back from Australia and a number of the photographers have brought GPS devices.
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:15.120]   There are some cameras GPS built in, but no good cameras. I don't think. Maybe they're
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:18.480]   there some, but nobody had any GPS built in the camera. But they didn't care. They would bring
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:23.760]   a little GPS device that created a tracking log of where you went. And all you have to do is make
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:28.800]   sure your camera time is accurate, local time it has to be, because the GPS uses local time.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:34.560]   And then when you get back from your trip, you take your GPS log and you merge it with your library.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:40.400]   Now, unfortunately, a lot of the the ones I've seen require JPEGs. They put it in the XF.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:46.800]   They don't support raw. And I work raw, man. I like to work in the raw. So I was looking for
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:52.320]   something and I found something called geofoto from OvoLab. And maybe I found it because we'd
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:56.000]   mentioned it on the show before, but this is really cool. Now, if you don't have a GPS tracker,
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.960]   you can still use it by dragging your photos. That's how I'm doing the Australia ones,
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:04.880]   because I didn't bring a tracker with me. So I don't have a log. But going forward, I love the idea
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:10.400]   of being able to you can merge it with Google Maps. You can merge it with Flickr. All of your
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:15.680]   photos have longitude and latitude information in them supports camera raw. So you don't have to
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:23.920]   downgrade to JPEG to get this to work. It supports IPTC tags as well. And it will work with a lot
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:27.440]   of trackers. Now you have to look, they have a list of trackers it works with works with
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:31.920]   aperture or Photoshop Lightroom directly with the libraries, same with iPhoto albums.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:38.000]   What a neat way to add geographic information and for people who take pictures on trips.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:45.040]   I mean, what a I mean, this is a travel log, essentially. I just love the idea of this. You could
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:51.600]   try before you buy. It's 25 bucks if you want to buy. I like this idea. I also like the way that
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:56.240]   the more people who geotag their photos, I post them on Flickr, the greater that the more valuable
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.920]   that soup becomes. There have been plenty of times when I've had a trip scheduled to someplace
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:07.040]   I've never been before. And I just said, "Well, okay, show me some photos that were taken in Kansas
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.040]   City, Missouri." And it will show me cool things that I might want to check out in Kansas City, Missouri.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:16.640]   It's a valuable group experience. Yeah, it's important. I think that we start geotagging.
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.160]   I think a lot of cell phones are now starting to do that. And I'm sure cameras will all start
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:23.920]   to do that as GPS chips get cheaper. Well, I think also we're going to see stuff.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:30.400]   Bill Crow was on Twitter, I guess, well, I wasn't actually on the same show, but I was able to
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:35.280]   have some coffee with them from Microsoft and they work on Photosynth. And as more people are
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:41.760]   as more people are geotagging all these photos, Photosynth is going to be able to take all of
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:46.160]   those photos and organize them in a way that you can kind of zoom in, zoom out, move around areas
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:51.600]   and really get this bigger view of it. We're right at the very beginning of this process.
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.760]   It's definitely going to be a great growth curve. I think a lot of times,
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:59.280]   Mac users have felt a little bit left out because a lot of the software for this is on Windows,
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:05.520]   but the funny thing is it mostly works with JPEGs. The new photo, I mean, the GeoPhoto 2
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:10.960]   supports RAW, and that to me is critical. Yeah, I don't want to have to convert everything to
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.480]   JPEG damage. I mean, eventually it will, of course, when it goes to Flickr or anywhere.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:19.200]   But I'd like to store it in my RAW file so that I have it there.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:25.680]   And when I export to JPEG, it gets exported automatically. So that's my recommendation.
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:29.600]   Sounds like something you might have recommended, Andy. Have you recommended this before?
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:34.160]   I think I had to recommend this. Something I might have had. I recommend it.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:40.640]   Did you? All right. Well, I apologize for duplicating, but let me second it then. How about that?
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:46.400]   It's actually kind of cool when we go back and we re-recommend something that either someone
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:51.120]   else has recommended or we ourselves did about a year ago. That's like a second vote.
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:55.280]   There's a lot of stuff I recommend because I just saw it two weeks ago, and I really think
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:01.520]   it's cool. And maybe six months from now, I'm not still using it. Whereas there are tools that
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:07.680]   just keep saving my butt week after week after week. And if it has a particularly epic good week
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.840]   for me, I just have to recommend it all over again.
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:14.640]   Well, in this case, this is new to me. I probably what happened is I remember you recommending it,
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:21.120]   Alex, and I just then had the need for it. And I found it. But it's just nice to have a Mac program.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:24.560]   GPS has traditionally kind of been laggard on the Mac. A lot of GPS
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:31.200]   hardware doesn't support the Mac, but this is nice. Oval lab is very nice job.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:38.800]   OVO lab is ovilab.com. GEO photos name of the program. Now Alex is picked. Speaking of second,
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:42.480]   this is from second gear. This is actually what I just started playing with. And I'm actually,
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:47.120]   I'm pretty happy with this. I have this thing where I really want my iCal
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:51.120]   stuff to be up on the desktop. I don't really need to be there all the time. I mean,
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:55.120]   that would be really cool. But I just need to be able to see what's going on without opening
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.360]   all of iCal. I don't really need the whole thing to open. I find it to be a little bit
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.560]   too much of my screen. It's too much of stuff. And I just want to see what my tasks are,
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:08.560]   see what my schedule looks like. And there's a program by second gear column today.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:13.360]   And what happens is you get the little icon on your menu. I think you can put it. You can have
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:17.840]   a quick key if you want. But I can very quickly, if I just click on it, it just pops right up and
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:22.240]   it pops up whatever my schedule is for today. So today I have Mac break weekly and I have some
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:26.400]   other meetings with other some software companies. And so all that pops up. And when I'm talking
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.440]   to someone or I'm trying to figure out when I'm going to go work out or what I'm going to, you know,
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:35.040]   lunch or whatever. And I just want to pop it up really quickly. I find it you can add tasks, add
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:42.480]   stuff to it, of course, as well. But it interfaces with iCal seamlessly. It's $15. It's really
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:48.400]   a very, very simple little application and a lot of fun. So that's it.
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.880]   And it just came out. It just came out.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.800]   Yeah, today from second gear.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:56.400]   Come out today. Oh, no, no, it's called today. It's called today, but I think it just came out.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:00.080]   Sorry. A little brain fart. No, I think it just came out. Maybe not today.
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:07.040]   Yeah, like a minute ago. Yeah, exactly. So, but it's a really it's pretty nifty. It's worth
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:11.440]   definitely it's worth downloading and trying out. There's like a seven day demo that you can
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:18.800]   play with 15 bucks. So I mean, it's like, yeah. Also, I just want to say that as far as picks go,
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:24.960]   we shot 22 episodes at NAB last week. Yeah, me, mostly.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.720]   Wow. There's some Mike Seymour.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.560]   Why can't wait to watch that? Because I didn't get to go.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:33.680]   Yeah, and we found random stuff. I mean, it wasn't it's not just like the big stuff or big expensive
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:38.160]   stuff. It's some of the stuff. It was just kind of this random spattering. And so,
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:45.200]   we had a couple people shoot some episodes. And so Mike Seymour's got some episodes.
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:53.200]   We shot some with Leana over at Podango. We have some, a lot of them with me and finding cool
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:58.400]   lights and cool gear and fun pieces. And so they're all going to be rolling out over the next
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.960]   week and a half. So people should definitely check out Max Break for that.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:05.440]   Excellent. I understand you met with the light panels, guys.
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:13.520]   We did. We did. I want to use those. Those are the LED, very expensive. And yet, if you have a
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.480]   choice, the way to go for studio lighting. They're LEDs. And they're not that expensive of you.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:23.120]   Look at the cost of bulbs and electricity. Yeah, it'll save me money in the long run. And I don't
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:30.560]   frankly have the electricity to spare. I mean, I can't do something that's too difficult.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:35.200]   Yeah. And when I hadn't really thought of it, I mean, we had talked about it. And then when we
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:39.840]   were at the light panel booth shooting an episode, I looked up and they had this little mini studio
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:44.480]   with all these one by one LEDs. And I was like, that is got that's what Leo has to have. So
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:49.600]   by the way, he told me, Alex, although they had eight in there, that he was confident that they
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:54.800]   could have lit that equally well with four for one by ones. Yeah. Yeah. But I think Leo, Leo,
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.800]   need more than that. Well, I want I want variety. I want depth. I want color. I don't
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:03.760]   want it just to be flatly lit. I want to. Yeah, it's a beautiful space plus glare issues. And I
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:10.480]   need to find ways to handle that. What issues glare? There's here's the problem. And I can't
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:15.920]   change this. The walls were shellacked. You know, they're the beautiful red wool paneling, but it
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:21.040]   was shellacked with a glare, we know, very shiny varnish. You know, it was 100 years ago, they didn't
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:26.160]   know. And I can't put dulling spray on it. I have to find a way to light so that the glare doesn't
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:29.760]   reflect black back into the cameras, which means that the, you know, you have to just put it off
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:33.760]   access and stuff. There's ways to do it. But well, I'll come up and consult. Will you please?
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:40.800]   Come up and I had hope to be up this weekend. We've got the T1 in place, but it looks like the
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:46.720]   ISTN line and the cable modem and the DSL line won't be in place until early next week. We like,
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:51.680]   like probably Mac break weekly next week, we'll be able to do it with video. But we streamed a
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:55.840]   little bit yesterday. We streamed for about the three or four hours yesterday just to kind of
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:58.720]   look at cameras and stuff. And it really looks beautiful. I'm really excited about it.
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:01.920]   Really, it should be possible. Come up soon. Please. Yeah.
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:08.400]   Merlin Man will be back next week. And we'll give him a plug because he's got his brand new podcast.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:14.320]   He better not be like abandoning us for you. Look nice today. I'll be mad. You look nice today
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:20.000]   dot com. I'm going to give him a plug anyway. Scott Bourns got about 800 podcasts, but a couple
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.880]   of my favorites are the Apple phone show. I was just on Twitch last week. I really like that show
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:28.080]   this week of photography, Alex and Scott do that together.
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:32.720]   And yeah, I think else you want to plug Scott, girls, Gondique?
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:37.520]   Well, we got a new show, Homec for the text. Oh, that's good. Like how to cook?
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:46.080]   No, it's like it's Homec for the text. So it's like tech projects presented in a Homec kind of way.
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:51.680]   Oh, how funny. It's our first all video podcast. And who's hosting that? We are.
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:57.840]   Oh, I mean, camera, it's a spin off from girls, Gondique. Oh, great. What a good idea.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:03.040]   It's really funny. And it's at Homec text dot com.
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:07.600]   H-O-M-E-E-C-T-E-C-H-S dot com.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:13.920]   Yeah, I, you know, me, I'm big on how to. I think how to is the is what you want. And so that sounds
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:20.080]   like a really great show. Well, I'm just go watch it just for the Monty Python like animation that my
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:26.160]   kids put together because I was. Yeah, they did a Monty Python ask animation. It took a long time,
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:34.720]   but I think this is why I do everything live. If you can't do it in the camera, I'm not doing it.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:40.320]   Thank you. And God bless you. That was the lovely colossal waste of sneezing.
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:45.920]   No, I don't know who sneezed it. It sounded like a sneeze, but actually I had a lot more to say
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:51.440]   about 23 24 minutes worth. So I actually recorded it all on a side podcast, compressed it down real
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:57.280]   tight. So if you just take that, just do a cut and paste of that little like one half second burst,
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:02.400]   and then just go into GarageBand, expand it all the way out, you'll hear eight different secrets
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:06.800]   for cooking eggs in the kitchen that would put a new lease on breakfast for you and your family.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.120]   That's brilliant. We call them burst casts. I like that.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:15.600]   Call the blip cast. No, I do hope don't listen to it in like as is because it will make at least
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:19.520]   one out of three persons heads explode because you're the reptile part of your brain will try
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:26.880]   to process it will overheat. And if that did happen, I can't tell you how sorry I am. But the
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:31.040]   rest of you, again, great recipes, you'll be trying out your next Sunday brunch. We should do some
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:34.400]   blip verts in the blip cast, and then we would, you know, the whole show would be over before you
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:39.840]   even knew it. And you'd have an unexplained desire to go out and buy peeps.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:45.520]   Andy Nocko is the colossal waste of bandwidth. No, he isn't. But that's the name of celestial
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:49.200]   waste of bandwidth. That's the name of his blog. Now, celestial is more we have them with them
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:57.600]   more godly nature to our body. It is at c w O B dot com. Alex Lindsay's at the pixel core
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:03.920]   at P I X E L C O R P S dot com and his podcast or pixel core TV. Is that where twip is as well?
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:09.840]   Twip is there as well as, you know, give me a tag and twin and a lot of other ones. We just
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:16.000]   finished a great swim that covers NAB and some of the some cool issues that came up there as well.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.440]   This week in that show. Yeah, this week in media has really, I think has really grown a lot
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:24.240]   in the last two or three months. We've really lighted it up a lot. Yeah.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:29.200]   So now where would the where would the NAB videos be? Is that a Mac break weekly thing?
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:33.040]   And this week in that's Mac break. It's Mac break video or Mac break iPod. So just the regular
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:37.120]   Mac break feed is where all the videos are. And then we discussed it on twin. But yeah,
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:41.040]   the videos are coming out in little segments that are like two or three minutes, two to five
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:45.680]   minutes long. Excellent. Of different things that we found. And we had so much fun shooting it.
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:49.360]   And I think we're going to hopefully this week be able to shoot some stuff from Web 2.0. So we're
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:53.440]   working on all good. Yeah, that's going on right now in San Francisco. Yeah. We also, by the way,
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:21:00.400]   if you know, this is not really a mag thing kind of. So we shot Mac break last week at 4K, you know,
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:05.600]   you know, because no, it wasn't big enough. HD wasn't big enough. You get a red camera? We had two red
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:13.520]   cameras. You're kidding. No, no. So we shot we were in Pittsburgh and cinematics has two red
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:18.640]   cameras. And so how did you like it? Oh, it was a lot of fun. It was a lot of fun to shoot.
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:21.360]   And how is it? How's the red camera? I mean, is that good for the?
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:24.720]   We've been shooting lots of tests with the red. And this is this is I think probably one of the first
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:29.280]   real projects. And you know, it's it's still a work in progress. So you can still go off the rails
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:33.680]   pretty quickly. And suddenly, and I should point out there's absolutely no way anyone can watch the
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:37.040]   video that you've got. We're going to post it. We're going to post it. But how can you watch it?
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:41.040]   Well, we're going to put it back into the red codec, I think that's the goal is because there
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:44.320]   should be some software we're going to talk to read about it. But there should be some software.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:48.400]   If we put it back into the red codec, whether it's possible that you might be able to play it back
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:52.400]   on a bigger machine, you know, we'll probably put up a couple, a couple of seconds just for people
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:57.520]   to see it. There's no good reason to do this for the web. We just explained so much about Alex
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:02.960]   Lindsey to those of you who are listening, they don't know this explain so very much about my
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:08.480]   friend Alex. He's shooting things that you can't see. Yes. Exactly.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:13.120]   Well, see, there's there's a lot of this. So everyone we're going to be posting eight frames
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:18.080]   per day for the next 40 years now. Yeah, saving your hard drive. But here's the thing. Here's the
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:23.200]   thing is that is that the, you know, we were everyone thought we were crazy when we were shooting
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:30.160]   HD, you know, and over time and over time, people caught up with us, you know, and now we get we
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:33.760]   get a lot of work. We do a lot of production for people because we got good at that.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:39.360]   So, next you're going to be shooting in holographic format. Well, well, okay, but here's the deal
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:43.280]   is that is that while we were there, you know, Justine, we were shooting with Justine Azrich.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:50.080]   I Justine and so Justine was there and she had the little flip phones. And so I created a little,
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:55.440]   I started creating a little stereo flip phone recording. So we went from the biggest cameras
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:59.840]   to the little cameras. If you go up to YouTube and I Justine, you'll see kind of a funny thing
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:05.440]   from the set where I'm shooting her in, I guess I wouldn't call it more scario than
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:12.320]   stereo. And so, you know, it's kind of fun. She threw it up. You can kind of, she shot it from her
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:17.200]   eyesight. And then I shot the two cameras, putting them over my eyes and it's kind of frightening and
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:22.400]   kind of funny all at the same time. I'd like to see Justine in 4K. Yes. Well, that's the whole thing.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:25.360]   You know, if it was just me, we would have, we would have stuck with a little
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:31.280]   skin. I mean, you have to be 23 to be, I mean, HD is bad enough.
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:36.560]   But we have, And Justine's crazy too. I mean, we had twice the resolution of High Def for those
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:40.400]   who don't. Yeah, we've got, we've got Justine because the red cameras go to 120 frames,
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:45.920]   we've got Justine dancing in slow motion. So if I down, do I have to download the Red
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:50.160]   codec to watch this in 4K? No, yeah, you will eventually, we're not going to put it out. It's
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:54.960]   still like two or three weeks away. So the Justine. How do you watch it? You can't even see it.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:24:00.480]   Yeah, you can because in the Red codec itself, you can you can actually view it. Oh, but you can't,
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:03.040]   you've had it on the screen. You've edited it. I don't have a screen. Yeah, right. So you
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:08.320]   edited it in low def or high def. Yeah, yeah. Well, we're still figuring all that stuff.
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:13.360]   They stopped their hard. Well, that's what happened. I when we did it. When we when we shot,
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:16.960]   I just want to remind you that when we shot Mac break, we had no idea how we were going to finish.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:20.480]   We did that in 10, eight of them. What? We did that in 10, eight and P.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:26.240]   Yeah, now we do 16 a day. So it's, you know, it's just it's a new process for us. We weren't going
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.320]   to learn it until we started playing with it, you know, we can turn this into a marketing challenge
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:34.560]   instead of a technical challenge. We'll take however much money you spent on hardware and video
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:38.400]   and that that's sort of stuff to produce yours. I'll take that same amount of money. I'll shoot
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:44.240]   mine on a single flip video camera is every single person who downloads this video, a flip video
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.800]   camera. So about 3000 4,000 flip video cameras to every single listener. I just want to point out
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:52.640]   that what I what I paid for the equipment was, I mean, what I paid for that shoot was the
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:59.840]   was the $5 plane ticket. Oh, that I that I. But we talked we talked. One of the photographers that
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:07.120]   went around Tasmania with us, Joe Shemish is kind of the video guy in Tasmania. And he's he's got his
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:11.920]   red camera should come any day now. He's number 2020. Well, the crazy thing is, is that Red announced,
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:18.000]   of course, at NAB that they have a 3k. It's only it's only 3k for $3,000.
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:22.560]   So it's on it's I know that's available. I'll buy that. I'll shoot every year, another year,
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:26.400]   another year. But it's going to be. Yeah, you're going to Leo, the great thing is,
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.640]   is just as your video production really gets moving and you get moving these little cameras,
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:34.400]   these little $3,000 ones will come out and you'll be able to put those in your studio. You'll have
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:38.000]   three little rents. Well, we're sending right now, we're doing we Excel Canon XL2, which are great
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.680]   little DV cameras and that's that's fine. And it's sending out actually, I want to send out the
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:45.680]   16 9 because I you know, I tell you what when you're watching on flash, it's 15 frames a second
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:51.600]   anyway, no matter what you're sending. And frankly, if it's 16 by 9 and it's h.264,
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:57.760]   it look people think it's high death. It looks fine for flash, right? So all right, hey, we're
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:01.280]   going to wrap this up because well, I know more than a few of you need to go to the bathroom. So,
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:07.600]   we thank you so much for being here. We hope you will join us again next Wednesday when we will
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:13.200]   have apples results and we can actually comment on them good, bad or indifferent. Merlin Mann will
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:17.760]   also be back with us. Andy Inaco, Alex Lizzie, Scott Bourne, thanks for joining me and I'm Leo
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:22.560]   Le Porte, our new ending. You may now pee.
