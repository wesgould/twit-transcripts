[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.920]   We got to-- and he's on the road.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.840]   He's out of here.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.800]   He's in the air.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.360]   He's in a plane.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.360]   He's not even in the road.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.360]   He's not even in the road.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.360]   He's exactly.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.760]   He should have been flying Virgin America, where he can
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.720]   enjoy a fast internet connection.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.960]   Could he do a show from Virgin America, you think?
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.480]   No.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.960]   No.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.720]   I don't think so.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.000]   No, no.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.200]   Streaming's bad on the phone.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.560]   It is.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.960]   It's really funny.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.720]   You can download-- you know what's funny?
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.520]   YouTube is really good on Virgin America.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.400]   Oh, they probably have their--
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.320]   Yeah, they're doing so kind of fun.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.880]   Each plane has a local YouTube cache.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.040]   That's Alex Lindsey from the Pixelcorpixelcorpixel.com
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.200]   for the multimedia artists' guild, learning, working,
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.920]   living, and breathing together at Pixelcorp.tv
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.800]   for the podcast every Thursday at pixelcorp.com/live.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.480]   Another great live event you've been doing so many--
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.760]   just down the hall.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.320]   Yes, we're doing-- give me the attack this Thursday.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.520]   He's in the Twit Brickhouse adjunct.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.520]   Yes.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.320]   What we need a name for it.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.200]   What do they call it in the church, where they--
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.280]   the rectory.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.520]   He's in the rectory.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.320]   That sounds--
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.320]   That does sound right at all.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.360]   That does not good at all.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.800]   I don't know if I want to be in the rectory.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.080]   And now Alex Lindsey from the rectory to Alex's right, Adam
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.400]   Christensen of the Maccast, Maccast.com.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.400]   Hey, Adam.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.120]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.440]   Great to see you.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.720]   Yeah, my first time virtually in the new studio.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.480]   I was there-- what?
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.080]   Last month.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.600]   Yeah, I was so--
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.480]   And I love it.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.280]   We try to get people to do it live.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.040]   But you see, we're in the middle of nowhere.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.800]   And so not everybody's here.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.720]   But Skype, thank goodness, still works even though Microsoft
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.000]   now owns them.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.320]   We were talking about the fact that Skype probably will never--
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.680]   on Linux anyway, will never get past its current version,
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.880]   right?
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.320]   I mean--
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.200]   Which might be a good thing.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.640]   Maybe even--
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.800]   The current version is not necessarily
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.000]   going to be an improvement by now.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.040]   Out of the Mac it hasn't.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.520]   And then to my left, hey, it's great to see Mike Elgin.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.040]   Hey, Leo.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.680]   I always want to say of Google+ fame.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.520]   That's right.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.600]   He's the guy who's promoting Google+ to its 40 million users.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.680]   Mike, of course, writes her computer world
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.200]   and has his own great newsletter, which is free at Elgin.com.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.120]   Actually, I shouldn't point people to Elgin.com.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.000]   Just go to Google+.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.440]   Sure.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.640]   Go ahead, because the Elgin.com now redirects right
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.320]   to my Google+ profile.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.280]   Problem solved.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.400]   Problem solved.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.720]   That's why you do a blog when you could just do this.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.280]   Great to see you.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.480]   Once again, Mike, thanks for coming back.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.320]   I--
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.320]   We've had you on Twitch multiple times.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.400]   I didn't realize you were a Mac fan.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.080]   Yes.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.920]   Actually, it's fairly recent.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.360]   I spent the '90s as the editor of Windows Magazine.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.920]   So I've been on the other side of the brigades.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.680]   We love winning over converts like that.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.040]   Well, you know, I wrote a cult of Mac piece about how I was
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.360]   lured in.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.160]   And of course, it started with the iPod.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.520]   And once you've got that gateway, you might as well just
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.520]   go straight to the methadone clinic.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.600]   You know, it's so great.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.840]   Of course, I know we're all reading.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.920]   And some of us maybe have finished the Steve Jobs
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.400]   biography.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.160]   Anybody finish it yet?
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.680]   No.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.640]   It's pretty long.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.920]   I'm almost done.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.320]   I should have done the audiobook thing.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.680]   I am.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.360]   I'm doing the audiobook.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.080]   So I listen everywhere.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.680]   And I'm almost-- I'm very close to done.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.960]   But you know, it's been great.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.480]   And this is why you should read it, Alex, especially.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:20.960]   I'm listening to it.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.400]   Anybody who-- and you too, Adam.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.600]   Anybody who's been covering Apple during this period,
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.040]   you read it and you go, oh, they did know that.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040]   Or, oh, there was.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.880]   So they talked about the move to Intel
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.920]   and how no one on the board, on the Apple board, no one
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.520]   on the Apple board wanted them to move to Intel.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.880]   Because I remember I was-- I was
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.680]   saying, if Apple does this or nuts, it's crazy.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.320]   What are they doing?
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.040]   The future is in Power PC.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.680]   Not so bright.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.920]   But anyway, you know, and at least I
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.640]   feel a little vindicated, the board was agreeing with me.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.360]   But Steve Jobs said, no, we're going to do it.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.960]   And that's that.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.360]   And of course, Steve was ruled with an iron fist at Apple
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.080]   in those last 15 years.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.960]   But the reason I bring that up is they knew very well
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.040]   the value of the iPod in moving people to the Apple.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.800]   They talk about it all the time, the halo effect, which
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.640]   we kind of pre-sealed or supposed.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.840]   But this was almost a concerted effort on Apple's part.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.440]   There was a debate over whether to move iTunes to Windows.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.520]   Steve did not want to do that.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.000]   And there's a very famous statement at the All Things
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.520]   Decompherence where he said, putting iTunes on Windows
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.400]   was like giving ice water to people trapped in hell.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.480]   Bill Gates's--
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.800]   My own view is that it's like giving boiling water
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.400]   to people in hell.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.160]   Because iTunes for Windows is awful.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.660]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.840]   I know.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.440]   Every time they say that, I go, you guys--
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.840]   Steve was saying, oh, finally, look at some good stuff.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.360]   No.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.760]   Oh, it's awful.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.360]   It's terrible.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.000]   It just doesn't work in Windows with the Windows
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.720]   mentality.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.440]   It's better on the Mac.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.880]   But even though it's nearly identical in functionality,
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.080]   but it's just something about it just doesn't work
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.720]   on the Windows platform.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.120]   He said that in an interview the day
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.560]   that he was going to go on stage with Bill Gates at All Things
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.080]   D. And Bill was not happy, of course.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.320]   And they go in there and backstage.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.360]   And Gates is like frowning.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.400]   And Steve had just picked up a bottle of water
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.720]   from the ice bucket.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.280]   He looks at him.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.560]   He's kind of half smiles and gives him the bottle of water.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.720]   And Gates breaks up, and that breaks attention.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.640]   They're talking a little bit about--
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.320]   Bill's talking a little bit about some of the negative things
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.200]   that Steve says about him in the book.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.720]   And he says, you know, I don't hold--
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.440]   what do you say?
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.600]   There was-- it was just yesterday.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.560]   I don't hold it against him.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.400]   We had our ups and downs, but ultimately we were colleagues.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.440]   And they do talk about in the book
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.600]   how Gates came to visit him in his final months,
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.720]   or maybe even final days.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.640]   And they talked for a long time reminisce.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.880]   They were pioneers together.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.040]   And I think they had much more in common.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.000]   They had a natural rivalry.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.680]   They were the heads of the two biggest companies
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.960]   battling over the desktop.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.680]   Well, I think that jobs from a creative perspective
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.280]   was superior.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.400]   I think Gates, from a systems perspective,
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.880]   as far as how to get it out there,
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.240]   how to work it out in the early days, was superior to them.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.440]   And Steve said some horrible things like Bill Gates,
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.880]   but Microsoft just steals everything
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.760]   that they were invented.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.360]   But you know what?
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.040]   I think anybody who knew Steve for any length of time
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.800]   just kind of accepted that as the territory.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.840]   At some point, Steve's going to say something horrendous
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.880]   about you.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.480]   It's just going to happen.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.720]   And that's the way it is.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.200]   And you a guy picks out of there, they've been fired
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.240]   three times.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.480]   There was actually someone I was told that was behind Steve.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.600]   And Steve would walk out of the room
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.240]   and he could just go back to work.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.680]   You've not been fired.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.240]   He will never remember.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.560]   He really-- I mean, you know, and people would say-- pull him
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.040]   aside, say, Steve, you can't be that way.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.880]   These people are working hard.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.040]   And he said, yeah, I know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.960]   And then we'll just do it again.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.120]   I'm getting a really interesting picture.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.880]   But I think that this week, the revelation really
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.880]   was Mona Simpson's eulogy.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.520]   No.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.320]   Don't read that one in--
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.040]   I'm going to cry.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.360]   I'm going to cry.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.600]   Don't read it in front of people.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.480]   You really need to do that in a quiet place.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.920]   So she is his biological sister.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.160]   They hadn't met until they were in their 20s
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.640]   because, of course, he was adopted.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.280]   He eventually did find his mother.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.720]   And by finding his mother found his birth sister, Mona Simpson,
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.920]   who by then was a novelist, writing her first novel.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:21.000]   She talks in the eulogy about how she fell in love with Steve,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.640]   basically, that--
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.880]   I mean, it's really a beautiful story.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:34.040]   And I'm just a very touching reminiscence of Steve
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:40.760]   both before and during his illness and at the end.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:47.000]   And then I think the thing that really breaks me up
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.120]   are his final words.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.680]   Not his final moment because he stopped speaking
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.200]   and survived the night and died later the next day.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.880]   But his last words--
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.040]   well, I'll read you the paragraph because it's--
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.800]   I'll try not to cry when I read it.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.440]   You know, actually, I think it's not only touching,
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:14.200]   but it's kind of inspiring the right.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   Steve's final words hours earlier were monosyllables
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.160]   repeated three times before embarking
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.120]   because she talks about his passing on as an embarkation.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.160]   Before embarking, he'd looked at his sister Patty
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.680]   and for a long time at his children,
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.040]   anybody with kids at this point starts to choke up a little bit.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.160]   Then in his life's partner, Lorraine,
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.080]   and then over their shoulders passed them.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.560]   Steve's final words were, oh, wow.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.760]   Oh, wow.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:50.440]   And you know, you want your final words.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.360]   If you think about it at all, you want your final words
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.600]   to be a coda on your life, maybe?
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.280]   Perhaps a little enigmatic.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.120]   This is better than Rosebud.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.520]   This is like--
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.720]   this is-- what does he mean?
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.120]   Is he looking over their shoulders at where he's going
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.200]   and saying, oh, wow.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.920]   Because he said about half the time he believed
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.720]   and half the time he didn't believe.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   Maybe he's saying, oh, wow, oh my god, I see it.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.960]   Or he's just looking back at his life and his children
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.320]   and his family surrounding him and thinking, wow.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.720]   Or all of the above.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.200]   Or maybe he's got a pain in his back and he's going, oh,
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.920]   I don't know.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.120]   I don't know.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.800]   And that's how she ends the eulogy.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.280]   Boy.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.280]   I think when you look at the book, when you look at the eulogy,
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.480]   when you look at almost all the things,
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.440]   what you see is someone who played full out.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:41.800]   Yes.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.200]   And expected everyone around him to play full out.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.520]   And that's the thing that just keeps on every new thing
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.040]   that you open up, every--
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.120]   of this onion.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.240]   What you keep on seeing is someone who's playing full out
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.600]   and expecting everyone around him to do the same thing.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.160]   I wrote a recent cult of Mac item about jobs
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.000]   and about some of the criticisms that he got about--
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.080]   he was supposed to be a jerk.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.360]   He yelled at people.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.440]   He abandoned his daughter.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.280]   He ripped off was.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.040]   He did all these unscrupulous things.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.000]   And it occurred to me, or at least it--
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.320]   I discovered, as I was really thinking about,
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.160]   all of these stories that have been fleshed out in the book,
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.880]   that there are really two categories of them.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.560]   There's the category of the incident
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.160]   where he kind of cheated was out of a couple hundred bucks
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:30.600]   earlier--
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.040]   No.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:31.560]   No.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.560]   Thousands of dollars.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.320]   Thousands.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:33.920]   OK.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.000]   So-- but it occurred to me that he was 18 or 19.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.480]   Right.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:39.960]   He was a kid.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.960]   He did that.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.840]   And many of the callous disregard
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.960]   for the feelings of others--
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.720]   category of Steve's jobs, behaviors--
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.120]   pretty much almost all of them happened between the age of 16
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.240]   when he met was and 24, 25.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.840]   And this is something that young men
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.960]   have a difficulty with empathy oftentimes.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.000]   And so there's that category.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.440]   And then there's the other category
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.840]   of yelling people at board meetings
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.080]   and calling people out at work and stuff like that.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.480]   And in that category of whatever you
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.000]   want to call them ethical transgressions
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.360]   or whatever you want to call them,
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.120]   in most of those cases, they were actually pretty effective--
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.240]   a pretty effective part of how he got things done.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.680]   If you look at the stories, like there's
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.640]   one where he came in and screamed at some chip suppliers
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.880]   and called them FDA.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.520]   I don't know.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:36.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.960]   They made t-shirts out of it.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.200]   You can't say that with words.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:39.920]   But they--
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.560]   And you think, wow, that's an awful thing to do to run
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.600]   into a meeting and scream profanities.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.000]   And people--
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.920]   Freaking--
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.840]   Freaking-- what is it?
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.080]   Let's bow-dly-rise it a little bit.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:49.480]   Freaking--
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.920]   Can you?
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.400]   There's nothing--
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:51.880]   There's nothing--
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.080]   There's no way you can-- every word is bad.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.400]   Yes.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.120]   But what was missed in that story is
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.600]   they made their deadline.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.880]   And they said they couldn't.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.720]   They said they couldn't.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.720]   And after labeling them the FDA, they did.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.600]   And so it's kind of-- people talk about the reality distortion
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.520]   field and his ability to persuade.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.480]   And they talk about using a motion in his keynotes
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.320]   and things like that.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.840]   But he used all the emotions.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.800]   He used not only inspiration and awe, but also fear and embarrassment
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.040]   and things like that to get things done.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.760]   But the long-winded point of all of this
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.720]   is that in the end, he seemed to become much more moral
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.800]   all the way through his life.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.600]   He seems to have been on this journey
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.480]   of becoming a better person.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.160]   And I just get the feeling in the last five--
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.160]   since he was initially diagnosed,
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.760]   he became a really cool guy, really cool.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.960]   Like any great man, he was a mixed bag.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.680]   We know that much.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.240]   And when you say great with a capital G,
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.640]   you get a really mixed bag.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.400]   But I think there's a lot in the book.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.400]   The book is fast.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.560]   I cannot put it down because it is an insight into stuff
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.240]   that we covered from the beginning
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.800]   about what was going on behind the scenes.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.200]   I think it's a very fair look.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.360]   And everybody who knows or knows Steve agrees.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:25.760]   It was a very fair book in that it reflected both his warts
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.920]   and his brilliance.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.440]   Go ahead, Adam.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.680]   You were about to say something.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.440]   No, I was just going to say, commenting on what Mike was
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:37.280]   saying, as I was reading it, I kept thinking about the teachers
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.520]   and the bosses and the people in my life who I kind of felt,
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.840]   especially with teachers in college and stuff like that.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.880]   The teachers that you had that were the toughest teachers,
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.760]   the ones you hated a lot of times,
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.640]   were really the ones for me that kind of drove me and pushed me
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.280]   forward and got me to do better things
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.240]   than I thought I was capable of doing.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.640]   So yeah, there's a little bit of that.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.760]   It's a fine line.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.760]   And I think Steve Jobs probably crosses it in some of these stories.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.800]   But yeah, the other thing about just commenting on sort of how
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.720]   the book was written in the observations that I was impressed with
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.320]   is I think the author did something like over 100 interviews
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.600]   with people in Steve Jobs' life and 40 with Steve Jobs himself.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.880]   And it was great to hear that he had free rein.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.800]   Nothing was off limits.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.760]   He could do whatever he wanted.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.960]   And I think that really comes through in the variety of the stories.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.400]   You really get both perspectives and it feels really, really balanced.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.760]   And that's what I'm really enjoying about it.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:37.040]   It just seems really honest and forthcoming with the warts
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.760]   and the great things and everything about his life.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.960]   So yeah, I'm totally sucked into it.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.760]   Hard not to put it hard to put it down, not to pick it up every moment.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.040]   Are they going to be able to make a good movie out of this book?
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:50.800]   They've optioned it.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.640]   It's a tough-- I don't know if you can do the whole book.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.520]   I mean, if you look at Pirates of Silicon Valley,
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.640]   they condensed everything to the point
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.800]   where it was a caricature of reality.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.760]   And I wonder if they can really do justice to it.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.720]   I mean, it looks like it's going to be the same people who
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.200]   did the social network.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.160]   And I'm afraid they're going to--
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.760]   it's going to end up being a little bit of an exaggerated,
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.280]   I don't know, misleading--
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.240]   Actually, Sony bought it.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.040]   And they're great.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.240]   I was starting to Dana Brunetti, who produced the social network.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.200]   He did not get it.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.240]   But there might be some other people from the social network involved.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.760]   You know, Aaron Sorkin, who wrote the social network.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.840]   Steve Jobs asked him to write that famous Stanford commencement speech.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.960]   And when I heard the-- when I started reading that part of the book,
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.480]   I went, oh, no, he didn't write that.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.000]   And it turns out Sorkin blew him off and blew him off again and again.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.160]   And finally, Steve said, well, I guess I have to write this.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.000]   And he sat down in an afternoon.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.800]   And with only feedback from his wife, he wrote that famous address.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.200]   And I was so relieved to hear that it wasn't ghost written,
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.480]   because it was so personal.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.040]   And I think that's what made it so amazing.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.200]   So I'm glad he didn't get Aaron Sorkin to write it.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.160]   And I think Aaron Sorkin--
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.400]   I mean, I'm sure that Steve did not offer him any money.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.160]   He just said, Aaron, write this for me.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.720]   And I'm sure Aaron just said, oh, yeah, I'll get right on that.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.000]   And then it was like--
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.080]   because he called him several times.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.560]   And Aaron said, oh, yeah, I got to--
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.920]   I'll get to you.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.520]   Yeah, I'm working on that, Steve.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.560]   So there is a talk--
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.960]   Steve Jobs was a better writer than Aaron Sorkin.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:18.440]   Maybe.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.640]   Steve Jobs was a great writer.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.760]   And I hardly ever see him getting credit for that.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.920]   But he was largely responsible for the--
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.160]   Here's to the crazy ones.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:29.840]   Think different, Adam.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.240]   That was brilliant writing.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.240]   Stanford address was brilliant.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.240]   Some of his letters are really well written.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.040]   So I think he--
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:39.880]   Good point, Mike.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.960]   In another life, he would have been a fantastic writer,
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.080]   like his sister.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.560]   Yeah, I think that's a really good point.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.800]   I don't think he's getting credit for that.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.360]   That's absolutely true.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.280]   So we will see a documentary, a kind of rushed out documentary
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:58.920]   of Steve tomorrow, November 2nd, 10 o'clock Eastern on PBS.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.760]   And it will be the first broadcast of an interview.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:06.280]   He did it in 1994, where he details his philosophy from life.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.560]   There are also interviews with his business partners,
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.360]   associates, other tech journalists.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.920]   Woz will be on it, Walt Mossberg, one
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.280]   of the original founders of Apple, who was bought out
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.080]   a week later, Ron Wayne will be there.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.520]   But the main--
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.760]   The Pete Best of Apple.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.440]   The Pete Best of Apple.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.000]   But unlike Pete Best, Ron quit.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.520]   He said, I can't take this.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.400]   10 days into the company in 1977,
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.760]   they had brought him in-- he was an engineer at Atari.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.440]   They brought him in because he'd done other startups.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.240]   And he said, I don't need this.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.880]   Because he had just hung onto a stock.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.720]   He would have been many times richer than Steve Jobs was.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.520]   $35 billion or something like that.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:54.240]   This interview-- I don't know how it got made, but never
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.400]   aired.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.200]   I've done lots of interviews that I didn't.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.640]   I guess so.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.840]   He says, here's a quote, you tend to get told that the world is
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.400]   the way-- this is in '94, where he'd been forced out of Apple.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.200]   He was at Pixar and Next, just to put this in context.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.440]   Wasn't not yet at back at Apple.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.000]   He would go back in three years.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.600]   You tend to get told that the world is the way it is,
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.600]   but life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.800]   And that is that everything around you that you call life
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.080]   was made up by people no smarter than you.
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.280]   That's Steve.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.080]   Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.840]   And I have to say that I talk about this meeting Steve
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.080]   a year later, spending some time with him.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.280]   And that was the one thing I came away with, is that he knew
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.640]   he was smarter than anybody else in the room.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.160]   And so he's really what he's saying here is, I'm smarter
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.480]   than the people who made this crap up.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.080]   I can make-- that's why he didn't follow rules.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:51.580]   Correct.
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:52.520]   I don't have to have a license plate.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.280]   I could park at a disabled spot.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.080]   He followed the rules to some degree.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.560]   The issue is, evidently, that the story is with the no license
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.280]   plate, is that he got a new car every six months,
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.560]   and you're allowed to drive it out of--
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.120]   It was legal.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.000]   It was legal.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.600]   It just wasn't the way--
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.480]   By the way, that car, I looked, because I said,
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.680]   I'd like to have that SL55 AMG.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.280]   215,000 dollars.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.840]   Yeah, because AMG rebuilds it.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.000]   It's a lot more complicated.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.080]   Yes, it's not a Mercedes.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:20.920]   It's an AMG.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.680]   Well, I mean, it is a Mercedes, but it's the AMG thing.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.400]   Yeah, so Paul, it's a separate--
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.040]   AMG can add-- I don't know what they added to his car,
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.160]   but they can add bulletproof windows.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.040]   But he had to get an oil slick for you.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.600]   AMG can add oil slicks for you.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.040]   Oil slicks, like it's Spy Hunter.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.040]   So people would press a button, you can press a button.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.040]   Dude, dude, dude, dude.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.640]   I think they only do that for government officials, though.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.280]   And you might say somebody's in the chat room said, well, yeah,
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.400]   OK, you can make that self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.440]   Just surround yourself with Nimwitz.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.400]   But I don't think anybody would say that Steve did that.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.160]   In fact, if anything, he pushed away the people he thought
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:53.640]   were stupid.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.440]   We crushed them.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:54.920]   We crushed them.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.880]   And the people who surrounded him
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.280]   were people who would stand up to him, who were smart.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.080]   I mean, he did not want to be around dumb people.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.040]   They were very, very focused on what he called everybody.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.040]   The one thing is--
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.520]   I don't know if--
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.520]   I've been in a lot of meetings at one different loop.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.600]   And the closer you get to Steve, the more focused,
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.000]   the more clear-headed, the more intelligent--
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.400]   I mean, it just gets this.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.080]   Because that's the only people that survive.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.320]   If they're in-- the more meetings you're in with Steve,
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.000]   the only way to survive is to perform.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:26.920]   I have been thinking--
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.560]   I have been thinking--
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.560]   I have been thinking--
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.320]   Because we've talked a lot about, well, what happens to Apple
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.080]   after Steve leaves?
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.280]   And I've really been thinking about this
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:32.960]   and looking at them all.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.440]   And I watched the Memorial Service.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.600]   We watched a little bit of it last week on the show.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.440]   And I really come to the conclusion.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.800]   Well, Tim Cook is a nice guy, obviously, very competent,
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:46.080]   very capable, even tempered guy who can run a company.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.360]   The vision going forward is Johnny I, 100%.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.400]   And that's the good news, because Johnny and Steve
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.800]   worked really closely together for 15 years almost.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.720]   Johnny was there when Steve came back.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.480]   He was about to leave.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.520]   And Steve was so loud, and he said, I'm going to stick around.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.760]   And according to this book, there was no one
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.640]   could say no to Johnny I've accepted Steve Jobs.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.880]   He was a force in Apple.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.800]   And I bet you it's still that way.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.120]   And I think I think I've's vision with Cook's implementation
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:15.960]   is a pretty scary--
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.240]   That's not so bad.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.680]   --pretty scary combination.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.440]   That's not so bad.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.880]   So I think that Apple-- I have to revise my thoughts.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.040]   I really did think Apple didn't have much of a future
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.760]   minus Steve Jobs, but they still--
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.800]   they have Johnny I've and they have Tim Cook.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.240]   And maybe the two of them can make one.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:31.840]   Steve Jobs.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.480]   OK.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.320]   I know people are saying, oh, he's still
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.040]   talking about Steve Jobs.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.120]   Look, there would be no Mac break weekly with Steve Jobs.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.520]   I can tell you that right now.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.480]   There would be no Apple.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.640]   There would be nothing to tell you about that.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.640]   I don't know if this network would exist.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.040]   I don't know if I'd want to be doing
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.120]   obsessive conversations about enterprise computing
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.280]   in Windows.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.160]   I could tell you that.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.440]   Done that.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:57.880]   Done that.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.200]   Been there.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:58.720]   Done that.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.920]   It's no good, is it, Mike?
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.320]   No, no, no.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.240]   Our little question engine here is full of discontent, though.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:05.960]   About?
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.840]   There's two things.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.840]   The two big things that have been voted up here so far.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.120]   Well, we should tell, first of all, people
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.360]   where they can go to do this.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.440]   You can go to-- we haven't changed the URL a little.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.560]   By the time we actually change it--
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.080]   I don't care.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:15.720]   Leave it.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.200]   Pixelcore.force.com/pixelcore.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.560]   If you go to that--
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.240]   This is a Salesforce tool that allows people to ask questions
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.040]   and then vote them up.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.480]   Salesforce no longer uses it.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.280]   Yeah, they use it for their internal stuff.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.480]   But we use it a lot.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.640]   We use it more than they use.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.920]   We use it more than anyone else in the world.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.960]   So anyway, the-- so what you can do here is you can, of course,
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.320]   you can sign in, ask questions, and then vote them up and down.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.320]   And what happens interestingly enough is our viewers
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.760]   are very astute, and they get very, very good at voting the stuff
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.880]   up that they're interested in and pushing everything else out.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.120]   And so they separate pretty quickly.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.320]   So here's the big one.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.520]   It's the demise of the Mac Pro.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.000]   That's the number one.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.480]   This is from Peter James.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.320]   Will a possible Mac Pro end of life
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.640]   affect you as a creator of the developer?
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.800]   Don't give it away.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.160]   We're going to get to it.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:02.800]   But that's one.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.400]   And then somebody wants to know about iTunes Match.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.160]   We'll talk about that.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:05.760]   Those are the big ones.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.800]   And then of course, the next one is the--
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.680]   Back to the rumor mill.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.480]   The rumor mill about the maps.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.440]   I think that's very interesting.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.120]   Apple did just acquire us a new company.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.120]   We'll talk about that.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.440]   And we're going to put Mike Elgin on the spot.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.440]   He says, I hate the iPhone 4S.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.440]   Mike, you're going to be the only one at this table.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.240]   But we'll give you a chance.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.760]   When we come back, this is fun.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.360]   We're going to talk about a lot more Mac stuff in just a bit.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.760]   Will the Mac Pro go away?
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.720]   Wouldn't that be something?
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.640]   [GRUNTING]
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.560]   But first, I want to say hello to our friends at Citrix,
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.600]   the creators of the Fadtochtik.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.120]   Go to meeting now with HD Faces.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:44.880]   You want to try this out?
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.000]   Go to the website, go to meeting.com.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.200]   Click that orange try it free button.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.560]   And use the offer code Mac break.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.920]   You try it free for 30 days.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:53.920]   Does it work on a Mac?
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.600]   Does it work?
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.880]   Of course it works on a Mac.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.360]   PC too.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.400]   And now with the HD Faces, oh, baby.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.160]   You're going to see video of your clients, your customers,
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:03.720]   your colleagues.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.880]   They'll see you.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.720]   It's not just desktop sharing now.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.720]   It's video as well.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.800]   And I'll tell you, you're getting quality
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.800]   that people have been paying for dedicated telepresence stuff.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.840]   They've been paying tens of thousands of dollars
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.880]   for this kind of thing.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.320]   And you can do it with your own computer, your laptop.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.400]   And yes, even your iPad works great
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.200]   on the iPad.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.440]   So you can attend a meeting on the iPad, see the faces.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.640]   All you need is an internet connection and a webcam.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.400]   And you can use HD Faces right now for product reviews
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.360]   and demos, sales, presentations, training sessions, weekly status
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.680]   meetings, do it all from your desk and attend a meeting
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.840]   anywhere.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.120]   You know in the last time I used Go to Meeting?
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:42.840]   Not in the John.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.920]   Tell me not in the John.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.920]   No, no, no.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.200]   It was earlier this morning.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.680]   It's like every morning, every morning, every morning.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.320]   Every day you use it.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.960]   How can you not use it all the time?
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.400]   All the time.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.960]   If you've been using other meeting software,
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.920]   just do me a favor, try this for 30 days.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.560]   That's all I ask.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.960]   Go to meeting.com, click the try it free button.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.840]   And the offer code is Mac break.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.520]   Great stuff.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:08.120]   I could go on and on about 128-bit SSL, 24/7 customer
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.040]   support for you and all that stuff.
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.360]   It's very simple to install.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.280]   You don't need any IT support.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.880]   Doesn't that traversal beautifully?
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.200]   But that's believe it or that.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.680]   Thank you for your support, Citrix.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.080]   Go to meeting.com and use the offer code Mac break.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.720]   So the iPhone 4S comes out today in a bunch more countries.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:31.240]   In fact, I think it's now 22 countries.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.560]   They launched it literally in the US, Australia, Canada,
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.120]   France, Germany, Japan, and the UK.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.040]   Today they add Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark,
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.080]   Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia,
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.640]   I just love saying these names.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.520]   Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia,
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.200]   Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.680]   And already, you know, 4 million in the first three days
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.480]   of availability.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.800]   The big three carriers in the US AT&T Verizon and Sprint
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.920]   say that fully half of all the phones they're selling
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.800]   are iPhones, all the smartphones that they're selling.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.760]   It is the fastest selling phone, smartphone,
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.800]   and even perhaps consumer electronics
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.920]   gadget of all time.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.120]   But Mike Elgin says, wait for the iPhone 5.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.120]   Is it the battery life that's killing you, Mike?
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.680]   No, there's no one thing about it that
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.840]   makes me come to that conclusion.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.440]   Like you, I love Siri.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.920]   I love both the idea and the promise of Siri.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.680]   And it kind of works.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.520]   It does work.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.040]   I mean, and for me personally, I'm not for this kind of thing.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.520]   I'm constantly setting alarms.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.520]   I'm constantly sending myself or other people
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.920]   messages or email while running or something like that.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.920]   While driving, I don't have my reading glasses when I'm
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.240]   driving or around town.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.680]   So it's great for that sort of thing.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.600]   I love Siri.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.680]   Love everything about Siri.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.640]   And that's why I still use an iPhone 4S
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.040]   is because of Siri.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:04.840]   However, happiness is the difference
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.080]   between what you expect and what you get.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.880]   And we-- and I expected-- and I think
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.160]   we all had the right to expect something different
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.520]   in multiple areas for starters.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:19.160]   They actually bragged about the battery life in the keynote
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.480]   and talked about how great the battery life is.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.960]   And people's mileage varies.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.640]   Some people are getting great battery life.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.280]   Other people are getting horrible battery life.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.720]   I have to charge my iPhone twice a day.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.320]   And if I don't charge it overnight,
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.920]   my alarm doesn't go off in the morning because it's dead by the
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.320]   time it's time for me to get up.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.240]   So an Apple has acknowledged this problem.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:39.920]   They're working on it.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.520]   I'm sure there'll be a fix at some point.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.600]   For the time being, battery life is an issue for lots of people.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.600]   One theory is-- and I'm just going to just--
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.880]   and then I'll let you continue.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:53.560]   One theory is that it's a location services issue.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:58.480]   That if you go in your-- do you have the overhead shot?
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.880]   I only know how to get her to punch that up
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.000]   so I can show you.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.120]   If you go to your settings in the phone and then go to
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.680]   location services right here, and then scroll all the way
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.080]   down to the bottom, you'll see system services.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.240]   See, that's part of the problem.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.160]   Nobody gets to the bottom.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:21.120]   And then they say one of the issues is setting time zone.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.640]   Now, I have to say I turn it off anyway because if you're
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.600]   not traveling, there's no reason for it to check where you
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.440]   are at the time zone.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.320]   Although, I think that's a great feature.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:28.880]   I like it.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.720]   But I'm in a lot of different time zones.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.080]   Yeah, you would want to leave it on.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.280]   Now you could tell what's checking--
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.640]   what has recent-- it says a purple location services icon
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.040]   will appear next to an item that is currently using your
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:41.880]   location.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.640]   So you could tell what's turning on the GPS.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.520]   The theory behind this being that GPS and we do know this
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.720]   uses a lot of battery life.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.080]   Any time I've installed on a phone, including an Android
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.600]   phone, anything that checks GPS a lot, that kills the
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.240]   battery.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.040]   But I think Mike, one of the reasons this is such an
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.840]   intransigent problem is that it's not consistent.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.120]   It's hard to reproduce.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.880]   I think each phone-- I think different phones may have
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.640]   different problems.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.600]   I've had a lot of trouble with my iPad battery life.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.000]   And not only--
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:10.840]   On iOS 5?
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.680]   On iOS 5.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.000]   And not so much--
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.280]   A lot of people complaining about that.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.000]   My iPads, if I leave them-- if I don't plug them in, they
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.960]   drain right out since I upgraded them.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.440]   My iPhone 4s, not so much.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.040]   Yeah, and my wife-- we installed the iOS 5, my
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.440]   wife's phone, and she immediately had half the
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.640]   battery life.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.160]   But the issue is really--
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.040]   you expect it with--
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.840]   I mean, Apple is so brilliant at delivering.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.400]   I think the single most brilliant consumer electronics
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.520]   launch of all time was the iPad, the original iPad in April
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.880]   of 2010.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.400]   Because the first time out of the gate, they created a
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.960]   product that was fantastic.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.240]   I mean, unprecedented.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.960]   It's a whole new category of product that wasn't full of
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.240]   flaws, problems, bugs, nothing.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.960]   It was good to go.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.800]   And it was amazing.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.720]   And so we kind of have learned to expect that sort of
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.240]   thing.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.520]   Now, the iPhone 4s is supposed to be usually what happens,
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.320]   companies come out with a new product, and it has some
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.400]   flaws, and they work on them.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.640]   And then they come out with the updated product, and it's
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.520]   just butter.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.320]   Well, this was supposed to be the butter version.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.000]   This was supposed to be the one that just out of the
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:15.880]   gate works fantastic.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.800]   This was supposed to be their Windows 7.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.520]   Yeah, this is the Pro-Yos.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.000]   Exactly.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.040]   This was supposed to be the perfected version of the
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.280]   iPhone 4.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.600]   And yet, in many of these things that I'm talking about,
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.920]   it's a step back.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.880]   What do you think, Adam?
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.500]   I'm with Mike on the battery life thing I've had issues
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.840]   with mine, although turning location services off.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.080]   The other one that seemed to help is if you're using
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.040]   geofence reminders, that seems to be a problem.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:41.800]   Well, I love that.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.760]   So that's a serious thing you could do where you say, when
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.440]   I leave here, remind me to call my wife.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.520]   That's a great feature.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.520]   Yes.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.680]   I love that.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.840]   The GPS constantly.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.400]   Constantly.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.160]   The GPS pulling.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:53.520]   Right.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.960]   Well, it's going to kill your battery life.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.600]   So they got to--
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.400]   I mean, that's the same thing I people say with Android
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:58.720]   phones.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.400]   And by the way, the iPhone 4 still has a better battery
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.480]   life than most Android phones.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.320]   You just want to point that out.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.140]   It's bad compared to other iPhones.
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.180]   But it's not bad compared to Android phones.
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:10.500]   It's much more like an Android phone.
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.340]   But on Android phones, yeah, you could-- same thing.
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.180]   They say, well, turn that off, turn that off, turn that off,
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.700]   and yet gets great battery life.
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.780]   But we don't want to turn off.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:17.060]   You know what?
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.540]   I just put a Mofie case on here.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.020]   I have just a massive secondary battery.
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:22.260]   He's a much larger phone.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:22.780]   But it doesn't--
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:24.900]   One of the best things is not changing the design,
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.260]   so I can still use my juice pack.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:26.940]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:27.420]   Yeah.
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.380]   That was the best thing.
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.500]   That's not a good thing, right?
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:29.820]   No.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.060]   The other thing that Mike pointed out in his piece
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:36.280]   that I was really impressed initially with the camera,
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.600]   better 8 megapixel camera.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.120]   I love the camera.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.200]   Great pictures.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.380]   But I've noticed that I have to be a lot more still with it,
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.720]   it seemed to not get blurry pictures
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.320]   when the lighting gets a little bit.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.120]   Are you using HD on?
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.040]   Are you using HD on?
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.120]   No, I'm not using HD.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.120]   It's the same on both.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.560]   There are two places where I take a lot of pictures.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.720]   Weed across fit, and my whole family does it.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:04.040]   So sometimes I take pictures of people doing crossfit.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:08.880]   And the lighting in there is like 80% or 85% of sunlight.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.800]   And then I take a lot of pictures in the kitchen
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.120]   when I'm cooking.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.880]   And that's about 80% sunlight.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.400]   And if there's any motion on the part of the photographer,
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.360]   which can happen, or on the part of the subject,
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.040]   it's just a blur.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.640]   Last night, I made a pizza, and I was taking pictures,
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.600]   action shots of the sauce going in the pan,
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.240]   and stuff like that.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.400]   It's just a blur.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.280]   And the reason I noticed it is that I'm
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.000]   taking the same types of pictures
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.600]   in the same exact locations with the exact same light
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.680]   that I used to take for a long time on the four.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.360]   And those pictures used to come out much better on the four.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.680]   I'm wondering if there's hardware issues,
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.840]   because I don't have that at all.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.160]   I'm looking at some pictures I took.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.240]   I was holding this out the window of my car
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.600]   as I drove down a hill.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.560]   And it's perfect.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.560]   And I look at this one.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.400]   I took this at night last night.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.400]   Like I took this at night.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.280]   I think there must be different iPhone 4s.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.040]   Because my experience has been--
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.680]   I have to admit that there's sometimes where I find it,
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.880]   we're convenient to take out my iPhone 4 than my 5D.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.320]   You know, it's just kind of like, oh, it'll actually--
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:11.360]   it'll actually like the photo more for what I'm doing.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.720]   Not a classic photo.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:15.960]   And I've been surprised at the low light performance.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.280]   To be honest with you, I mean, I shot these jackal linens
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.560]   in the middle at night in Petaluma last night.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.280]   And they are perfectly sharp.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.400]   The other thing is, the thing is,
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.080]   it seems to be inconsistent both on the battery license.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.400]   Some days I'll have great battery life.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.200]   And other days I don't do the same thing with the photos.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.720]   Sometimes I'll snap the photos.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.440]   And they look great.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.640]   But I've had other instances where I've taken a photo.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.920]   I thought I was perfectly still.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.160]   And then you zoom into it.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.080]   And it's slightly blurry.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.680]   And I don't know why.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.040]   I don't know what I'm doing differently.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.080]   It makes sense that this is happening
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.440]   because there's a larger aperture.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.680]   And so that's an advantage when you want to, as Apple said,
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:52.680]   let more light in and get more detail.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:57.240]   But that's likely to lead to a higher likelihood
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.600]   of blurry pictures.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.800]   No, that's not crazy.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.160]   That's the opposite.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.160]   Oh, is it?
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.400]   The larger aperture means that you have a faster shutter.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.000]   You have a shorter depth of field, but a faster shutter.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.520]   OK.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.680]   I've got it backwards.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.480]   But I mean, I saw it on my kitchen.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.480]   And this is shot in my kitchen.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.400]   And it's probably 20% of daylight.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.720]   I just went through all my pictures.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.120]   And it's perfectly--
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.000]   it's some great brisket.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.200]   I have some blur when people are moving in a low light
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.200]   situation.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.880]   But maybe your hand is shakier than mine,
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.520]   because I haven't had any.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.840]   Now, I'm looking at the verge.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:28.360]   I'm going to change all of it, man.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.320]   Are you shaky?
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.320]   I'm not shaking hands.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.680]   The verge published a picture comparing the Galaxy Nexus
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.160]   to the iPhone 4S.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.720]   By the way, the Nexus seems to do quite a good job.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.040]   This is the new verge, by the way.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:41.760]   They launched today.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.720]   Congratulations to Joshua, Tobulski, and company.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.560]   What a sight.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.800]   They've done a great--
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.000]   this out-engadgets and gadget, I might add.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:50.840]   Have you seen it yet?
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.840]   I'm not just writing.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.560]   It's just to distract everybody.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:57.280]   But it's just amazing what they've done with this.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.080]   Anyway.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.680]   Let me show you an example.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.080]   OK, good.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.120]   And this is like a demo--
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.440]   if you go to my Google+ page, I just
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.480]   re-shared a picture I took last night of the pizza making
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.680]   process.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.800]   And as you can see, when you get to that,
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.680]   everything is clear, except the part that's moving.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.720]   So it's not the hand shaking.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.680]   You see the sauce pouring in the pan.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.920]   The background, yeah.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:25.600]   Yeah, and this was not a dark kitchen.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.560]   I'm just simply pouring sauce into a pan.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.400]   And it's--
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:28.840]   Yes, yes.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.600]   So the motion blur here from the sauce moving, yeah.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.360]   The one thing that I've noticed with mine--
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.360]   and this is just a theory I haven't had a chance
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.560]   to really test it out.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.240]   But it seems to be pulling the autofocus,
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.360]   like all tap to focus.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.080]   And then I get instances where-- especially in low light,
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.680]   where it's constantly trying to refocus.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.800]   And I think it might be also just slightly a timing issue.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.000]   So the thing with all of these problems
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.800]   that I've been having with the 4S is the good news.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.640]   It sounds like most of them are probably
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.000]   fixable in software.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.440]   It's just tweaking the software.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.520]   Including the battery issues, because they don't seem
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.720]   to be consistent, which I think is a good sign.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.220]   Yeah.
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.800]   By the way, these are great pictures.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.600]   Thank you.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.400]   Like the--
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.520]   I wouldn't complain.
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.000]   In fact, I don't even mind the fact
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.320]   that the sauce is blurred as it's going out of the pan.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.480]   We get some sense of motion.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.640]   I don't think that hurts the picture.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.520]   But I see what you-- I understand what you're saying.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.360]   Well, the point is--
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.960]   This is also a very low light situation.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.720]   I mean, you're--
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.560]   It's not super low and it's not super high.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.240]   But the only point is that if I took that picture with an iPhone
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.480]   4, it wouldn't have been that blur.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.080]   It would have been maybe a little bit of motion blur.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.480]   Look at the depths of field on the--
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.160]   Yeah, I love the depth of field.
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.600]   I mean, it's a fantastic camera, otherwise.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.440]   But it's just one of the six things
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:40.200]   that I found on this phone that I personally found
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.720]   is a little bit more annoying.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.760]   I'm throwing away and deleting a higher percentage
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.840]   of my photos because of blur.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.760]   That's the only point I was trying to make there.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.600]   No, I understand.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.480]   OK, so that's two battery camera.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.280]   What else?
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.360]   OK, so the screen people are complaining about yellow screens.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.240]   And I had a very yellow--
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.680]   Oh, that happens every time, though, right?
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.120]   Well, but it's not necessarily the case.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:02.960]   Now, the old yellowing used to be splotchy.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:03.840]   And it was a glue.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.360]   Right.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.040]   And as it dried, as it cured, it got better.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.480]   Now, this seems to be completely even across the screen.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.080]   It's different for black than a white iPhone.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.720]   So we have a white one, a black one,
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.720]   and we have a couple of iPhone 4s around the house.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.520]   So I compared the new 4S, white, the new 4S, black,
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.880]   and the old 4.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.240]   And the 4 looks much better.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.320]   It's got really great color.
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.360]   The white phone has a little bit of yellowing,
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.840]   and the black phone is noticeably yellow.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.720]   And in terms of the blues look greenish,
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.680]   that's how it shows up.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.040]   And so, again, this is a minor problem.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.480]   This could be correctable software.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.560]   It could actually be glue.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.200]   We don't know yet.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.280]   I still have yellowing.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.120]   It doesn't seem to be going away yet.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:56.680]   But again, the point is that when you have an upgrade of a phone,
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.640]   especially from a company like Apple,
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:02.320]   you expect the screen to be better, higher res, better
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.800]   color, something, or at the very least, exactly the same.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.160]   But here we went from a screen, and now we
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.600]   have an inferior screen.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.560]   OK, now that's three things.
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.520]   And again, proof is in the pudding.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.800]   Many of these things could be resolved one way or another.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.960]   Now, this is another one that it's difficult to argue about
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.800]   because beauty is in the eye of the holder.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:28.480]   But some of the Apple's software design decisions
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:32.480]   are questionable to me.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.320]   For example, they started putting wood paneling bookshelves.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.480]   I hate that.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.080]   I hate it too.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:38.560]   I hate that stuff.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.720]   It seems so unappled.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.680]   The worst one is "Find My Friends,"
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.440]   which is a stitched leather wallet.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.960]   It looks like a wallet that you made in cash, summer camp.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.120]   Well, maybe that's the point.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.520]   Well, you know, I can understand the design sensibility.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.440]   If Microsoft did it, I'd kind of think, wow, you know,
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.920]   and that's good.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.120]   But Apple has taste.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.200]   Yeah, there's a blogger or designer guy named James Higg,
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:06.320]   who he had a somewhat exaggerated post about this.
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.280]   But he called it, if it's hilarious.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.760]   It's a word for this.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:14.240]   He said it was saccharine patronizing Disney-like sinister.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.440]   It's mendacity.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.120]   That's what I like.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.040]   He says it lies.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.240]   It lies.
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.280]   It lies because it's a lot of software.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:27.960]   And most importantly, it's discordant
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:32.720]   with the hardware industrial design, which is not--
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.520]   It's not--
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.560]   It's not a ham.
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.920]   It's huge.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.200]   It's science fictional.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.560]   We need to talk about that.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:40.600]   We're going to call you right back, Mike.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.600]   We're really losing you.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.320]   But I think we understood that what you were saying.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:48.840]   And I thought that was a great blog post, a classic blog post,
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.600]   over the top.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.200]   But I think there's something to be said for this.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.880]   We've been complaining about the fact
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:57.360]   that I, Cal, has little bits of ripped off pieces of paper.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.440]   I like to when Apple has that kind of range.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.320]   There's a way to get rid of that?
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.040]   Well, with doing some hacking, you know.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.120]   Or use a different program.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.000]   Yeah, I think David Sparks told me
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.760]   that he hacked his username.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.040]   He just couldn't take it.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:11.760]   He couldn't take it.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:16.640]   He went into the package contents and cleaned it up.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:17.920]   He said he could do that.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.920]   He had that on his desk.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:19.920]   The blotter on his desk.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.880]   He'd be obsessively ripping that stuff away.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.840]   Skeumorific.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.560]   There's the word ish.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:24.960]   Thank you.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.960]   Skeumorific.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:30.480]   I just want to underscore something.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.720]   I think we sometimes think that Apple is 100%.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.120]   And that Steve's taste was 100%.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.840]   There are plenty of examples in the world
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.680]   where it wasn't 100%.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:41.920]   This is one of them.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.240]   And I don't think that, you know,
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.160]   I think that to some extent it's kind of surprising.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.400]   But at the other-- but people make mistakes.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.440]   And this was just a-- this was bad, bad design.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.400]   Well, here's the problem that I'm having.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.120]   And this has been years coming.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.360]   There's been little pieces of this going along.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.320]   But for me, the thing is Apple has always
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.640]   been about consistency.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.520]   About things being the same when I move from app to app.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.320]   Things are the same.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.520]   And now they're playing with these unusual interfaces
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.280]   that are totally changing.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.600]   And what you lose is that ease of use
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.520]   that we've always had and come to love.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.000]   That I'm going to open this app and I'm
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.520]   going to know how everything works, whatever button does,
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.560]   where everything is.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.360]   And now that's going away.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.840]   I mean, somebody asked me something as simple as,
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.000]   you open up your contacts.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.720]   It used to say right there on the bottom in the address book,
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.160]   how many contacts you had when you were viewing all contacts.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.160]   Somebody said, where is that?
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.080]   It's gone.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.440]   You have to actually-- it's still there.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.200]   But now you have to scroll the entire list.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.360]   So if you have 1,000 contacts, 1,500 contacts,
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.040]   you scroll all the way down.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:47.800]   And there are a lot of examples of that, Adam.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.720]   And I think to some degree, that happens over time.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.960]   You have a pure vision.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.160]   I mean, the original 1984 Mac, I had the--
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.480]   because I wrote software in those days.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:01.000]   And I had the original Mac user interface guidelines,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:01.880]   the API books.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.800]   There was a brain shell for that stuff.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:09.840]   And it was draconian and completely prescriptive.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.160]   And you will do this, and you will not do that.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.680]   But as time goes by, these things soften and change in mold.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.760]   In fact, you can give Steve some credit that over a period of--
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.600]   what does it does?
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.920]   27 years.
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:26.400]   He managed to preserve some uniformity in that Mac interface.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.360]   But I think over time, that stuff goes away.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:35.720]   I think it's kind of--
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.840]   we don't expect it from Apple.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.320]   And I have to say, having moved from the Android universe
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.200]   to the iPhone universe, at least for the time being,
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.000]   there are some Android user interface features.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   I miss the iPhone, because every app is by a different designer.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.040]   Every freaking app has a different way to do stuff.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.960]   There's no very little uniformity app to app.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.720]   Believe it or not, there's more uniformity in the Android app
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.560]   space than there is in the Apple app space.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.560]   And that's a little shocking.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.600]   I've come back to Apple for the time being.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.960]   And I'm in apps, and I can't figure out what the hell do I do?
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.640]   You have to press the home button.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.200]   You have to press the home button.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.760]   There was a reason there were those guidelines
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.840]   that I think were important.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.640]   I think we're moving almost too far in the other direction.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.200]   I think there's a middle ground you can find here,
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.960]   where you can still do creative designs,
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.880]   and you can do creative things with your apps.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.600]   But there's also some core features,
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:32.400]   like you're saying, certain buttons, and how maybe toolbars are,
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.000]   and where items are.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.040]   I think on the Mac, now developers
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.040]   don't have to conform to where, say, the preferences is.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.720]   Most apps have, just by default, put it under the application
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.920]   menu, but not every app that I have has that.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.880]   In the old days, it was like, OK, you have to file.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.280]   You have an open, you have an edit, and it's under this menu,
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.480]   and it's there.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.760]   And that adds a sense of grounding,
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.120]   I think, to the user experience.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.720]   We're sounding like old farts, but I think this is important.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:01.120]   Yes.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.520]   Let's sound like new farts, and look at the--
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.040]   to me, what is the most shocking reality that's happened
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.480]   recently, which is that suddenly Google
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.840]   is designing some really nice web services.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.640]   Gmail, the new Gmail looks great.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:13.920]   The new--
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.840]   Getting really?
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:14.840]   Wow.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:20.600]   Google+, I mean, these are Apple-like in their form
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.600]   and function unification.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.920]   And these designs, we started talking about the--
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.680]   find my friends.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.880]   Those are designed by Apple.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.880]   The third party design is a separate issue
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.880]   that needs to be addressed, but Apple itself
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.840]   is designing software that's starting
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.960]   to be a little cheesy, and Google, of all companies,
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.640]   is starting to design web interfaces that are pretty elegant.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.440]   Well, remember, everybody works for everybody.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.960]   I mean, everybody's moved around 100 times.
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.360]   Well, they're just starting to clean everything up.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.960]   That's the big thing with Google,
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.280]   they've learned that there's this thing called white space.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:58.360]   It's crazy that if you use it a little bit here and there,
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.400]   it turns out to be a good--
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:03.120]   Well, there's a great passage in the Plex, the book,
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:08.120]   about Google by Stephen Levy, where Marissa Mayors is quoted
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:10.880]   as saying that the design sensibility for Google
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.560]   is that we wanted to look like a machine designed it, not
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.120]   a human.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:17.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.280]   And the design--
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.480]   She told that to the design department of Google.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.160]   And they said, oh, finally, now we get it,
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.720]   make it look like a machine designed it.
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:27.000]   But the new designs look like a human designed it.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.040]   And in fact, the guy who designed the circles
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:33.560]   editor for Google+, which is the most elegant interface
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.280]   that I'm aware of that Google has designed,
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:41.720]   is that project was headed by one of the original designers
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:42.400]   for the Macintosh.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:42.720]   Right.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:43.240]   Andy Hertzfeld.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:43.840]   Andy Hertzfeld.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.320]   Andy Hertzfeld.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.600]   That's what's so interesting.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.880]   John Rubenstein went to WebO as in Palm and then
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.200]   sank out of the site.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.080]   So everybody moves around.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.240]   I mean, Silicon Valley is constantly in flux.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.600]   So I'm not surprised that some good people go end up at Google,
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.000]   some people leave Apple, and so forth.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.120]   Anyway, this is a great conversation.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:03.960]   Did you hit all of the six-- what was it?
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.200]   Seven things you hate about the first?
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:05.880]   There are six things.
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.240]   And there's just a couple more.
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.040]   And these are a little bit more controversial.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.840]   One is iCloud.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.280]   If you're a Google user and you're synchronizing through
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.920]   Exchange, iCloud can be problematic and difficult.
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:23.760]   And the solution to that, as many of my critics were kind
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:27.480]   enough to point out to me, is I have to do this, have to do
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:27.960]   that.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.640]   But a lot of these things sound very
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:32.360]   unappled like in terms of the solution.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.040]   On other platforms like Windows, oh, the problem is you.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:35.960]   The problem is the user.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.080]   You're not doing XYZ.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.760]   You're not reformatting it wrong.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.200]   Right.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.240]   And that's the reply we're suddenly getting with the new
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.440]   iPhone and iCloud.
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:44.640]   Oh, the problem is the user.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:48.480]   You're not smart enough or you're not technical enough to
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.320]   use this product.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.200]   And that's the problem.
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.120]   It's not the product.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.000]   And the sixth thing is Siri itself.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.840]   I actually was a serious user of Siri before it was a
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:00.680]   feature and when it was an app.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.840]   And I figured, wow, they had all this time to work on it.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.880]   This is going to be amazing.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:08.480]   And in fact, I'd been in many arguments with people
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.520]   essentially saying, no, Siri's going to be really, really
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:10.800]   great.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:11.480]   And it is great.
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:12.960]   There's no question that Siri is great.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.920]   But it makes a lot more mistakes over simple things
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.880]   than I would have thought.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:21.120]   And sometimes it doesn't recognize what you say.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.440]   And that's one problem.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.840]   Another problem is sometimes it recognizes what you say and
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.120]   then does weird things with it.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:32.040]   Like, for example, I told it to remind me when I get home to
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.400]   recharge my phone.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:36.400]   And it said, OK, calling Iris.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:40.800]   Iris was a thing I set up to automatically call IFTTT.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:41.960]   It was in my contacts.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:46.080]   But it showed me what it understood correctly.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.720]   And it said, oh, I understand that you're saying, remind me
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.160]   when I get home.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.800]   And then the action was something else.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.080]   So they said it's beta.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.320]   That's kind of like nitpicking.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:54.680]   I agree.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.240]   That's probably an unfair one.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.600]   But I thought it would be better, personally.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:01.360]   Well, it's not an unfair one because the real reasons to
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.920]   switch to a 4S are the camera and Siri.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.920]   So if one of those things is kind of only, it is a little
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.840]   broken, then that's a reasonable thing to bring up.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.280]   I don't think that that-- yes, it's in beta.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.720]   But that doesn't let you off the hook if that's a reason to
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.040]   switch.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.400]   And your point isn't that you don't like the 4S, but that
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.040]   it would be better to wait for the 5 if you haven't yet.
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.640]   If you're not obsessed with Siri, if you're not like, wow, I've
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.600]   got to have Siri, then no, I would recommend that you wait
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.400]   for the 5 because this is--
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.320]   if you've got a 4.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.680]   Now, if you've got a 3G--
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.920]   Oh, you've got to upgrade if you've got it.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:30.600]   You've got to upgrade.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.720]   And this is the one you're going to upgrade to.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.960]   And again, I think many of these problems will be solved.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.960]   The camera in most conditions is far superior and a
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.160]   wonderful camera.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.960]   And there's much to recommend in the phone.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:46.560]   But I just got the feeling that--
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:51.880]   it just seems so unappled like to release an updated version
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.840]   of a major product like the iPhone with so many of these
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.520]   niggling little problems.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.640]   And I just got the feeling that they said, you know what?
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:04.280]   We can't go through an entire year without releasing a phone
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:05.760]   because they had to release this.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.200]   There wouldn't have been any phone in 2011.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.000]   And I get the feeling that they said, you know, the phone is
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:11.440]   unfinished.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:11.920]   But you know what?
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:15.320]   We can throw our unfinished voice recognition--
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.600]   it's intelligent agents in there.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.680]   And everybody will love it anyway.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.440]   And I think that's what happened.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.280]   I mean, if without Siri, imagine this.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.200]   I mean, it would have been a disaster.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.160]   I'll give you the opposing argument, which is this is
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.640]   exactly what Apple did with the iPad as well.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.640]   That their new mode is not to make these major upgrades
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.920]   every single time, but to do incremental upgrades.
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:37.960]   The iPad 2 was only slightly better than the iPad 1.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:40.000]   The camera, for instance, nobody would use it.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.120]   It was terrible.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.920]   I actually like-- there's a lot of the iPad 1 that I still like.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.840]   I actually like it to be a little thicker.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.680]   The 2 is, you know, is a marginal improvement.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.000]   In much the same way, the 4S is a marginal improvement.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.400]   And I think that we will see an iPad 3 that will be a more
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.280]   significant improvement.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:58.160]   And we'll see an iPad, whatever, 5 that will be a more
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.320]   significant improvement.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.480]   I have a feeling.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:04.120]   I don't-- we won't know until the next biography comes out,
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:05.560]   the Tim Cook biography.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:09.920]   But I have a feeling that this isn't-- this is actually
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:10.840]   intentional.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.320]   Not let's throw something out so we have a phone this year.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:13.840]   I think that--
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.520]   And by the way, I got to point out, it's wildly successful
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.400]   as we said when it started.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.000]   And we didn't make a mistake from a business point of you
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:22.520]   at all.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.760]   Well, I think you also have-- you have a lot of toedippers,
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:29.120]   which there's a lot of people who got the $99 version of the
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:33.040]   3G or whatever-- 3GS, whatever-- the $99 version.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.200]   And they said, well, I'm going to see if I like an iPhone
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:35.800]   or not.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.200]   And now they've decided, OK, this is what I want to use.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:42.720]   And now I want to go ahead and upgrade to the 4S.
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.280]   And so I think you end up with a lot of conversion.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:47.560]   You have a handful of people like us that go from the 4 to
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:47.920]   the 4S.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.920]   I think there's a lot of people out there that are going from
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:53.480]   3Gs and 3GSes to the 4S.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:56.360]   I think that's a big source of its success.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:56.880]   I agree.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:00.480]   And for me, all I needed was a faster processor, a better
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.920]   camera, and Siri.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.840]   Those were the three things that-- for me, Siri is a
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.080]   huge--
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:09.040]   I can't go back.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.040]   I can't go back.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:13.160]   I don't care if it barely works some of the time, but the
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.400]   thing is, is I am such--
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:15.720]   I have so many things going on.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:17.920]   Maybe you'll be able to talk to someone and just say--
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.400]   So you put aside that the Galaxy--
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.800]   I'm still-- I use it for the camera.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.720]   I'm testing it more than anything else.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.800]   But it's not even close.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.240]   I would say it's close to me.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:31.480]   I mean, and that Siri was enough just to slightly balance
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.640]   it and favor the iPhone.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.360]   But I could go back to Android at any moment.
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.200]   I feel like--
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.240]   Which is good news.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.160]   There's some real parity on these platforms.
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:38.520]   I do--
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:39.240]   There are parts of it.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:41.720]   I like the maps better on the Android.
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.440]   We're going to talk about those maps in a second.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.480]   Yeah, but I like those better.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.400]   I like the way it interacts better.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.200]   But there's not much about the Android that I like better
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.600]   than the 4S.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:51.680]   Adam, what do you think?
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.040]   I'm an iPhone 4.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.320]   No, I'm not asking about Android.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.640]   I think that would be foolish.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:02.120]   Just in general on the 4S, you think it's enough?
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:05.080]   I totally agree with what Alex is saying.
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.160]   I mean, a lot of people, I think,
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:09.360]   are moving from a 3GS or a 3G.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.120]   And the iPhone 4S is their first iPhone 4.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:13.520]   And that's fabulous.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.520]   I mean, I remember that upgrade a year ago.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:17.400]   And there was enough in it for me
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.000]   between Siri and the camera and things like that.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.600]   And then all these issues that we're talking about,
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.960]   I really think are software tweaks that can get fixed
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:26.280]   in terms of the battery life, in terms of some of how
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.840]   the camera's doing its focusing for me and things like that.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.040]   And I think they're going to be addressed.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.960]   But to Mike's initial point, it's sort of like you,
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.160]   as an Apple fan or person who follows this,
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.240]   you expect more out of Apple.
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.880]   You don't expect these little annoyances to be in there.
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:42.640]   And they are.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.240]   I mean, they are there, so we can't ignore them.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.840]   Let's move along to our next topic.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:51.280]   Actually, before we move to our next topic,
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.720]   I do want to talk about Apple's latest acquisition
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:56.320]   and what it might mean for maps.
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.400]   And we do know, by the way, that Apple has reached out
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:01.240]   to owners trying to figure out what's going on
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:02.560]   with a couple of these little bugs.
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:09.320]   So presumably, there will be fixes to this at some point.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.640]   But we will talk about the new maps.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.360]   We will talk about the rumors.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:14.480]   We will answer your questions on the--
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.440]   On the force.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.920]   What is that force URL again?
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:20.760]   It's pixacord.force.com/pixacord.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.720]   So ask a question there and vote up the questions you
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:24.560]   want us to answer.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.040]   You can see how much branding we get out of that URL.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.040]   We start in ends.
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:30.080]   Pixel core, pixel core, pixel core, pixel core, pixel core,
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:32.000]   pixel core, pixel core, pixel core, pixel core, pixel core.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.560]   This show brought to you by our friends at Ford.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.160]   Ford is doing a-- we're going to have a great time at a barbecue
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.800]   coming up, and we'll give you details on that.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.080]   We still-- we better get going on that.
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.920]   That's just a couple of weeks.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.880]   November 13th, we're going to have a barbecue for us.
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:47.120]   We're going to bring all their newest vehicles.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.120]   You get a look at them.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.360]   Has some food, watch, Twitch.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:52.160]   Watch our new gaming show as it begins its pre-production.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.120]   It won't be a release version.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.480]   It'll be probably our first rehearsal
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:58.280]   with our new hosts, Veronica Belmont and Brian Brushwood.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:01.120]   Our new show, Game On, begins probably the week
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:02.640]   after November 20th.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.600]   If you go to Ford.com/technology,
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.480]   you could see ahead of time some of the things you'll
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:11.080]   be seeing at the barbecue, things like the incredible app link.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.400]   I love this.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.600]   You know, Ford-- Alan Malale told me this in an interview
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.640]   a couple of months ago.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.920]   He said, you know, we realize that the smartphones are
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.080]   going to move faster than our car can because the design
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.240]   cycles are shorter.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:24.960]   So we have made it possible for your smartphone interface
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:26.480]   with your Ford Sync.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:27.360]   They call it app link.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:33.880]   It's an API for apps so that you can talk to apps in your car.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:35.280]   Press the button on your steering wheel.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:38.040]   Keep your eyes on the road, your hands on the wheel,
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:43.040]   and say things like, Pandora, play my classic rock station.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.440]   Or bookmark this song.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:45.040]   I want to buy it.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.360]   Or thumbs up, thumbs down.
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:49.000]   Pandora is one of the apps.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.760]   Stitcher Smart Radio is already out.
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.240]   Open beak, which is really cool.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:53.640]   It'll read you your tweets.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:56.480]   These are available right now on Sync Equipped 2011 Ford
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:01.760]   Fiesta's factory installed on the 2012 Fusion and Mustang.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:06.520]   And it works with iPhone, even the 3GS.
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.520]   Android, of course, BlackBerry as well,
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.360]   with the latest BlackBerry OS.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.120]   I just think this is just one more way
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.360]   Ford is really staying ahead of the pack.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:18.560]   Apps that talk to your car and your car talks back.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.160]   This is Siri for automobiles.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:22.600]   Of course, we talked about how you can turn your car
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.200]   into a Wi-Fi access spot.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.640]   There's some neat things too for parents.
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:26.800]   You might be interested in this, Alex.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.120]   I was.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:31.760]   Ford has, they call it MyKey technology.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.640]   Let me see if I can find this.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:35.120]   Is that like, Hey, MyKey?
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:35.800]   MyKey.
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.120]   MyKey'll like it.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:39.920]   When you give your car keys to the teenagers, yours aren't yet.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:41.600]   Believe me, they will be sooner than you.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:42.120]   I have a teenager.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:42.520]   Oh, that's right.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:42.920]   You do.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:43.440]   I forgot.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:47.240]   Well, when you give the car keys to the teenagers,
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:50.080]   using this MyKey technology keeps an eye on what they're doing.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:53.680]   For instance, you can set a maximum speed, a maximum volume
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.960]   on the audio system.
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:57.200]   I love this.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.960]   The low fuel light comes on sooner,
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:01.880]   because we know teenagers will not fill up the 10.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:03.720]   So they-- I mean, is that funny?
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:04.280]   That's awesome.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.800]   At 75 miles too empty.
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.600]   They turn on their low-- you need gas.
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.080]   Don't forget, dad's going to be mad.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:12.160]   It's a special ignition key just for your teenager.
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.600]   They can set all these parameters.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.320]   One of many ways Ford is really innovating.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:16.800]   Find out about all of them.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:19.920]   At your local Ford dealer, take a look at the Fiesta,
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:23.840]   the new 2011 Fiesta for the App Link with Ford Sync.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.880]   And I want to start a Fiesta onto our pond.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.160]   We did donuts.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:29.160]   We didn't have a Ford Sync.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.360]   I got a website for you.
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.320]   A new one?
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.720]   Ford.com.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:33.720]   Twin barbecues.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:34.720]   Oh.
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.160]   Wow.
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.840]   We set something up.
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.160]   Twit barbecues is--
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:40.000]   There's a banner on our Twit.tv website,
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.200]   but I just clicked on that.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:44.080]   And it doesn't go to this, but twitbarbecues.com.
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:46.800]   Well, it's the first one's coming up on the 13th.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:47.300]   Yes.
[00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.920]   That's what I'm saying is what?
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.160]   We better get going in the barbecue.
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:53.800]   Aaron Jonas, our caterer, some people who did our opening
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.240]   party, they're great.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.120]   They're great.
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:57.200]   It's going to be delish.
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:01.480]   So you click on one of these dates, and then you apply.
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:02.440]   Well, that's neat.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:04.080]   I wish I'd known that.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.520]   Twit barbecues.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:06.040]   Twit barbecues.
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.520]   I just saw an email from Lisa.
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:08.520]   Thank you, Lisa.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:08.520]   Yay.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:10.000]   That's the barbecue.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.200]   We brought the site down, by the way, twitbarbecues.com.
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:13.160]   Oh, we did?
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:14.200]   Oh, darn it.
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:17.440]   Obviously not a Squarespace site.
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.400]   Well, how do you spell that?
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.400]   Maybe I spelled it wrong.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.400]   TWIT, B-A-R-B-E-Q-U-E-S.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:23.400]   Q-U-E-S?
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.600]   No, don't tell me that.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.600]   Well, that's--
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.600]   B-A-R-B-E-Q-U-E-S.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.800]   Yeah, there's lots of ways to spell barbecue.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:32.880]   Nobody spells barbecue like that.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.800]   It's like cut off-y.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:35.800]   What the hell?
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:36.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:40.880]   That's not either spell it with a C, or you just do B-B-Q, but
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:43.800]   there's no barbecue with a Q.
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:44.800]   There are many ways--
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.400]   I go to a barbecue place here in San Diego, and they have all
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:50.880]   the different spellings up on the wall, and there's 10 or 15
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:51.880]   of them.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:52.880]   That's actually correct.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:53.880]   Yeah.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:54.880]   Chatterum says it's correct.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:55.880]   Wow.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:56.880]   So the 13th and the 13th--
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:58.680]   Glad they didn't ask me.
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:58:59.960]   That's not how I would spell it.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.320]   Anyway, the only way I know how to spell barbecue is B-B-Q.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:03.320]   Yeah, B-B-Q.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:04.320]   That's what I-- that's my preferred spelling.
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:05.320]   I can't even spell that one.
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:06.320]   I can't even spell that one.
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:08.160]   Okay, you can just call it a bry, which I like.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.560]   I kind of like bry.
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:11.560]   Anyway, go.
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:12.680]   Why are we cute?
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:16.320]   Is that B-A-R-B-E-C-U-E-S?
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:17.320]   Isn't that how it spelled?
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.320]   I think that's one of the spellings.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:20.320]   Actually, that's one of the spellings.
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:21.320]   That's so funny.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:24.040]   I didn't know there were so many different ways to do it.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:25.040]   Is it-- what is it?
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.040]   A French word or something?
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:27.040]   It's--
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.040]   Bow back.
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.480]   Anyway, we're going to have a barbecue.
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:32.240]   We should have just said picnic and left it at that.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.240]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.240]   How do you spell picnic?
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:37.240]   So for more information, these are the two dates.
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:38.400]   Now I know.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.760]   So yes, it's a December barbecue.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:40.760]   Hey, this is California.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:43.440]   We could barbecue any time where you want.
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.560]   Maybe in the rain, but we're going to have a big tent.
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:47.080]   Where is it going to be?
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:49.320]   We actually got the police to block off the street.
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.320]   Awesome.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:52.600]   And on a very heavily trafficked street.
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:54.760]   No, we couldn't do the whole street.
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:56.040]   It's enough of the three street that we couldn't.
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.040]   We have to--
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:58.040]   Oh, OK.
[00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.840]   I'm sure the grocery store is thrilled.
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.400]   The grocery store across the street is broken.
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.560]   They have their own barbecue.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.440]   I know we should have just hired them.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.760]   Well, this is going to be very limited availability.
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:10.040]   So you really got to go there and request your tickets
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.240]   because we can't-- I mean, we can only
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.800]   have 50 or 60 people here.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.040]   Come.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.840]   Don't come.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:18.920]   We'll webcast it.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.720]   We'll webcast it.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.120]   We'll use smell-o-vision.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:21.640]   So you can--
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:25.000]   So Calgary Guru says, this is a common misspelling
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:25.720]   of barbecue.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:30.040]   What are you citing?
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.600]   Wikipedia?
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.440]   It's misspelled.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:38.400]   Anyway.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.640]   Never doubt Leo.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.720]   I know my spelling.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.960]   And one thing I'm good at is spelling.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.080]   It's one thing, the Apple bundle dictionary.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:47.480]   Wait a minute.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.520]   Now I got to do it.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.120]   What is the-- isn't there a keystroke?
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:54.360]   Is it command-- open command shift D or something like that
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.840]   for barbecue-- to spell check something?
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.760]   I think I just right click.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:04.200]   Apple bundled the Oxford English Dictionary.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.520]   So you right click?
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:10.600]   No, but look up in dictionary.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:10.800]   All right.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.800]   Let's see.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.000]   Let's see what the dictionary says.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.720]   Oh, it comes from a Wikipedia entry.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.920]   CUE.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.760]   Barbecue, common spelling variant.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.920]   OK.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.320]   OK.
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:24.080]   Bar-Q-U-E, that's not a misspelling.
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.760]   It's a variant.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.360]   That's what I say about my spelling all the time.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:30.520]   The origins of barbecue cooking in the word itself
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.320]   or somewhat obscure, etymologists believe barbecue
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:38.360]   derives from the word barabisu, found in both the languages
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.680]   of the Timokua of Florida and the Taino people
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.280]   of the Caribbean.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.520]   It's insensible.
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.040]   Yes.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.600]   And I love my jerk chicken.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.600]   And we're going to get jerk chicken.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:50.120]   And then, of course, in Spanish, I think it's barabacoa.
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.040]   It stands-- it translates as sacred fire pit.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.760]   See, now, twitsacredfirepit.com.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.360]   Could we have gotten that?
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.520]   That would have been better.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:00.320]   You can't now.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.080]   It's just taken.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.760]   Samuel Johnson spelled it with a C. I just
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:06.720]   want to point that out.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.040]   Wow.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:07.720]   This is great.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.880]   This is the apple-- that's good.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.280]   OK, let's look at the dictionary here.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.840]   Let's see what the dictionary-- no entries found for barbecue
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.320]   with a C. Let's try it with a Q rather than let's try it.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.040]   C-U-E. Yeah.
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.040]   So Apple says--
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:21.040]   Look at that.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:24.040]   --spell with a C. Look at this.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.160]   Barbecue is often misspelled as barbec.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.840]   Uh-huh.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:32.160]   Uh-huh.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.120]   It is not accepted in standard English.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.720]   There we go.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.200]   I rest my case.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.200]   Who wants to be standard?
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:43.960]   I'm trying-- we're--
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.920]   I read the Steve Jobs books of management.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.880]   You guys suck.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.280]   OK.
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.080]   Let's move on.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.480]   Anyway, whatever it is, we're going to have bozos.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:59.920]   We're going to have whatever that is at some point.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.480]   Did you see the apple patent for multi-touch?
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.360]   Patently, what is the-- is it Patently Apple?
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:10.120]   I thought they patented the--
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.120]   The scroll-- it's a swipe to unlock.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.720]   Swipe to unlock is one.
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:14.720]   Right.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.600]   And of course, that's a ridiculous patent
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.520]   because that predates Apple in a number of places.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.240]   It's ridiculous.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:19.960]   It's ridiculous.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:24.400]   But they also just got a fairly large patent for multi-touch
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.280]   based on the original iPhone.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.080]   And these are very-- these are much more significant than swipe.
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.840]   You might be able to sue on swipe.
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:34.160]   But Apple has now the patents.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.120]   They've got 14 new patents, by the way.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.400]   14 new patents.
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:44.000]   But they have the multi-touch patents, which is huge, huge.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.280]   Because there was some-- a lot of people said, oh, no,
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.240]   there's a lot of prior art on multi-touch.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.240]   You can't own multi-touch.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:56.800]   This is pretty much going to be a big issue,
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.400]   I think, in future lawsuits.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.040]   Now let's talk about the swipe.
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.920]   They also want swipe to unlock.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.440]   Which was thrown out in Europe.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.200]   Right.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.800]   Due to prior art.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:07.920]   OK.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.360]   Has there ever been a patent where you think, you know,
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.720]   good patent?
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.600]   It makes a lot of sense.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.600]   The light bulb, I believe.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.360]   It's been a while.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.840]   Any more thoughts on Apple and television?
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:28.280]   I thought Nick Bilton had an interesting article
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.400]   in the New York Times.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.480]   What's really next for Apple and television?
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.760]   Chris, we're all referring to this fact that in the biography,
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.760]   Jobs says, I finally cracked it.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.320]   Some people said it's Siri.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:44.760]   That's what Nick seems to think, that it's voice recognition.
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.880]   And if that's the case, the remote
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.400]   would have to be the microphone.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:53.080]   Because you'd be competing with the sound of the television,
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:53.520]   otherwise.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.640]   Yes.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.280]   So that may be it.
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.880]   You'd just talk into the remote.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.320]   Talk into the remote.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.280]   Talk to the remote.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.760]   And by the way, that could be probably an iPhone, right?
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:06.000]   Or an iPad, both of which have microphones.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:06.640]   I don't mind that.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.440]   Now, by the way, Microsoft's doing the same thing
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.440]   with Connect in Xbox TV.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.800]   But the Connect is across the room.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.320]   It's on the TV.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:18.320]   One of the thought about Apple and the TV, I've always--
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:21.880]   I think most of us think that Apple would have done a TV
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.760]   eventually and it makes a lot of sense.
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.760]   But I think the biggest reason it makes sense
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:28.560]   is that it's perfectly in line with their strategy
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:33.960]   since the late '90s, which has been to obsess over content.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:36.520]   So their higher end machines have been optimized
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.680]   for the creation of content.
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.760]   And their mobile devices and other devices
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.920]   have been optimized for the consumption of content.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.360]   And this is the secret sauce of Apple
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.080]   that people don't seem to understand.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:51.680]   If you compare Apple, the iPad versus other tablets,
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:56.440]   you can see that Apple's whole business
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.320]   is to make tons of money on content.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:03.160]   This is, by the way, the Amazon model, so much so
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.640]   that they actually lose money on the device.
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:09.120]   But what Apple does is they look around the world
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.720]   and they see where are millions and millions of people
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:15.400]   struggling with clunky, ugly interfaces
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.240]   for consuming content.
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:18.880]   And that's why they did the iPhone.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:22.360]   That's why they did the iPad and so on.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.280]   They started with the iPod.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:28.520]   And television is the last great clunky interface
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.200]   for consuming content.
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.040]   Most people, most of us are struggling
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.600]   with these cable interfaces where we've
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:37.480]   got this incredibly complex remote controls given to us
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:40.840]   by the cable company with these weird menus
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.800]   where you have to-- what's on TV and you're scrolling through
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.440]   1,000 channels.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.560]   And it's just a horrible mess.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:51.160]   And I just would love to see Apple come out with the Home Run,
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:55.840]   which is essentially an iMac, a 41-inch iMac,
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.080]   that you put with your home theater system
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:01.040]   and you talk into the remote and say,
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.640]   play dancing with the stars.
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:05.840]   Well, I think that it's-- yeah, for me,
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:09.600]   the distinction between the two is Umi Zumi, which is--
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.480]   I go to Umi Zumi and my kids are obsessed with Umi Zumi.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:13.360]   What is it?
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.920]   And it's some little cartoon that drives me crazy.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:22.920]   So anyway, but the thing is that if I can't find it in Comcast,
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.000]   it's in Comcast.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:24.800]   It's there.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:29.120]   And so I have to go into shows and then I have to go into kids
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.160]   and then I have to go to Nickelodeon
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.800]   and then I have to go into preschool for Nickelodeon
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:35.320]   until I can finally dig my way in to figure out
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.000]   where the Umi Zumi is.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.800]   On Netflix, I just--
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.240]   Netflix for my Apple Zumi.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:44.560]   I just go search Umi Zumi and then I play it.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.600]   That's painful though.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:46.440]   That's a lot of work.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:46.840]   You got to go--
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.000]   Not on iPhone.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:48.640]   On iPhone.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:48.640]   I just--
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.840]   Oh, iPhone, it's quick.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.520]   And the thing is, and with Siri, to the point,
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.240]   is if I just said, just play me Umi Zumi,
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.040]   I go to which episode, and episode four, and then we're done.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:02.520]   Didn't Groover mention that Jack Donnicky thought of this
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:06.960]   on "30 Rock" that he should have the patent?
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.360]   I still have to see if I can find this.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.800]   Yeah, actually, if I play it, then we'll
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.920]   be pulled off YouTube, so forget it.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.800]   Look it up yourself.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:19.600]   And Connect does do this, but with middling success.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.040]   I think the opportunity for Apple is much bigger,
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:26.240]   because I think that 80% of the population only needs iOS.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.040]   I mean, I think that there's 20% of us
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:28.440]   that are geeks.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.040]   I can't just have an iOS experience,
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.000]   but I think 80% of the United States population
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:33.840]   could just have iOS.
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.520]   And if you had an iOS in your TV,
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:37.880]   and if they really need to type on it,
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.160]   you could get a Bluetooth keyboard.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:43.920]   And my kids and my parents would be totally done.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:44.680]   All right.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.640]   Plus, it's another gateway drug, like the iPod,
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:51.320]   where you use it for a year, and then it's
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.240]   time to buy a laptop, and you're thinking,
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.440]   you know, I really like that Apple TV.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.560]   Maybe I'll get a MacBook Air.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.280]   I just don't even think that what's
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:01.040]   going to happen is people are going to get it on their TV.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.080]   It's going to be totally integrated with the iPad on the iPhone.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.680]   And most of the population doesn't need any more than that,
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.840]   because they're not creating anything.
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.080]   They're not doing anything complicated.
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.680]   They're just surfing the web and getting their email,
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:17.200]   and it's an appliance for most people.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:22.080]   And in the case of the iPad, or the Air, or a PC, or whatever,
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:26.480]   it's a complicated experience that is constantly got bugs,
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:29.560]   rather than just when you click on it, it just does what it does.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:30.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:31.040]   All right.
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.400]   I'm going to play the video.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:34.480]   Why not?
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:37.520]   AOL has its-- there's many chat room there.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.520]   There's like a four-hour--
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:39.360]   Oh, my god.
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:41.360]   There's a four-hour Merck commercial in front of it,
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.320]   which I've been watching.
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:44.560]   God, I hate prerolls.
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.400]   Don't you hate prerolls?
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:45.760]   This is--
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:46.560]   But this is a really long--
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:48.760]   This is a minute-long preroll, I believe.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:49.260]   All right.
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:49.760]   Here we go.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:50.760]   We're all fired.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:51.120]   Here we go.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.280]   This is--
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:55.200]   Maybe.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:55.920]   Geez, Louise.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.600]   What is the one part of the television experience that's not
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.120]   perfect?
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.120]   To me, it's the remote control.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.440]   Too easy to lose, right?
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.360]   Yes.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.320]   I lose my remote all the time.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.240]   Gert, couch cushions.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.480]   What if you didn't need a remote control?
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:13.160]   Because your remote control was your own voice.
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.320]   Television on channel NBC.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.960]   Crew out of the Bronx called the Ace Duces.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.040]   Amazing.
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.280]   I give you voice activation.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.560]   Word for my CIs.
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.640]   You got off, but--
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:26.720]   That shouldn't happen.
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:27.720]   TV on.
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:29.920]   He's a voice activation who are the--
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:30.360]   Bo-act.
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.960]   The only route we have is some mute kid.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:33.920]   Unmute?
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.120]   My friends at the D.A.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:38.760]   These guys have a high volume of cocaine coming into the dark.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:39.760]   You'll be able to--
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.160]   First of all, go home.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.760]   Delete everything that's on my TV.
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:43.600]   Oh, come on.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.640]   Aren't you six episodes--
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.400]   TV mute.
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.360]   --on the top, shit.
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:50.400]   It doesn't seem to work.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:50.960]   There you go.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.200]   There's the problem right there.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:59.160]   OK.
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.440]   Let's get to our questions.
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.400]   And you voted them up.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:02.920]   Oh, I forgot.
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.040]   I'll get to the math thing before we do that.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:08.200]   So Apple, according-- well, a couple of things.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.080]   Gosh, there's somebody thinks to talk about.
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:15.520]   There's the rumor that Apple wants to do 3D maps,
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.200]   take on Google Maps with 3D mapping.
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:21.400]   They did acquire a company called C3 Technologies.
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.760]   That is a 3D mapping company from Sweden.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.120]   They bought them a couple of months ago.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:35.800]   It's now thought that the 3D maps will be part of a new Apple
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:36.440]   mapping map.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.720]   And they are amazing.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:38.520]   The C3 maps.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.600]   You want to see a little bit of these?
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.080]   This is--
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:41.040]   They are insane.
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:44.280]   They're calling it Google Maps on steroids here.
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:47.880]   This is from netbooknews.com.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:50.400]   Oh, no, another ad for Android.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:50.960]   I love that.
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:54.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.160]   Well played.
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:56.160]   Well played.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.480]   Well played.
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:59.280]   All right.
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:00.800]   Here we go.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.160]   I just want to see the picture.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:03.640]   Show me the picture.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:04.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:05.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:11.880]   Apple also bought PlaySpace, which is a Google Maps competitor.
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.080]   Remember that Apple's collecting traffic information.
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.120]   That was one of the revelations with that data
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.040]   at SNAFU earlier.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.000]   Also Poly9.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.960]   I think there's third mapping company acquisition.
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.000]   So they're clearly building something.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.240]   And you know, it makes sense.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.240]   Oh, look at that.
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:28.240]   Wow.
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.680]   One of the anecdotes in there, which
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.640]   confirms something you'd said all along, Alex, is that Steve
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.560]   goes ballistic when Adobe announces it's not
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.040]   going to release Premiere and says, we are never again
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:39.760]   for the Mac.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:43.240]   We are never again going to let a company determine our future.
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.240]   We will write our apps.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.880]   That's when they decided to write iLife.
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:49.680]   And I think that that was part of Steve's vision is end to end.
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:53.520]   And why rely on your hated enemy Google for your mapping app
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:54.960]   on the iPhone if you could do your own?
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.000]   So I'm sure that this is something that they want to do.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   And it looks insane.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.600]   This is, by the way, your defense dollars at work.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:02.120]   I think--
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:03.360]   Just as Siri was, by the way.
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:03.880]   Right.
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:04.480]   That's absolutely--
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.680]   And the internet and the GPS system.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:10.080]   But I think this is very much part of Steve Jobs's
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.560]   Thermonuclear War.
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:12.080]   Yes.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:12.580]   I think--
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:13.080]   I think if--
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:13.520]   On Android.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.880]   Google had never gone--
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.280]   come out with Android.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.920]   I don't think this would be happening.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.520]   Well, remember pre-Android?
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.120]   There was this kind of nice relationship.
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.640]   Schmidt was on the Apple board.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.280]   There were a number of Google apps on the iPhone.
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.320]   We're still waiting.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:30.080]   Parris Lemon, M.G. Seagler, says a native Gmail app
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.800]   is imminent on the iPhone.
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:33.440]   But of course, Apple has to approve it.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.720]   The interesting-- so this is a mapping app.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.880]   This isn't just aerial video.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.200]   Wow.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.600]   Yeah, that's what it looks like.
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.720]   That's spectacular.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.840]   I will say Google Earth and a lot of the three Google stuff
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.040]   looks really, really great, too.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.600]   I don't think it looks as good as this.
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.640]   This looks real, as opposed to a texture map
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:54.240]   on top of a 3D SketchUp image.
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:57.640]   I don't, in fact, know how they could be doing this.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:01.480]   And it's also worth pointing out that I'm 100% certain
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:07.160]   that we're headed toward a multi-touch desktop world
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:09.680]   where everything is like a giant iPad.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:13.560]   And this kind of application on a big, big, big desktop
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.440]   computer that you're using with multi-touch--
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.840]   Wouldn't that be sweet?
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:17.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.400]   In fact, if you look at the Pixel,
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.760]   what's the name of that company?
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.840]   Pixel, something or other.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:25.280]   They're the ones who do the multi-touch displays for CNN
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.600]   and so on.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.560]   Jeff Hahn and those guys, they always
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.520]   show mapping applications like this to demo
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:36.040]   because it's such a wonderful thing to manipulate an interface
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.080]   like this through touch.
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:38.440]   It's a natural, yeah.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.160]   Did you notice I had a stick mark in the front of the garage
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.840]   doing more of this.
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.040]   Touching your laptop?
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:45.560]   Yeah.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.120]   I'm thinking about something and then I go, touch it.
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:48.080]   Oh, I'm the wrong guy.
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:48.960]   Well, it's inevitable.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.920]   In fact, Steve did say that nobody wants to reach across
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.040]   and touch their laptop screen except that we all do now
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.400]   because we can condition to do so.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.240]   And I think that's an imminent aisle.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.880]   Certainly, Microsoft doing--
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:04.320]   I would say most laptops next year for Microsoft Windows,
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:08.400]   laptops will be doing touch of some sort, using Windows 8.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.440]   And nobody reads anymore until Apple came out with the iPad
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.040]   and suddenly people started reading.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.760]   And nobody wants to watch movies on a small device,
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:16.720]   et cetera, et cetera.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.680]   Et cetera.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.480]   I was unimpressed, underwhelmed by Newsstand.
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:23.480]   I have to say, on the iPhone, especially
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.360]   where there's a dearth of stuff in the stands.
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.760]   I felt like it was just like--
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:27.440]   It's a folder.
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.640]   It's just you're stuck with a folder.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:29.680]   Well, would I subscribe to something?
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:30.720]   Then I just ended up with a nap.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.080]   Right.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:32.720]   And I was like, I don't understand why.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:34.120]   It's basically a folder.
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.360]   Like I didn't-- I was like, I don't understand.
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.280]   I mean, I got the economist now.
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:37.880]   I'm very excited.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:39.240]   Well, it's working.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:42.080]   Conde Nast says that weekly digital subscription sales
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:47.360]   of its titles are 268% up since the Newsstand came out.
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:51.240]   268% from what?
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.840]   From zero.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:57.040]   When Akhandi is the New Yorker, it's Vanity Fair.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.000]   It's wired.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:58.960]   It's all the magazine.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:01.440]   Frankly, it's all the prestige magazines
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.560]   you see on Newsstand.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.920]   They dominate.
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.600]   You sit for the economist.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:08.240]   The economist?
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:08.880]   My favorite magazine.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.400]   And now, how does it work with the economist?
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.280]   Do you have a subscription?
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.280]   Yeah, it's a subscription.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.800]   It's a digital subscription.
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:16.360]   So you just get--
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:17.760]   And what's cool about the economist
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:20.400]   is all the articles, it'll read them to you.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.040]   And it's not a computer reading them to you.
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:27.280]   It is a oftentimes a very nice sounding woman
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.600]   reading them to you, which is--
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:30.000]   Does she call you Alex?
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:30.000]   Alex?
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.720]   Alex, did you know?
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:35.000]   I have to say that it's a very nice way
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.080]   to get the world news.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.760]   I tell you that when you look at Newsstand on the iPhone,
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:42.560]   there's New York Times, and it's downhill from there.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.640]   There's a BMX magazine.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.200]   Good house TV.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.680]   Not a lot of content on the iPhone.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:47.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.320]   The iPad is much better.
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.040]   Better experience, though, too, I think,
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.520]   for consuming that content.
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:54.200]   Yeah, all right.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.560]   I'll give you that.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.400]   Anyway, they're doing all right with it.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.960]   It is, by the way, I should point out, it is the store.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:04.040]   When you tap on the Newsstand button and go to store,
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.440]   it's the app store.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.240]   So in fact, if you do us-- this is one of the things
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:10.000]   Sarah and I were talking on iPad today.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.560]   A wonderful show, by the way, we do at 1.30 PM,
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:17.280]   1.30 PM, 4.30 Eastern every Thursday on Twitch,
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.600]   that the store you're being pulled to is actually the app store.
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.560]   It's just the Newsstand section of the app store.
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:24.120]   And if you do a search, you can't just search for magazines.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.400]   It'll search for everything, not just magazines.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.800]   There's no way to search for magazines in the Newsstand
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.880]   search, which is really stupid.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.160]   It'd be great if it worked more like iBooks, I think,
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.720]   where it kind of flips around.
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:36.840]   I can't remember if that now jumps to the actual store.
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:38.720]   Do you download anything on iBooks?
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.360]   I did the Jobs Biographies, the only thing I did.
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.720]   I'd be too.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:43.880]   You know, I bought the physical book and then bought that.
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.320]   I got excited about the iBooks, but I can never find any
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:49.680]   of the books that I want, so I end up just buying one Kindle.
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:50.840]   They're better than they were.
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.160]   I think that you should look again.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.640]   They've added titles.
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:55.640]   It's a nice experience.
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:59.640]   The iBooks experience is very nice even on the iPhone,
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:01.200]   but really on the iPad, it's spectacular.
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:01.920]   But it's very legible.
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.560]   It's very easy to read.
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.480]   The page turn is very-- what is it?
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.560]   Skewmorphic.
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.160]   Yes.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.760]   But let me see.
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:12.280]   You asked an interesting question.
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:16.120]   If I go to the store on this, does it
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:17.920]   pull me to a special store?
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:21.520]   And yes, that's a bookstore only.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:25.520]   See, because I know because the browse has a pair of glasses.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:26.320]   So it's--
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.480]   Yeah, so I don't know why it's not the same way as to do that.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:28.840]   Why does it now?
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.040]   Almost with the newsstand, it seems
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.240]   like they should stick with that sort of work
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.760]   thing where I can swipe through, almost
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:36.240]   like I'm looking at a physical newsstand.
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:39.840]   You know, just change it to kind of a steel New York newsstand-y
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.520]   kind of interface and let me browse through the available
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.160]   magazines and publications.
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:45.240]   It feels like an afterthought.
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:49.160]   It feels like it's a special folder and that's it.
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:49.960]   Well, yeah.
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.960]   I mean, it's home screen placement, right?
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:54.520]   This is what people used to pay for windows.
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:55.720]   It ain't on my home screen.
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:56.440]   I moved up.
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:57.800]   All the way to the end.
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:58.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:01.160]   But that's why we're frustrated by it as ekes, right?
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.040]   You can't delete it.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:03.120]   It's the same mentality.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:03.960]   Yeah, you can't delete it.
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:04.600]   You can't remove it.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.280]   So you buy a PC and you'd have this stuff on the desktop,
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:10.280]   right, that you couldn't get rid of that was sort of pre-installed.
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:12.120]   And these were all deals where they made money, right?
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:16.520]   But it sold software whether you wanted or not or sold services.
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:19.720]   You know, that's why AOL wanted their icon on the on the desktop,
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:19.960]   right?
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.720]   Same thing here with the magazines, I think.
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:22.360]   And that's what we're seeing.
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.480]   It works from a consumer perspective,
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:26.680]   but you know, geeks and nerds and tech people.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:27.560]   And we don't want it.
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.840]   You know, I want my old folder back.
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.960]   Macworld is not going to be called Macworld anymore.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:36.040]   Sorry, January 26, 2012.
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:42.160]   Macworld Expo will now be called Macworld iWorld, the ultimate iFAN event.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.600]   I...
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.080]   Barf.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:49.360]   But I think that it's probably because, well, I don't know.
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.920]   Is it trademark issues?
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:57.120]   I think the majority of people who use Apple products don't use Macs.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.160]   Did I buy them?
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.680]   One thing if you walked into Macworld.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:03.000]   It's all really as much more iWorld than it is Macworld.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.280]   I mean, it's that there's a couple booths that are still Mac,
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.280]   but there's mostly just iPods and iPad.
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.720]   Interesting.
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:12.920]   Well, and I think they're doing the thing that we all thought they probably should do
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:18.280]   when Apple pulled out and make it more about the community
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:21.720]   and the people in the community and what's going on with that.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.640]   So they're expanding, they're kind of changing the sessions
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:26.680]   and making it more about, you know, music and movies.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:29.800]   I know they're doing a sort of movie thing there.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:33.880]   And I think they're expanding it to reflect sort of what's going on in the community,
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.560]   which, you know, it could go either way.
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:39.080]   It could be a hugely successful thing or anything they're experimenting.
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:43.320]   But it's probably the right thing to do because it puts the focus back on the user
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:44.840]   and the community.
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:49.320]   We have questions at our Pixelcore feedback loop site.
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.400]   We're going to get to those just a second.
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:54.360]   Mike Elgin is here from Elgin.com.
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:00.200]   From MacCast, Adam Christensen, the premier Macintosh podcast.
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:03.080]   And Alex Lindsey from Pixelcore.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.080]   And we will get to your questions in just a moment.
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:07.720]   As soon as I tell you all about audible.com,
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:11.480]   where is Andy when we need him?
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:14.360]   Actually, there's no question what the audible book recommendation is today.
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:16.040]   Actually, I don't even need Andy for this one.
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.840]   If you go to audible.com/macbreak, you can get a book free.
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.920]   Right now, you'll be signing up for the gold account.
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:21.880]   That's a book a month.
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:24.600]   These are, you know, you know, Devorak was giving me a hard time.
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:26.920]   I said, I'm reading the jobs biography.
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:28.920]   And he said, you're not reading it.
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:29.720]   You're listening to it.
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:31.400]   I said, well, every word is in there.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.440]   I'm reading it.
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.400]   Oh, you're not reading it.
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.120]   You're listening to it.
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:35.400]   Well, I am listening to it.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.520]   And it's a great book.
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:39.400]   Great book, 25 hours.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:43.080]   And it's, you know, I've gotten a farther ahead in this book than anybody I know
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.160]   because I listen in the car.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.160]   I listen at the gym.
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.360]   I listen in bed at night.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:51.240]   I listen all the time because that's the beauty of audible books.
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:54.120]   You would listen on your iPhone, iPod, iPad.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:55.880]   It's a great way to fill up stupid time.
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:00.040]   You know, like, it's no longer, it makes stupid time, smart time.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.840]   Chatroom saying also that I'm not reading it.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:03.800]   I'm listening to it.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:07.320]   You know, I got, I disagree with that.
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.640]   The opinion that listening isn't reading.
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:14.680]   I mean, literature has been stories, spoken stories since the beginning of time.
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:19.000]   And books are pretty recent, you know, the universal availability of books
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.360]   is a pretty recent phenomenon.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:24.040]   I mean, it's all about the stories and the content
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:27.480]   and the information is not ink and wood pulp.
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.880]   Mike, Mikey flies got the right angle on this.
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:30.840]   He says, well, that's fine.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:32.120]   It's better than reading.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:34.120]   It's audible ink.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.720]   I think the text is a fad.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:37.480]   It's a fast texting.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:41.800]   It's like sitting around the fire with Walter Isaacson as he tells you about Steve.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:46.280]   It was only here until we had the proper technology to put it back in its place,
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:48.040]   which is the fireplace.
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:52.120]   Steve Jobs, the book is out now on audible.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.280]   You can get it absolutely free.

[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.760]   We've been talking about it now.
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:09.400]   You can listen to it.
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.120]   There are other great books.
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:12.920]   In fact, other great Steve Jobs books, lots of business books,
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:16.440]   but there's also thrillers, classics, mysteries.
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.680]   It's just fantastic.
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:20.200]   75,000 plus titles.
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.160]   Audible.
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:23.480]   Dot com/macbreak.
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:24.520]   Give it a try today.
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:24.840]   All right.
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:31.000]   Our Pixelcore feedback server is fired up and so are our fans.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.040]   And by the way, this top question was also when I said,
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:36.840]   what should we be thinking about when I twitted it out yesterday?
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:40.040]   This was the biggest story as far as everybody ever was.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.640]   So what you're saying is we buried the lead.
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:44.920]   We buried the lead, which is the demise of the Mac Pro.
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:45.480]   Will it possible?
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:46.520]   I don't believe it.
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:48.760]   So the rumors are that the Mac Pro,
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.360]   here's the rumor.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:53.560]   The rumor is not so much that the Mac Pro is gone,
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.600]   but there is discussions going on at Apple
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.280]   about whether they should put out another release.
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:01.560]   And I will say that I believe that--
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.320]   and this one, by the way, is from Peter James.
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:04.440]   Thank you for putting that question in.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:09.240]   I think that we were probably looking at the last Mac.
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.320]   If we get another Mac Pro, we're looking at one more.
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.160]   And I really think Apple should do the right thing,
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:17.160]   which is to put out one more Mac Pro, upgraded processors
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:18.680]   with a Thunderbolt connection.
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:20.760]   So that the rest of us can go for another two or three years
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.120]   until they figure out whatever they're going to do.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:26.120]   Really, just one more.
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:30.120]   And then I think that they need to open source OS X.
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.160]   If they're going to move away from it,
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:33.400]   they should just-- that would be the ultimate kick in the teeth
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.360]   to the NPC industries.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:37.560]   That we will take your tablet industry,
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.720]   and then we will let everybody use OS X.
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:41.080]   Wow, that's it.
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.600]   Now, you've been pushing for that for a long time,
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:45.160]   but that's a very interesting strategy.
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:47.640]   It would be the crush of--
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:50.120]   because you're basically an open source to OS X.
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:53.960]   Now, I think we won't see this until X code is running on iOS.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.680]   So if you got to a point where X code was running on iOS,
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:01.560]   and Apple didn't need OS X, I think the next step would be to open--
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:04.520]   This is the first time I've actually given any credence
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.760]   to this thing you've been pushing for a long time now.
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:07.400]   Years now.
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:07.960]   Years now.
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:10.680]   But this-- actually, this point, it makes business sense.
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.680]   When you've made your transition to iOS,
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:15.080]   and that's as it almost is now, you're--
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:17.880]   it's certainly a majority of Apple revenue, isn't it?
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:18.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.440]   It's close to it, if it's not.
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:23.560]   You still need the trucks, but why do you need to sell the trucks?
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:24.600]   Now, I think--
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:26.520]   The one thing I'd credit on this rumor is they probably
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:28.440]   don't need to redesign the pro.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:28.920]   No, no, no, no.
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:30.120]   They just need to upgrade the process.
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:32.680]   They can do that all easily with the existing--
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:34.120]   Simply put it and put a Thunderbolt in.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:34.600]   That's the only thing--
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:35.080]   Thunderbolt.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.680]   The only thing that they need to do is--
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:37.480]   That would be fine.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.760]   The pro is a perfect computer.
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.360]   You don't need to do anything more to it.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:41.960]   And here's the thing, as a pro user--
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:42.440]   We're trying to him.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:43.560]   And if someone is attached--
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:47.400]   Well, the thing is, I want Apple to open source OS10.
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:47.560]   Right.
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:50.440]   I do not want Apple to run OS10 because they suck at it.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:50.840]   Right.
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.280]   So the thing is, is that they--
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.920]   We as a pro user, we never get what we need.
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:57.400]   We never get the graphics processors we need.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:58.440]   Everything is dumbed down.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:00.200]   So Apple focus on that.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.880]   And then basically-- otherwise--
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:03.720]   It doesn't say they're going to kill the iMac, though.
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:05.320]   I mean, they still sell laptops.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.920]   They still sell iMacs.
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:09.400]   I think that all of that's going to be iOS.
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.920]   So the thing is, is that-- but I think that--
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:11.720]   No.
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:14.520]   I think that's the long-term development process of Apple.
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:16.040]   I don't think-- I don't think Apple's interested in this.
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:16.760]   But if they're not--
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:17.640]   That's interesting.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.440]   There's a transition.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.560]   I don't think it's going to happen immediately.
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:20.480]   But I think over a couple of years,
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.800]   but I think Apple should open source it at some point
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.120]   because then we--
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.520]   We need to rename this show to iBreak Weekly.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:27.640]   It was show up.
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.160]   Not yet.
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:29.880]   So I cast.
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:33.240]   Well, this came up when we were at the MCE
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:35.600]   when I was up there in Petaluma earlier in the month.
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:40.080]   And I think Ms. Jason Snell, who kind of defended this
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:41.960]   because I thought, oh, this is crazy.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:44.800]   Apple's not going to stop making pro machines.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:47.440]   But the key seems to be, in that conversation,
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.840]   we thought the Thunderbolt connector.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.040]   I think Alex is right.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:53.080]   With Thunderbolt, you can have this breakout box.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:56.360]   You can have this thing that can be added to an iMac
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.160]   or MacBook Pro.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:00.600]   And suddenly, you get advantages of portability.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:02.040]   Plus, when you're back at the desktop,
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.480]   you have the power of these big powerful graphics cards.
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.720]   You can do expansion off there.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:07.880]   You can pull more drives in there.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:08.920]   You can put raids in there.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:11.080]   I mean, the possibilities become infinite.
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:13.960]   So, I mean, one theory is that the Mac Pro goes away,
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:17.160]   but it's kind of replaced by this more modular kind of system.
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.000]   Well, at this point--
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.200]   --using the foundations.
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.200]   What is the difference in an iMac and a Mac Pro?
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:22.920]   It's purely expandability, right?
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:23.480]   No.
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:25.040]   The Mac Pros are still performing high.
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.360]   Our Mac Pros are still performing.
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.680]   They're considerably better.
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:30.920]   But there's any reason you couldn't put those same processors
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:31.880]   in an iMac?
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:32.920]   I don't think so.
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.200]   The only reason they don't do it right now
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.320]   is they're artificially making this distinction between pro
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.240]   and consumer products.
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.440]   But I think that the issue is, I think,
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:42.520]   if Apple put out one more Mac Pro, a lot of us
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:44.720]   keep our Mac Pros around for a while, because they are expandable,
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:47.600]   because we can switch things out.
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.800]   If they put out one more with a Thunderbolt connection
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:52.800]   and the faster processors--
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:53.600]   And just leave it at that.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.040]   Well, no, no.
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:56.440]   By then, I could see you having an iMac that
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.640]   had the same power that we needed and so on and so forth,
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.400]   two years from now.
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.720]   But it doesn't exist right now.
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:03.080]   We're barely seeing any Thunderbolt pieces.
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.360]   And as I said, for those of you in the chat room,
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:08.920]   I'm not saying that Apple sucks at doing OS 10 in general.
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:11.240]   I'm saying from a pro user's perspective,
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:13.040]   the iOS solution--
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.600]   I'm sure the OS 10 solution is horrible.
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.920]   It's better than the other options.
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:24.880]   But it is an open source version of this possibly managed
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:30.800]   or something would be far better for a pro user than a--
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:32.320]   So I'm only speaking from the pro user.
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.080]   The next big jump in Intel processors
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:34.880]   is Ivy Bridge.
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:37.080]   That's spring of next year.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:38.080]   That's it.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.160]   Go ahead.
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.280]   Sorry, I'm the processor side.
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:41.480]   I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:44.880]   But on this side, a really good question came up today.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:48.000]   I was talking to John Martellaro at Mac Observer.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.120]   And the question was open CL.
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:53.600]   There was all this promise behind open CL
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:56.600]   and leveraging the GPUs that are in these systems
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.480]   to beef up the processor.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:00.840]   And when you look at some of the numbers that were run back,
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.720]   then, I mean, it's amazing what they could do.
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.160]   I think they were achieving things like he said,
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:10.600]   a teraflop, where 800 gigaflops are coming off of the GPU.
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:13.240]   So I don't know what's been happening on that side of--
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:14.240]   Oh, one of the things--
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.480]   And that could go a long way to changing
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:18.360]   the landscape of the pro Mac.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:23.400]   From what I understand, one of the big problems
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:28.080]   is that because open GL is so used in the actual interface,
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:30.320]   in actual OS 10, the issue that you get into
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:33.040]   is that Apple wants to write all the drivers for it.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.520]   NVIDIA tends to want all its own drives.
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:38.760]   I know, but I'm saying that the problem is that the support
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:43.360]   for all of those things are intertwined.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.840]   It's called something different for NVIDIA.
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:50.080]   But the point is that all of those things are intertwined.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:51.640]   And so Apple wants to own it.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:55.520]   The NVIDIA wants to own it.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.080]   I don't know about ATI.
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:01.440]   The issue is that the graphics manufacturers
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:03.360]   to write their drivers.
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.600]   That's what they do for the quadrocards.
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.480]   And that's how you're going to get the most performance
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:09.200]   out of those cards.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:11.720]   And when I say pro user, I'm really speaking to pro.
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:15.520]   High-end users, the guys that really need big machines,
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:17.040]   3D and heavy duties.
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:20.040]   Because I don't even know if you need a high-end machine
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:23.160]   anymore to just do editing.
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:24.560]   I mean, I'm not.
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:27.280]   We use IMACs for most of our editing.
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:28.520]   It's just fine.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.320]   But I think that for the really high-end,
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:32.720]   the place where I think these machines make a difference,
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:35.560]   I think we really-- we would love to get something a little bit
[01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:36.920]   more open.
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:39.320]   Well, so that's what you're saying on the software side.
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.960]   This is why you'd like to see it opened up,
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:42.720]   because that seems to be where maybe the bottlenecks--
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:43.520]   They're going to let this go.
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:44.960]   If they're going to let it go, and if they're
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:47.800]   going to stop developing these, let it go so Alienware can put
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:49.280]   OS 10 on their machines.
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.720]   I still think that this is just against the culture.
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:52.760]   I don't know.
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:54.560]   I think it's against the culture right now,
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.120]   but I think that once Apple doesn't need it--
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:56.600]   Could change.
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:58.480]   That's just dropping a little match into the--
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:30:59.000]   Could change.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.240]   They make a lot of people happy.
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:00.740]   Yeah.
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:01.400]   You get to the other side.
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.200]   And they're, OK, now we're just going to light the rest
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:03.880]   of this on fire.
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:07.200]   Yeah, there's a business advantage, I think you could say.
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:08.480]   And it's the kind of out-of-the-box thing
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:10.760]   that Apple is famous for.
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.760]   But they're not notorious for loving open anything.
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.760]   Well, after they don't need it.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.000]   Yeah, give it away.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.480]   Yeah.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:21.520]   Interesting.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:22.480]   We'll just have to wait and see.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:23.440]   Was there another--
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:24.120]   So the next--
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:25.040]   Do we have a consensus?
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.320]   Are they going to drop the Mac Pro?
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:27.520]   No, we don't have a consensus.
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:28.040]   We don't know.
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.480]   We're making our case that they need to do one more.
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:34.080]   I think they-- I mean, at the very minimal,
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:36.680]   I think they can drop it down to maybe one system.
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:37.760]   Are they at one system?
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.680]   No, I can't remember how many configurations.
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:40.320]   Almost one.
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:41.360]   They're basically one with--
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.080]   I think Alex is right.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.560]   Maybe one more revision.
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:46.800]   And then I think they rethink sort of how these things go
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.320]   together.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:48.960]   Think about what they did with Final Cut.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:51.640]   Think about what they did with Final Cut.
[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:53.200]   Isn't that what they did with Final Cut?
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:56.800]   But they eliminated the high end user
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:58.320]   while they moved towards the mid range.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:01.600]   I think they definitely-- they refocused Final Cut
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:04.600]   towards the mass of the people who
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:07.800]   are using-- who need to do editing in the next five years,
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:11.400]   which is folks that are a little less--
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.520]   just less trained to do this stuff,
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:15.320]   but have great creative ideas and so on and so forth.
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:15.840]   One thing--
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:17.840]   I'm using-- I use a little bit of everything.
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:20.800]   I'm using a little bit of Avid, Premiere, Final Cut 7,
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.080]   and Final Cut 10.
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.320]   On the things that Final Cut 10 run on, it is just--
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:25.320]   Wow.
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:26.000]   So one thing--
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.880]   One thing Apple did learn from the cube, which
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:31.560]   is that the pros don't care about design in the least.
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:33.880]   The cube was just aimed at a pro who
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:36.680]   wasn't going to pay extra for that fancy design.
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.320]   And the pro is fine.
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:39.080]   It does the job.
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:40.400]   It's a tower case.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.240]   I wish it was Rack-N-O-M-M-L.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:43.240]   They killed the Rack-M-O.
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:43.840]   They killed the extra.
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:44.840]   Which is the same size.
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:46.240]   I think they're moving the direction.
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:47.320]   I don't think they'll kill the pro.
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:49.560]   I just don't think they'll bother to update the design.
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:51.720]   They'll continue to put new motherboards in it, new cores
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:53.360]   in it when the Ivy Bridge comes out.
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:54.440]   They'll be Ivy Bridge.
[01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:57.000]   That's by the way, when they'll put many--
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.120]   whatever it is, the port in there.
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:01.400]   Thunderbolt.
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.320]   And then they'll keep that for a few years.
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:05.320]   I mean, there's a market-- if they can still sell it.
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:07.000]   The only question is how many they're selling
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.760]   and whether that's an important part of the market, right?
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.760]   Well, I think that there's more than that.
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:14.160]   I think that the support of the pro market is--
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:16.440]   one of the issues is I think that Apple sits on--
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:18.080]   if they choose to continue to develop it--
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:20.840]   sits on a perfectly vertical market,
[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:22.880]   which is that everything when it comes to content,
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:26.440]   everything from the creation to the final viewing--
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:27.920]   They're a consumer company now.
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:29.480]   But it all sits on it.
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:33.680]   They have a vertical market that they built
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:36.280]   between producers and consumers that
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:38.040]   makes Croupp's arms look like a walk in the pie.
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.440]   I agree.
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.760]   And that's the business.
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:42.240]   But I think that they need to keep that business.
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:44.080]   I don't think that they should give that away.
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.240]   I don't think they have to.
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:48.000]   And the pro is where it all starts.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.760]   It's at the very beginning of the developer's point.
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:52.720]   Any other questions?
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:54.840]   The next one-- they all fall off after the second one,
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.320]   which is where is iTunes match?
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:57.320]   Well, that's obvious.
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:33:57.800]   Yes.
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:58.800]   That's the other big question.
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.320]   It was supposed to come out of October.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:03.880]   I believe, if I'm correct, it's the beginning of November.
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:04.560]   Today.
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:05.000]   Today.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.080]   It's officially late.
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.200]   What happened?
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.640]   I want it.
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:10.480]   What happened?
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:12.240]   This is the deal where you pay $25,
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.160]   and they upgrade all of your stolen music
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:17.560]   to high quality DRM-free AACs.
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:19.320]   They put it in the iCloud, but you can download it, right?
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:23.440]   I mean, you don't have to always have an iCloud.
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:25.640]   They let you sign up, but you can't use it.
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:26.960]   You can sign up now?
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:30.160]   I think you've been able to sign up for a little bit now.
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.680]   But you don't get anything.
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:32.960]   Do nighting.
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:34.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:38.400]   One of the things that I wonder about with all of this business
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:43.240]   is Siri, as we know, sometimes tells you, I'm sorry.
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:44.400]   I can't do that, Dave.
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:46.120]   I can't reach the server.
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:47.240]   Can't keep up.
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:50.440]   And so there's a capacity issue with their servers.
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:54.240]   Now, Apple has in recent years been radically expanding
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:56.800]   their data center capabilities.
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:59.040]   But I wonder if this is another data center issue.
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.560]   They're just not ready.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:03.240]   I think it's more likely it's some kind of legal wrangling
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:07.000]   issue with trying to keep the record companies in--
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.760]   Where do I sign up for that?
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:10.320]   Not in iCloud, I see.
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:14.960]   I think on iOS, you can turn it on now.
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:15.600]   My biggest fear--
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:17.360]   They may have turned it back off.
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:18.360]   I don't know.
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:20.240]   They're flip flopping on it.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.240]   I don't think there's--
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:22.800]   It can't be contractual at this point.
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.040]   It must be a technical issue.
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:25.960]   It's gots to be.
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:26.520]   I hope not.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.480]   I hope that the reality distortion field
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:31.920]   didn't go away that quickly.
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.400]   Yeah, I don't see any music match.
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:36.000]   I see iCloud back up.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.920]   Maybe I'm totally mistaken.
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:38.640]   I apologize.
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:42.520]   [SIGHS]
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:44.120]   Siri, where is--
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:46.720]   [LAUGHS]
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:47.680]   Gotta be quick.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:48.360]   Sorry.
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:50.040]   I don't understand.
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:51.200]   Siri, where is--
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:53.360]   Well, I didn't finish it, nitwit.
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.040]   Siri, where is iTunes match?
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:36:00.520]   Searching the web for Siri, where is iTunes match?
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:02.520]   Yeah, so am I, Siri.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:03.640]   I shouldn't say Siri, right?
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:04.560]   I don't know why.
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.400]   Do you do that to Mike?
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:06.120]   I always say Siri.
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:07.520]   I shouldn't say Siri.
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:10.600]   I sometimes thank Siri.
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:11.720]   Thank you, Siri.
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:12.560]   Yeah, thank you, Siri.
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:14.080]   And then you get a nice--
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:16.400]   you're welcome type.
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:18.200]   All right, Siri doesn't know either.
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:23.720]   Siri, check the data server down the hall.
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:24.560]   Yeah, never mind.
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:26.440]   All right, we're going to do our picks of the week.
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:27.760]   And then we're going to get out of here.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:28.840]   Twit photos coming up.
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:29.920]   Catherine Hall is the week off.
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:32.440]   But the great Derek story is already in position,
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:36.920]   ready to begin talking about photography in just a little bit.
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:39.360]   So excited.
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:40.960]   Let's start with you, Adam Christensen.
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:44.640]   Your pick-- oh, do we want to do the iOS tips and the Lion tips?
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:45.880]   Do you have a tip?
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:46.600]   I have a tip.
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.080]   All right.
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:47.480]   I have a tip.
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.680]   And he's not here, so we could--
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:50.640]   so the tip of the week--
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:52.080]   And dispense with his lion tip.
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:55.080]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:58.600]   I put it in the notes, and then I summarily forgot about it.
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.880]   So my tip of the week is--
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:02.560]   this has to do with tabs.
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:03.920]   And this was actually--
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:05.840]   In Safari iOS.
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.120]   Yes, in Safari iOS.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:08.440]   I know what your tip is going to be.
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:09.400]   I like this tip.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:12.480]   I put it in the rundown, actually.
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:13.360]   And I think--
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:16.280]   You can get recently closed tabs.
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.480]   Recently closed tabs.
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:22.680]   And so what you can do here is if you hold down the plus--
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:25.280]   so if you go to your Safari and hold down the plus,
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:27.120]   you will see the things that you close.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:28.640]   So if you closed it too quickly and you
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:31.200]   want to go back to what you had been tabbing,
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:34.720]   it is a great way to find that last thing.
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:36.920]   And I want to thank the person who--
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:37.920]   I can't do it on my Twitter feed.
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:39.160]   I don't think I can do it on an iPhone.
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:40.160]   I don't have to do it on the iPhone.
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:41.520]   You need only iOS.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:43.960]   Here, give me your iOS so I can show people.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:46.560]   So here's-- this is on the iPad.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:49.120]   So when you have tabs-- you only have one tab open,
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:51.200]   but there's always this extra show and other tab.
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:53.320]   If you click and hold the plus, there's the tabs
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.440]   he's closed recently.
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:55.000]   And one is--
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.240]   That is a nice feature.
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:58.240]   And one of the things with the iOS features--
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:37:59.440]   there's so many people using this.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.880]   I've been kind of crowdsourcing these.
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.880]   And so I put it up on-- the day before,
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:04.400]   I put it up on my Twitter feed, like, hey,
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.000]   what's the hot iOS tip?
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.400]   And people started submitting some of them.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.320]   And this was from Mike Johansson in--
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:10.320]   Mike.
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:13.320]   Skeleftia, Sweden.
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:13.960]   Wow.
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:15.200]   So thank you very much for that.
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:16.600]   And I'm going to keep on doing it.
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.480]   I'm learning a lot about iOS because there's
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:19.920]   a lot of good ones that I haven't said yet.
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:23.640]   But people were sending in great ideas better than I
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:24.480]   could think of myself.
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:27.000]   Neat.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:27.480]   Let's see.
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:32.080]   I was thinking if I had a lion tip lying around,
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:35.320]   but I don't.
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:39.000]   So let's go to our pick of the week, starting with Mr. Adam.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.480]   MacCast Christensen.
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:44.120]   And yeah, sorry, just a clarinet to match thing.
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:46.240]   You can turn it on is the thing.
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:47.760]   So you go into the music app and the--
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:49.040]   Oh, it's in the music app.
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:49.520]   Oh, OK.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:51.120]   It's in the music app settings.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:52.480]   You go into settings, music.
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:54.440]   And I believe the toggle switch is on the top for everybody.
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:54.800]   Thank you.
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:56.240]   But then it just says coming soon.
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:57.040]   Right.
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:58.360]   Hey, but at least it's on now.
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.400]   That's too anything with it.
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:00.400]   That's what matters.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:02.000]   It's on.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.280]   So my pick actually is somewhat related to me reading
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:08.880]   the Steve Jobs book because there's a ton of great just
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:10.760]   quotes and information in there.
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:12.240]   And I've had this app for a while.
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:13.520]   I hadn't really leveraged it.
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:15.160]   Do you remember Matthew Bischoff?
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:15.520]   Yes.
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:18.360]   One of the first team podcasters.
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.840]   He's a guy who told me about podcasting.
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:22.360]   He is now writing apps.
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.560]   And he has an app called QuoteBook
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:28.200]   that lets you grab a bin store quotes.
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:29.360]   And you can tag them.
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:30.360]   You can put ratings on them.
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:34.400]   You can share them on SMS and Facebook and Twitter.
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:35.840]   Has full search in there.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:40.880]   You can add the credit where the quote quote came from source.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:42.800]   And it has a cool thing where when
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:44.600]   you're doing copy and paste on the iOS device,
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:47.040]   it'll recognize you have a quote on the clipboard
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:48.880]   and automatically turn that into a quote.
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:52.440]   So when you're moving back and forth using the switching,
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:53.600]   it works really great.
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:55.440]   About my only complaint about it right now
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:58.720]   is the only way to get quotes between devices
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.280]   is you have to do an import export thing.
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:02.600]   But they even make that easy because you can email
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:05.560]   a comma separated value or text file
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:08.800]   between devices and transform that way.
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:10.480]   But I'm hoping there'll be Dropbox
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:12.360]   or some sort of integration in the future.
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:13.080]   Don't really know.
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:16.360]   But it's a great little app for keeping track of all your quotes.
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:19.000]   And I always want stuff for like when I have to do a presentation
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.520]   or something like that, something to throw in.
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:23.440]   And this is a great place to just store them right
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:25.120]   on your iOS device.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:27.000]   So I'm finding it incredibly useful now
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.760]   that I'm reading the Steve Jobs book.
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:30.360]   Very good.
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:31.720]   Quotebookapp.com.
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:32.720]   Quotebook.
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:34.680]   That's so nice to see that Matthew's doing so well.
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:35.800]   He's in college now, I think.
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:39.280]   Is he at-- I saw some pictures, but I can't remember where he is.
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:41.800]   But somewhere nice.
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:44.000]   Do you have a pick, Mr. Alex Lindsay?
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.600]   I've got a couple related ones.
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:45.800]   OK.
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:48.840]   So my first pick is--
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:51.040]   we use a lot of Cinema 4D from Maxon.
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:52.520]   It's maxon.net.
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:55.120]   And they have a new version that they released a couple weeks
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:59.680]   ago called R13 of Cinema 4D.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:01.440]   And if you're thinking about 3D, if you're
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:04.520]   thinking about getting into it, to do high-end kind of work,
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:08.080]   this is probably the easiest, fastest way to get going on.
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:10.560]   And what they've added is really good--
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:12.360]   this is kind of more inside baseball,
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:13.800]   but really good motion blur.
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:15.440]   And what's called a physical camera,
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:18.440]   which allows you to get some really great imagery out of it.
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:22.240]   And I just love the new pieces, some physics.
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:23.120]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:25.000]   So the thing is, is that even if you're not sure
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.080]   if you're ever going to get into 3D, they have a 30-day demo,
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.720]   just download it and play with it.
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:30.560]   It's just a lot of fun to play with 3D.
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:35.960]   And this is probably the easiest one of all the big five
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:40.040]   or so 3D apps to actually do something with.
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:41.960]   Now, if you don't want to spend that kind of money
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:44.320]   or you're not ready to pull the big download,
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:46.480]   I've got something for your iPad called Forger.
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:47.120]   Forger.
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:48.160]   Forger.
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:50.680]   This is F-O-R-G-E-R.
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:54.360]   And a lot of us have heard of stuff like ZBrush
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:56.600]   and so we kind of like this.
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:59.840]   Yeah, this looks like Kai's Power Goo kind of.
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:00.280]   Yeah, so--
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:01.480]   Wait a minute, you've got to show it over here.
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:04.080]   So, hey, you want to do it or shall I?
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:05.080]   You can just--
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:06.400]   I'll get my head out of the way.
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:07.680]   Can you see it?
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:10.040]   OK, so I was just playing with this.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:13.560]   So I can take two fingers and I can rotate around.
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:14.560]   Let me just move it over.
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:15.160]   There we go.
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:17.120]   So I can rotate around here.
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:19.360]   Of course, I can zoom in and out.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.160]   But what is that?
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:22.080]   OK, so what I can do is I can actually--
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:23.080]   I'm just sculpting.
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:25.680]   Now, it's very hard to do this under the camera
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:27.040]   while I'm stretched across.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.240]   But the bottom line is, is there's
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.400]   a whole bunch of little tools.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:33.840]   And if you go down here, there's different kinds of tools
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:35.080]   here that you can use.
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:36.480]   And this is really written by someone
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:37.640]   who does a lot of this stuff.
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:41.320]   So there's just a lot of really great things
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:42.280]   that you can get in here.
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:43.440]   So let's see what this one does.
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:45.480]   This one kind of inflates.
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:48.280]   So you can do lots of little sculpting.
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:50.720]   And I think if I hold this down and go like this,
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:52.560]   I can make the brush bigger.
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:53.920]   I've just started to learn how to use it.
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:57.920]   But it is so much fun to sit there sculpting away.
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:59.000]   And I made a big mess.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000]   But there's a lot of better things.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.280]   And you don't have to start with a sphere.
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:04.440]   Can you save those models?
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:05.120]   You can save them.
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:06.040]   You can export them.
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:08.760]   There's import-- you can import files and work on them there.
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:11.360]   And I believe there's an export--
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:12.800]   there's a way to get them out here.
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:14.880]   But I haven't tried to do that yet.
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:15.720]   And there's a little tutorial.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:17.480]   That's very guessier what you just did there.
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:19.360]   I like it.
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:20.520]   So it's--
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:22.080]   Anyway, it's $2.99.
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:22.680]   That is named.
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:23.760]   That's a $2.99.
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:26.560]   Yeah, it's just called Forger.
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:27.440]   It's easy to--
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:28.920]   F-R-G-E-R.
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:29.400]   Yeah.
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:31.120]   That is for three bucks.
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:31.480]   Yeah, pretty cool.
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:32.320]   Wow.
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:33.160]   That is really cool.
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.360]   And then here's the thing is that you should just get it
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:38.960]   just to see how much you can do in 3D on an iPad.
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:41.200]   I mean, it just really cracks into.
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:42.960]   It performs really, really well.
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:43.400]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:44.320]   I want to buy that.
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:44.800]   Yeah.
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.440]   That's by the way, something I love on Android.
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:47.800]   I wish they would have on iOS.
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:49.840]   On Android, you can go on the web to--
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:50.680]   you can stall from the web.
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:51.920]   You go on the web to the marketplace, say,
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:54.840]   I want this app, press it, and it will send it to your phone.
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:56.800]   And your phone just next time you pick it up is installed.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:57.320]   Now, I have--
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:58.600]   See, I would love that right now.
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:00.840]   I would like to put Forger on my iPad.
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:02.320]   And I would just like to do it right here.
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:02.600]   I don't know.
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:04.080]   I've been buying stuff now with iCloud,
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:06.320]   and it just shows up on all the little places.
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:07.280]   And so I've been--
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:08.040]   That's a good point.
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:08.680]   It does show up.
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:09.560]   It just pops up.
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:10.600]   But I still have to do it on iOS.
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:11.040]   You have to do it on my laptop.
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.400]   I want to do it on my laptop.
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:13.800]   I think you can do it on your laptop.
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:14.360]   Could I?
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:15.800]   I think you just have to turn on iOS.
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:19.600]   Kneko gave me a lion tip that is probably what we call on the iPad
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:20.720]   today show a "da" tip.
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:21.960]   You guys all know this already.
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:23.360]   But it's been driving me crazy.
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:28.040]   When you're looking at your purchased apps in the app store,
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:29.440]   there's always stuff that you wish you--
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:31.600]   you just don't want to show up like Snow Leopard's Xcode.
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:32.440]   I don't need that anywhere.
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:33.360]   I'm on lion.
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:34.040]   I didn't know this.
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:35.680]   But when you hover over to see that Xbox,
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:38.040]   boom, you're never going to see that again.
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:38.640]   Don't.
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:39.840]   Just be careful when you do that.
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:40.560]   Well, I don't know.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:41.800]   There may be a way to get that back.
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:44.440]   There are programs that I bought or installed at one time
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:47.120]   that I just don't want to see in here anymore.
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:48.880]   And that's how you get rid of them.
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:51.640]   When you hover it over the thing, there's a little X.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:53.040]   Did you guys know that?
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:53.960]   You did not know that.
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:54.800]   See, I didn't know that.
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:57.280]   And I-- it's been driving me crazy because I have this long list.
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:58.120]   And you can't sort it.
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:00.920]   You can't-- you know, this list is a pain in the doohickey
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:02.400]   because you just-- this is it, right?
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:03.800]   All the things I've ever bought.
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:05.320]   And that's just only going to get longer.
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:07.640]   What's it going to look like at three years?
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:10.120]   Oh, it'll be open source, but then it won't matter.
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:12.760]   Do you might-- do you have a pick, a topic, anything you'd
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:14.520]   like to share with all of us?
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:15.120]   Sure do.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.960]   I have an awesome pick.
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:19.320]   It's called the Aloe Clip.
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:23.400]   So if you go to bitemyapple.co, you'll
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:28.320]   see the $68 lens for your iPhone 4S or iPhone 4.
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:29.840]   Oh, I want to do this.
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:30.440]   Yeah.
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:31.800]   And what this does is it gives you
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:34.400]   a fisheye, a wide-angle, and a macro lens
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:39.720]   in a tiny little clip-on lens device that fits in your pocket.
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:41.160]   Oh, I do want this.
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:42.760]   Yeah, this was a kickstarter.
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:43.880]   Be-- how do you spell it?
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:44.360]   I can't find it.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:45.360]   B-I-T-E.
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:48.800]   M-Y-Apple.co.
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.680]   B-I-T-O, not the Apple.
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:52.200]   That's C-O.
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:52.700]   Yeah.
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:53.200]   All right.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:53.760]   And here we go.
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:56.560]   Now, it gives you a 10X multiplier for the macro lens,
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:58.280]   which is awesome.
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:01.320]   And also gives you a fisheye lens and a wide-angle lens.
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:04.320]   Do you have any images on your Google+ account
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:07.000]   that we could see using that?
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.240]   I don't.
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:12.400]   I posted a thing about this, but I haven't seen the images on it.
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:14.280]   And I personally haven't bought one yet,
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:15.680]   but I could have shown you a real--
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:18.160]   I'm going to order it right now.
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:22.440]   And I guess their website has some images you can see.
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:23.600]   Can they sell the glyph?
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:25.440]   Or did they make the glyph?
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:27.480]   Are they a reseller?
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:27.920]   I have--
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:30.000]   This was a kickstarter project.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.360]   And they say that they're going to have a due shipment coming
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:34.120]   in a few days.
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:36.920]   So it sounds like it's really happening.
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:39.480]   Are they the same guys that made the glyph?
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:40.160]   I don't know.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:40.640]   Because the glyph--
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.320]   Maybe they sell the glyph because you need the glyph
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:44.440]   if you want to do a macro shot, probably.
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:45.320]   You want a tripod.
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:48.320]   The glyph is a tripod that goes into a clip.
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:48.880]   Yeah.
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:49.400]   Yeah.
[01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:50.880]   Ah, that's pretty good for them.
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:51.400]   It's awesome.
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:53.160]   I'm ordering it right now.
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:54.160]   The glyph is kind of--
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:54.920]   And I'm ordering it.
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:57.520]   Now, do you-- what is it a magnet or is it glued on?
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:00.840]   It's a-- I think it's like a clip-- it clips on.
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:01.320]   It clips on.
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:01.920]   As far as I can tell.
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:02.520]   That's how it should be.
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.120]   That's why it's over the corner, I think.
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:04.960]   Slides over the corner.
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:09.320]   It's a-- everything breaks cases, though, doesn't it?
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:09.720]   It's too bad.
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:11.840]   Ah, very good.
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:13.920]   That's a nice pick.
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:16.640]   Mike Elgin is mostly on Google, but Google Plus.
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:18.360]   But the best thing to do is just go to Elgin,
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:20.400]   e-l-g-a-n.com.
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:23.320]   And you'll find his Google Plus account.
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:24.520]   And follow it there.
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:26.360]   Subscribe to his newsletter, too, because that's
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:28.920]   an aggregate of all his Google Plus postings.
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:30.000]   Please circle me.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.720]   Circle me, he says.
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:33.600]   It's the new thing.
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.920]   All the kids are doing it.
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:37.040]   That's good to have you, Mike.
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:37.840]   Always a pleasure.
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:38.440]   Good to be here.
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:39.360]   Thanks for having me.
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:40.680]   Yes.
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:46.200]   MacCast is still the longest running Mac podcast out there.
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:47.240]   Mac-- yep.
[01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:48.520]   Coming up on seven years.
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:49.680]   Unbelievable.
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:50.520]   A record.
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:51.640]   It's amazing.
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:53.560]   M-A-C-C-A-S-T.com.
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:56.200]   This is the guy who hosted Adam Christensen.
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:56.720]   You can file--
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:57.600]   Yeah, I also need--
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:58.200]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:47:59.640]   I also need to give a plug, because I
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:02.120]   always forget for my iOS podcast that I do.
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:03.920]   It's called We Have Communicators.
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:05.960]   Oh, I don't see You Have Communicators.com.
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:07.200]   I didn't know that.
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:09.360]   I like that name.
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:10.840]   There are a few people do, because I always
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:11.520]   forget to mention it.
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:13.240]   It's whimsical.
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:14.160]   It's whimsical.
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:15.160]   We have--
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:17.640]   Well, it used to be the iPhone Ali podcast,
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:19.120]   but that got sold.
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:20.520]   And we got a new name.
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:23.120]   And I came up with We Have Communicators.
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:23.720]   So--
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:26.480]   We have communicators.com.
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:27.880]   You've done 141 episodes.
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:29.920]   My God, man.
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:30.440]   Yeah.
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:32.200]   We need a site designer, though, I think.
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:36.160]   Well, I think there's a lot to be said for just like content.
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:37.160]   Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:39.200]   You could have a different image every show.
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:41.560]   But other than that, I think you're set.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:43.200]   Hey, Adam, so good to have you.
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:44.080]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:45.560]   Good to see you again.
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:48.200]   Alex Lindsay is at pixelcore.com,
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:51.240]   pixelcore.com/live for their live broadcast on Thursday.
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:52.560]   What are you be talking about?
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:53.520]   Brent By is coming in.
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:53.880]   Yay.
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:55.200]   Sharing some Brent goodness.
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:56.920]   Brent's the guy who does all the lighting and cameras
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:57.600]   here in the studio.
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:58.640]   He's just amazing.
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:48:59.800]   He is an expert on lighting.
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:01.760]   He's a gaffer's gaffer.
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:03.240]   He's awesome.
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:04.720]   It's just so much fun.
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:06.120]   We have so much fun having him on the show.
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:08.120]   So we're going to be doing that at 6 PM.
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:09.720]   And again, you can ask questions.
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:10.400]   You can watch.
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:11.880]   You can have a great time.
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:13.720]   We do it every week.
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:17.440]   This one is dealing with mostly video production.
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:19.000]   Sometimes we do effects.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:19.560]   Photography.
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:23.480]   So it's Thursdays at 6 PM Pacific Standard Time.
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:25.720]   And if you want to know more about pixelcore, the great
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:28.480]   guild of multimedia artists who learn and work together,
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:31.280]   pixelcore.com is the website, the core.tv for their
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:32.280]   podcasts.
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:34.520]   And I'm threatening to do a tweet up.
[01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:36.640]   Oh, in Vegas.
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:37.400]   Next week.
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:38.440]   You're going to be in Vegas next week?
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:38.800]   All night.
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:39.800]   So am I.
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:41.080]   Are you both in Vegas this week?
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:42.120]   I am speaking to--
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:43.840]   is it Webmaster World?
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:45.640]   Yeah, I'm speaking on Tuesday in Vegas.
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:47.000]   I'm going to be there until Friday.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:47.960]   I'm going to be done.
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:48.800]   What are you doing there?
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:51.560]   I'm doing a live stream from Wednesday to Friday.
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:53.080]   For Salesforce or Salesforce?
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:57.080]   So anyway, so the--
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:49:57.720]   so yeah, we're there.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:59.320]   I'm there all week, so we'll have to--
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:02.280]   maybe we should just do a big tweet up.
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:04.160]   That's so exciting.
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:08.480]   Well, and if you're going to be at--
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:13.160]   I guess they call it PubCon, make sure you come.
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:14.560]   I'll be speaking November--
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:17.000]   Tuesday, I think, is November 9th, I believe.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.680]   One week from today.
[01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:20.200]   Is that right?
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:22.760]   So who's going to host Mac Break Weekly next week?
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:23.520]   I think Andy's on.
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:25.320]   Oh, Bonnie.
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:27.040]   I'll try and figure that out.
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:29.240]   We have that conversation going some day.
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:31.320]   November 8th will both be out of town.
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:33.080]   We could just do it in Vegas.
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:34.440]   We should just do it in Vegas.
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:35.440]   We were both there.
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:36.440]   You know what?
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:37.440]   That is a possibility.
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:38.440]   Let's talk about it.
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:39.440]   I could probably peel out.
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:41.680]   I'm flying back right after the talk, so I don't know.
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:43.440]   And I'll have to look at what my flights are.
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:44.440]   OK.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.440]   Oh, that's exciting.
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:51.920]   Yeah, PubCon Las Vegas, I will be giving a talk on what marketing means to me, because
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:53.320]   I'm kind of the anti-marketer.
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:55.120]   So it's a big marketing event.
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:56.120]   Right.
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:51:00.600]   I'm just going to talk about building community without advertising in any way, shape, or form.
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:02.000]   That's not good for you.
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.000]   Shit.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.840]   If I remember correctly, there were three advertisers on this show alone.
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:09.000]   No, no, I mean not advertising on the show.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000]   You're doing your own advertising.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.520]   I don't advertise on shows, right?
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:13.480]   I don't have billboards on the strip or anything.
[01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:14.480]   Right.
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:15.480]   Oh, that's not a bad idea.
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:17.040]   Can I make a good plug?
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:21.720]   And Ms. Eileen Rivera, the star of all about Android, I don't know what you could possibly
[01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:23.880]   plug on a Mac show.
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:24.880]   I know, right?
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:29.120]   Well, I would like to plug our twit.tv/bestofsite.
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:31.120]   Oh, that's important.
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:38.960]   So you can actually tell me your favorite Mac break weekly story moment of this year.
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:41.920]   Yeah, we're going to do our best to have again for the holidays as we did last year
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:45.600]   and the year before where we take the best moments from the year and put them together
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:48.440]   as a show so we don't have to be here on Christmas week.
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:50.000]   Sounds like a plan?
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000]   Yep.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000]   So it's twit.tv/bestof.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.000]   Yes.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.320]   And then we have a very special forum.
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:58.120]   There's a forum and then there's a drop down here for all of our shows.
[01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:01.720]   I don't think all of our shows are going to have best ofs but Colin went ahead and added
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:02.720]   it to the show.
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:03.720]   You know what?
[01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:04.720]   I don't think it's fine.
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:06.360]   We want to know if there was anything good in any of these shows that would be useful.
[01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:08.160]   So here's Mac break weekly.
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:09.760]   Something you could tell us.
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:10.760]   Thank you.
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:11.760]   There was nothing happened.
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:16.720]   All right, I want to have one last vote before we end this show.
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:21.040]   When we convene next time, let's pretend it's next week.
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:23.520]   Will iTunes match be out yet?
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:24.520]   I say yes.
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:25.520]   Will it be out by next week?
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:26.520]   Adam Christensen?
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:28.160]   I'm going to go with yes.
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:29.600]   Boy, two yeses.
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:30.600]   Mike Elgin.
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:31.640]   I'm going to say no.
[01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:33.000]   I'm with you, Mike.
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.800]   No way.
[01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:35.800]   Split decision.
[01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:36.800]   Christmas 2012.
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:40.440]   After that, you have to say bye.
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:41.440]   Bye.
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:42.440]   I'm Leo LaPort.
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:43.440]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:44.440]   Get back to work.
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:45.440]   Break time is over.
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:46.440]   Bye.
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:46.440]   Bye.
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:49.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:53.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:55.740]   (upbeat music)
