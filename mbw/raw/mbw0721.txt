[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Renee, Andy and Laurie, your hill great show,
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.920]   Planfree. We're gonna talk about what hardware, if any, Apple will announce before the end of the
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.160]   year, whether Apple drop chargers in the iPhone 12 and how the best way they can do that.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.280]   And what the heck would a program named "Mm-hmm" be good for? It's "Mm-hmm-hmm." It's all coming up next.

[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.560]   my good friends. Talk about the latest news from Apple Lori Gilles here, managing editor at iMore.com.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:39.120]   Hi, Lori. Hi-oh. Good to see you. Andrew Ennaco also here from WGBH in Boston and
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:46.640]   Parts North. Andy, of course, the star of our show for how many years have you been doing this?
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.320]   Oh, enough years that I bet I could drive. You're the old timer.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.240]   Drive already. We're definitely the old timer. Lori,
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.960]   can I lower third now say senior contributing?
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.080]   Absolutely. Yes. And lieu of a rise in pay as corporate America is apt to do.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.400]   We'll give you a title instead of the money. How's that? Senior director of panelist Macintosh
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.640]   related services. Northeast, Northeast Division. So if we can't fit it in a lower third, it's good.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.720]   Yeah. There you go. Yeah. Also, Renee Richie from iMore, formerly of iMore now at youtube.com/Renee
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.080]   Richie, our second longest contributor, Alex Lindsay, who started this show is not here.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.280]   Again, on some secret project, no doubt. Oh, yeah, we don't know. I got a Georgia Dow haircut, Leo.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.880]   So it looks good. She finally took a patty on me. She finally took a patty on me.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:49.280]   Scissors. A katana. I believe she used a katana. Yeah, I'm fairly certain. Oh, God, I hope so.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.760]   She's always sober. That's the problem. It looks good. Very, very... I'm trying. I mean,
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.400]   it's less shelter and placey now, but it's what I could do with what I had.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.560]   So one concession I've made to quarantine is we allow our haircutter to come out and she does
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.320]   the whole family outside in the deck. We're all masked. Oh, outside is a great idea. Yeah.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.760]   Yeah. She did ours outside. Her salon is reopened, but I don't want to go inside and do anything.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.960]   I know. You're very right. Very wise. Yeah. So let's talk. Gosh, I have a feeling
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:32.640]   we're going to be a little short of news until the apple silicon comes out.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.880]   I don't know. I think we'll have a bunch of products over the summer. Do you think we're going to get
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.720]   some? Yeah. I think the apple might just drop things in our laps just randomly. We'll just suddenly
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.560]   have apple tags. We'll suddenly have the AirPods studio as we'll suddenly have a new Mac. I think
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.720]   I think we've got some things to come. Yeah, I think Lori's going to give you my big guess.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.480]   Yeah. I don't know if this is true or not, but because we're trying to figure out how they can
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.400]   do an Intel iMac while having apple silicon iMacs on the way. So if I was doing this, if I had my
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:12.240]   druthers, if I got to work in those secret labs, I would do the 27 inch Intel iMac and the 24 inch
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.800]   apple silicon iMac and then the 30 inch apple silicon iMac. And then there's no direct overlap.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.440]   That's how I would. That's how I would run the business. Can we get an iMac? You've seen the now
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.400]   the super wide curved monitors Lisa has one. It's almost embarrassingly big. I don't think they
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.480]   curve it. I think it'd be like the Protersplay XDR, but with an iMac bolted on the back.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:45.040]   I want the one reason I'm not happy about my iMac Pro and I love it is it has its own display
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.560]   and I really would like it. I really want a Mac mini so I can cook it up to that big curved
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.720]   display. I'm with you except I'm a cheapskate and I can't get like the curved monitor that I want
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.920]   is like way too expensive for me. And so I realized that actually I do really like this
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.840]   Dell like this very nice Dell color color attributed monitor that bought like three or four years ago
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.160]   and now that's three or four years old I can buy them like second hand on eBay dirt cheap.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.480]   So I just bought my actual as I speak the my second copy of the same monitor is like in my entrance
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.840]   way right now. And I'm also looking for a third one so I can have a one two three setup like on my
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.720]   regular writing desk. Yeah. So right now that's what I have is three monitors of two cinema
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.920]   displays in the iMac, but the bezels are wide and they get in the way. Yeah. I want one
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.320]   wide display. I don't maybe that's silly. How big are the widest ones? I can't remember
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.840]   what is Lisa's do you remember John? It's like 50 inches or something.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:54.480]   Yeah. 72 for some reason. That's 60. I don't know. That sounds. That would fall over. I don't know.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:03.120]   H and big ones at eight. HP announced one at I really wanted at CES this year that has
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.760]   I think three HDMI inputs. So you could have three different computers on the single monitor,
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:20.400]   which was pretty cool. I have a LG curved monitor. I think it's 48 inches. It's really nice. It has
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.120]   lots and lots of ports like you know you can go all over the place with it. What do you use that?
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.760]   Thunderbolt. I actually loaned it to a friend because it's too big for me. I don't it's it's
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:38.080]   actually I find myself like having to look too far to the left and right to use this space on it.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.240]   Maybe that's too wide. Yeah. Yeah. So I've I've loaned it to my friend.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:49.040]   There were a ton of them. Here's the Samsung we saw at CES. Do you get some idea of how big this is?
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:55.120]   I figured you'd be more like Osmandius in Watchmen and just have like a whole wall wall.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.440]   80 different monitors showing 80 different things. Love that wall. Yeah.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:06.560]   Yeah. Historically, my idea has always been like NORAD and war games. Just like every
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.880]   biggest the biggest wall. The biggest wall is just nothing but one huge screen followed by
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.560]   satellite screens. Each one no overlapping windows overlapping windows are absolutely anathema.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.320]   Everything is either tiled or in its own screen and that's I know that's that's totally different
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.240]   from like what we thought the future of computing was supposed to be where we're supposed to put
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:32.480]   a floppy disk in our wristwatch. But still it's it's the more that I this is where it seems like a
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:38.400]   lot of us are spending this time like in like self quarantine. Like because we because we can't
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.840]   get our entertainment by leaving the house. You I'm I and other people are focusing on
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.720]   systems that we have that I have inside the house that were set up years ago and maybe could use
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.360]   some improvement. And one of the things I'm doing is sort of redoing like my entire office.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.640]   And part of it is just realizing that you know what I actually do want multiple screens. I know.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.240]   And so even if it means like stealing screens away from another thing the way that I do my work
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:10.240]   now involves. And yeah as like and I can do with this one screen like overlapping windows and
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:15.200]   everything I want to do. But it's just so much more productive when I was experimenting with like
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.640]   old TVs that I had old flats panel TVs that will what if we have this screen is just for like
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.520]   news items and like research that I want to keep an eye on. This is for the thing that I'm actively
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:32.640]   working on. This is for and this is for like time and for notes right exactly like that.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.720]   And like there's something to this idea of having a dedicated box like a physical box with bezels
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.840]   with a frame around it saying that no no no no no no no no no this is you are not going to drag
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:49.440]   a Twitter window into this window that has the thing that you are writing because your your
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.720]   detention belongs here on the creative window. How it doesn't seem likely though that Apple's
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:03.920]   going to do an iMac with a giant screen. Right now they they kind of made their their intentions
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:11.520]   known when they when they said hey we're here's the new Mac display screen it's it's the LG like I
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.920]   know they made the XDR but I think I don't think that they're going to really spend a lot of time
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:23.200]   just doing displays. And I think the iMac and iMac Pro specific they are not going to have big long
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.160]   wide you know curved they're just going to stick with the standard because it's they're going to
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:35.040]   stay with what they got. Honestly I feel like if they're going to do any more Intel Macs they're
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.920]   going to keep the old design to distinguish them from whatever the new Apple Silicon Macs look like
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:45.840]   right. Yeah I mean unless there's significant manufacturing advantages to them just pushing
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.200]   out a new design with swappable silicon which I don't imagine there are because one of the
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.920]   benefit to the Apple Silicon is theoretically going to be much cooler operating temperatures
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.720]   which require very different thermal solutions. Right I don't think you know maybe a Mac Pro will
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.480]   have an adapter module you know because that's a brand new design but I don't think anything else
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.040]   will. But I'm the only I just can't get out of my mind now Andy sitting in front of that screen with
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.400]   a voice going good morning Andrew how about a nice thing with this. Isn't it's always when
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:22.240]   they when they want to show people with huge skills in technology like Ozymandias or like the hacker
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:28.560]   and Mr Mercedes they always have lots of monitors and big why is that is that how
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.840]   single asking is for Buster's Leo Hollywood regular humans Hollywood proves oh this guy must be
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.240]   pretty sophisticated he's got 300 to split watching Dukes a hazard and Beverly Hill delays at the
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:45.120]   same time he must be very smart though also even even goes far back as as the conversation
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.720]   that's right Gene Hackman's character where in the van he's an he's an audio engineer as
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:56.400]   opposed to a computer engineer but his lab inside of inside a physical cage no less
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:02.800]   is nothing but oscilloscopes and test materials and and real to real to real to real
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.520]   and that sort of thing that says ooh that is sexy with a capital C yeah
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:13.920]   is that a spell like Elon Musk's new shorts that's how sexy it is with a you spell it with a C
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:27.120]   merch we needed S E C X Y C E A U K S E Y okay see I got to get this down for the title
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:35.360]   it's a Romanian root origin Josie Sesky all right anyway we're fantasizing at this point because
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:42.160]   we have no idea what Apple's gonna do but so your prediction Renee is
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:49.280]   say it again yeah so I don't think the prediction is more like just what I want and that is because
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.840]   they supposedly have a new Intel Mac ready and that's awkward given that they said that Apple
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.720]   Silicon they said there are Intel that's in the pipeline yeah Intel Macs and we've heard that about
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.920]   a 10th generation NIMAC you know for a while now you know just being delayed for various reasons
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.520]   so if they still ship that I think the easiest thing to do and we've also heard rumors about a
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:13.360]   24 inch which is a different size right now they're 21.5 inches and 27 inches so if they
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.160]   ship a 27 inch iMac that folds into the current lineup right and then we get two different sizes
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.960]   24 being the new small one and probably some of that is bezel deletion like it has been on all
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:28.640]   their other devices and then a 30 inch or maybe 28 or 29 whatever they can fit in the bigger chassis
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.160]   coming later and then there there's no confusion it's not like we just swapped the
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.640]   CPU on one of these designs that looks identical they have their own distinct original model.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.880]   There was a geek bench leak as we you know we often rely on these because people use geek
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:46.160]   bench and forget that it also when you're uploading the benchmark results is uploading the specs
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:57.200]   an i9 based on the Intel i9 10910 a Radeon Pro 5300 so that would be the 10th generation
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:04.240]   processor that you're talking about in an Apple iMac the iMac Pro I have is a Xeon right I don't think
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:10.800]   it's it's yeah it's Xeon so with this not be a pro this would just be a high-end iMac probably
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.720]   right yeah and it's going to be interesting to see if Apple keeps that distinction because there
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:20.240]   was a knee absent the Mac Pro for low those many years there was a need for people who did want
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:26.640]   Xeon chips right and ECC memory and all the things that go with that but in an Apple silicon world
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:32.000]   so far they've only talked about SOC systems on chips which have the graphics built into them
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.280]   not discrete cards and that's let a lot of people start preemptively panicking that Apple you know
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.800]   it's the end of discrete GPUs and it might be you know Apple might be folding all of those into
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.960]   SOCs they might make their own GPUs they might still use AMD GPUs they might make accelerator
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:54.080]   cards like afterburner it's like a whole new and an exciting new world yeah we're gonna do
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:03.360]   menager yeah this is a 10 core 20 thread processor clocking at 3.6 to 4.7 gigahertz so it's it's as
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:10.080]   high end as you can get in the Intel Core series I think this is going to be that makes sense
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.720]   and if it's already in Geekbench it's going to be sometime the next few months you think they'd
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:20.080]   release it with Big Sur at the at the Big Sur release in the fall I feel like they're going to
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.000]   probably want to have that reserve for Apple silicon units and they want to sort of clean the deck
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.400]   of the Intel stuff as a semester than later next month or so I think so interesting they did it last
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.080]   year right wasn't it I don't have floor remembers for sure but I remember them doing max and July
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:42.800]   last year has Apple ever given them? I'm trying to remember the dates but it was definitely just
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:52.160]   July of last year it was a is an iMac refresh right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I've been wondering
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:57.680]   I can't remember if Apple has ever broken out numbers on how how many of its customers buy iMacs
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:03.120]   versus any other form factor because I'm wondering if the iMac isn't sort of ripe to get
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:10.320]   squeezed out a little bit given that it's it's it's a nice all-in-one but the people who I feel
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.720]   as though the people who want to spend more money have a greater budget for a computer are like
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:19.440]   well keep your display all buy a display that's appropriate for me not a display that's appropriate
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:26.160]   for you I didn't ask yeah did they say that astronomically people buy the Mac like by far they buy the
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:31.360]   Mac books and MacBook Pros of the desk of the desk of the desktops by far they buy the iMac
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:37.040]   and the Mac mini and the Mac Pro even though they were not updated so you know chicken or egg
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.840]   for many years are I don't know if they said single digit but her next ring-lose small percentage
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.040]   of their desktop business interesting so I guess so guess that means that it's they would be very
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:54.320]   very excited about getting Apple I still stumble when I say Apple Silicon fine I need a brand new
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:02.080]   whatever the the new mega zap CPU family in the iMac family because I feel as a Apple is a sort of
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:07.120]   company that won't do this timidly they'll say they'll go all in very very quickly and say that
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.080]   this is our those are best-selling most popular Mac and now we are so committed to this transition
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.200]   that we don't want our our favorite we don't want our big our biggest customers to have to wait for
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.480]   the latest generation speed improvements but then wouldn't that be the exact same reason they would
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:30.640]   also keep an Intel iMac because you know it's the their most popular iMac they want to make sure
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:36.000]   that everyone in the Mac family is happy so we got your Apple Silicon Macs for those who are ready
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.760]   to jump in and your Intel Macs for those who are not ready to jump in that's not the Apple that I know
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:48.720]   the Apple i know is hey congratulations you know that keyboard you really like on that
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.600]   laptop computer that you absolutely need we decided to throw away that keyboard and do something wacky
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:00.640]   you're welcome well i you know and i i was talking with somebody i think it was
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:06.480]   red kind of the chat room who said uh you know apple will probably support any Intel Macs for at least
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:13.040]   five years that seems reasonable and and that's what they did with the g5 or the g4 i guess in the
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:20.080]   transition Intel it lasted five years but i have to say i remember how antiquated the g4 seemed
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:26.080]   instantly like yeah maybe it's supported for five years but the minute the Intel Mac came out you
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.880]   didn't want it the minute the apple silicon comes out unless it's you know there's some
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:36.480]   showstoppers in which their mail may well be it may be very slow or i don't know you know there's
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:42.400]   all sorts of potential pitfalls you're probably not going to want an Intel Mac the minute a silicon
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:48.320]   apple silicon comes out the one thing you have to keep in mind Leo is that that there are hundreds
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.680]   and hundreds and thousands of people who don't even know what that means what an intel chip versus
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.320]   an apple silicon chip means they want an iMac and they don't they don't even understand the
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.120]   difference so you got to remember them too there's people out there who don't even know what that
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:08.160]   means yeah they want they care what it looks like they care that it runs fast they don't care about
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:14.800]   the you know the little things the guts on the inside yeah also a lot of the stuff people
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.680]   like corporate buyers they don't they can't just simply place an order on amazon or at the apple
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:24.960]   store they have to get approvals and the approvals take long to my time they have approvals for
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:31.920]   or carte blanc on buying any intel intel based mac but for this new arm based CPUs they're going
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:37.200]   to have to make their case gonna want to test it figure out yeah so and also like i think it was
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:43.600]   you who were saying this from the beginning that there's sorry you tagged a wrestling tag team of
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.160]   u and alix saying that the people who are at the super super high end where i'm editing 8k video
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:54.800]   i'm doing blender i'm doing all this high end stuff where i'm very very i'm very very confident in
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:00.560]   this high end multiples multiple CPU intel solution can do what i needed to do for the next two or
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:06.160]   three years i will look at your arm based macs in a couple of years time but for now i'm perfectly
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:11.600]   happy buying keep keeping my order in place for a brand new thirty thousand dollar mac bro if you're
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:18.960]   in the middle of the mediterranean editing below deck on an intel back in touch you're not going
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.840]   to take a chance you're going to make sure that you keep stick with the stick with the program you're
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:33.600]   not going to try apple silicon until the season is over anyway did you see Neil cybart's column i
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.240]   thought it was quite good i like and the only like above apple on his blog he says this is
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:45.600]   provocative yeah i'm glad you predicated it with smart guy rene because what he said is going to
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:52.240]   piss people off he said apple is pulling away from the competition for the second year in a row
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:58.240]   apple hill developers conference that should frighten its competitors apple is removing oxygen
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:04.240]   from every market it plays in now apple fans are going to love this but that anytime i say anything
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.640]   remotely similar to this we should like preface this by saying that you know is not precious about
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.960]   apple at all like he has said years ago that apple should just dump the mac and go all in on ios
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.320]   right to maximize revenue so he's not looking at this like someone like i'm sure he loves apple
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.760]   and stuff like that but he's looking at this as a sell side analyst to someone who wants to
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:27.520]   match like how can apple maximize you know stock he's got a very a very specific uh inform but very
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:32.320]   specific point of view well and to people who say to me oh this you're overplaying this silicon
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:38.240]   transition i say it's it's i think as important as the introduction of the iphone by which i mean
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:45.760]   it is a phase change it is going to be a sudden shift in what we in how we think of computing and
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:51.440]   that you know has the potential for being as big as the iphone i think well i i think it'll
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:57.920]   definitely be a shift in how we think of of max i'm not sure if it's a huge quantum leap in computing
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:03.440]   in general it's still here's your keyboard here's your mouse here's your screen here's your storage
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:10.080]   which is a powerful paradigm that has suited people's needs for the past 30 40 years right now
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:16.960]   but i don't think that's that's as that's as revolutionary as a touchscreen phone or like even
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:23.680]   the first trio that had uh built in internet access uh i i'm still sort of excited about
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:29.120]   companies that are really trying to push them push that needle and say well we have we have
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:35.840]   overwhelming evidence that people are that phones are doing the job that uh they would people would
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:40.720]   ordinarily have bought laptops or desktop computers for how can we make how can we stop thinking
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:46.480]   about this device uh less in terms of a have a phone that has computer features and more as a
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:51.920]   entirely new class of mobile device that is pocketable but can go well beyond the capabilities of
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:57.840]   something the size of a of a playing card here's my point is there used to be or there is right now
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:06.240]   a a definite uh schism between the mobile and the desktop device but apple is blurring that line by
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.720]   going apple silicon there now we're gonna continue on the there will be a continuum of devices and i
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:17.040]   think that maybe not maybe not but i think that's going to be a big shift neil writes here that apple
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:25.120]   has changed from a pull product stat strategy up to 2018 by which he means the iphone is pulling
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:33.120]   all the other products along to a push strategy where and only a company with the scale of apple
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:40.320]   could even attempt this where he's they're innovating across the entire product line although i mean
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.800]   it's not exactly that because the phil Shiller doctrine which goes back years like i don't know
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:50.240]   half a decade longer than that has always been like you the device below pushes so hard against
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.840]   the device above it that it wants to take on its features and that's always been something about
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.720]   apple that i think other companies miss is they're not they they've never mistaken their products for
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.640]   their businesses and a lot of companies have done that so they'd be they were fine with just
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.560]   cannibalizing the ipod with the iphone that was fine and they do that like the apple watch should
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.560]   gain so many features that people doubt whether it's worth it to get an iphone and the iphone should
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.800]   be so good that people may not think it's worth it to get an ipad and the ipad so good people think
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.520]   it may not be worth it to get a macbook and the macbook so good the iMac and on and then it's the job of
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:24.640]   all those products to get so much better that they push back down the stack and that sort of dual
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:29.520]   direction tension is what's supposed to make every product the best product it can be so this is
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:35.520]   niell's writing unfortunately for apple competitors the combination of a revised product strategy this
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:44.560]   new push strategy and a unique definition of innovation didn't just make for strong WWDC
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:51.280]   keynotes consumers are noticing and wanting when apple is selling apple for instance so the largest
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:57.440]   sales share increase in the smartphone industry last quarter taking it away from android apple
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:03.040]   added a 20 million new ipad users per year even though it's 10 years old and has a large installed
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:09.520]   base apple's oldest major product category the mac is adding 10 million new users a year apple
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:15.680]   watch an airpods 100 million user base each apple users are paying and this is important for apple
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:22.720]   for 518 million subscriptions across apple's platforms that's up 20 you know that's up 126
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:30.160]   million in just a year he also points out that the competition while apple is kind of firing on all
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:35.920]   whatever how many cylinders that is six cylinders all of them all of them apple's competition is
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:42.720]   starting to waver he says Samsung remains rudderless from a product vision perspective google prioritizes
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:52.800]   technology over design it's honestly google seems to be uh uh not focused if you ask me on what's going
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.280]   on and and he says the lack of attention given to the user experience quickly becomes apparent
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:04.000]   amazon's massive bet on voice with echo was the wrong one he says the stationary smart speaker
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.320]   space was a mirage they should have bet on wearables and by the way whose best positioned right now
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:16.400]   in wearables probably apple he says microsoft's running into growing trouble with the consumer
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:22.240]   when it comes to surface they just close all of their stores facebook ends up end up playing the
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:29.040]   wrong social bet instead of going after our closest social network facebook evolved to offer a curated
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:36.160]   version of the web via the news feed but he points out people prefer the privacy of apple a message
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.920]   sent through apple's messages is a message not sent through facebook property
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.240]   and always a similar to sennoski's thread right like there's there's a couple of
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.800]   managers apple has yeah that one is that they're unified behind their products and that's been one
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.800]   of google's biggest problems to date with that famous ricostola thing why isn't the battery
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.880]   better you know at the last minute because they have a vice president who wants a profitable product
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.360]   division they have a product runners who want to dog food things like not like notches which is
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.680]   very noble like notches and hole punches for their partners and they have a development team that
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.360]   just wants to make cheap developer prices but it ends up making a device that doesn't have a
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:15.440]   singular vision behind it and it seems hard for them to sort of have one person decide what that
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:20.640]   stuff is going to be and and microsoft is looking to the cloud and that's not always the best for
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:25.440]   the for the physical thing and apple they make a lot of mistakes they don't cover a lot of areas
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:30.640]   as some of us wish they would cover them but they tend to get when that arrow shoots everyone tends
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.880]   to grab the target and run as fast as they can to make sure it hits the target at the end
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:42.560]   you know see I've read the I've read this column it's very very well researched it makes great
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:49.040]   points I agree with most of it the the only place where I would if I had five minutes for
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:54.480]   rebuttal the only points I would be making is that apple is pulling away from the competition
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:01.600]   if you define the competition that they're all competing in if you're talking about selling
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:07.920]   hardware and creating consumer hardware products that people are absolutely relating to
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:15.280]   then absolutely the numbers speak for themselves but let's take a broader approach that what has
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:20.640]   I hate to I hate to sound like a like a like a not a tech hippie like this but I will say it
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:26.720]   what has apple done to change the world you saw and you talk about okay they have the apple watch
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:32.480]   which is doing amazing things with health absolutely shot shot clearly clearly on the board but when
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:39.280]   you talk about when you talk about things that are that the that the United States and the you
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:44.080]   and other governments saying you have way too much power and influence on society we have to look
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:49.520]   at maybe raining your powers back apple is never part of that conversation you talk about google
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:56.640]   created a search tool that revolutionized reinvented and made the web useful and practical for everybody
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:03.600]   and it's free they created a docs a google a an office suite that is not only so powerful but also
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:11.120]   so well tuned in to how people work together and individually in the 21st century that is making
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:18.400]   hardware irrelevant I can take a ten dollar scrap notebook off from the MIT flea market if I can
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:26.320]   put Linux on it and run a chrome run a chromium based browser on it it is arguably 60% as powerful
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:32.640]   as a $2,000 MacBook that's actually the threat to apple frankly right and even and I'm sorry
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:37.760]   I'd rather than spin up I'll I'll spin it down even when you talk about the the great evil facebook
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:44.400]   apple has not created a single tool that has brought people together as much as instagram and
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:50.400]   facebook has we hate facebook because we hate the company and we hate the for lowercase h hate
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:56.640]   the CEO of that company but the fact of the matter is if you want a service in which both your best
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:03.200]   friends to my best friends today my my best friends from 10 years ago my aunts my uncles my
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:08.480]   nieces my nephews there we can we can only get together in the same place on instagram and facebook
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:14.080]   we are not doing that with with the only place we can do that on an apple product is with messages
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:18.720]   fair point but I don't have an iphone I don't want one which means that I've being aced out
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.960]   and apple doesn't care about that so what I'm saying is that we're but there is but admit it
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:29.600]   there's pressure that means on you to move back into the apple ecosystem I don't feel any you know
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:36.000]   apple has to apple has to create apple has to create a compelling super super compelling product
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.840]   now they're they're getting there by with the power of the apple watch I mean I'm I'm watch
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:47.120]   I'm wearing my the only reason why I haven't a wear a west watch on my wrist right now was because
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:52.160]   I was able to buy one like a fire sale price a hundred bucks and for a hundred bucks yes I will
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:57.520]   buy a really really terrible state of the art department device oh no for as a hundred as a
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.400]   hundred dollar fitness watch it's okay it's it's adequate that's the only thing that's kind of pulling
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:08.480]   me back towards the iphone in terms of things that the iphone does that any other platform can't do
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:16.560]   I don't see it and I keep looking for it time again google privacy privacy about security
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:24.960]   security less than privacy but I will give you privacy it again it depends on the deal that you
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:30.960]   want to make with the devil sometimes the devil actually gives you pretty good terms google google
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.360]   gives you good terms facebook never does but the trend but the trend is against you in this case
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:42.800]   privacy and security are incredibly important for people you know it is it absolutely is but
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:48.240]   if you're talking about if you're talking about a phone that doesn't really if you're talking about
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:52.240]   that the trouble that it would take for me to switch from my android phone to an iphone
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:58.400]   I know enough about the security and privacy of android to know that it is not as good as what's
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:02.960]   available on the iphone but that doesn't mean it's bad it's very very good it's just that
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:10.160]   whereas apple makes that an a core competency and a core symbol of pride of the company google
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:17.360]   regards that as something that is important and and every way you're smart enough to realize that
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:22.720]   it's more secure but i don't think most people are well then why do they care about switching
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:27.040]   to an iphone instead of instead of an android so you don't realize that people don't think of
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:33.120]   android is secure that is absolutely the case i think that that's a message google needs to fix
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:39.440]   i think that's absolutely true the other thing is that app that as the saying one of my favorite
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:44.080]   lines from west wing i know that i know that rene is what's the what's the next 10 words
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:49.520]   my mine is the idea of i think i think north i think north korea found its car keys sir
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:56.640]   someone says oh from north korea isn't a threat they're north korea can't even find its car keys
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:01.040]   and then that's the the and the national security right i say check the map they just found their car
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:07.040]   keys and i think and so that so i'm sorry i'm just we have time and i'm excited i'm excited about
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.880]   that line but that but that's that's what i think about google's hardware that they are
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:16.400]   they need to find their car keys if they can't create a phone if they are in that sort of situation
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:21.360]   where we're rick austral the guy who is in charge of the hard but the consumer hardware division
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:26.560]   is saying a month and a half before the release of their flagship phone i'm disappointed that the
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:32.320]   battery life isn't better and this and that and the other instead of saying this a year ago when
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:38.240]   you know you can change some parts orders that's a problem any the pixel which is arguably the
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:45.200]   the most secure and red device sold 10 10 million last year it's not even in the ball park
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.520]   that's what that's what that's what i'm saying they and most people are not using high-end
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:54.880]   and right phones they're using the cheapest possible and right phones so the numbers the market share
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:33:01.440]   of and right admittedly is much bigger than that of apple but i don't know if that's a good thing
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:06.720]   those people are the ones most secure well no the way that the way that i impact that is that
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:13.360]   it's it's a it's a very very it's a very very relatable thing to say that uh google pixel phones
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:18.560]   are not selling merely as well as an iphone or a samsung phone uh because they're not they're not
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.000]   building them well they're they're not advertising them well enough they're not making the compelling
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.560]   and that's fine whatever reason but it doesn't doesn't dismiss apple is pulling away from the
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:32.240]   competition kneels in those areas in the areas that he it kneels all sorts of things apple doesn't do
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:36.800]   and they don't know they're not pulling away from all but also like they don't do a lot of like
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.840]   they don't do a lot of it management stuff you know there's a whole bunch slew of area
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:44.480]   no in fact servers they don't make routers they don't have one or if they're if that with the
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:49.600]   uh arm so see that they might not get back into the server trade go ahead and we froze him
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:56.000]   is you actually but what but but but what that says is that they're a whole category of really
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.800]   inexpensive devices that apple is starting to do its best to try to address but four hundred dollars
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:08.720]   as good as the iphone se is is not going to cut it there's a whole there are immense swaths of
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:14.800]   people in the entire world that are not going to ever be relevant to apples interests and so when
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:20.400]   we talk it's a headline is just a headline so that i'm not uh it is not the entire argument that
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:25.360]   that he's making here i'm just saying that if we're if we are using this podcast to talk about
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:30.560]   this we have to say that there are ways in which apple is absolutely pulling away from its competition
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:36.240]   its processor strategy is it is i've never i can't remember the last time i have been this excited
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:41.600]   about a processor strategy for god's sake but when you're talking about when you're talking about
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:46.720]   all the different all the different ways that i list here is great here are ways in which
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:51.120]   different tech companies are competing with each other more importantly and this is like when
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:56.080]   something like try to keep myself focused on what are they doing that is good for people as
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:01.840]   opposed to good for selling thousand dollar gadgets to people who can afford a thousand dollar gadget
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:06.320]   it becomes a broader question and in the topic of a much more interesting conversation to me
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:13.040]   andi i would argue that apple is probably leading the way in terms of like doing things that make
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:19.840]   real changes for people they it's just not it's not presented in such a big way and i think
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:26.480]   accessibility is an example of that apple is number one in accessibility features and they make it
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:33.680]   one of their top tier things that they do and they make revolutionary changes that actually impact
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:39.840]   and affect people in that have accessibility needs but that also trickles down to those of us who
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:44.480]   don't have accessibility needs that we get to continue to use these cool new features so
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:52.720]   no apple didn't make google you know that like that was an impact that was worldwide and it still
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:36:00.480]   is impacting the way the world exists today but they're smaller significant changes many small
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:06.240]   significant changes instead of one big change that i think makes apple you know part of that sort of
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:12.160]   pulling up pulling away from its competition idea is it's it's chipping away at its competition
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:18.640]   allowing it to pull away from it i i'm not i don't designate myself as in any way qualified to talk
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:23.600]   about how well any other company outside of apple is doing on accessibility thank goodness we have
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:28.560]   people who are focusing on those areas that understand the issues who have the contacts and
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.280]   really talk about that when i but i would say that it's
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:39.440]   um i recognized a lot of new accessibility features in the new ios that i've seen elsewhere i don't
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:48.800]   think i i i have i at this point off the top of my head i have problems i have difficulty in
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:57.040]   conceding that apples commitment to accessibility is greater than others because i've talked to
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:03.680]   people in the accessibility teams of i'm sorry primarily google and apple and i don't see any
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:10.240]   lesser commitment from the google teams as on the apple teams but if you talk to people who are
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:16.080]   members of the accessibility community one thing that i hear more often than not is people have
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:23.760]   actually switched over from android to apple because of the the progress and the technological
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:30.480]   technological advancements that have come along with using an iphone and ipad a mac things like
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:36.400]   voiceover and voice control i think are really big big moves forward and something that apple
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:44.160]   is doing for our future for accessibility so i do think that well i there's no doubt in my mind
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:52.000]   that other tech companies aren't trying to um take care of accessibility needs i think that apple
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.120]   has succeeded at a lot a lot of those things that are that are needed and required and and the way
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:07.440]   they make it and like top tier priority it's not it's it's not that they go here's this cool thing
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:12.240]   that we've just came up with oh yeah let's put the accessibility button on it they go here's this
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.400]   really cool thing that we came up with but we're not going to do anything at all until we make
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:23.920]   sure that it's that it's accessible so being able to kind of like think in terms of like the importance
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:31.600]   of taking care of the needs of everyone i think helps make apple products kind of stand out in a
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:37.200]   crowd in that way i absolutely agree with your observation that most people who are experts in
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:44.080]   accessibility note that iphones are not just more popular that that's a glib term but people people
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:47.440]   who need accessibility features are using them because they feel as though it suits their needs
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:53.120]   better that's absolutely true i would disagree with the idea that apple is unique and building an
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:58.720]   accessibility from the ground up again i've been talking to teams at google another tech companies
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:04.480]   like that where some of them came to came to came to the the light side of heaven versus hell a
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:09.840]   little bit later in life google is not one of those people i do know that they are they do they do
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:14.160]   have to i think that each one of their features really has to pass by one of the panels that has
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:18.800]   to go has to go through is an accessibility panel if i'm remembering correctly and this is off the
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:24.400]   top my head but i don't i don't think that apple is unique in saying hey this is the accessibility is
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.640]   an integral part of the development process of every single piece of hardware and every single
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.800]   feature that we put into that hardware so you're but you are absolutely right there is a real
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:41.040]   difference between how well apple products are integrating themselves into the lives
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:45.280]   lives of people who need accessibility features and the way that google products are apple is
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:51.440]   definitely ahead there and and just to kind of like put the button on this entire point was that
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:56.960]   you know um we're kind of talking about like why why would you consider apple being
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:01.200]   you know pulling ahead of its competition and and on the one side you're you're saying that you
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:07.200]   know apple hasn't really actually made any big changes in the world in in comparison to something
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:13.600]   like google and and my argument is that they're not as big but there's there's little ones so i
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:20.160]   think we're kind of you know coming around to the same perspective of why you know google matters
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:25.680]   versus why apple matters like there's different reasons why and there's different you know kind
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:30.320]   of different paths to take and i think one of the points that you might be trying to make is that
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:35.920]   you know it'd be really nice if apple would start making products that were available to all
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:41.600]   income classes and i i think as much as a four hundred dollar phone is headed in the right direction
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:47.200]   i think i agree with you that that's it's still not there you know it's still not a hundred
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:53.040]   dollar phone it's still not a phone that you can get for free on some kind of payment plan with
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:58.640]   you know t-mobile or something like that there's there's there's still a lot of work to be done
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:05.520]   on apple's side to try to be more inclusive if it really does want to match that kind of making
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:11.280]   huge strides in in making changes around the world yeah also i think none of this is altruistic
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:16.240]   either because like from apple or from google or from facebook i mean the google and facebook
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:20.720]   identified a strategy where making free products was good for them not good for us and if you look
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:26.000]   at the news feed and you look at the new tube algorithm they've done significant harm just socially
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.120]   but also in terms of the businesses they've destroyed along the way it's it's there is always a cost
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:35.280]   associated with the stuff that we get for free and that's true just as true about apple or google so
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:41.040]   i don't want to weigh their relative moralistic merits but i think niell is is right when he talks
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:46.560]   about in terms of the inter and it's the same reason there was a very good um sertechary column
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:52.160]   today from ben tompson to talking about why the team microsoft teams user experience wasn't as
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:57.920]   good as slack but the convenience of their combined offering made it so compelling especially to
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.160]   existing customers but also to a lot of other customers that it didn't matter they were just
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:07.280]   doing a better integrated offer and i think they weighs heavily into niell's point of when apple's
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:11.760]   integrating from the silicon to the experience of the device it makes it hard to compete against
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:16.080]   you can compete like one-on-one with any of those pieces but if people are looking for multiple
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:22.720]   pieces it makes the competition harder actually niell i think in this article is mostly talking
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:31.200]   about wearables and how the real future lies with he's big on those with wearables yeah he's very
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:36.720]   big on those and uh and then apple he says giving apple a ten year head start against competition
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:42.320]   with wearables may end up giving too much credit to the competition except that's all called this
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:47.680]   week and announced new mobile new wearable silicon and at first i was super excited because the way
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:52.560]   they phrased it was like yes we're finally taking this seriously but then when you read down it was
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:59.280]   another phone chip still on a 14 nanometer process and i know i know that wearable silicon is really
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:03.840]   expensive and you have to have a lot of customers to make it worthwhile especially if like qualcom
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:09.520]   your profit is based on selling those chips but part of me just wants them or google or samson to
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:14.480]   say effort we're making a chip as good if not better than apple is making and we're going to
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:19.120]   build a customer base and get our money on the back end because dammit we need better watches in
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:23.840]   the world yeah if there's if there's anything that everybody should anybody with half a brain needs
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:29.680]   to steal from apple is the idea that i don't wear on on a watch on a ver wearable every square
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:36.720]   millimeter is gold every minute of battery life is gold every feature you put into it is gold you
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:41.600]   can't take an off-the-shelf product and build a watch around it you have to build the entire
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:47.600]   watch as a as a single unit and that's why the apple watch is the apple watch and that's why the
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:54.960]   that's that's that's that's why this watch is uh well if you knock down the price by 68 percent
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:58.160]   i'll think about it only if i can get it in black you know
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:06.560]   uh i'm so i'm so attached to this that i've forgotten who made it is the fossil watch
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:11.360]   and it was like if not the fact that things are so disorganized i still have the box like right here
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:17.600]   i would not miss it oh fossil that's the name of this watch winner i'm just waiting for samslung
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.440]   to announce an ex-anose tyson book plus that uh unpacked this fall
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:28.080]   google actually is not sitting back in wearables they acquired uh north we like the north so
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.640]   the focal is quite a bit this is interesting i'm so upset by this did you have you tried the
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.720]   vocals one at the uh nelson and art on our team the thing about this though is that like to me
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:41.840]   this is just like they're google they're google they don't need like they don't need to buy fit
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.600]   bit they don't need to buy i mean i'm i'm happy that they did i mean i'm not happy that they're less
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:50.480]   this is how companies on the market compare this to how apple develops right this is how google
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:56.480]   tries to occupy space like more world uh like what have they done with fit bit they did nothing
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.720]   with motor already folded at a loss they're buying focus they bought like they bought those cameras
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:05.920]   that competed with go pro it won't happen to those cameras exactly anymore exactly just make a good
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:11.120]   product i don't care how you make it just make it and i will buy it in a door you apple has said
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.920]   all along we don't like to acquire companies because it's too hard to integrate them in most of what
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:21.520]   apple does is acquires where they hire talent and what happens to be that they had to buy the
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:26.080]   company to do that uh google seems to really think well we can get into any category just by
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:30.560]   buying the products that's all they do glass without focal like they made glass without focal
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:36.560]   succeed it's i mean i guess it's got an enterprise flavor okay but realize that
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:42.240]   realize that reporting from canada was that uh this company was like two
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:47.600]   two or two lunch orders away from being completely bankrupt anyway i'm sure google got a great deal
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:51.680]   basically know them they would they would not have the only way that the only reality in which they
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:58.320]   continue to exist is from the the summer onward is that google buys them yeah and does that exactly
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.640]   right yeah magically might be next yeah although they have a new ceo the real point of this is
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:08.080]   exactly what you what you said which is that google wants to be in wearables and the way they do
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:13.680]   it is by acquiring wearable companies just like they wanted to do it in home automation and they
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:18.960]   bought nasty so yeah the whole stuff is good like and the nest stuff is okay i mean i think people
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.160]   were upset when they did a lot of the fusion stuff like when they fused accounts and things
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:26.400]   like that but i think overall people are widely happy with that but that's been the exception and
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:31.680]   not the and not the rule for these acquisitions when i know i think we haven't go ahead i'm sorry
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:38.160]   go ahead you maybe just have to think about google from a different in a different capacity instead
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:42.240]   of thinking it as a company that's making tech you can think of it as a company that is
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.960]   distributing tech you know so they own folkles but they probably aren't gonna disassemble
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:53.600]   folkles unless it really does take a dive they're just gonna keep folkles going same thing that
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:59.520]   they did with nest and fit but those companies still exist brand wise as themselves they're just
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:06.320]   basically backed by google so you know maybe they're not trying to be the next apple maybe
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:11.600]   they're trying to be the next i don't know condonast or something you know like someone has to kick
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.400]   apples buttery somebody has to kick their butt and heart
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:21.200]   sam's song sam's song might be the one maybe i'm not over wearing slippers on either
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:26.960]   boots yeah i honestly this is really what niell's as much as what niell's saying is that the other
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:32.800]   guys aren't trying very hard as apple is firing on all cylinders and you combine the two i could
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:38.560]   see why he says you know apples is a company i think you could make that same statement at any
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:44.480]   given year in the past about apple though so i think i don't i don't i don't know i feel like they
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:49.840]   they they've they've spent a lot of time they went up a notch they spent a lot of time watching
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:55.760]   the mac slide uh they couldn't really figure out how to make the ipad take off now maybe
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:00.800]   in the secret lab they had this silicon all the time and they were saying just wait just wait just
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:06.400]   wait uh or maybe it's hard to tell or maybe a couple of years ago they went oh crap oh crap oh crap
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:10.720]   they had silicon all the time they didn't have this silicon like this is purpose i believe they
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:15.840]   were using um ios i'm just saying strategically they might have been saying let's not push too much
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:20.480]   on the mac in the ipad right now because we got a plan i think it's much more likely the latter
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:25.040]   case where they went oh crap we got to do so my understanding is that for years they were holding
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:29.760]   it like a sort of damocles over intel saying are you gonna ship on time are you sure you oh by the
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.920]   way do you see that sitting on my desk in the corner they gave them way they gave them way too
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:38.880]   much slack then they should have pulled the patient out there a long time ago i think it's much more
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:44.720]   likely that after the skylike debacle apple said you know we really can't keep doing this yeah
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:52.640]   but it was a battered spouse relationship well that's that's maybe not a great analogy but uh
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:57.680]   apple apple benefits from having competition uh and they do learn from their but when they see the
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:03.840]   when they see the numbers they do what they have to do uh to the one one of the top three ways that
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:08.720]   any person can spend 350 dollars and get them greatest bang for the buck in terms of computing
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:14.480]   power is the lowest end introductory level ipad and that would not have existed if chrome books
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:23.360]   and other machines have not been kicking apples but in education still are and it is still i will
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:29.280]   say it is an amazing product i'm still blown away by what you get for you know you don't get a it's
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:34.480]   not like it's not like amazon's like disposable tablets i mean they're they're almost literally
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:39.040]   like if the kid drops it even if it still seems to be working uh no problem we'll just buy another
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:43.840]   one i just i felt like i felt like god kid got one he came home and he was sitting there and he was
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.200]   like playing and i'm going to do it he was like oh they said if i gave them location permission i could
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:54.880]   eat all the houses on my street with pacman i'm like oh you're a kid i know i just like you know i
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:50:01.280]   love what they do i just don't always love how they do it yeah but but i think i had it i was saying
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:07.040]   that it is not a cut rate device at all it was like no it really was like the it was as i popping as
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:11.360]   the the introductory price of the ipad at a time when everyone thought that everyone knew that
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:16.320]   apple's apple's gonna do a tablet everyone pretty much agreed that a thousand bucks was likely eight
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:21.520]   hundred dollars would be great and when it introduced at six hundred there was a collective gasp in the
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:27.680]   room to and and and a smile the biggest smile on steve jobs faced when they realized that all of
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:32.240]   these jaded tech reporters were suddenly looking up for their keyboards saying did he say five hundred
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:36.480]   and ninety nine dollars yeah and i think and i think that the the introduction of a three hundred
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:42.880]   twenty nine dollar like ordinary people street price that is one of the and one of the most amazing
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:47.280]   accomplishments and apple hardware history it is an amazing product yeah and and you don't think
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:53.680]   apple is going for the low margin market but i think we gotta we do it yeah go ahead
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:58.800]   the that's an example of a way that they were able to like tap into that market that you know
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:05.680]   at the start the ipad was more expensive than other tablets so you were your competition was
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:12.000]   either an ipad or something super cheap and apple was able to get the price point down to
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:19.520]   such a low level that you know they they hit us with somewhat expensive tablets for a few years so
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:26.080]   when they when they gave us that cheap one i think a lot of people said okay i'm willing to spend
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:30.960]   you know a hundred and fifty two hundred extra dollars on an ipad then get a cheap fifty or a
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:35.840]   hundred dollar tablet because i see all of the features that features that come along with it
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:41.600]   because really think about tablet wise like what's what's the left out there like it used to be
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:49.200]   a plethora of brands making tablets of all different price ranges but now it's more niche and there's
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:54.880]   more like individual companies doing them you know like amazon having the fire uh tablet and and the
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:52:03.200]   samsungs um note samsungs tablet and they're like there's only a few that have kind of like
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:11.040]   like made it into the competitive space and i think apple managed to go from the most expensive
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:18.560]   tablet that only you know only people with money can buy two equal equal playing filled tablet
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:22.800]   that everybody can have and then they have the pro model that has more features but not
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:27.520]   everybody wants the pro model most people want the basic three hundred and twenty nine dollar model
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:33.760]   and that one is just as good as the other brands that are at that same three hundred and twenty
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:37.840]   nine dollar price range it's super interesting to me because i think they've done they've come
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:43.680]   across a rather remarkable strategy for doing for getting their products out there and you
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:48.080]   started to see it a few years ago where they started introducing more expensive features not
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:52.560]   just more expensive products but it features that were themselves expensive like the OLED screens
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:57.280]   or like the true depth camera modules and they found a way to pay for that by making these
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:02.080]   ultra premium and devices where people were willing to pay more and apples margins aren't
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:06.240]   substantially different than they were at the steve jobs here they floated around thirty odd
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:10.320]   percent they're slightly down now because apple's making more expensive products but they've been
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:15.360]   about the same and the average selling price goes up and down but by making these premium models and
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:20.800]   then using those to sort of get the technology into mass production a year two years later they
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:25.040]   can start pushing that technology down like smart keyboards and pencils and the better
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:29.440]   display is all of those things and like this year we're supposed to get OLED on all the iPhones
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:33.840]   and they introduce new premium features like lidar scanners on top until they can make those
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:38.640]   mass market and then you get the lower priced versions like the three twenty nine ipad and the
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:44.080]   one ninety nine watch and the three ninety nine phone and together it's the same average selling
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:48.960]   price you just have the middle options and slightly more expensive high-end options and slightly
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:54.480]   less expensive low-end and even this year with the iPhone 12 there's supposed to be a smaller one
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:58.400]   that's fifty bucks less expensive but the regular size one is fifty bucks more expensive
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:03.040]   but in the end again the average selling price stays roughly the same and that's
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:09.120]   that's a rather unique but so far for them pretty effective product strategy yeah i love that one
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:14.720]   one thing in apple's pricing strategy that used to be an absolute cornerstone not and wasn't a
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:19.920]   bad thing but it's just one of the cornerstones is that they figure out that people are that
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.440]   their customers seem to be perfectly happy spending a thousand dollars on a macbook error
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:28.240]   and so their motivation is not to try to find a way to make that macbook error
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:31.680]   nine hundred dollars or eight hundred dollars but to say we're going to keep the price at a
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:35.200]   thousand dollars because people are happy with that price we're just going to continue to improve
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:40.960]   that product and make it way more powerful way more features way more usable at that same price
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:48.000]   i'm glad to see in so many different categories that they're taking one of amazon's greatest
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.920]   endeavors which is to take the the kindle which originally released and i think five hundred dollars
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:58.720]   and now you can still buy a premium high-end kindle if you want but they found a way to take
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.880]   the features of the original kindle and now sell them to you like in a paperweight display
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:08.400]   for eighty dollars you can buy discounted for sixty and it's not and because it doesn't run
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:13.280]   their own custom the custom app store apps it doesn't have all the privacy problems that
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:18.320]   that the fire tablets have that is wonderful and now i'm glad to see that in the modern age of
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:23.120]   uh of apple they also see that okay it's great that we're and we're going to continue to make
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:27.040]   really great four hundred dollar apple watches but we're going to figure out a way to take
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:32.960]   whatever whatever was the four hundred dollar watch a year ago two years ago three years ago and make
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:37.600]   it accessible to people who can't afford a four hundred dollar brand new watch same thing with
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:42.720]   with the ipads again they were forced into this by having taking a point of pride in being an
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:47.920]   education computer and again having their lunch stolen by every single other manufacturer because
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:52.800]   they weren't creating a product that school systems could afford or that school systems could
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:58.720]   integrate into what they had to do for their curriculum etc etc etc but all but they have
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:03.280]   managed to do that and make it accessible as well as holding the line for people who want a thousand
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:10.080]   dollar high-end uh ipad pro tablet this is something that i think and just say nothing about the the
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:17.600]   the iphone se these are things that i think that i'm much more happy with uh the way that apple
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:26.240]   runs its business because i don't think that i can even jokingly say that apple's subtext logan is
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:31.920]   apple go be poor someplace else which used which really was the feeling three or four years ago
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:37.600]   it was like yeah hi but all your and your wonderful ad for this computer you have like an eight-year
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:42.480]   old kid who loves his who loves his macbook or loves his tablet and has got taken with it everywhere
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:48.240]   but i can't afford to give my kid eight years old who go who who splashes the rain puddles an
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:54.480]   eight hundred dollar tablet they go well sucks to be you then bye and now it's like oh of course
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:59.040]   well we have then we have other price points just to say again i i know i keep harping on the three
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:03.680]   hundred twenty dollar nine dollar ipad but it also means that cranks like me who are still
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:08.880]   complaining that oh i just wish the minimum buy-in for uh for a macbook weren't a thousand dollars
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:14.320]   there is a absolutely credible legitimate argument that he's made that anybody who is really price
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:21.200]   conscience about uh about an apple mobile computer type device three hundred twenty nine dollar ipad
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:27.200]   by any uh thirty dollar uh any thirty dollar uh keep blue tooth keyboard you want and you have
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:32.800]   something for four hundred dollars that will easily compete with anything that costs less than six
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:40.960]   hundred dollars in the window space i'm glad to see it happening interesting survey going out to
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:50.080]   some iphone owners how do you feel about the usb charger uh i keep stabbing myself with it it's
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:56.080]   the worst uh uh the survey the surveys very specific say we're not talking about the cable we're
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:02.160]   talking about the charger the usb charger they say is used for charging a wall using a wall outlet
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:07.840]   you can plug the charger into an iphone with a separate charging cable and then they ask how do
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:13.600]   you use your charger i sold or traded it with my iphone i lost it i gave it to a family member
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:19.680]   a friend i still use it at home i still use it outside i still have it but i don't use it i think
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:26.800]   it's pretty clear apple is this kind of confirms the rumor we'd heard which seemed kind of hard to
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:32.160]   believe that apple might not include the usb charger or the earpods or they're trying to measure
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:38.000]   sentiment before they make a decision yes exactly right exactly how do you feel about that thing
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.680]   you love it how many pitchforks are you counting pitchforks and torches if it's a thousand we're
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:45.280]   not going to do it but if it's under a thousand we go ahead strip it if we were to what if we were
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:50.960]   to mail it to you without a box we just put an a patent envelope what do you be cool with that
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:56.240]   they do include the crappiest charger with their iphone right it's that little tiny thing with the
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:59:01.040]   11 with the 11 pro you get the 18 watt usb c charger which is much nicer
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:09.440]   yes but they're like that's you know price-wise like you know i can go out and buy an
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:16.080]   18 watt charger right so and and i have a dozen of them lying around the house exactly the point
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:24.400]   and i think what apple might be considering at the moment is number one do do we need to be the
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:31.280]   ones that put this charger in the box when people can have the option to go somewhere else and number
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:39.600]   two at this point in in the existence of all technology aren't there already enough of those
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:44.800]   in people's houses and can't we just let them use what they want but like normal people are just
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:52.720]   us nerds no normal people yeah my mom i always talk about my mom is being like my my sort of
[00:59:53.280 --> 01:00:02.320]   um gauge for everyday people tech technologically she's probably got a half dozen or more um
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:07.840]   usb c or usb chargers just you know just the plug just laying around the house with the
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:12.160]   the hole in it where you stick whatever cable you got she doesn't know which cable is which
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:18.320]   you know that's that's like kind of the average everyday people and we buy so much technology
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:23.680]   that we just have them lying around the house and if you want to invest in something that's
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.560]   really good quality that you want to make sure you know charges your phone faster or something
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:36.080]   like that the market for for third party chargers like the the wallboards and the the pad the charging
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:42.160]   pads it's enormous you can run the gamut from super super cheap to super super expensive so
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.920]   i can see why apple might be considering just kicking that to the curb you know
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:52.720]   you're wasting it i i don't yeah exactly no that's exactly the point i was going to make
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:59.760]   e-waste is a big problem uh like you said lory people at this at this point a smartphone is not
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:07.680]   not of uh the the the exclusive domain of the elite elite nerds and upper class people it's like
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:12.160]   it's what upper class incomes it's everybody has one which means that everybody probably has a
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:16.160]   charger which means that we're probably contributing to a much bigger e-waste problem by simply packing
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:21.280]   one in and that isn't doesn't even talk about how how much less it's going to keep it's going to
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:26.800]   cost to ship all of those phones from china if we if apple can pack them in smaller boxes so i
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:31.760]   don't i don't have a i find i surprise myself by by realizing i don't have a problem with it i would
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:37.600]   like i would like however the i would i would like apple to consider doing two things however i wish
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:44.160]   to think you could buy essentially the cheap darn near useless version of the charge that
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:51.040]   used to get for free as an item that's at or near cost at the apple store or via via via order
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:56.880]   partly to give you the option of saying that if by some reason you you just woke up from a 20
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.960]   year coma they said welcome back to the land of living his or iphone and by the way here's what
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:05.360]   an iphone is i know you oh i guess you're gonna need a charger here's here's here's an easy way to
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:08.720]   just tick that box and i have to go look for one but the bigger problem for me is that
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:16.640]   when people go to buy a cheap charger oftentimes they're buying really horribly designed chinese
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:23.040]   stuff that causes fires that is a safety hazard i want i want apple to give their customers the
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:28.880]   ability to say look here is it costs 11 dollars instead of 10 dollars but this has been certified
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.960]   this is made by apple this is not something that's been made to look like apple but then
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.720]   all the components are really cheap and all the backup fail-safes have been deleted
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.160]   i want people to have the security of knowing that i've got an apple branded charger that is not
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:46.320]   going to cause me a loss of my home my my issue with it is optics and we saw that with the with
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:50.640]   the stand for the pro display like you know they and we all talked about this back when it happened
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.720]   but they said the stand is a thousand dollars extra and the room died where if they had said
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.920]   if you don't want to stand fine we'll take a thousand bucks off the price you know everyone
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:02.400]   would have cheered exact same price structure is just how they phrase things and my concern is
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:06.000]   these phones are going to be more expensive for apple to make because the low-end ones are
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.480]   supposedly going to have OLED and they're going to include 5g modems especially a millimeter wave
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:14.560]   ones on the high end and other phone companies have bumped prices by a hundred bucks you know we've
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:19.840]   saw it with sam's own charge for the galaxy s series this year and it's apple supposedly
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.280]   going to hold prices firm they're not going to raise them for the OLED they're not going to raise
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:28.240]   them for the 5g which is going to cut into their costs quite a bit and one of the ways they might
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:33.040]   defray that even though for apple those chargers don't cost almost anything at all but over
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:38.880]   200,000 units it does add up it's just not to include the charger in the box but if it's phrased
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:44.960]   that way you will see pitchforks and you will see torches and regardless of how much money apple's
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:48.720]   eating on the 5g and the OLED people are going to say they're being cheap and you know they're
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.360]   putting profits over users and stuff so if there was some way where they could phrase it where you
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:58.160]   know these are more expensive iPhones but if you don't need a charger we're very conscious about
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:03.360]   e-waste when you order it will ask you if you want one and if you if you don't want one you'll save
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:09.040]   10 bucks or something off the phone and i think they win the optics bar and they don't add a
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.760]   skew they just have a skew that all phones don't come with it but you can add it as at purchase
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.200]   like adding a final cut to your Mac purchase you know you don't just don't check the box i think
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:20.400]   that's what i think that's exactly what they will do and i'm going to give them the benefit of
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:27.280]   that and say this is about e-waste this is what the EU was pushing them on i think this is more about
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:33.120]   e-waste than savings but yeah if they'd moved the USB-C earlier then they'd have a vast array of
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.960]   universal chargers that people could use if they didn't get one in the box yeah that would sound
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:40.000]   you're gonna have to hunt down that would sound yeah now you're gonna have to hunt down your
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.680]   your USB well the problem is if it's a USB-C cable in the box generations of
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:49.440]   iPhone owners have USB-A chargers so it's not going to work for them so it really does you're
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:54.480]   right it really does seem as though if customers don't necessarily care whether you get a disposable
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:59.040]   they consider being a disposable charger in the box apple is buying themselves a whole bunch of
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:03.840]   a whole lot of pain in terms of expense trying to trying to make sure their chargers comply with
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:09.520]   the EU whatever whatever new regulations the EU puts in place and they get nothing in return so
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:15.040]   why not just say you know what come come to the store yeah tell tell us you're deeply hurt and
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:21.440]   disappointed we'll hook you up you had a great you want a free bumper speaking of the Phil Schiller
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:26.720]   doctrine you had a really good piece yesterday or a couple of days ago in on i'm more Renee
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:32.880]   about multi touch you've come around a little bit on the notion of always wanted it like i've
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.960]   wanted it for years because i really believe that if it's like for anybody raised in the ipad
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:41.920]   generation if the screen is not touched it just feels broken but my sticking point was i didn't
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:47.920]   think apple would do it because it was so hard from Microsoft like it they saw the pain of the
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:54.640]   transition windows 8 oh oh and windows windows 8 windows 10 but also like just the engineering
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:59.280]   expense because they had they were working on ipad o s at the time and the idea you know and
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:04.000]   they've never had enough mac engineers and the idea of taking people off ipad o s to build
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.960]   all like to redo the interface to do all this stuff it seemed painful like it seemed like
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:14.320]   prohibitively painful but what i didn't think about was that they were busy doing those transitions
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.640]   the whole time like they were swapping out components while the airplane was in the sky
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:23.280]   and we felt that pain we just didn't know what it was for and even though we talked about apple
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:28.080]   silicon and we talked about all this stuff and them doing all these back to my mac sort of ios
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:33.760]   things but then they announced this whole transition and again i think it's a rorschach test you can
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:40.320]   look at the new interface and think that it's an absolute sign of multi touch app or you could
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:44.640]   say oh they're just doing it so that your ipad and i'm an iphone app don't look out of place on the
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:50.080]   screen but also they could have been doing their three-year walk in the desert for multi touch the
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:55.840]   same time for apple silicon it was so much more efficient that way yeah yeah and not announce it
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:02.240]   yeah i i think i have to agree with you you you uh you know i want this so i'm biased towards
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:09.520]   wanting to have a great shot of you pretending to use the uh the iMac as a touch device and i'm sitting
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:14.080]   in front of frankly a touch device from lonovo was intended to run windows but i'm running
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:18.400]   linux on it that is exactly what you're pretending to use you know and it comes with
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:23.040]   some kind of a mate about touch screens not being good vertically doesn't apply now because that's
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:29.200]   how the ipad pro at the keyboard works right yeah yeah i uh there is that issue of touching my very
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:34.720]   nice expensive pro xd i just play keep your fingers off of it well you can't that's the thing the pro
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.080]   xd artist play you can't like it's physically it like it's bad for it if you touch it because of
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:41.360]   the way it's gotten out of the way so that's a larger issue and i think a lot of people say
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:45.840]   i don't want my my mac to be touchable because thing is people are going to touch it anyway because
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:49.840]   we're so used to using the ipad yeah but it's going to do something like you're touching your
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:54.480]   ipad why is the max screen difference the max screen can explode where the i know i mean oh i've
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.240]   got fingerprints on my mat you got fingerprints on your ipad screen already fell yeah too late
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.920]   yeah i already happened we're all used to it i would i would hate apple i would hate apple to
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:07.360]   reduce the ambitions of the mac on simply dogmatic reasons yeah i do think that for a lot for many
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:14.560]   years no multitouch on on their desktop max was a dogmatic thing as opposed to a yeah but
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:21.440]   my kid wants to write my kid insisted on windows machine because they were like the idea i thought
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:25.280]   they couldn't do it so that's why they didn't like it wasn't that dogmatic so much as it would be so
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:30.400]   painful right that they would rather not do it and that was the easiest way to explain it but
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:35.040]   what i loved about the ipad is a couple of years ago their accessibility team said that every form
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.600]   of input should be co-equal on this device and that's why we got voice control you should be able to
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:43.360]   talk to it you should be able to touch it the pencil should be able to do everything we should
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:48.320]   have pointers we should have keyboards should be first class citizens and that just it has to
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:54.560]   apply to the mac too otherwise the mac ends up being a second class citizen well i hope you're right
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:59.680]   and i think you actually are right it all kind of is clicking together and it seems pretty obvious
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:03.920]   that they're gonna have to they're gonna back down on that and it also makes a lot of sense from a
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.920]   market point of view if you're saying and i still think this may be the most important part of the
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.880]   transition that you're going to be running i-phone and ipad apps on your mac that it won't matter
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:18.400]   that you code for one you code for all you gotta have to change the date picture see that was only
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:23.280]   fly in my ointment if they'd left that date picker that wonderfully tactile spinning date picker i
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:26.880]   would have said that's it they're all in but they changed it to a dumb text field and i'm like oh
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:31.440]   did they do that because they're really intractable about this i don't think so i think it's just
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:38.000]   hard to use that date picker with a mouse it is but i mean it's so it was so emblematic of the
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.360]   touchscreen area yeah we'll see i think you're right i think they're going that way but we'll see
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:48.640]   i'm gonna oh lory a case of whiskey if i'm wrong oh really lory you bet you bet a case but uh no she
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:53.200]   just makes she just makes me give her whiskey whenever i write it oh okay it seems fair but but
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:59.120]   you know it's it still comes back to that kind of idea of like you know a refrigerator with a
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:07.440]   toaster in it like not everything needs to be like everything else and you get the memo everything
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:16.000]   is like everything else i i think you're i think you're right yeah but i'm not sure i'm not sure why
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:24.720]   it's i'm still in the in the camp of i don't need a i don't need a computer laptop or desktop that
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:30.160]   i can touch the screen the beauty of it is you don't have to touch the screen yeah right then
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:36.080]   why is it still because i want to touch the screen because rene and i want to because it
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.680]   well it's just instinctive sometimes and it's faster sometimes and it should just like in the
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:44.400]   same way like you may not need a cursor on your ipad you might buy an ipad and never buy a keyboard
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.640]   for it but the option is there and for some things and maybe better and also i'm a big honk and artist
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:52.480]   and just the idea of those kinds of large surfaces makes me get it not it's just natural for me when
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:58.400]   i see a button to touch it or to scroll with my fingers and i can't on the back a lot of businesses
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:02.080]   had those i'm acts at the entry and they would have big buttons on them and you think you could go
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.680]   up and touch them and you'd be like yeah but i honestly think it's really about eliminating
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:13.360]   the artificial distinctions that the product line is going to get more and more uh continuum and i
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:18.240]   honestly think that that's a sensible thing for apple to do it builds the strength of the ecosystem
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:23.920]   uh it doesn't actually fit the shiller doctrine though does it rene because does if there are
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:28.800]   continuum then nothing's pushing anything i would argue it does no i would argue it does because um
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:34.000]   when steve jobs announced the ipad for example he said it had to fit in between the iphone and the
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:40.240]   mac and it's always been more iphone than mac and now that it has the keyboard and cursor it's pushing
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:44.880]   hard against the mac like people who previously wouldn't have considered an ipad just because
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:50.080]   of those things are now getting ipads and loving them and that puts enormous pressure on the mac
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:54.880]   and one of the ways the mac is fighting back is going to apple silicon but another way they can
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:58.640]   fight back is by getting multi-touch and then people who just need it a little bit
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.040]   well no we'll no longer be able to just like not even consider it the way that people didn't
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:08.720]   even consider an ipad before i also think that microsoft's done a lot of market research for them
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:12.560]   you you'd be hard pressed now to buy a pc from anybody that doesn't have touch
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:17.440]   it's it's obviously something consumers want are they are they because it adds expense
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:23.680]   complexity to a device but apparently consumers want it because it's they're very you know you
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:28.160]   have to really go to a weird kind of business machine to get one without touch it does add
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:35.360]   a super amount of flexibility that the the the thing that the thing that i love about uh windows
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:40.960]   and chrome books so chrome book laptops particularly the ones that have the 360 degree screen is that
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:46.160]   there are times where i'm i'm having lunch i just want to read the morning comments and
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.640]   said i'll follow turn it into an easel and then just like occasionally flip this flick the screen
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.360]   to scroll up and so much of what i use a laptop for is actually just reading stuff the number the
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:02.160]   number of times where i've got uh my my uh linovo windows 10 machine that doesn't the screen
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.880]   don't i keep i keep instinctively wanting to try to fold the screen all the way backwards don't do
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:12.080]   that and it's not supposed to do that you you can only do that once and you can't do that twice
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:18.160]   and i'll just like be on the sofa just like you know absolutely vegging out and i'm just like
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:23.120]   sitting i'm just sitting there like with like my hands on a steering wheel just going flick flick
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:28.400]   flick so it's not it's not as though i would love to i miss i miss being able to like do eight hours
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:33.200]   of work which i'm constantly doing this but there are times where just like with the ipad if i'm
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.120]   going to be drawing something i really want to be able to touch controls on the screen as
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:41.120]   opposed to having to activate some sort of a control and enter command there are times where
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:45.440]   i'm consuming media where i want the keyboard completely out of the way because the superf was
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:50.880]   to my needs but i still need to interact with the app or the the viewer in some way so i feel as though
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:56.640]   if apple were to say okay guess what we're we're admitting we're admitting no malfeasance and no
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:04.160]   no mistakes here but guess what wwdc 2021 here's how to do multi-touch on a on a mac i think that it
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:10.720]   would open up a really wonderful class of hardware and software that would solidify people's love
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:15.120]   of the mac they you know there are only two things that there there are only two things that would
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:21.040]   make me switch to uh to windows machines as opposed to macs one of them is better keyboards but they
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:27.280]   fix that but the but the other one is these wonderful form factors that aren't perfect for everybody but
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:33.360]   damn this one company is making this one model that is absolutely it is the andeanato edition of a
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:39.200]   laptop and it is so perfect for how i use computers that i don't care that it doesn't run my favorite
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:44.080]   operating system i just why just it's just going to be so great to live with this thing i'm glad to i
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:49.360]   want to see apple try to put some of that some of that thinking into macs i know that they can't
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:53.760]   because they are one manufacturer they have to make they have to make the machines that
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:15:00.720]   everybody wants not the ones that are either a andeanato or b people who have been tragically
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:05.680]   afflicted with andeanato syndrome uh want want but that's the sort of thing they're fighting
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:11.920]   against i think multi-touch on a on a on a mac particularly and i i'll say it again if apple makes
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:17.520]   an ipad pro it's it's they basically they just take the ipad pro make it in a different body color
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:23.360]   and now it's locked to mac OS you can't switch between two operating systems but it's a mac OS
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:31.440]   on on an ipad pro oh my god i would i would totally find the money for that i would spend my rent
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:36.960]   money my housing money my cell phone bill to have that on the first day of release because it's it
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:42.160]   would be such a compelling device for me no it'll never happen but oh boy does that get me excited
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:47.920]   let's take a little break our show today brought to you by stamps.com we're gonna come back and talk

[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:13.760]   they're going to do is a series based on where the wild things are i presume it'll be animated
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:19.040]   not live action although they made a movie live action didn't they would be interesting well
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:24.240]   spike jones they have fragger rock they could use the fragger rock characters time to get away

[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:35.360]   tom hanks salty and in the next day be all tom hanks unsalted well that's a funny one amazing
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:42.400]   so so as we know and i can't wait to see apple tv plus has the exclusive on grayhound his next
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:48.160]   movie they spent a lot of money 70 million dollars yeah for it his first comment with a guardian
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:54.400]   it was a absolute heartbreak that it's on apple tv but i don't like extreme yeah i don't think the
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:59.200]   heartbreak is apple at the heartbreak yeah no it was clear and if you watch it it was clear in
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:02.800]   context he said he was heartbroken that it wasn't in movie theaters because he believes that war
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.560]   film should be shown on giant screens with giant sound systems will come to my house
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:11.680]   immediately come to my house you're gonna be on a giant screen with a giant sound system
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:18.320]   i think the problem with the headline that was also picked up across the board was
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:24.160]   you know tom hanks saying it's heartbreaking that it's on apple tv like that's like the wrong
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:29.840]   message that wasn't what he was saying i think that yes like just as a headline that's just so
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:39.280]   out of context that it's painful band and love joy come on man well in fact he has added to his
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:48.000]   comments now saying no no no you don't understand grayhound was rescued at sea by apple tv plus
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.760]   that's a little bit that was from the today's show he was also cranky that they wanted him
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:55.840]   they didn't want his books behind him in the press junk in the remote press junket because
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:59.520]   apparently they thought that people would find it distracting seeing what books were on his shelf
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:04.320]   rather than what he was saying that's my say what i wanted blank blank i always say he was back
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:09.840]   on the book thing obviously you won that war yeah i like the books yet the today's show said you
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:14.400]   could have some books yeah and i spent a lot of time trying to figure out what books he had
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:21.040]   why didn't he just drop the h-bomb on them like just just say just say gosh i'm sorry you know
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:25.920]   television better than i do if you think that it would ruin everything by having tom hanks in front
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:29.760]   of books you should definitely not have me on the show you're right you should do exactly what you
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:35.200]   want hi oh oh you're saying it's okay for me to have okay i'm sorry i'm just understood i thought
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:42.560]   you said i might know a little about filmmaking we trust you with it he's the most loved man in
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:49.680]   america mr roger he's mr roger's don't mess with him uh apple's not done spent in the
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:55.840]   since been in the dough for exclusives they just bought will smith's new action film emancipation
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:01.760]   bidding against some heavy hitters in hollywood reportedly got it for not 70 million
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:09.120]   but a hundred five million dollars was down to apple and warner brothers warner brothers said
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:13.840]   we're out that's too much so this is where i worry because the last two like both in the
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:17.200]   theaters the mother forever matter millenia i forget what it was called the will smith clone
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:21.840]   movie and the one on netflix where they had like he was like fairy police or like goblin police
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:27.200]   something terrible not very good movie terrible like expensive but not very good and i thought apple
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:31.360]   was gonna emphasize and maybe this is the best movie ever i don't know i haven't seen it it's not
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:36.160]   been produced presumably they saw it before they bought it you never know though because like i've
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:41.520]   been listening to uh john august and kreg mason's script notes podcast for a while now and there is
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:47.120]   so many a slip twix the production and the ship when it comes to hollywood movies and interfei
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:51.280]   and we're just hearing about all the d_c universe interference that went on for the last two years
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:56.240]   i mean it's remarkable any movie gets made but it does seem like these like in the beginning apple
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:24:00.800]   was doing very quirky things that would not be produced without them and i sort of love that
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:05.920]   approach because it lowered expectations and really set the bar on quality where i feel like
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:12.000]   will smith vehicles could be made anywhere and the emphasis goes rapidly off the quality to just
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.480]   the star power um there's more to it than this it's directed by an tuan fuqua
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:25.360]   and it is a true story of a runaway slave and who changed the world a little bit he
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:33.680]   uh he escaped from uh his slavery and journeyed north and then joined the union army
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:39.120]   this is an 18 i feel like a jerk yeah listen because it gets even better this is in 1863
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:45.040]   and when he when he got the physical for the army had to take off his uh his shirt and showed his
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:52.960]   bear back they took photos even though this 1863 of the scars on his back from a near fatal whipping
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:25:02.320]   that photo uh was seen got published was seen around the world in 1863 and it gave the abolitionist
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:08.240]   cause indisputable this is from deadline indisputable proof of the cruelty of slavery in america
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:14.400]   and it influenced people and really had a lot to do with it's and this is its title emancipation
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:21.680]   so you are the worst human you didn't know you didn't know that i didn't know it till i read it
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:27.280]   but uh we love you rene it was the first it was so early it was earliest days of photography and it
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:34.480]   was the first viral image of the brutality of slavery and so there is a really big i you know
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:39.360]   who knows what it's worth who knows how many people are going to go see it but it is an important film
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:43.520]   um it has what i want to i want by the way stories that aren't being told i think that's
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:47.280]   where they can make their impact on the industry i think that's why they did it and by the way they
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:53.200]   haven't seen the movie because it's slated to start production next year so they did have to now
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:56.080]   yeah they bought it so they were talking they were talking this week about how they were going to
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:00.400]   have to use cgi to have people touching each other on movie sets without without having them
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:04.240]   being quarantined for two weeks first it sounds like it's going to be very hard to produce anything
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:10.160]   for a while so there were seven bidders in the virtual can market uh after 75 million the
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:14.080]   bidding was down to apple and Warner brothers and apple eventually won the rights for
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:17.840]   it what will likely be a spend of a hundred twenty million
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:23.120]   uh dollars it shows that apple is this is not now this is a production deal this is not merely a
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:29.760]   distribution deal um so that's the shows apple is very much all in on creating content for
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:34.640]   they're all in on apple tv plus i think there's no question about that yeah when i apologize to
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.760]   be the worst kind of content you're not you didn't know but no i spoke off reactionary garbage and
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:45.200]   i apologize he has made some pretty bad films lately well it's no doubt about it but to talk
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:50.160]   about every single one that's right yeah i'll talk about every single topic make a difference
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:55.040]   it's not it's not just making movies like this but also making sure you're hiring filmmakers who
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:59.920]   are underrepresented people are not getting meetings like antia vuquai yeah leading leading
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:05.280]   leading uh leading actors that they because they can't guarantee a 20 million dollar opening are
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:13.280]   not going to get cast which means you ace out of any all but uh 18 18 mostly white men you also have
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:20.480]   some white women a few non-white actors that can open a movie uh i i really think this is i hope
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:25.600]   that this turns into a situation like we had uh in the uh at least in the in the nostalgic version
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:32.960]   of the the 1970s movies were absolutely anything goes yeah it's like yes yes this is damn great damn
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:38.160]   crate oh yes the the heartthrob from welcome back Carter is going to be in a rated r movie about
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:44.240]   sex and dancing in brooklyn sure well i go ahead in all seriousness apple deserves i think some
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:49.280]   credit for putting some money behind it's uh tim cook statements about uh diversity about
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:54.000]   supporting black filmmakers so we can have black filmmaker a black star and i think a very
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:00.000]   important film regardless of the box office what will be a very important film for 2021 or 2022
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.240]   when it comes out so i think that's as much as anything that's tim cook saying yeah we're gonna
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:10.160]   put our money where our mouth is yeah um and you know what look at Antoine and uh and will are not
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:16.240]   suffering so uh i'm uh hope they also had you know hire some other people a black gaffer and a black
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:20.480]   uh you know i mean that's best well you don't want to call them a best boy anymore so whatever they
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:25.680]   call those guys stage hands um i hope that they put their money there too in another places but
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:30.400]   uh you know it's a i don't know if it's a big payday for a will or or Antoine but
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:36.880]   i think it's going to be an important film to make so that's probably a lot of that too going on uh
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:42.560]   phil libin has introduced uh phil's an old friend of the network loved him when he was the
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:47.840]   CEO at uh evernote he's been on twitter many many times he just put sank four and a half million
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:56.080]   dollars into a new app with the strange name of mmm how many m's how many h's too
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:02.640]   m's worst name ever two mmm hmm yeah but you can know how to say that don't you
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:09.120]   it's yeah but that that means that like i got 12 i got 12 dollars i'm gonna i'm gonna take every
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:15.360]   domain name that is one one h too many one m too few in case this thing takes off then i'm gonna
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:19.520]   sell it back to the company for twenty thousand dollars a piece i'm gonna guess that the way phil
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:23.760]   came up with this is i don't know if you've watched any of the saturday at lives from home
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:29.760]   um but they they're not just people on zoom calls they've really dressed them up with some
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:33.040]   great production graphics that's what mmm hmm will do
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:37.840]   libin said it's important to have a name you can say while eating
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:43.600]   which is funny because phil is a big guy on uh on fasting i don't even
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:49.920]   fasting uh it's a virtual camera place quibby will it will it fill the quibby five hole in my non
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:54.960]   existing heart oh boy oh boy quibby there's a there's a good article about quibby i'll talk
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:59.280]   about that in a second uh it's important you have a name i'll say while eating says libin it's a
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:04.320]   virtual camera which as you know sometimes work sometimes doesn't work with zoom and skype and so
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:10.160]   forth but i guess they're planning it for zoom google meet or other at youtube even you turn it on
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:16.000]   and it transforms your room into a virtual stage and offers a variety of still and animated virtual
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:23.440]   backgrounds to enliven your conversations it also you can manipulate slides backgrounds your own
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:28.240]   image with a simple gesture on a trackpad you can move your face around the screen shrinker and
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:35.360]   larger image disappear entirely um let's see here's the beta preview this is phil starring in a video
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:42.800]   created there's phil but mmm hmm um i don't know i think it's interesting this shows you that there
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:53.360]   is a uh a gold rush in zoom stuff it is for the mac by the way it's it's it's everybody has to
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:58.320]   deal with this everybody's not and even after this whole thing goes away the idea of video
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:02.880]   conferencing becoming part of the workplace is going to stick around and so the idea of let's have
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:07.840]   let's have let's have ways to make this cool let's have ways to make me have fun doing this tom hanks
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:14.800]   should have had this because he uh adds a bookshelf with some books to that bear blank wall he has
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:24.080]   over the shoulder graphics powerpoint presentations he can disappear become translucent move around
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:28.960]   on the graphic i want this actually i think we're gonna do our shows with mmm from now on
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:35.200]   this looks pretty sweet this is a kind of like he can you see he's got an he can style uh
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:42.000]   instead of his uh smartphone um he can't stand very well i mean mica used it today for ios today
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:49.360]   uses it i think this is really uh you know what this sounds silly and no doubt the name is silly
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:58.880]   but i think it's pretty cool yeah i think it might actually this this might be the uh the time to make
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:07.360]   i do hope that the i do hope that the software generates a random and fresh unique collection of
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:13.760]   random crap on the bookshelves behind them every single time every single user or else oh i see
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:22.240]   you also have the the oak burl uh horse head figure as well as the generic book on quote us history
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:28.960]   unquote libin says it's uh intended to be the go-to app for people who want to stream powerpoint
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:32.560]   instead of fortnite depressingly there are very many of us
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:42.240]   he also likes the name because he says you can't just say it you have to perform it which is a
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:47.520]   really good point isn't it oh well no well now you're risking like sounding like looking like a
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:33:02.400]   like a one the crash test dummies you know oh no no no no would you like to put a m.2 ssd into your
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:11.280]   ipod classic my mom has two ipod classics i sent her the the idea was uh i could load them up with
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:15.600]   books and music and she just plug them in she wouldn't have to know anything about it i'm gonna
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:23.680]   get him back i'm gonna get him back yeah that's awesome ipod classic modding is a hell of a thing
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:29.520]   there's a lot of videos about it and i'm amazed at this ancient ancient by modern standards uh uh
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:35.840]   software uh operating system that's in there when that could not conceive of like 512 gigabytes of
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:42.960]   storage a terabyte of storage uh is now saying oh there's a terabyte there's like a raid or a raid
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:47.840]   controller inside there that's giving you access to a terabyte of storage sure well give me five
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:52.720]   minutes to build the dead build database but sure now it's not the most attractive mod
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:34:00.160]   because it is a full-size m.2 card which means it's bigger than the actual case i think but
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:05.680]   hey it works that's you're right Andy that's the kind of miraculous thing i can't believe it works
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:11.200]   and what people need to understand is that this isn't just like someone who has like access to
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:16.960]   like microfines soldering and desoldering and customs you can actually buy kits that says pull
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:22.960]   up this hard drive pull plug in to the connector this little controller board then plug any micro
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:29.360]   SD card you want up to up to 512 gigs or whatever into this thing it is a real thing i've i've a friend
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:36.400]   who who sheepishly asked you you have a lot of old ipods don't you yeah do you have a series four
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:44.720]   which color do you want and and i'm like hot cut if i gave you like my black series four could you
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:51.520]   do the same thing to mine and you can keep the one that i gave you so i'm gonna do this you have to
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:35:00.480]   buy the special part from iFlash it's the iFlash SATA version 10 and it is a special drive and
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:04.240]   actually i guess you can put it back together again because look at that that's a smaller he was
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:09.280]   he must have been demonstrating doing it with the traditional or maybe also have to keep in
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:14.560]   mind how difficult it is to open these things up apple does not make them easy to get into
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:20.960]   yeah it also is a SATA not NVMe connector so get that set some some are pretty easy because
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.680]   at this point it's well documented and if you have an i fix it when you drive out you have you have
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:30.640]   you have a tool you just have to release some clips that are little that are invisible and hard to
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:36.720]   find but once you release it some of them all they just just pop apart yeah wow or you could use
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:41.600]   it looks like you could also use a micro SD card in there i don't know why i'll do it well that would
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:49.520]   be this is a big this is a long standing rich cultural tapestry of things in mods to classic
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:54.960]   ipods what a testimony to design team to put it together that it's such a compelling form
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:36:00.320]   factors such a compelling device to have in your pocket at all times that yes i'm willing to
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:04.960]   spend extra money and go to a lot of trouble just to keep this thing afloat and make it practical
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:11.920]   and wonderful in 2020 by the way remember forest gump speaking of tom hanks yeah
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:19.120]   do you remember that he said he bet he invested a hundred thousand dollars in apple computer
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:26.880]   according a hundred thousand in apple stock according this weirdo alevia all over on i'm more
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:34.640]   than a hundred thousand dollars in apple stock forty nine billion dollars it would be worth
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:39.440]   can we invent the time machine let you just go back right now forty nine
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:46.800]   dollar actually but yeah he never said how much he said some kind of fruit company
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:54.400]   i can i can pinpoint the concept of my of my ethics and it came on that day in 1997 where the
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:37:00.880]   stock was at twelve and seven eighths and i i'm not joking i was i literally had to spend a couple of
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:08.400]   days thinking i have i'm not rich by any means but i can buy like a thousand shares of this stock
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:15.520]   that i know is going i i know is going to go up but but if not for the fact that okay well i i'm saying
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:19.440]   at the the reason why i didn't was because ethically i don't feel as though it's okay for me to invest
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:24.640]   in companies i write about but also oh that's right you also are under nd a on a bunch of things that
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:30.560]   would blend you in jail if you may have been a good one like take this money and buy every company
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:35.120]   with a fruit in its name i don't want to know which ones oh every company with a fruit in its name
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:40.560]   all all i all i did was i had to call like every friend of mine that i knew who was in relative who
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:47.600]   was like into investing and said i i cannot tell you why but i really believe that apple is going
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:52.320]   to rebound hard and a couple of them said okay that's worth that's worth a thousand
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:57.040]   dollars of my of my money and they upgraded me from like christmas cards to like christmas
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:01.360]   presents for like ten years after that so it's it's a i don't i didn't remember this but it's a joke
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:06.560]   in the movie because he says i took the money i made from the bubba gump ship company and put it into
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:10.960]   some kind of fruit company then gets a letter in the mail and you can see that the fruit is a nice
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:17.280]   looking at it he would be uh the 22nd richest person in the world today
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:22.880]   that is only tom you gotta make a sequel now
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:30.080]   um and you said you were a little miffed rene but i think you don't mean it in a bad way but the
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:37.600]   frown hofar company has come up with something to succeed h.265 which they also so i i'm miffed
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:43.680]   in the sense that i believe so right now there's this huge schism in codex that's resulted for years
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:48.640]   in people with apple devices not getting 4k youtube that's just the most common example but
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:55.600]   basically almost everyone was on board with h.264 and then the same consortium went to h.265
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:00.480]   and google said no we've had enough of this we're going to vp9 and in some ways it was good because
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:04.960]   they didn't want a pattern encumbered uh codex but in other ways it's bad because they didn't do
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:08.800]   anything to indemnify anybody that used vp9 it was sort of like we don't have to pay stuff but
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:13.120]   good luck to you if you get suit suckers i was like so some companies did and some companies didn't
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:19.440]   and it just meant that we that wasn't a compatibility and the hope was that av1 would replace both
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:25.360]   because both apple and google signed on for it meaning that after this happened the next generation
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:30.080]   of stuff would just work with you'd get your youtube everywhere you'd get you know your hollywood
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:34.960]   movies everyone would just would and the reason this matters is that companies build accelerators
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:40.800]   into their silicon intel tried to famously but apple you know has been doing h.265 acceleration
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:47.440]   for years uh and now the consortium's like yeah but we want licensing so h.266 and i'm sure
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:51.520]   i don't know if apple's going to support it hollywood might force them to i don't think google will
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:55.760]   and i hope that doesn't mean that ak youtube is just inaccessible on my next iphone basically
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:06.160]   this uh this new codec h.266 uh is quite another devil it may be pretty popular because uh
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:14.480]   according to frounhofer it can get down to about half the size so a uh a 90 minute 4k movie which would
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:22.080]   be uh uh uh 10 gigabytes would only be 5 gigabytes for the same quality they've been trading
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:27.920]   file size for encode complexity so like h.265 is half the size of h.264 but it takes
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:32.480]   i don't know double but it takes a much longer time to encode but encoding is done once and
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:36.000]   and decoding is done over and over and over and over and let youtube do it so why not you know
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.680]   they do it all for you well youtube won't though that's the thing is they won't implement this because
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:45.680]   it's from the h that consortium yeah they say well now they're going with the media coding industry
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:53.840]   forum to do the licensing mcif not the mpeg consortium 34 major member companies but it's still licensed
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:57.360]   it's still licensed but they want to i'm hasn't anything now because i'm making huge mistakes
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:02.400]   by speaking out of my industry well that's just my that's just my no but your concern is real and
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:06.320]   that's they're trying to address it whether that will fix it or not but at least it's not the mpeg
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:14.480]   consortium it's a new it's a new group the mfi mcif the media coding industry forum i'd like to
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:18.640]   know more about that in this article and in gadget does not describe it you see the youtube bruja
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:25.440]   today leo no then for the moment yeah youtube announced that they're going to allow mid-roll ads
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:29.040]   in any previously you have to have a video ten minutes or longer which is why a lot of youtube
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:33.360]   videos are longer than ten minutes in order to have mid-roll ads inserted into them either
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:37.920]   programmatically or manually and they're dropping that to eight minutes but they're not just dropping
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:43.120]   it they're opting everyone into it when they drop it and if you don't want mid-roll ads you're
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:47.840]   gonna have to go and opt out and we thought this is going to be super complicated but you you
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:51.600]   wait for a banner to appear you drop it down you say no thank you i don't want an
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:55.840]   mid-roll ads and then they're like what but why don't you is it that you think that it's too many
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:59.360]   ads are you worried that we're going to put too many ads in do you think that ads are going to
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:02.560]   reduce your amount of viewers can you please tell us why you don't want and it's fairly
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:06.320]   obviously really want those ads but a lot of people are trying desperately to not have them
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:14.880]   show up unintended yeah i'm looking at the um m c i f web page these are the member companies
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:20.160]   of course apple is one of them so is doleby frown-off or the creator of the codec intel
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:30.240]   you see sony in there but no google no so you're right that you know this is not this is not this is
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:35.760]   this is too bad that skism is not good and google is a big player thanks to youtube there maybe is
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:39.600]   the biggest of them all maybe they can convince
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:46.800]   google to drink the kiwi well apple just added uh 4k playback uh and i wasn't sure if it was av1
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:51.120]   or apple finally cave and started supporting vp9 but we've seen people say both things i'm not
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:55.600]   sure what the reality is but okay again just means for consumers you have to deal with two things
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:59.920]   that you shouldn't have to deal with why why wouldn't apple if it's not if it's not if it's a free
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:04.640]   codec why wouldn't apple support it because it's not indemnified and there's always a risk that
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:09.920]   the em kegill is in a suit anyway right um because like how do you prove like it was not how do you
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:15.280]   it's it's usually a torturous for companies apple sized after like they will be the one that gets
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:18.000]   sued it's not like a bunch of little companies that are going to do an i are going to get
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:26.160]   apple be so yeah that's right yeah yeah um let's uh let's do our picks of the week if uh you don't mind
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:31.040]   andy you want to start i want to leave lory for the last because i know i'm gonna buy whatever she's
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:39.280]   talking about right it's been very bad it's been a bad experience i have so many things lory
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:46.080]   recommends maybe i'll buy this one from andy what do you got andy uh my pick is free uh you were
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:52.080]   a lot of us here are big fans of the plex media server app yes this is when i a few years ago when
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:44:00.000]   i realized that itunes was struck in iceberg and didn't think i should get off that boat sooner rather
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:06.320]   than later plex was the media organizer and streamer app that i landed on it is essentially it's like
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:12.640]   you it's like you get you can create itunes music and netflix room personal versions of it using
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:18.000]   all this all the music and video and other files you already own uh they create there's a brand new
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:24.240]   app however specifically for music called plex amp which is instead of using like the standard plex
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:29.280]   like mobile app for a figure iphone or ipad and you navigate to your music library and you do this
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:35.120]   that the other this one zeros and specifically on your music and it is really optimized as a music
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:40.960]   player uh and i kind of had forgotten that that it existed i think i downloaded like the beta
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:46.480]   a beta when it first uh first arrived uh and then real events i only really started using it like a
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:51.360]   week and a half two weeks ago and it really is a much more muscular way of use of accessing your
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:55.840]   music on plex and now i'm like oh i could have been i could have been having this good a time for the
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:59.520]   past couple of months instead of for the past couple of weeks andy you are not the
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:08.000]   chariot's knife in in the salad bin it's no no android ios macos windows and linux nice yep
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.800]   nice nicely done and like i said it's it's said of having it it doesn't it doesn't have more features
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:18.400]   than the than the standard plex app which of course still works on your on your ios device and whatever
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:22.000]   but it means that you don't have to drill down through menus to get at them because they're all
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.960]   right on the surface great stuff do you know because i i really wanted to do this i wanted to put all my
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:34.000]   audio books on my plex server and listen to them and i haven't i don't know if plex doesn't handle
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:38.880]   the codec or something but i've not been able to do that and it's been disappointed because i
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:44.960]   would love to really do that i have i have to say that that's an area in which i decided to bend
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:50.720]   certain rules that i did use audio hijack to capture like my favorite audio books that i've
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:58.800]   bought and purchased from from audible only because i i my bottom just you can do that i bought well
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:02.880]   yeah and also it's just that i know that i could just simply install the audible app on my phones
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:06.560]   and on my devices and they make it very easy to do that that's not a problem it's just that
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:12.160]   when my first thought in my head does not go to oh well i'll launch the audible app it's that oh
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:17.600]   i'll go to plex because it's a piece of audio and also i like the way that i can organize that media
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:23.360]   and tag it and create collections and stuff like that to say nothing of the fact that i can put it on
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:29.600]   like my my sony walkman because it just will it play it as an m4b or does it um in other words
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:34.080]   i treat like a book or like a piece of music i don't know i think the way that the way that i do
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:39.360]   it is treats it like a like a mp3 an mp3 an audiophile but i have it actually you're
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:44.480]   that's not useful probably i should look i should look into that all all i did was a couple years
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:48.560]   ago realizing that okay i can't figure i can't easily figure out a way to simply
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:52.560]   put this file onto my plex server and make it work right okay i guess i'm just gonna have to use
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:55.840]   audio hijack and convert it to conversion and p3 that's because of the copy protection actually
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:02.960]   i'll give you a recommendation as long as we're breaking the law i use this this is e pub or
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:08.880]   which is a converter for a variety of formats but they have specifically an audio converter for audible
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:15.680]   that'll convert it to mp mp 4b or mp3 i don't use mp3 because you can't you needs to pick up where
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:20.720]   you left off obviously you're so good but i do use the m4b format i haven't found anything
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:27.200]   though on plex server that will play back the m4b files you don't think i'm worried about it so
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:32.240]   that that's that converter is shady or shifting in any way the my problem with those things is that
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:36.960]   they're paid for it so many of them they're like i know google search there's a hundred of oh just
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:40.800]   here's a go to our helps upload this file into the website and you will get a download link for
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:46.080]   mp3 version and it makes me think that either it's collecting data on me or it just wants to add
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:50.000]   this oh here's an audiobook that we didn't have for our pirate library that we're selling elsewhere
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:58.240]   thank you so the issue of course is you're removing drm and depending on your interpretation of the
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:05.360]   law well moving drm is probably illegal by according to the dmca because you're reverse engineering drm
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:13.920]   this company e pub or makes converters for ebooks as well um all i can say as i bought the audible
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:18.960]   converter a couple of years ago not because i don't i am a regular audible subscriber i pay
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:23.360]   for every single book i don't share my books with anybody but i want i was really hoping to have
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:29.360]   the convenience of a backing up my books exactly yeah so that i have them somewhere and i can play
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:35.040]   them without the audible app uh you know an ipod and i think we'll play them without an audible app but
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:40.000]   i wanted to be able to do that a and b i really wanted to do it on my plex server i would thought
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:45.520]   it'd be really nice to be able to listen to my audiobooks kind of in this in this kind of more
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:51.440]   open way uh but i haven't yet figured out how to play those m4b's back yeah however and i will say
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:57.120]   this i pay for this bought it a couple of years ago i've gotten regular updates i haven't had any
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:03.920]   problem with it it does the job it's 23 bucks um they have a free trial and as far as i can tell
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:08.080]   they're legitimate company i have no idea they can away with it i just i that's whenever i hear about
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:14.320]   a new app oh i understand and you know what you know it's such a important for some of us it's a
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:18.800]   rarely important point now audible is a little bit different in that they're owned by amazon so it's
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:22.880]   not as though they're gonna go away and two or three years and take all the my purchase content with
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:29.680]   it but in principle i believe that unless if i've bought content unless i have it as an unlocked
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:33.760]   file that i can move wherever i want without restriction makes me nervous really own it i mean
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:39.280]   yeah i i can play i can play this movie i can play this book i can play this whatever under certain
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:44.880]   conditions that are controlled by an outside company and to me that's not acceptable that's
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:50.160]   just that's just a principle it not i'm not insisting that everybody agree with it or share it and i
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:56.320]   could be wrong in certain ways but that's basically my instinct that's that's why that's why right here
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:50:03.120]   i mean even here are my podcasting's death this is why i still have like uh incoming like stacks
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:09.040]   and stacks and stacks of cds and blue rays because i just don't buy stuff digitally i have to buy
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:15.440]   them like on cd and then rip them because if i don't have it as a flak file i don't feel as though i
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:21.600]   actually own it yeah and it's not you know i'm in the same way i feel like making backups of stuff i
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:26.720]   purchase legally i own and i'm not gonna give away i'm not gonna set up a blanket on the front lawn
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:32.960]   and sell it's okay that to me is ethically even if it's not the letter of the law it's of the spirit
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:38.640]   of the law it's ethical um on the other hand this company charges for a product to do that yeah that
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:45.280]   seems less than the than ethical however well uh that's you know that's on that but as rene has said
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:51.200]   more than once like if if you don't know where a company is making its money that's something you need
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:56.640]   to uh to investigate and not not just from the oh well if you're if you're not the if you're not
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:00.080]   paying for it you're not the consumer you're the product i don't mean things like that it's like
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:06.720]   okay so what's in it for them to give me a free tool for for converting stuff all the time and
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:11.360]   like that's the thing that that's the thing that always gets me a free SDK to make my app do all
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:16.800]   these things it's my guess there there's somewhere use our framework in the Cayman islands or you know
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:23.760]   somewhere where they're beyond the long arm of the us copyright authority but um maybe and maybe
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:29.280]   have harmed them now by telling people about it but let us let us let us bid for on your ebay
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:34.000]   auctions for you just give us your luck and credentials yeah exactly your budget bids at one
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:41.920]   second before the okay uh rene richy pick of the week so mine is just a like it's something we all
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:47.680]   know but recently when craig feder icky and greg jaws we act we're on the talk show uh friend of
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:53.680]   the show john groover asked them why there was no calculator app on the ipad and craig was talking
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:59.760]   about you know apple could easily make one but he basically gave a whole bunch of uh you know
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:07.120]   typical apple responses for something that i feel like uh james tomsen of p calc has done beautifully
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:11.920]   going on a decade now and that is make a calculator for the ipad so i know this is still a source of
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:16.800]   frustration every time i ask people what they want to see in a new version of ipad o s they say just
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:23.120]   a calculator so weird and and there is well there was the actual story is that steve jobs um when
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:27.200]   they were making the iphone a bunch of the original apps were widgets literally dashboard widgets
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:32.240]   but they performed terribly so they remade them as little apps but steve hated the way they
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:36.880]   looked blown up on the ipad screen so he refused to ship them and apple has added some of them
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:41.840]   back over time but still no weather still no calculator but p calc is a brilliant
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:48.640]   calculator that james has been making for ten years for the ipad it comes as a universal binary
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:53.840]   for the iphone with the apple watch it currently has previous generation widgets which let you
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:59.520]   actually do calculations in widget space which won't work anymore with the new generation widgets
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:05.600]   but i'm sure he will think of some incredibly cute novel maybe augmented reality or dice based
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:12.960]   work around for that kind of stuff but i i i am never uh i'm i'm always impressed but i'm never
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:19.440]   surprised that indie developers do things faster and often better than these giant companies do
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:24.800]   them and that's absolutely the case with p calc so if you're looking if you've just said where is
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:30.080]   the calculator app that my ipad was born for while it is james thong's and have one for you yeah
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:37.600]   can i can i just say that if apple were to come out with a calculator app that in any way where
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:44.080]   jeopardize p calc there would be a reckoning swift and inevitable that may be why they have
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:48.880]   in that right yeah maybe they just it's like you you do not you do not mess with p calc and it's
[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:54.160]   best beloved creator it's really true it's really true yeah is it it's ten dollars but is that ten
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:58.800]   dollars get you the iphone and the ipad and the wash okay yeah absolutely and the sticker is
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:03.760]   an i message sticker the thing about jim that i love all is not just like james worked at apple
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:08.720]   you know famously on the dock and on um and on the finder in the early days of o s ten but
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:13.840]   there is nothing he can't do and he is always day one of any new app store apple announces
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:17.920]   if they announce that he will be there it's like he had the calculator on the apple tv day one

[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:51.920]   if i lose it i will be very very sad so it's so it's in a display box all along with my the other
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:56.400]   ones that are like that james really is a beloved isn't he that's so awesome he has had him on
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:55:01.280]   on the video last week to talk about the new widgets and he was just i asked i asked him about
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:05.840]   you know like apple when apple announced the new widgets in their session video it says widgets
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:10.960]   are not mini apps and i asked him if he felt personally attacked and he was very gracious in his response
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:15.680]   twenty eight years he's been doing this it's kind of amazing
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:23.360]   so like all right lory what am i buying today well i think you might be happy to find that what i
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:30.400]   am offering today is not something that you have to purchase it is a free download it's called eat
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:39.440]   okra and it is an app that helps you find black-owned restaurants and eateries drink places in your
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:43.600]   neighborhood or wherever you it doesn't even have been your own neighborhood it's sort of like yelp
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:48.880]   but it's specific to black-owned restaurants so you know when you're you know trying to
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:54.080]   better educate yourself and figure out you know what's happening in this revolution and how can i
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:59.280]   be a part of it one of the things that i have thought that i can help be a part of is by supporting
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:05.600]   black-owned businesses and in my local area so when i came across okra eat okra i was really happy
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:10.800]   to see that not only it's like in sacramento there's not very many businesses on this app
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:18.320]   but businesses can put themselves in there so if you go to the eat okra.com website you can
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:24.400]   you can submit your business for their app they they want this they want more and more people
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:30.880]   to participate in this to make it a better app experience but you know i looked up the bay area
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:35.280]   and there's there's dozens and dozens and dozens of restaurants in the bay area just my
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:39.840]   Sacramento area doesn't have that much yeah peddle in it as either which is such a disappointment to me
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:46.480]   but that but that just means that that businesses have not yet discovered this so you can kind of
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:50.960]   reach out to your favorite black-owned businesses and let them know you know there's this thing
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:56.240]   called eat okra if you want to be a part of it they actually are in the middle of a crowd funding
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:06.240]   campaign because just since June 4th or between May 30th and June 4th something like that
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:12.640]   they increase their app downloads by like 4000 percent and they just they just don't have the
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:19.120]   manpower to like do what what's expected of them so they're now actually trying to raise some money
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:25.360]   to just fund keeping this going and making this is the grow the way we want it to grow so
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:30.880]   there's where you can spend your money you can go big and spend 25,000 on investing in
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:38.160]   in in the eat okra that's eat eat okra did i get that backwards no eat okra is right so they'll
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:42.960]   take a smaller amount by the way you don't have to spend twenty five yeah in fact you can even
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:48.560]   for the for the crowd funding you can you can donate twenty five dollars and then have your
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:53.840]   favorites locally owned or not even locally owned your favorite black owned restaurant
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:59.840]   featured within that area so it's kind of a nice little way to give back to your community
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:04.960]   you know the restaurants that you that you go to that you love that are black owned you can say
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:09.760]   hey you know i want south to be featured and then for seven days it'll be featured in the app
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:16.400]   when you go to that location so so yeah but eat okra just down more than ever now more than ever
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:23.440]   because as you know during quarantine restaurants are really going out of business fast and yes
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:31.360]   to your point to your point if it is in a restaurant that also supports food delivery services
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:36.080]   it shows you right there which ones they are so you can find out whether or not you know
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:42.160]   door dash or postmates or caviar whether or not that is actually part of their their process
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:46.640]   of ordering food so you can find out right from within the app that kind of stuff so it's actually
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:52.000]   a really well designed put together app it just needs a little bit more attention it needs
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:57.760]   some more people reaching out to local businesses and asking them to submit their restaurants which
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:02.240]   i think this the crowdfunding campaign that they're working on i think will help grow that
[01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:07.200]   business they just need the business to be bigger so anywhere you can eat including bakeries cafes
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:15.200]   food trucks bars and of course black owned restaurants i wish we had some here i have a feeling we don't
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:20.800]   i mean that can't be i'll have to look around that is that is most likely not true you just got to
[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:24.960]   find out where they are locally in your area yeah i'm getting hungry now
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:32.480]   same i want some soul food let's do it let's eat some okra thank you good good pick laurie and

[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:43.120]   great to have you here are you triggering this weekend yes um we are we've been triggering every
[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:50.080]   weekend the last weekend we actually went all out we did um ribs we did pork ribs um uh shrimp
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:01:00.000]   and jerk chicken i just got a recipe for queso from the meat church and waxa hatchet
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:06.960]   what what are you laughing at the meat churches where i worship my friends is where i worship i'm
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:11.760]   saying that i haven't been to mass in a while but oh boy i'd be the i'd be the every single
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:17.040]   whole day of obligation at the meat church for me uh they uh they have a queso recipe you make in
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:23.360]   your trigger you smoke it up it does involve velveeta and cream of mushroom soup in the can
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:30.160]   i'm not going to hold that against it it sure looks delicious you know what i make a mean queso
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:36.080]   and i promise you it's because it's velveeta i am not kidding no i know it makes the best queso
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:41.520]   yeah well does it like jake was it kenji alt low pack i can't i can't remember alt low
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:45.840]   pass yes yeah he was showing how there was the ingredients that they put in that cheese make
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:50.000]   other cheese melt better and you can buy the box of that chemical on everyone if you don't want to
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:54.320]   use it but if you don't want to use it oh places of american cheese and that chemical will do more
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:58.160]   than the amount of cheese that you put in it it's a kind of salt i forget what kind of salt it is
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:04.080]   but yeah kind of salt because actually this this recipe calls for smoked gouda in an equal quantity
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:10.560]   the velveeta so he must be using the velveeta to dissolve the smoked gouda to make it melt better
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:14.400]   yeah but again like they show that you can just order a box off amazon and then put a table a
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:18.960]   tablespoon or something in for the amount of cheese you want to he does that for grilled cheese too
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:22.800]   and it makes the grilled it makes all the cheeses melt better it's amazing can i get some velveeta
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:27.440]   i've been eschewing it my whole life saying it's not or american cheese has a product
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:37.600]   yeah too fancy for the aerosol cheese yes i am but look at this case though it i mean man i
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:42.880]   guess what i'm making this weekend thank you for showing me in the trigger it'll have that nice
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:50.720]   smokey flavor so yummy yummy yum it's sodium citrate sodium citrate but you probably yeah buy that by
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:57.280]   the jar of course yeah it's probably cheap um i'm going to be doing i think a pork shoulder
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:04.080]   going to do a little pulled pork they say pork but it's the easiest but uh might you know all the
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:08.480]   same to the pig i made a i made a i thought it was quite a good brisket but it was a little over
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:14.000]   cooked and that's because of the the stall i got the meat stall so i gotta i gotta work on that
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:18.480]   can i since since we're talking about barbecue can i tell you about an experience i had at the
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:25.520]   store this weekend yes i finally there's a display of like your basic like barbecue themed display like
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:36.240]   like wood panel of this end cap of like barbecue barbecue meat in like shelf stable cans where it's
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:44.560]   like like shredded pork like jerk chicken like steak like chips and it's like oh my god this is
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:49.600]   the greatest thing ever i pulled down a can just to check out like more details and after a
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:54.480]   close examination i stress close examination it's dog food
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:04:04.320]   so disappointed or like tempted in my life well i mean i bet it can't kill me
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:13.840]   but like oh i like i mean i mean i had this these dreams of like i can buy pulled pork like at the
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:19.520]   at the at the market nearby but that means that i have to plan like one to one day to a week in advance
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:24.000]   of when i'm going to enjoy pulled pork but the idea of like saying man i don't feel like cooking
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.560]   but i really want like a barbecue oh wait a minute i have that shelf stable can it's not going to be
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:33.840]   great but it's still going to be pulled pork but it's dog food i've i've i'm disappointed
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:43.600]   that is disappointing i think i see i see you and he is the kind of guy who in his obituary they could
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:51.680]   say something like he spent his entire life seeking to perfect meat in a can and i just see that i
[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:58.240]   was i know i would be i would not be unhappy if they said he was like a barbecue diogenes wandering
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:04.640]   the streets for the lantern looking for cost effective and simple ways to acquire barbecue on
[02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:09.760]   demand but then the constraints of his busy life as an internationally tolerated journalist
[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:16.400]   sounds good to me sounds good to me thank you all three of you it's really great to get together
