[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.800]   And I woke up this morning and the Apple store was down.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.600]   So I figure there's some news from Apple.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.500]   Hey, Jeff.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.800]   Jesse Sneltake in the week off doc rock is here.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.020]   The rock that was so I was so good to sit on a tweet and be like Apple introduced a new
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.400]   product before Leopress record.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.660]   See people you change.
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.580]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.940]   Thank you.
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.940]   Thank you.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.240]   Also with Mr. Andy and I co from WGBH in Boston.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.160]   Hello, Andrew it's nice to be clear.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:26.000]   I'm disappointed but I'll tell you why in a second also Alex Lindsay from 090.media and
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.400]   office hours.global.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.720]   Were you interrupted in the midst of office hours?
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.720]   We did.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.400]   Someone mentioned the first thing like the stores down and then we just kept everyone.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.920]   I think everybody had their window open kept on refreshing and then about I think it was
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.920]   about 815.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.520]   We were in the middle of some other conversation.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.640]   We were like okay we have to stop and talk about what just happened here and we talked
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.160]   about a little bit and then we went back to what we were doing.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.840]   I was looking at the date stamp on Apple's press release and it was 8 a.m.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.320]   Pacific time.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.320]   So you nailed it.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.800]   Before we get into this it's new iPads.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.880]   It's everything we knew.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.640]   In fact Mark Herman yesterday said it's going to be tomorrow.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.040]   New iPads they also said that iPad OS and Mac OS Ventura will come out a week from yesterday.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.040]   So the 24th we kind of thought that as well.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.480]   I guess Mark was right no event but where the hell's the laptops?
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.400]   That's all I want to know.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.400]   You know why?
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.640]   Because I spilled some coffee in my mouth.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.640]   I knew that.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.520]   I wasn't sure if that.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.680]   I brought it into the guy and he smelled it smells like coffee.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.200]   I said yeah I spilled coffee and he said dude usually when it still smells like coffee after
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.040]   we've dried it and cleaned it and let it sit for three days.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.200]   It's what we call a tier four.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.680]   Tier four he said you're going to shed at least four tiers when I tell you $1300 without
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.880]   AppleCare to fix it.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.000]   This is the last year M1.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Is that why we were talking about rice before the show?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Okay.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   You can buy that 10 pound sack.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.400]   They're going to pump sack of basmati of the story.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.200]   Little hit here though.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.160]   Do it with uncooked rice.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.160]   Not good rice.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.160]   There you go.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.160]   I'm just saying.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.280]   I wonder if that high level Koshihikati like straightforward.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.280]   Highly rice.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.560]   It dries out your products better because it tastes better.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.560]   But whatever it dries out the band.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.000]   I am wasting that good rice.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.400]   I ain't wasting that good rice on a drying out of Mac.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.960]   The guy really said dude it's not worth fixing.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.520]   I said yeah.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.760]   That's what happened to you right Andy?
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.040]   Yeah yeah.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.680]   In my case it was in my case it was actually was died Dr. Pepper and I just fell asleep
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.360]   in a hotel room while trying to get my glass of my mail done and I had the glass in my
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.560]   hand and I was in bed and I fell asleep and just fell in fell over.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.520]   And but the good lord quote was looking out for me because there was an Apple store like
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.040]   right across like the parking lot and I did have to deliver keynote at 10 a.m. that day.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   Yikes.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.040]   Okay.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.080]   I'm about to spend I'm about to spend about $2,000 to make sure that I can still deliver
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.080]   that keynote.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.080]   Oh well.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.280]   So you also probably were faced with a four tier.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.880]   A life like life.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.520]   So and I was really hoping that maybe Apple would announce some new laptops.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.520]   Do you think they will announce them next week or is perhaps this not the year for the
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.920]   Macbook Pro?
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:39.840]   I think the Macbook Pro and the mini will still show some you know face right before the old
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.320]   Christmas shopping cycle.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:47.160]   As we know keeps getting moved back but I'm thinking like you know end of the month 29th
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.320]   is whatever that Tuesday is before the end of the month or the very first Tuesday in November.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.280]   I think they still have room to drop a new mini and smaller notebooks.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.920]   You've got they must have them unless there's some sort of supply chain issue or there's
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.920]   a big redesign.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.520]   I mean I don't think with the Mac mini there'd be a redesign.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.200]   I think it would typically be a chip upgrade for that.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.440]   Would they upgrade the studio or no?
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.440]   No, not yet.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.440]   Not yet.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.440]   That's possible.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.140]   No one piss off all of us.
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.140]   Yeah.
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.640]   Well the studio was a year ago, right?
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.640]   No.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.640]   In that case it was months.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.640]   This year.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.360]   Yeah, spring was April or May.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.140]   I think I got mine April 24.
[00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.140]   Okay.
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.880]   Apparently I have some gene in me that makes me want to throw money at Apple for no apparent
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.880]   reason.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.480]   But I need a new laptop.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:42.560]   So now the question begs the question should I just get what's out there now because I
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.560]   kind of need it.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.560]   I don't have a laptop.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.320]   Well how often do you do questions?
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.240]   The question is how every morning at breakfast that's why I spilled coffee and I'm not by
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.000]   the way I should stop doing this but I have the laptop there and I'm having my coffee.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.540]   I put it down and then for some reason I whacked it.
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.500]   And I guess when you're doing the coffee thing are you doing email or are you doing
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.500]   email?
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.500]   No, as you probably noticed I don't do email.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.140]   I'm preparing for shows.
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.300]   I'm going through the news pretty much every time I have my laptop open and this is day,
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.180]   morning, noon and night.
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.020]   Going through my news feeds looking for stories for this fine program and others.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.020]   Right.
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.300]   No, no, I'm just curious because I do the same similar thing but I just do it on my
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.300]   phone.
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.300]   On your phone.
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.700]   I'm just going through news or other things like that.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.820]   You know why I have to do it on a laptop is I need to really bookmark it.
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.860]   I need an easy way.
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:42.180]   So I use we have a whole workflow with Zapier and Pin which is a sponsor and Pinboard where
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:48.820]   I will pinboard it and I'll copy the salient content, the paragraph, pinboard it with that
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.020]   in there and it goes into a script that does all sorts of stuff.
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.420]   But I guess if I were just reading news that probably the last number maybe the iPad actually
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.820]   would even be better.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.820]   Speaking of iPad.
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.660]   You could do that on iPad.
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.460]   But you know if you're really forced to buy a notebook I never thought I would say this
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.940]   and I can't believe I'm going to say this on live internet TV.
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.020]   My MacBook Air is amazing and I never wanted one.
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.180]   I always thought it doesn't match me because I'm an editor.
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.180]   So I need like this.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.180]   Pi and end.
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.180]   Yeah.
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:26.540]   This into baby right here has been my favorite notebook ever and I might have gone psycho
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.100]   and you know filled it up.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.580]   So it's it's twenty twenty five hundred dollars.
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.580]   Yep.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.580]   I know.
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.580]   Well yeah.
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.580]   I know.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.580]   You know how I know because I had it.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.780]   I bought it yesterday and then I for OK about it and then I thought oh I shouldn't have
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:41.780]   the midnight blue.
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.580]   That's the fingerprint magnet version.
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.100]   But then I canceled it this morning.
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.780]   I said no what am I crazy?
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.940]   Never buy a laptop the week before there's possibly no laptops.
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.460]   But maybe I don't need.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.460]   Maybe I don't.
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.460]   You need the editing specs.
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.260]   So like I bought mine just the test of editing spec or streaming spec would work.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.260]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.260]   And you don't need it.
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.540]   So like I love it and it does work.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.500]   It does edit and as a matter of fact I don't tell if you should do this but it actually
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.500]   worked for streaming.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.780]   I did it on the road the last two months.
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:17.060]   But after using this on the road for two months and not having to buy the editing version
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:22.940]   I think that the M2 MacBook Air was suffice for almost majority of the Mac users out there.
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.300]   It's only those of us that are brainwashed into believing we need a pro and that was me
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.900]   until I took this test and I'm like I've been spending too much on laptops for years because
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.380]   I have a Mac studio.
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.380]   Yeah.
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:39.900]   And I guess I most of the time when I go out now I got my iPad and I really just don't
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.340]   up my laptop that much.
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.460]   If I have to do work then I open it up.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.780]   But I've got little Mac minis everywhere.
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.700]   I have Mac mini at the office, I'm Mac mini at the house and I'm kind of like they have
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.380]   a monitor and I can sit down and I just don't go to a lot of places.
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.460]   So if I'm going it's fine.
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:59.320]   You're not alone Doc because the number one Apple says it the number one selling Mac
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.540]   is the MacBook Air.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:07.060]   And Micah got the midnight blue M2 and he loves it.
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.580]   He said in fact I don't think I'm misquoting you Micah.
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.780]   It's the best laptop he's ever had.
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.620]   Me too.
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.620]   I can't believe I said it.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.620]   I can't believe I said it.
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.420]   Does the color make it faster?
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:25.260]   No, I got silver because fingerprints and beards beard you got to put oil to make it
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.180]   dope and then you touch anything it's going to be fingerprint.
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.180]   So I'm like I am as much as I wanted it.
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.180]   I was like nope.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.420]   I wanted it and I canceled it.
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.420]   Yeah.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.420]   And I think I'd probably get it.
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.260]   If they made it the same color as this purple phone though trust you me that sucker would
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.060]   have been in a box.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.860]   Okay.
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:48.620]   So all of this sounds like it's very self-indulgent but what I'm really wanting to know is are
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.380]   we not going to.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:54.660]   Is it odd that Apple announced the iPads today and didn't announce anything else?
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.660]   Don't they have?
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.500]   I just think there's new form factors coming and I think that's the issue.
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.500]   It's delaying it.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.100]   No, I will come start good.
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.100]   Well I'm serious.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.300]   I don't know.
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.380]   I don't see I don't know but you notice that these if they're going to be doing stuff
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:14.220]   that's just a non-event just an announcement and a 10 minute like mini event video they
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.700]   post to YouTube.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.900]   They're going to want to make sure that they're all talking about the same message.
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.220]   So this was all iPad some new stuff.
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.780]   Here's a new feature for the Apple pencil.
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.660]   Here's a new hover mode for the pencil that doesn't didn't exist before.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.260]   Here's a new magic keyboard folio with the detachable keyboard.
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.500]   Now the folio has function keys.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:37.020]   I think it makes kind of more sense particularly since Ventura is still indefinite date of release
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:43.540]   to hold off on the Mac OS stuff and make that another another non event 10 minute video
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.100]   release so that you're basically bunching all the news together like it get like as
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.980]   part of like so I don't I don't think this says anything anything worrying worrying some
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:57.700]   about a Mac mini or a new MacBook to me and I said this before.
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:04.420]   It's the difference between the air slowly leaking out of a balloon in a sad sad and a
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:12.140]   big explosion if I honestly do not understand why Apple would bypass the opportunity to have
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.700]   an event that gets a lot of attention.
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:20.660]   This is of you know what I bet you a lot of people not the people listen to this show
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.580]   but a lot of people normal people don't even know that this stuff came out there by the
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.780]   way do you know there's a new Apple TV.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.860]   What a great way to just throw it away right.
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.220]   Well but then again look people are on different cycles for buying phones.
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.660]   Every single year there's a group of people that are looking at buying a new phone not
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.340]   necessarily people who bought a new phone last year but every single cycle they know
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.780]   that they've got to make a they got to let people know here's what the new phone is maybe
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.940]   this is the year you should you should actually go forward on that.
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:51.740]   I know you thought about it last year but definitely do it this year whereas an iPad
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:56.740]   and definitely a Mac is more of a thoughtful purchase I think most people for it's you
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:01.580]   interact with a with a desktop computer or laptop a lot differently than a phone.
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:06.260]   It's a lot harder to notice that oh you know what this is pretty slow.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.100]   Oh you know what that screen is kind of like grubby and cracked right now.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.660]   It's I think that you you definitely want to have the dogs and the ponies out for the
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:19.180]   for the phone show you definitely want it out for the for the earbuds which are an affordable
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.860]   sort of thing definitely for the watch which also are really really affordable compared
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:26.700]   to everything else for the Macs though you don't know when they're going to come out you
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.620]   can you don't necessarily need to have the dogs and ponies out here.
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:35.940]   They did make a video you can see it on Apple.com or on their on their YouTube and on YouTube
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.180]   five hundred and seventy nine thousand people looked at it last three and a half hours.
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.180]   Okay.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.180]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.180]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.180]   And we're looking at the production value of that while it's a while it's they didn't
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:50.780]   do an event this video cost at least as much as most people's events.
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:55.860]   You know like just the video so so we don't want to underestimate what makes it so good.
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.900]   Well I mean everything.
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:03.820]   So I mean just remember that every time you see a close up of somebody you know and the
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.540]   scanning across the top of something you know just assume that that's twenty five thousand
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:08.540]   dollars.
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:12.380]   You know twenty five fifty thousand dollars because it's because the thing is is that
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.260]   that they're going to set that whole stage up they're going to probably they probably
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.580]   have one set that looks like a house.
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:18.580]   Yeah.
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.460]   When they want to do it they're going to get one or two of those shots a day.
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.460]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.300]   They're going to have a big old crew of twenty five or thirty people moving on.
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.500]   Set up for the next shot yeah but like you know like some of these like the ones who
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.660]   want to cross the keyboard or probably motion control camera or or Trinity rig.
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:38.460]   And so these are all things that that are you know complicated you know things to do.
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.020]   And and then there's computer graphics.
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.820]   So let's show you this one.
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.020]   This is what you're talking about is let's show this.
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.860]   That's a motion controlled shot you can see.
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.420]   That might it could be motion control it could be it that could be also just a steady cam
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.660]   you know moving around.
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.660]   Got it.
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.660]   But that's a motion controller.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.860]   How smoothly that's they can be done with a Trinity rig underslung.
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.260]   You know so those are the kind of things but like that that's probably a probably a little
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.660]   you see there's even a little dog in the in the in the camera lens.
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.660]   Yeah.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:14.500]   I mean yeah there's there's some effort going into this not to mention the cost of the manicure.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.940]   So I was going to see that just out of manicures manicures is all points right.
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.700]   You got to give me a leak yeah.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.420]   And even though she's pretending to be in her.
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.140]   Shall I somewhere I think this is all a fake.
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.580]   This is a couple months.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.100]   This is yeah and this is a couple months of of of planning and storyboards and people
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.100]   and things.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.540]   I mean you know there's nothing accidental about any of this and the level that Apple
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:42.260]   works at is probably you know it's solid million dollars couple million dollars to put this
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.260]   together.
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.260]   That's nothing to them.
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.780]   No it's it's not but I'm just saying that most people I do a lot of events.
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.940]   Most people would say it's a million and a half or two million dollars for your event.
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.660]   They go that's a lot of money.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:57.720]   So anyway so instead of doing the event they they made this video and the video probably
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.740]   describes it as well as the event would.
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:04.340]   You know and I will grant you that this is the perfect ad for it.
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:09.700]   It's only it's only 19 minutes long or I'm sorry nine minutes long and I'm in and they
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.900]   got 600,000 views.
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.140]   You know they didn't mention the Apple TV in it though and I fact I don't even see a
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.900]   there's if I were in the Apple TV division I would just feel like I was a slapped silly
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.900]   with a drought.
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.740]   But what what's what was in the announcement that is in any way interesting or exciting
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:32.180]   and also it's it's Apple if there's any opportunity for them to produce a really really big live
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:37.660]   event is at the time when they create a new Apple TV that really says here is triumphantly
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:42.460]   and convincingly why you should give us a hundred and fifty dollars for our Apple TV instead
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:48.900]   of fifty dollars for a dongle or a small box that will do really most of what most people
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.260]   want that won't want streaming box to do.
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:56.220]   I mean streaming boxes are so anonymous that you really have to say here is brand new content
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.780]   we've created that takes advantage of HDR that takes advantage of 120 frames per second
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:06.060]   that takes advantage of the 4k in way in ways that you're $40 or $20 ball marked dongle
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.020]   absolutely can't even touch and here's why you would want to have it.
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.500]   So that's that's a difficult.
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:19.700]   It is an important point though that then there is a now $129 Apple TV 4k so that that
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:26.100]   is so the Apple TV is has always been great and we love it but it's always been way over
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:32.180]   priced compared to a Roku it's still twice what a Roku would cost but that's a big deal
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:36.580]   that they offer that that one does not have ethernet which is kind of a non starter for
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:41.020]   a lot of people that you're gonna have to pay for the Wi-Fi plus ethernet pay a little
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:46.900]   bit more they put an a 15 bionic in it that's a that's a very high end I don't even know
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:54.940]   why they need such a high-end ship but that's and gigabit ethernet that's great thank you.
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:18:00.740]   It seems like this is kind of overpowered but you're saying Andy who cares oh well only
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:05.980]   that I think that I think that most people are they're not they're not buying hype they're
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:11.100]   not they're not shopping for a high-performance streaming box they're shopping for I want YouTube
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:16.380]   on my TV I want Hulu and Disney+ on my TV this $50 thing from Google gives me Hulu on
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:22.660]   my TV great here's $50 give me the 4k thing it's it's when Apple I mean we can appreciate
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.640]   that wow that's that's a really high-powered chip for what for what this is delivering
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.360]   right now I wonder if this is indicative of a future plan of in the next two or three
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:36.160]   years that ties into more more more fitness apps more relatable game gaming apps more VR
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:41.480]   etc etc most of the people I think they really have to be told here is why this is this is
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:46.160]   $130 versus $50 so this is why it's always been a little bit of a bit of a mystery to
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:52.160]   me when Apple's gonna drop that other shoe and say this is why this is an expensive box
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:58.440]   I mean they I again in the other room I do have a $150 streaming box but it is capable
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.640]   of acting as its own media server it can run a web browser it can run all kinds of apps
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:08.240]   it's a it's a gaming platform it does all these things which kind of justifies it being
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:14.600]   a $150 or $200 box I don't think that Apple has successfully made that argument to people
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:21.000]   that here is beyond beyond having the ease of use that comes with having another Apple
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.520]   box on your network filled with other Apple boxes here is why you'd want to spend an extra
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:30.640]   $100 to $150 on our product as opposed to other products and I can I can just say as
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.920]   someone who streams to all those boxes that the Apple TV is a lot better than the other
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:40.560]   ones yeah I was there but is there such trash but in the store you don't know from a live
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.520]   stream from a live stream perspective they are the all the other boxes are just trash
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:50.600]   you know and so 100% so the so the Apple TV is just so much easier all the Apple products
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.480]   are so much easier for us to develop for so if we want to shoot so if we want to send
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:00.480]   a live stream with HDR and atmos and and you know high quality video and you know really
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.440]   you know all of those things the only thing like I'm about to start doing office hours
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.400]   actually we're going to be testing at most envision in 4k and and I've made it clear
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.280]   to everybody there that I'm not going to try to do anything else with Android or Windows
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:17.680]   because they're until they get their stuff together like I'm not going to play because
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.040]   it's just a disaster it's a wasteland and so from a live streaming perspective and for
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.920]   for most people it doesn't matter if they're and when I say live streaming I'm not talking
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.200]   about there's live streaming which is what I do there's streaming which is Apple TV and
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.040]   Netflix and those are all pretty much the same so they play back videos that aren't live
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:39.880]   but when you start talking about how does how does my Thursday night football look it
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:45.480]   will look better on your it it will look better with with better process Amazon was a yeah
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:52.640]   or was it somebody was I think was Amazon was streaming the baseball playoffs and 4k you
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.800]   would really like that on the app but things are but things they'll say things are 4k and
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:01.360]   they'll say that they're HDR but but there is a lot of versions of that that are yeah
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.280]   well that's what's interesting so I think Apple deserve this Apple TV deserve more attention
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.640]   obviously we're giving it more attention we haven't even talked about the iPads we will
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.440]   but I think a big a big price drop is a big story it's still more expensive than the other
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:22.320]   guys but now you can maybe say well 129 bucks 64 gig storage if you want ethernet at $20
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:28.240]   and you'll get double of storage though those are here's significantly less than the old
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:33.240]   Apple TV here's the thing that every time this conversation comes up a cracks me up because
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:40.720]   it doesn't it's gives a major portion okay as a person that's multilingual when I walk
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.400]   into a place where I see a bunch of stuff in Japanese I immediately can recognize that
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.600]   I know what it is as an Apple person I have this computer I have my phone I have my iPad
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:55.080]   I'm not talking about the tech I hear I mean it's a random Apple person when you walk into
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:00.720]   the target or the Walmart or the best buy and you go to look at a streaming device your
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.320]   brain just connects to what you know what you feel and you understand the quality is
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:11.040]   not even a thought the Nvidia Shield is an amazing box they don't sell them at target
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:17.560]   so they don't count those are people that are seeking a gaming platform plus a streaming
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:25.600]   platform plus something that I can run emulators illegally plus that doesn't matter to the
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.320]   normal person that goes in to buy a streaming box that matches the rest of their kit now
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:37.160]   again last portion when I go from a person that ran a TV store for 30 years when I go
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:42.440]   to put this in my in my setup of all other boxes on there the market right now which one
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:48.760]   looks the best style is still a thing and it has to pass the Karen filter mine she's
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:54.840]   Karen she's not one of those me he can't stand careful with a Karen filter no here's this
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.440]   funny is I tell her go by her middle name her middle name's Yoko not any better oh you
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:06.520]   get away here in Yoko wow I just I just I just say I did colors you go did so much for
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.600]   John Lennon Jenner what John Lennon would not have served survived the 70s physically
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:17.160]   or financially without Yoko let's let's make sure this I this I agree like for her to
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.200]   want to put something that's seen in the living room and she's a realtor so everything in
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.520]   the living room has to look a certain way and video she was not getting in my house I
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:30.040]   have one but it's not in the house hiding down here in the studio there yeah yeah yeah
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:36.440]   yeah it can't it cannot live in the living room okay I say so I think doc I think you
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.520]   made the you made exactly the right point I like the fact that people will go into a
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.840]   target and buy the thing that is going to appeal to them that there are people that are
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.320]   not gonna they're gonna look at the hundred fifty dollar Nvidia shields they all I don't
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:54.560]   care if it's like if it's like HD upscaling to 4k I understand two of those words but I
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.520]   do understand is forty nine dollars versus a hundred and seventy nine dollars for this
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.880]   Nvidia shield that they think that and so and I don't deny that there is going to be
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:09.520]   a quality improvement on some content for for the the Apple TV but I will but what I really
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.400]   wish that Apple did was that they said we acknowledge that there are people that are
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.600]   only going to come in really that they have they really have a price in their mind that
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.080]   I don't know why anybody's charging more than fifty sixty dollars for for for a streaming
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:28.040]   box just like even Google they have the their fifty dollar 4k streaming dongle and they recently
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:33.600]   came out with a thirty dollar at just HD only no 4k one because the price is so sensitive
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.000]   so I just wish that people going into the Apple store would have the option of having
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.200]   a more affordable even if it were like fifty dollar fifty sixty dollars even if it were
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:48.880]   a way to stream 4k on an Apple device that has Apple's sensibilities regarding privacy
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.680]   and security Apple's integration with all the other stuff that people are going to have
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.480]   in their house that burns with Apple I just wish that there was an option for people who
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:02.400]   are that who do have that kind of price sensitivity and I just wonder why Apple doesn't doesn't
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.600]   go for that I'm surprised they even have two skis look at like one point one forty nine
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.560]   like I you know I don't like the one twenty nine I would never get because it's got doesn't
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:16.160]   have an ethernet cable like it's like it's like a lot of people I only I don't I know
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:21.160]   that's crazy just also the bit I'm sorry do you need the more RAM or is that just well
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.600]   you get any three hundred twenty bucks the storage mean storage mean storage gaming right
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.200]   more than anything else also more apps I mean people people I really wish there was more
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.280]   attention paid to how much how valuable it is to have even if you know even if you're
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.160]   not done letting huge games I'm saying that on some of the dongles I've tested out it's
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:43.040]   like you've got your four that you absolutely need and then maybe there's this one extra
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.520]   streaming service that you only use for new breaking news but there's not enough room
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:50.240]   for it and you have to start to choose so yeah I think that having more storage is a
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:54.920]   really big big feature and what happens is is that if you have if you're on Wi-Fi and
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:59.640]   your Wi-Fi has any your AP has any trouble what happens is is the Apple TV goes oh you
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.920]   can't handle this bandwidth and it'll just drop down to the next it'll go into the manifest
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:08.840]   and go they can't handle the highest quality video so let's go down to one and then it'll
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.080]   go down to that and a lot of times once it goes down once it stays there you know because
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.720]   it's not because it doesn't want to see have you see it glitch so so Wi-Fi is something
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.520]   you know you shouldn't watch you shouldn't want stuff with Wi-Fi because it's because
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.680]   of what it does is it jumps down it jumps down to a lower quality and almost all of them
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.840]   once they jump down for your show until you leave the until you leave the show and come
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.760]   back to it they're not they're not going to keep on trying to play with it because that
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:38.400]   the changing of the quality people notice more than the actual quality so so it will
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.480]   it's making a decision about that and very quickly you'll notice when you get on a lot
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.760]   of streaming stuff it's pretty rough for the first couple seconds because it's going to
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.720]   give you something that'll pop up and then what it's doing is it's it's looking at how
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.320]   long does it take to get to your device and how you know how much work did your device
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.840]   have to do and then goes okay they can go to this but as soon as it has a glitch in that
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:04.760]   top tier which may come from your Wi-Fi AP it'll it'll dump down to a lower tier and
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.920]   that's sometimes why you see more macro blocking sometimes why you see low resolution is because
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:14.600]   you had a problem with your AP and Ethernet oftentimes will get you past you know a lot
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:20.920]   of those issues the added storage is for games there's also things that could be done with
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:26.600]   the Apple TV that maybe not aren't used right now that that more more storage would be
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:32.760]   useful successfully overpowered yeah it also supports now and you can explain why this
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:41.480]   is important to me Alex HDR 10 plus yeah so HDR 10 plus is basically the I the companies
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.440]   that Samsung and others that don't want to pay for Dolby vision they don't want to pay
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:49.040]   the license so so HDR 10 is I don't want to pay for Dolby vision but otherwise it's
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:56.520]   pretty close to Dolby visions the best okay and that's what the plus offers is Dolby
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:02.280]   vision take the HDR and a lot of streaming services is Dolby vision you have you have
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:06.760]   three basic ways of managing the HDR you have HLG which is just kind of like we don't
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:11.240]   have to manage anything it's not very great it's not great but it's okay and everything
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:16.040]   can use it because it doesn't have any metadata so the HLG is always the same and it's just
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:22.840]   kind of the vanilla you know HDR then you have HDR 10 and what that does is it sets certain
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:27.520]   metadata that says this is the brightest point and this is the midpoint of this piece of
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:33.040]   work and then it also sets trims for the red green and blue that allow that to be managed
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.120]   but that's for the entire movie that you're watching what HDR 10 does as well as Dolby
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:44.840]   vision is HDR 10 sets that that max CLL and max fill as well as the trims it sets those
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.880]   per frame or per it's per scene but really per frame so so that it can do that at every
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.680]   scene that way it can adjust to whatever if you're going indoor outdoor everything is
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:29:02.040]   managed at every scene Dolby vision has additional features an additional dynamic range that's
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:07.480]   out there that most consumers wouldn't necessarily notice but I wouldn't buy a TV without I would
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:12.520]   buy a TV that had both HDR 10 as well as Dolby vision what Apple is is acknowledging is that
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:18.600]   Sony and Samsung and others make TVs that don't have Dolby vision to pay for it yeah and they
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.520]   want to HDR 10 so it supports HDR 10 now which is just basically saying it's going to read
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:28.760]   all that metadata and hand it back frame by frame yeah TV TV streaming is just so I can't
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:33.800]   think of the category that's so ecumenical where there are people that I absolutely don't care
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.920]   about anything except for the content I don't care about the quality I got a 12 year old TV that
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:43.800]   still works and that's fine with me and then there are people that are like I really do a
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.240]   pre I watch movies on this thing I watch sports on this thing and if you just if you just give
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:51.320]   me a hint that I can get better quality by spending another hundred dollars on a
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.640]   on a streaming box or another thousand dollars on a screen I will absolutely do that and there's
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:02.440]   every step in between I've got a 4K HDR TV it's six seven years old it is it is I will I will
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:08.440]   I will admit that I've committed the sin of placing a nice TV next to a window all right it's the
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.280]   best place for it to have all have all my friends like be able to see the same thing around my
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:18.360]   sectional sofa and it's this is why it's so great to have these conversations because there are
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.440]   things that are going to be critical for some people absolutely not even an issue for other
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:27.240]   people and everybody really needs to be addressed in some ways are we're going to take a little
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:33.080]   break when we come back we'll talk about the iPads and the chat room has noticed something
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:42.680]   that's missing from the Apple TV and the iPads a big change but that's just a tease because that's
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:47.720]   coming up next our show today brought I'm so glad you're here Doc Rock filling in for Jason Snell
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:53.880]   good to have you great to have Andy Inako Alex Lindsey we got the experts in house to tell you
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.840]   what you should do to tell me what I should do but first I want to tell you what a great
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:07.000]   night's sleep I had last night thank you to my eight sleep I love my eight sleep I've got the pod
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.760]   to pro cover now if they have the pod three I love eight sleep so much I'm thinking I'm
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:20.440]   upgrading although my pod two is is really really good what does the eight sleep do it is a mattress
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:26.200]   or in our case with a cover the cover on your existing mattress that both heats and cools your
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:32.600]   bed that's important it doesn't just warm it up it can cool it down because it turns out
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:39.480]   one of the keys to a great night's sleep is sleeping cool one of the reasons more than 30%
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:44.680]   of Americans struggle with sleep is because they're they feel hot at night and it's not just in the
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:49.480]   summertime because in the winter you heat the house you got a lot of blankets you still can get
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:54.040]   overheated so the way I have my eight sleep set and by the way the one of the best things about
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:32:00.360]   the eight sleep is it dynamically cools and heats both sides of the bed so I've got my settings Lisa's
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:05.240]   got hers she gets the optimal sleep temperature setting and I've got mine I like to start the
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:10.920]   night warm I get under the covers at bedtime and it's cozy and comfortable but then it slowly
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:17.080]   drops the temperature imperceptibly and cools it down and that's where your deep sleep hits and
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:22.280]   then in the morning it's kind of my wake-up ritual starts to warm up I know it's time to get up not
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:27.880]   because I've heard an alarm but because I'm starting to get a little warmer and feeling good it's nice
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:34.440]   but that's me you will have your own choices and the wonderful thing about this is the eight
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:40.920]   sleep has biometric tracking as well so it will watch your sleep and adjust accordingly
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:47.160]   that's really nice they call it the sleep doctor dynamic cooling and heating with biometric
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:54.840]   tracking you can add the pod cover to any mattress it goes as cool as 55 degrees as hot as 110 degrees
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:33:00.360]   or anywhere in between and it's very gradual ramp up and down clinical data shows eight sleep
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:08.600]   users experience up to 19 percent increase in recovery up to 32 percent improve sleep quality
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:13.400]   up to 34 percent more deep sleep I'll tell you what 34 percent more deep sleep
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:19.800]   that's all that's life that's the best thing that ever happened to you I mean it can help with all
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:24.760]   sorts of health issues decrease the risk of heart disease lower blood pressure reduce the risk of
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:31.000]   Alzheimer's I mean there's so much evidence that a good night's sleep is critical to long-term health
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.280]   and I tell you when I get that extra half hour of deep sleep holy cow I just feel so great the next
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:43.320]   day I'm confident my mind and body are moving through the restorative sleep stages that are vital
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:49.480]   for physical recovery hormone regulation mental clarity the new pod three we got the pod two as I
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:54.120]   said but the new pod three has doubled the amount of sensors so it's even more accurate sleep and
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:59.960]   health tracking delivering you the best sleep experience on earth Kevin Rose told me about this
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.840]   I admit I was a little skeptical uh Amy Webb was on the show these are the two of the smartest
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:09.880]   people I know Amy Webb was on the show she said oh and she got it now both of them are saying oh
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:14.520]   Leo you got to get this so I find we got it last spring so I've been through a kind of a cool
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:20.840]   spring hot summer and now cooler winter nights with it and I could tell you it's not magic but it

[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.720]   so important when you use that address that's how they say it was at working eight sleep dot
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:09.240]   com slash mac break thank you um so the chat room pointed this out I haven't checked it yet they say
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:19.400]   the new apple tv remote type c charging hmm hooray none of the new ipads have lightning type c
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.560]   charging I think I think I think I think the three hundred I think the three twenty nine dollar one
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:29.400]   still has it the decimal ones oh I have to double check I'll check the newsroom you know apple it's
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:34.120]   funny it it buries that information I've been trying to find it they don't want to make a big
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:43.000]   deal about it obviously so let's talk about these ipads here and by the way all of this is exactly
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.120]   as rumored right with your were there any surprise that maybe that hover thing is a surprise we didn't
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:52.200]   know her was new yeah I haven't heard about that and that and that seems like I can't wait to get
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.160]   my hands on that the idea that if you now if it's if the sensors are good enough that if you just
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:03.320]   hover the pencil over the screen it will show you the target below it so it's kind it's kind of
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:08.120]   it's got it's like 3d touch but the opposite direction from the screen and for art apps they
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:12.920]   just just know where you're about to play it to plunk down your your pointer is just a big big deal
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:18.680]   I think that scribble sensing it is a huge one to me yeah I think that the other thing that
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:23.560]   potentially could happen there is spray painting so oh now you're not touching the surface you can
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:29.320]   go over it and and lay layers of spray paint which has been something that you can do with
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:33.960]   uh wackum the high end wackum tablets and so on so forth is not actually touching the surface so
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:38.120]   it'll be really interesting for read photo retouching as well yeah that's a good point you can see
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:44.840]   what you're doing to the lights and the shadows while you're doing it yeah so for vibrant colors
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:51.320]   uh and they are vibrant frankly except for this silver uh there it's very they're very they're
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:57.160]   looked like uh the the iphone c remember they really are very colorful yeah they're very
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.480]   personal i'm glad to see the gray one looks more clearly
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:06.760]   they keep they keep breaking new ground on new ways to have words for describe the word gray
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:13.000]   and this is a redesign right the uh squared off uh yeah case is kind of more like the ipad prose
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:20.680]   from last year so that's uh all pig all pixel screen two which is good or you know it's all glass
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:25.800]   so the buttons on the top instead of being in the bottom more than that the camera is on the top
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:31.000]   instead of being on the side what a big difference you know i might have to get my mom this because
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.680]   she's always looking in the wrong place putting her thumb on the side yep yep uh put it on the top
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:43.080]   now makes it more like a laptop which is very smart ultra wide 12 megapixel front camera
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:52.600]   12 megapixel back camera they say updated a usb c support this is on the uh the new ipad
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:58.440]   so it is usb c it's not lightning yeah it supports a wide range of accessories wi-fi
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:06.040]   six i thought it was six e the pro is six e the pro is six e okay yes not that that matters for
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:14.760]   most people but you know it's the first uh ipad with six e i believe um new magic keyboard folio
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:22.200]   it doesn't have that weird uh lift up thing anymore it's just a regular flat kickstand it's got a kickstand
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.920]   which actually i think is probably better because now you're
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:30.440]   lying the keyboard flat on the surface right so it's going to have less give i would think i don't
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:36.360]   know maybe maybe but also also look the row of function keys on the thing that is oh they did
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:41.320]   they did so much to make this like inexpensive like four hundred fifty dollar tablet into
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:45.560]   why would you why on earth we'd even consider buying a windows tablet because this is we're
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.480]   making we're making so many accommodations towards the real world of people who are people who are
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.720]   like man i would love this but it's kind of a close race and oh i just can't deal with lightning
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:58.600]   or oh man i've loved this it's a close race but i really need actual function keys for for
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.480]   for a lot of the uh virtualization that i do this is such a compelling product in so many ways
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:12.600]   it's very exciting um greg joswiex said we're so excited to bring the completely redesigned ipad
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:16.200]   to our most advanced ipad lineup ever why even bother greg
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:22.360]   i still think i still i'm just waiting for like you know this one is as good as the last one but
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:27.240]   yeah we've had we've had some supply issues and you know
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:33.640]   it's it's funny they always get the crap taken out of them for saying that the next one is the
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:39.400]   best one ever because of course it is but i i'm trying to find out why did they do it like what
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.560]   makes it things especially when you know everyone's teasing you because there are always new people
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:47.640]   being brought to the ecosystem always because it's funny until they stop
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:53.800]   well here's the thing that's hilarious it's starting to come up in like the regular comedy
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:58.440]   stuff right so s&l did something and they had a joke recently and they're talking about the ipad
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:02.840]   oh yeah this one the best whatever so like now it's getting down to everybody knows
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:08.440]   yeah i just the nerds are doing it but i think the only thing that i can process is my head is
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:13.240]   they realize there's new people coming to the ecosystem all the time so for them this language
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:18.280]   is new and it makes them feel like they're getting in on something dope but it's funny to us
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:26.120]   is uh the display slightly bigger right it's now 10.9 inch instead of 10.2 so they have reduced
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:30.680]   the bezels it's probably as much as they ever gonna because you still need to hold it somewhere
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:39.000]   yeah uh liquid retina display a 14 bionic first ever landscape front camera usb c
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.520]   i think the usb c is telling i mean then there's no lightning in any of this
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:49.560]   this is the i think the different i think the what the difference between apple silicon and intel
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:54.440]   is to the max the difference between usb c and lightning is to the ipads or really every every
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:58.840]   other product gets if you don't have a usb c port yeah maybe you should hold off another year
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:06.600]   yeah uh i by the way ipad o s 16 which they said will be coming out for all of us with ipads uh well
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:14.360]   all of us with ipad pros and some of us with regular ipads uh on monday your order
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:21.320]   which can be made today for both the new apple tv and the new ipads is uh delivered wednesday
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:29.400]   not tomorrow october 26th not tomorrow i was like don't give me a don't get your hopes up
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:36.440]   are you gonna order this uh doc rock uh no i have my in my in one ipad pro which i absolutely love
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:41.000]   i don't feel and yeah i'm the same way i don't feel any need you know i'm definitely not going
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.520]   to switch to m2 yet because like like a ding dong again this is normal for me when i got the m1 ipad
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:55.480]   pro i filled it so it was 2500 bones but i i you know i one thing i just realized i forgot that i
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:01.640]   ipad 16 wasn't already because i've been on the beta for so long but i literally forgot it didn't
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:06.440]   exist because we have it on the phone right so yeah that's kind of funny to see that announcement
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:12.760]   i'm like what do you mean coming up it's been ipad os we don't have that yet yeah yeah totally
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:19.320]   forgot yeah yeah so it is so good that i literally forgot that i've been using beta and that's a
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:23.480]   that's a good thing for the people who will be upgrading you know come this week or next week
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:29.640]   is that it is really really stable and yes i don't use that state state state on it though
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:34.360]   because it that just makes me you know i will be interested free form is coming out with the ipad
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:38.920]   os i we thought maybe it was going to be delayed so i will be interested to see what you think of
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:43.560]   that i feel like that's there's some stealth thing they're doing there with free form or
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:47.480]   maybe just up here another one of those apps that somebody wrote and they threw it in and then
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:52.520]   now ignore it for the rest of the it's it's life it was it was a it was a nice resharing piece of
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:57.320]   news i have to correct myself i said that the release of date of intro is indeterminate but i
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:02.360]   forgot it's monday's weather that was exactly yeah so yeah so so knowing so knowing that they're not
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:07.480]   they're also i think the announcement also said that yes stage manager will be part of
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:11.960]   of a venture is not like they're going to say oh that's going to be and that's there's a there's a
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:17.480]   technology preview in place and for for for early betas but then you will get the will we will
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:21.480]   deliver the actual product in about a month after that the fact that they're shipping they're
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:27.160]   they're shipping stage manager next monday is good at least they feel so it's stable enough that
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:32.040]   it's not going to break people's heads the if it might break people's heads the new user interface
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:35.320]   but again that's like we talked about last week if they don't want to use it people don't have to
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.000]   use it but it has to you have to put it out there and get people start to hammer on it before they
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.240]   can figure out how to make it even better pricing is a little higher they're still going to offer
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:51.080]   the ninth generation base model for 329 this one kind of more it's not they didn't label it in
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:58.680]   air but it's kind of more air priced 449 if you want cellular 599 that's a bigger bump used to be
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:03.560]   a hundred twenty nine dollar bump right and now it's a hundred fifty dollar bump to get a cellular
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:11.160]   in there maybe that's the 5g tax it'll come in 64 gig and 256 gig configurations nothing in between
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:18.680]   you either get it all or nothing oh by the way apple pencil first generation only right
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:23.960]   so is that a disappointment do we want to use the second generation on this thing I guess that's
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:32.360]   for the pros how do you if it's usbc how do you oh oh you're sure i got to have a cable
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:38.600]   but it has that adapter came with it oh yeah that time you can't plug it in you have to get some
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:45.000]   adapter now to like plug it in a dongle of shame yeah as Dave shop calls it in our
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.400]   cherim a dongle of shame wow most of us lost that little nubbin that came with it like
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:58.520]   eos ago but also and even the apple tv a while back came with a little nubbin that was so somewhere
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:03.400]   around here i have it but i use a second gen pencil so here's the thing that's amazing to me and
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:10.280]   and Alex mentioned this earlier now in ipad game we got a lot of skis like that's unappolic
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:16.040]   there are a metric apple basically three levels but then there's sizes
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:23.000]   full because now we have pro in two sizes we have ipad we have ipad for gin ipad
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.840]   night i mean 10th gen and i will say do we have any more is the air gone yes no it's still there
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:33.720]   that's what i'm saying we have a lot of excuse right now wonder what that's interesting so they
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:38.520]   didn't come here i feel like apple's been doing a lot of skis for a lot of things and it it i will
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:43.720]   say i agreed that with the doc that it's they're getting away from the uh it's getting a jib jobs
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:48.920]   thing yeah and and i it's a some degree i see it in in the sense that there are we use it for
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:53.560]   different things um we definitely we i have a bunch of minis that i use for one thing and mine
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:57.640]   personal ones are the pros and you know if we've used a bunch of things so it's it's
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:05.240]   i kind of get it but it's still the mini was not updated was it uh last year so time yeah but there
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:09.560]   was a rumor that they were going to update the mini i guess not oh you know not this time
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:15.080]   and andy's right like the mini is definitely one of the ipads that is to use an andy word
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:19.960]   ecumenical it is religious everybody that has a mini don't give me nothing i love my
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:27.080]   mini i love my mini and i don't need an upgrade i'm on mini to be honest mini is like the converse
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:32.040]   chuk tailors back in the day chuk tailors for certain people were religion like i don't need
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:37.720]   all of these fancy shoes with these pumpings and straps i just needed chucks yeah and so to me
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:42.920]   the mini is much like chucks and it comes in all those colors and i use my pencil too and i charge
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:50.440]   it on the side of my ipad mini yeah so you're right there's a lot of skews there's the ipad mini from
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:47:02.120]   499 the ipad from 329 the new ipad from 449 the ipad air from 599 and the ipad pro from 799
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:07.240]   too many skews too many i do think they're what's the difference in ipad and ipad air you know
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:12.680]   that's going to confuse people in the stores i think i think the ipad air needs to go i don't i
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:18.120]   i see so many situations which i would say no no just get the regular ipad and max it out don't
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:22.520]   spend the extra money on that or i would say oh you know what for you spend the extra money and
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:26.520]   get the ipad pro even if you have to get like one that doesn't have that much storage on it because
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.680]   you are absolutely going to actually going to adore that thing it's hard to know where the ipad
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:36.840]   air exists you know why pay 150 bucks more for an ipad air i don't understand yeah we said that
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:42.200]   when the regular came out when the knife came out we said that the new one passed the air and that
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:46.920]   was almost a year ago well of course the air has the m1 chip but dirty little secret
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:55.000]   so as the a14 is the m1 chip so i don't i don't know why that's an interesting game apples
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.280]   plan with that i guess maybe the m1 has more cores or something or it's an interesting game
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:07.880]   uh i would say yeah you don't need the air it's got more muted colors it's not as candy colored
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:13.240]   you know but that's that that's also really good indication for the new colorways on the uh
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:18.360]   on the ipad nothing that the that really gives me hope that they really are going to release i
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:23.720]   macbook airs with like like four or five really exciting colors not the four different shades
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:28.920]   of shades of gray but like nope if you want purple we'll give you purple you want you want red but
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:33.080]   you don't want any money going to charity we will sell you red without without giving money to charity
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:37.880]   that's it's it's such a vibe it's such an apple thing to do and i'm amazed that apple isn't doing it
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:42.520]   i put a case on the thing anyway in fact that was one of the saddest points about bringing in my
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:48.760]   macbook pro with a coffee in it is that it was pristine on the outside because i'd have kept it
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:53.240]   in the case you know all the stickers i put on the case none of the well see for me it's like it's
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:58.680]   it's all about the stickers stickers i know but i stick on the case where'd you get a boe nasa sticker
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:04.200]   oh that's the 75 that's the 75th anniversary uh 75th birthday anniversary one i got i got it at
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:10.440]   the david boe pop-up store in soho last year that's why i love stickers in fact that's another thing i'm
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:16.120]   sad i have to retire my sticker collection uh which i thought i would have for a longer time than you
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:22.120]   know nine or ten months or whatever this oh that's that's it's should i buy should i be buying uh
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:28.280]   that was the other thing they said do you have map uh yeah apple care i said no said oh
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:35.480]   yeah i mean should i be buying apple care if i'm gonna spill coffee in my mac i get i don't know i
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:38.520]   don't know if that saves you but i can tell you that i can get apple care with all the apple products
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:43.400]   it's the one i don't do it with anything else i don't buy any of those kind of services but
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:47.160]   i've definitely got my money because you just you get benefit of the doubt all the time like it's
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:53.480]   just like oh yeah i'm gonna have to start doing that i i i don't buy it because like you i have a you
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:59.000]   know i know the history of these upsell warranty extensions is just really terrible it's been so
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.400]   easy when something went wrong i'll bring it in to and it just gets sorted out and really fast and
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:08.360]   it's just been they'll probably get mad at me for confessing this online but what the hell i
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:14.840]   retired a long time ago uh we definitely have a different thought process when you have when
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:20.600]   you're looking at it should i replace this computer or should i fix it if it's under apple care most
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:28.520]   of the genies we will just replace it faster because it's technically a different money source as far
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:35.000]   oh that's it oh so you're speaking as a former genius yes uh that's good i let
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.560]   uh view into the mindset of the genius so the genius looks at it and says do you don't have apple
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:46.120]   care when he's going oh that means yeah you're screwed but if i had apple care but i mean still
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:52.120]   wouldn't i have to pay a lot to get it fixed it's not well most people don't realize this apple care
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:58.280]   is it's the same company but it's a different division so the money is slightly you know what i
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:05.080]   mean so okay here's i tell my people yes i tell my people don't buy your product from best buy or
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:09.400]   target i know it's closer but go to the apple store and they're like why from the apple store is our
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:14.360]   inventory so in the rare situation where you get a limit right so you bought a brand new macbook
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:20.200]   air too and it's just not good we can just hand you another one right out of stock it's our money
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:24.840]   the other stores have to send it for repair because they paid for the inventory that's what he said
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:30.440]   he said we're gonna have to mail it in uh-huh it's there money yeah so you should always win
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:35.480]   possible buy directly from the source because it's we literally will hand you a brand new one
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.920]   and let you walk out the door but the other stores will repair it even if it was a dead or
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:45.640]   the rival type situation damn it and it's so hard like the apple care is harder to connect to it
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:50.280]   it's harder to prove you know when you bought it and everything else it's so easy if you just buy
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:56.520]   it from the apple store i i have bought them from the at and t store from best buy from lots of other
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:01.160]   places and i stopped that a couple years ago because it was just always so much less pain when i
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.600]   anything went wrong or anything need to be managed taken back to the apple store is so much easier
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:13.720]   yeah live and learn 1300 smackers to repair that thing it just doesn't make any sense to spend
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:17.800]   that kind of money right so real quick question before we switch what do you guys think about the
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:22.200]   new style of apple care which i did for my phone which is weird because i'm never going to keep
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:29.320]   it more than a year but the concept of doing in the monthly or the never ending apple care right
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:36.600]   does that lean towards the cleaning up the these devices are disposable mental disposable mentality
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:43.560]   like as long as you keep paying the fit in my case for the uh iPhone 14 pro 13 dollars and 49 cents
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:51.240]   a month uh we will fix it yeah that's for the theft like plus you like that better than the closed
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:56.200]   in apple care i i just don't like stacking up subscriptions so i'd rather just pay for it know
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.960]   that it for the next couple years i don't think about it usually you pay for two years or you get
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:08.040]   it monthly until until you stop it yeah it's a difficult decision i guess so you're saying if i
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:13.160]   get a new laptop i have never spilled coffee in my laptop i've spilled it in the mixer
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:18.760]   what i even spilled coffee in my laptop i once spilled i once spilled uh in the old one the old
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:22.680]   remember the ones that we had batteries on both sides that would slide in yeah i remember it was
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:26.920]   like black but then you have a shot because you could pop the batteries that's what happened is i
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:33.000]   i i i spilled a now gene bottle full one liter full just they just fell down and just emptied itself
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   on my keyboard and the first thing i did is just grab those and batteries and pull them out and then
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:42.360]   i just i i i sat it in a bag of rice like what you normally do not yeah because you got a short
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:47.320]   it once you it's and but there's no way to remove the power from that thing exactly and so and
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:51.720]   and uh i left it there for three or four days first i let it just sit out and then i then i put it in
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:58.520]   some it wasn't bad rice it was actually a desiccant um and um he's a professional folks he is well i
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:04.280]   put it i have i i we have it for equipment so they're like really large balls of of those and you put
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:09.400]   them we used to have the thing to dry them out where we had a it was a plate with holes in it and we
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:14.040]   put the desiccant below it and we put whatever the device was on top of it close it so your advice
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:20.200]   is to both buy apple care and a lot of desiccant you get it in jars and you can put it back in the
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:24.840]   oven and re and re- desiccate it yeah it's for you know supposedly you can do that with a little
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:30.280]   packets too but i've never fresh i the bag of the fresh stuff crystals is probably is the is the
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:33.320]   best thing that i found when i was testing it a while ago what's it called? what's it called?
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:39.000]   fresh stuff crystals kitty kitty litter not the clay stuff but like the crystal stuff that is
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.600]   actually like that's almost the same desiccant material that comes in packets and you buy it for
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:47.720]   like nothing for whatever it is fresh step kitty litter is the same desiccant as you buy the
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:52.360]   the crystals the crystals but it doesn't have any kitty litter in it that's the key is it's all
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:58.040]   clean and not not used not used i'm saying not used i know how desperate you are you get a
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:02.440]   tranet of the perfect size for the laptop but still reasons without the kitty litter
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:07.400]   that it's really cheap with the kitty litter it is like they'll give it to you like it's just
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:11.800]   the practical way good way is this what you're talking about premium crystals easy care litter
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:17.320]   fresh step pretty and powerful easier cleanup stronger order protection and light on pause
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:23.080]   this is what you're talking about i believe so if i'm yep so get that and but there is litter in
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:28.440]   there as well clay in there as well or no there's no clay it is the whatever stuff it is if it's
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:32.760]   just playing the crystals the clay could be a problem especially with moisture the other
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:36.600]   the other thing i want to put into people's brains like when you if you're trying to program
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:41.880]   your immediate reaction apart from just saying blank blank blank blank blank blank things i
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:47.160]   cannot say on on the show if you if your instinct is immediately your first thing is to flip the
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:53.000]   flip the your laptop over so that the keyboard is so basically yeah that's i had this
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:59.160]   i had that same thing with uh with my my uh my yeah yeah no no not with the well that was dead
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:05.320]   because i get i was asleep it got it got it got it was four hours of marinating it was it was i
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:11.640]   woke up five hours later he said i could smell coffee that means it's been marinating let me let me
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:17.480]   let me tell you because i woke i woke up at five a.m i like oh gosh i must have fallen asleep oh gosh
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:23.320]   and all i could say and the thing is all of the liquid had dried even like the liquid on the on
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:29.480]   the duvet cover had dried so all as so as far as as far as i knew just my oh gosh should i did
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:33.160]   oh i guess the battery must have run down or something it actually took me a while to realize that
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:39.320]   oh poopy i just dumped like a whole glass full of oh well this is not going to end well uh but
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:44.200]   so yeah if you can program yourself to flip it i but i actually the the the the the the
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:49.720]   sad the the positive version of the story was i also i had another beverage action but this was
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:55.800]   not my fault i was at a sidewalk cafe where like it's the the tables are like those thin like metal
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:00.440]   where if you so much as nudge it it'll start wobbling and so it knocked like a bottle of root beer
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:05.320]   onto onto my think pad but again i immediately flipped it over also the think pad uh the that
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:12.120]   model of think pad it really is designed to like be abused and still survive and i think i was
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:16.840]   patient for a couple of days i let it dry out i took it apart because think bad reason to take
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:22.280]   part i kind of hose down the keyboard and it worked just fine thank goodness mr genius mr former ex
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:29.640]   genius should i i mean i've got it back should i take it apart and and dry it out and see if it starts
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:35.640]   or should i just not even attempt there's nothing you know the the the see here's the point it the
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:41.720]   the prior to 50 me would have been like get the over 50 me is like screwed it i would rather spend
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:48.120]   that time watching something good on tv or like having a simple ball and yeah so like no and to
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:56.360]   to Alex point the um you can get color indicating desiccane gel beads for like 18 bucks on amazon
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:02.040]   for two pounds so it's actually not that expensive and it's reusable the color indicating means like
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:06.280]   if you buy orange beads they turn green when they're saturated so you know that they work
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:10.280]   right if you buy the blue ones they turn a different color use this for kitty litter right
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:15.400]   use this no no this is this is for doing what we're talking about like good you can get
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:18.840]   usable desiccane you can get 64 pounds if you want
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:25.880]   oh that's really really really that's really really that in case that maybe you maybe the
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:31.160]   problem is your ear sense of your responsibility maybe maybe you need to lose a couple laptops to
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:36.360]   teach you how to take care of your toys it broke my mind you know be very careful of saying i've
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:42.280]   never done because i was joking because my friends who always break their phones and i'm like i have
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:48.440]   never so much drop or broken an iPhone and we're on like iPhone 14 i swear second day i
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:55.240]   full 14 dropped it and nothing happened thank goodness but never say that because you immediately
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:59:00.120]   jinx yourself it's like the it's like the commentators curse in sports yeah oh he never throws it in
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:06.680]   his oh there's a deception yeah oh oh that's cool so if it's more than it's 50 to 60 percent
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:10.920]   absorbed with moisture it turns pink this is good and then you can micro they come in different
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:14.920]   colors you can pick whichever color you want you can microwave it defrost be
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:20.840]   microbaked huh i think that microbaked in and i was like i was like you know that
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:25.560]   we really like really good really good your micro planes and your micro domain like
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:31.560]   they make up so then then your product comes out dry and like like like like like like
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:36.120]   bacon jerky but it faces you can you can get it like an elton tin like a checkout slide that
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:41.720]   would i would be like micro paper a micro bacon show title
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:50.040]   i wish to back your kickstarter Alex at the at the one gross case level for award level
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:55.320]   space grade microbaking we're gonna take another break because i got to pay for a new mac uh
[00:59:55.320 --> 01:00:03.640]   we will so tell me again do you do you guys think there will be an event next week or not
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:09.560]   an event an announcement next i don't i don't think so i'm thinking not now right no no but i
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:14.040]   have to but i have to say that we're hearing the same the the kind of rumors and the kind of
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:18.360]   velocity of rumors about the mac mini and about an updated macbook pro are very consistent with
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:23.240]   what i would expect from a imminent announcement on on both of those things so i would be
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:27.400]   i think you're confusing me so you think it won't be next week but it might be next month
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:33.000]   i think i think people see one by the end of the year maybe next month i i don't know about next
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.960]   free black friday right they did drop something uh they did drop the black i mac or something
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.920]   they dropped after black friday and we were like wait what i it was only like three or four years
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:50.120]   ago and i forget what product it was but they did drop something after black friday and but
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:55.640]   those things don't fit in the black friday shopping so they can come at any time between now and in
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:01.960]   the year but but not and but nonetheless like apple traditionally likes to slow down like between
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:07.480]   like thanksgiving and and and the new years so they would want to get all that stuff out the door
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:13.240]   like before people start lose at apple start a lot stop losing it stop paying attention to their
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:18.040]   jobs which is sort of like the culture in disservice like uh we're not we're not going to drop anything
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:24.120]   really big it's going to be fine go home put the koala on the tree i'm scanning mark german's newsletter
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:30.520]   to see you know i don't know what it is now i i gotta say it was exciting for me this morning
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:36.360]   because i woke up uh like i'm like doing a couple of a couple hours of like email like in bed see
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:40.920]   like the see oh the store is down the store is down and suddenly like i'm on for the like as i have
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:45.560]   been for the past month because i know that at any moment if i'm not given that i'm not expecting
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:50.440]   there to be an apple event for the new mac mini i'm expecting to get basically find out that on the
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.360]   next hour you're gonna have to be at the apple store at the apple store to pre-order a mac mini
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:59.880]   and spend two thousand dollars it is high alerts almost like having a baby only cost you well okay
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:03.320]   less money than that his american health care system but in both countries it would be more
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:08.760]   expensive mark german by the way uh does agree apple should discontinue the ipad
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:16.120]   error it just there's just no place for it in the lineup it doesn't make sense uh one thing to
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:21.640]   remember is we still need space for the mac pro so there is one more event people we just don't know
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:27.000]   well do they they would yeah normally they do that well i know we know there's no normal with apple
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:34.840]   silicon but i would expect every year there'd be an m plus one update to the all the stuff or no
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:41.240]   right right so that's why you're later no october 29th if i remember october 20th
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:49.240]   announced october 29th ship was the mac mini right um because i'm trying to remember when i got
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:55.560]   mine so it has to be this is going to be two years for this mini um which i finally took off the
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:00.600]   desk it's been relegated to a pelican case with a display like it's a portable studio so that
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:07.160]   guy is basically two years old yeah next week right so yeah i definitely think it has to consume
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:13.960]   just because of the timing so i'm as if it's not next week it's men of them yeah they did they did
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.720]   they did say that when they first announced apple silicon they intended to have the entire
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:24.680]   mac lineup updated to apple silicon by the end of 2022 or in two years time yeah so unless i don't
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:28.440]   i don't i don't think anybody would ding them very very hard if they simply said oh we're gonna
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:33.000]   announce it we won't be able to ship them new mac pro until whatever but act doc rock just yeah
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.800]   that's that way they knew a new mac pro they would they would not to simply put new silicon in the
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:42.120]   old case design they would need to because so much the old case design is based on how do you get
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:46.360]   all this heat out of this other stamp thing so yeah that's interesting maybe we'll have another
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:53.720]   event for for max sorry you have to go you have to go to commercial i know let me show you my box
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:04:00.760]   real fast that's cool oh that's nice that's a perfect okay just play oh look at that and then
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:07.400]   there's the mini the keyboard uh sure interface and underneath this thunderbolt hub and and so that's
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:11.960]   so you can stream remotely mostly or uh yeah because you know like i was on the road in
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:17.480]   massachusetts for the last two months and i had a little air b&b in newberry port and i just needed
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:22.680]   to take my studio while i was working on uh we might be coming down with a new version e-cam
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:29.240]   so i was hiding in massachusetts and uh this is that where he came in yeah and aim is great
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:34.280]   but i was a newberry port because i wanted to be i went from beach to beach no one told me that
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:41.400]   water is freezing oh it's terrible oh it's and and come to california it's even colder oh my
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:47.640]   goodness that water over this is it's full reasoning it is not like what i got across the street
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:51.400]   where it's back next to my toes when i lived in Rhode Island i thought it was warm because it's
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:56.760]   got the gulf current right Andy exactly so it's then you come to the so the Atlantic was actually
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:02.920]   believe it or not doc rock you're used to hawaii which is beautiful but uh california is even colder
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:08.200]   than the atlantic at least northern california lord that was sight even even even the differences
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:13.080]   between the beaches on the north shore of cape cod are different from the beaches on the south
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:18.120]   shore of cape cod just simply because you're getting a little more warm water from the south and
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.600]   worth that you boy do you are you in novascosa if you are in the north shore
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.840]   oh my god it's like you can you can know of a scotch fish i know that
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:31.960]   pretty good oh my goodness it's crazy but the aid of food is really good in newberry port i did you
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:39.240]   have clam cakes i cannot eat selfish anymore but i i did have a lot of various other good things
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:45.960]   that they have shellfish is the best thing they have there yeah no it's a carcoyze cahog's quahog's
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:51.720]   co-hogs yeah yeah that would be the best lesson i learned how to say we keep in packing so i don't
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:57.720]   know i was like oh i got to go to the packing to get i'll like get go to the what and my
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:03.560]   friends i got to go to the packing that's the package store yep yeah which which which like
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:08.520]   which is versus this is that the packing that's that's beautiful because they said the packing
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:12.200]   they can say the liquor store let's give me the package store and that doesn't help it's like
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:18.760]   mr. oh wait no that's a package store that's from prohibition days when you blew laws maybe blue
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:27.480]   laws exactly yep uh sorry uh no no i'm having fun with you guys i don't need to do a commercial
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:31.080]   but i do need to do a commercial let me let me let me know let me know the next time you're anywhere
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:35.240]   rock the next time you're new you're new you're new you're new you're new you're you're nearby i
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:41.000]   i you would have been worth a ten dollar commuter railfare to see you oh oh you know it's great i did
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:49.160]   go to uh north in and i went to the uh in uh improv asylum oh my goodness if you're ever in the
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:52.920]   and the bastin i don't know how to say that part if you're ever in the bastin area go to improv
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:57.720]   asylum and watch them and they were doing a graduation so like these people were competing
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:06.040]   to move to the master cast whatever they come in and he was freaking oh how amazing one of the best
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:11.000]   nights of comedy ever and they're in a very competitive so it was great comedy scene in boston
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   we will take a break when we come back the ipad pros and other apple news there's lots more
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.760]   uh to talk about so glad doc rock is here sitting in for jason snell this week and the anaco
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:28.520]   Alex Lindsey our show today brought to you by new relic i'm talking to the developers out there the
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:37.800]   engineers the people who run big cloud apps i know i love devs because you know and you know i'm an
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:43.800]   honorary dev i'm a hobbyist dev but i look at you guys the pros i'm just blown away you know you've
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:48.840]   fascinated by what you're doing i think you love what you're doing you're always exploring the latest
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:53.720]   tech you actually read the documentation because you you not only want to know how things work you
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:08:00.200]   want to know why they work that way that's why so many engineers love new relic because new relic
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:06.360]   gives you the data you need to know about the stuff you build it shows what's really happening in your
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:12.200]   software life cycle the whole stack one place you could see it all you don't have to look into a
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:17.800]   bunch of different tools make the correlations manually no it's all in new relic it pinpoints
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:24.040]   issues down to the line of code so you can not only know why the problem's happening you could fix that
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:31.640]   right there that's amazing it pinpoints issues down to the line of code that's why dev and ops
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:39.400]   teams at door dash use uh new relic so does github epic games uses new relic 14 000 companies use new
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:44.680]   relic they use it to debug and improve their software they use it to keep an eye on the whole
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:50.760]   stack so they know what's going on and i love it because when you when you're getting together to
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:57.000]   to triage problems to make decisions about your data to solve problems to implement resolutions
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:04.040]   you're doing it based on facts not not somebody's great idea not opinion i think this is what's going
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:10.200]   on you know what's going on use the data platform made for the curious right now you can get access
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:15.480]   to the entire new relic platform you can get a hundred gigabytes of data a month and you can get
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:23.160]   that free forever no credit card sign up at new relic dot com slash mac break any w
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:30.520]   r-e-l-i-c dot com slash mac break new relic dot com slash mac break thank you so much for their support
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:35.240]   of mac break weekly and of course when you go to that address your support us to new relic dot
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:43.320]   com slash mac break i am not tempted by i love my m1 ipad pro is it a redesign in any way
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:50.920]   it's the same right it's both inside the guts are new but i don't everything else looks to say
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:57.400]   it doesn't yeah i guess we don't know until we get it home uh supercharged but supercharged
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:05.880]   by the m2 chip it has Wi-Fi 6e it also has the apple pencil hover experience
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:11.560]   it looks like it has the same magic keyboard that lifts not separates
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:22.040]   or actually lifts and separates doesn't it like a like a fine brazier but uh that so i guess the
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:28.280]   new magic keyboard is not available to the mac i rather the ipad pro
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:34.840]   uh stage manager yeah you'll get all that stuff the new ipad o s when you pick it up
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:44.680]   october 26th you can order it today it is not cheap yeah that's that's fine though i like see
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:49.880]   that but the thing is you compare like uh the magic keyboard i've got my ipad pro to almost
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:56.280]   every other accessory like keyboard trackpad case and oh my god it's like the the typing surface is
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:01.720]   perfectly firm it snaps closed really nicely it's got it's got an extra charge port on the
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:07.560]   on the opposite side of where it would be on the on the ipad it's just you just uh granted you
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:14.120]   you you have i have i'm speaking from the pleasure of having bought it for like maybe even two thirds
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:21.800]   off on on a closeout thing but because uh the whatever uh but yeah it's if you're using this as
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:25.560]   your main laptop you might find that this is uh the best choice available for it but if you don't
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:29.560]   if there's too much there's so many others out there that's okay this this is this isn't like apple
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:34.840]   telling people hey go be poor someplace else do you think this m2 ipad pro is actually faster than the
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:43.640]   m1 uh macbook air i guess it is oh yes i guess it's it's starting to do it apple 20 it's not
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:49.000]   but it's also starting to do it yeah also i mean the thing is it's not about benchmarks it's about
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.320]   how much annoyance is ios going to put you through versus the simple things you could be able to do
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:59.880]   with the same operations again my my biggest the only complaint i have about the my ipad is that
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:06.600]   i really wish i could just get a desktop desktop desktop browser for it that doesn't that has no
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:11.560]   accommodations for it being a touch device no accommodations for being an ios device because if
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:17.720]   if i could just get plain flat safari or plain flat chrome on this it would reduce 90 percent of
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:23.000]   the problems that i have in getting things done with the ipad that is so true somebody needs to
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.840]   make a full complement chromium browser or yeah chromium be the best because it's extensible but
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:33.720]   that just runs on it because i mean as a desktop class processor it has all of the
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:41.000]   the stuff that you need why do i have to have this dumb down version of a browser and the load the
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.440]   mobile site switch to the low desktop site thing never works the way it should and you're right
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:52.200]   that's about it the other thing i just can't believe i want to say this again i'll make fun of myself
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:58.440]   i've had this magic keep answer today came out i completely forgot about the other charging
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:04.680]   cloud that's i that's so nice i love always plug it in here no no i do the opposite yeah oh my god
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:10.520]   the whole time i was in the hotel i had my cable like which around this weirdly yes yes and i
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:15.800]   completely forgot about that and i literally literally every day for the last two months i'm on
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:20.840]   the road or i spent like the last month in my ass and i just forgot about that john jurad in our
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:27.240]   discord said he asked apple sales and they said it is the same size and design so your m1 ipad
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:34.360]   pro case will work your m1 ipad everything's work that is good so they didn't they didn't redesign it
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:41.080]   tommy on trip says the biggest thing about m2 is pro res so there's pro res support now is that
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:48.600]   near well you got the pro res support and you got the extra neural engines now we were able to work
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:54.840]   with pro res in the old model but this one shoots in pro res uh which i think seems like a really
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:14:00.440]   weird form factor i know that people do it but i think that yeah it's not the phone has not a great
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:05.880]   camera right i mean it's not as good as the i i phone camera yeah the photo the phone has
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:10.760]   better lenses and better camera process than the then the ipad the ipad's kind of like i
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:14.920]   okay you got a camera with two people people use only to land it so because it does have pro
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:20.280]   pro res hardware acceleration so oh i edit all mine all the time okay so you'll value that
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:26.120]   guy if you work in pro res yeah i will i'm using it for basically offline editing right just
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:31.160]   chop some cuts in real quick and with luma fusion i can send it to fauna cut and send it in a fauna
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:37.320]   cut XML and everything is you know where you need it to be so that part is dope and i think the only
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:43.160]   people i ever see really using it in a camera the way that ables talking about is education space
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:49.400]   as in schools the kids are always holding it oh yeah all the time yeah um and so i guess it's good
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:54.600]   for that because they are very popular in that space and we tend to forget that but it's really
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:59.400]   where into this day when i see someone at a concert or a game go like this and the like
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:06.440]   do you all hate that oh yeah i i i don't even like the one they do on the phone i was at a concert
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:13.240]   saturday night perfectly happy standing in the mosh pit and joining a all-female zep led zeplin
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:19.960]   tribute band known as zeparella and some guy muscles up and stands in front of me with his phone
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:27.080]   like that videoing it like all i can see now is a big bright screen it's like dude that is so
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:32.920]   rude please folks don't do that don't do that so especially when they have the old case with a
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:40.520]   flat with flat down you got the big ipad the case is hanging off of it come on man why not just
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:45.160]   why not just open a victorian parasol behind you if you want to be that big of a jerk to ever
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:52.200]   find you why pretend so uh the first half of the apple video is the ipad the second half
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:57.240]   we go to the apple campus to meet the ipad pro
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:06.680]   somebody saying they had a then somebody shooting with a rig yeah here you go that's exactly what
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:16.120]   you want to see on a movie set some guy with a rig and his ipad pro is that silly Alex
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:21.320]   yeah but but i think that i think that some of it has to do with i mean so obviously some people
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:25.560]   are getting paid to do it with an ipad specifically so that's why they're doing that but but i think
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:30.200]   that in general um sometimes you can get some of the previous stuff and shoot some videos that's
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:35.320]   for previous or something that's what i was gonna say yeah so that's probably your pre-indition i
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:39.640]   love it how the previous that and through you can see things like for instance we use things like
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:47.400]   Artemis Artemis pro um to you know visualize this is what this lens on this camera is gonna look at
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:51.000]   now i've never done video with that i don't even know if it does that but right but it but we
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.600]   visualize it there and the phones are really good for that i've never used again i haven't used an
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:17:02.360]   ipad for that so uh he's doing a costume pursuit scene i can see for previous that would make a
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:07.480]   lot of sense we it's not the movie itself it's just getting the gettin the shots in so usually
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:10.680]   usually you're not all set up with all the grip stuff and everything else if you're doing it's kind
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:19.160]   of weird yeah yeah little um aspirational aspirational that's it apple apple's aspiring to do something
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:23.720]   the hovers really cool uh they showed one of the things you can do with the hovers you hover it
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:28.280]   and then you can use your finger there it is swipe the pen size up and down before you're
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:33.080]   tapping anything i think that's kind of a cool use of hover i i think it's adorable they're still
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:38.360]   trying to make it as as though this they're trying to say these multi-touch multi-jester
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:42.840]   interfaces on the ipad are absolutely intuitive and absolutely easy no you're just going to learn
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.920]   to use them that's fine oh if you're an illustrator that might be something you'd you'd end up using
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:57.320]   um i do want the ability to drag the center point of an image into something i just that's so cool
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:01.320]   you have to have uh you have to be just have to be a portrait mode photo to do that he just did
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:07.400]   it with a car look at that just you know you do anything okay because it's got depth image
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:12.520]   no i was playing with it on the iPhone and it's so good on the iPhone it's kind of crazy yeah
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:17.880]   i've given i what when they started doing the composers for the home screen i was like well
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:21.880]   that's kind of silly you know it was like a silly little thing but now i find myself out with my
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:26.600]   kids trying to frame it to shoot it so there's just a little overlap and it doesn't automatically
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:32.280]   give up and put the put the time over top so i've i've found i went to stickers what do you do
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:38.040]   i use them for my home screens i have uh that's awesome you know i have i have my kids and my wife
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:43.160]   and everything else on home screens and so i it seems to swap them i must do something that swaps
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:47.640]   them because it seems randomly i get new ones so i don't really know exactly how that's happening but
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:51.000]   but i start but i've started to shoot the photos and keep them in the collection of
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.040]   um you know just a little bit of their hat or a little bit of something just covering part of them
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:59.880]   you know so because if you put too much of it if it's too much on the top in front of them then
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:04.360]   it won't do it it'll just put the time over top so there's this game where you're playing and i've
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:09.560]   gone from not thinking that it was useful to wishing that there was a camera in the home screen
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:13.880]   so that i could frame it and it would just show me where whether it's going to pop up above or
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:18.360]   below so i can just frame it correctly so i'm because i'm shooting for the home screen so here's
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:25.320]   a question Alex so uh to do this uh the second half of the ipad introduction video from apple
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:33.240]   they apparently hired a a movie car a stunt driver he's got an earpiece in he's driving he's going
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:40.360]   to go they must have also taken over the street because uh he's you know he got to show it sooner
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:45.800]   right let me do it again here he's taken over the he's they had the whole police department come out
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:50.920]   because this guy that's not even that's a that's a prop police car because it's not modern right
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:55.000]   no no this is one of those uh this is one of those stunt cars you see with it and then but they had
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.280]   to take over the there's a prop police car and all of it shot with an ipad yeah
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:10.040]   maybe not it probably be uh come on man yeah a little much i suppose some of this stuff they're
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:16.760]   double-dutying right so they're in the process of shooting say five days to memorial or blackbird
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:21.640]   or whatever and they know they got these products coming out they're like i need the i've got a
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:27.720]   marketing team uh maybe maybe it was a real movie yeah right we're going to make a concession during
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:32.920]   something that they're filming for apple TV and then they can just work it in very much doubt that
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:36.840]   for the for apple like apple would have coordinated a separate they can afford to do it separate
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:43.000]   and that hill is definitely in San Fran but i don't think i don't i doubt apple did anything
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.760]   other than like this is because the hard part is when you say oh we want to take advantage of a
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:50.760]   set now you're fitting into somebody else's schedule and they're that's true that's true you've got
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:55.400]   something else they ought to do and yeah so so they're just apple there are definitely lots of
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:21:00.120]   companies that do that i work inside of those gaps all the time but i don't think apple does that
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:03.960]   i think apple just goes well we're just going to shoot this and yeah what's the budget 150 000
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:14.200]   sure sure leven inch ipad pro starts at 799 if you want cellular at 200 dollars 12.9 inch ipad pro
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:21.640]   1099 at 200 for the wi-fi plus cellular the pencil second generation under 29 dollars magic
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:27.080]   keyboard all that stuff is the the same that's the same price is before yeah 1099 i think it is
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:35.320]   but as as doc rock so eloquently pointed out what did you call it you get the fat boy for
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:45.400]   it was crazy that my in one ipad pro i haven't waited i swear to you this is heavier than the
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:50.760]   m2 air it seems like it doesn't it yeah everybody that grabs this thing goes oh my god that thing
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:58.760]   is a tank and i go yeah but i mean i love it so other uh so that's it that's the announcement
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:08.680]   you can order today all of those products delivery next week ipad o s 16 and macOS ventura come out
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:14.600]   monday officially um and that's it that's no you know if that's all they had to announce i see
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:18.840]   why you don't have an event there'd be silly you have an event for that there is there is no
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:24.280]   here's the test 22 hold on get anti first yeah there is there is something this kind that's
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:29.960]   kind of missing from here we still have not heard a peep about about about free form like that
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:36.520]   whiteboard app they showed off at ww dc comes with ipad o s 16 they said they said no no no no i'm
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:41.000]   looking at the rest of it it was a lot of portion it's a large portion of the demo too right when
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:46.680]   they're doing the fire is yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so i mean i was saying that's kind of interesting
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:50.760]   because i don't know if that's one of those things that apple it's like a product that apple has
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:54.600]   gonna is gonna grow good the reason i asked that is because microsoft has a product i think it's
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:23:01.240]   called loop that they've been teasing um and and google's adding to its google docs and workspace
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:06.440]   something similar all of these are ways to embed components in it it looks like a white if it's
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:10.840]   just a whiteboard where you could draw on big deal but when you're embedding components from other
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:17.880]   apps into it it becomes more interesting and i feel like microsoft google and i think apple are all
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:20.920]   looking at some sort of future product that is some sort of
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:25.640]   you know for a long time there was a thesis in computer science
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:33.000]   that uh why are we focused on file systems documents files you should be focused on the
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.520]   document and uh no one has successfully done this both apple with pink i think was
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:45.000]   document centric microsoft uh with long horn and olay have been pushing this but nobody's done it
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:50.360]   yet and i'm wondering if we're headed in that direction yeah this is when it's gonna be really
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:57.000]   cool to see how much they're managed to pay off on uh when the when the key elements of the
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:02.040]   wwdc keynote which is always as intended to be very forward thinking it says as close to apple
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:05.720]   ever gets to saying here's what our strategy is for the next five years here is some unannounced
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:12.280]   products for you to chew on they really seem to be hyping up messages as not just a way to keep
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:17.000]   people from buying android devices and not just a messaging app but also this is we feel as though
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:23.080]   this is going to be the center hub for for collaboration where uh when you you're gonna invite people to
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:28.680]   join in on a freeform whiteboard through messages that you're gonna basically every time you do a
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:34.200]   collaboration is good the initiation point is going to be through a messages group chat and so i'm
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:38.680]   i don't think we're gonna see how much that's gonna pay off the next month but once all that
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:43.400]   technology once all these uh operating systems have been updated all the way across the product line
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:48.680]   i'm keen to see if that really pays off in six months as a real strategy or whether that's just
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:54.680]   a feature they wired in because they knew that that would help that would help uh ios and macos
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:59.880]   and enterprise let me correct myself because you were right Andy uh you know so i'm looking at the
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:05.880]   press release and it mentions freeform as a part of ipad o s 16 but i didn't see the part where it
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:10.680]   says footnote number six freeform will be available in update to ios ipad o s and macos later this
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:16.920]   year ah yes so you were absolutely correct yep at wwc they they they didn't even attach it to the
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:21.800]   the next versions of the vio s and ipad o s they just said later this year it is interesting though
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:26.680]   here and the press release ipad o s 16 brings powerful new features number one is new features
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:33.800]   and messages number two is freeform so you know they're definitely i think they have some hopes
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:38.280]   some aspirations for freeform it's not clips it's not you know some
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:45.400]   afterthought that somebody made and you know maybe it'll be something uh i mean if they put it
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:51.720]   above the weather app on ipad i think that's pretty serious yeah uh let's see oh other news
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:56.840]   are we have we have we completed the everything anybody wanted to say about the product announcement
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:03.320]   i'm spent yeah oh i know what i was going to say one thing that was important i wanted to say
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.760]   here's a funny thing about it when they do the events or something that they could have just
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:15.640]   been in press release there is some bovine verse given by the the the people out here
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:21.640]   when they do the press release and a video on youtube instead of an event we're having more of
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:28.840]   those you know superfluous bovine verse so which is it folks like pick one pick a camp right like
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:33.640]   it is funny no matter which way they did it it's wrong and i wish that would just stop because
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:41.720]   it's useless anything else to say any other uh little details that we uh we forgot to mention uh
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:47.800]   Alex um the apple tv i just think that the big thing with the big thing with apple is
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:53.880]   when they release an ipad that gives an m2 i just didn't feel like they communicate at least in
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:59.640]   that video really what they talk about like better photorealistic photogrammetry or or 3d
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:04.760]   modeling but they don't really show us you know i think the biggest problem with the ipad
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:08.120]   is we keep on getting new chips and this gets a little bit to the what we were talking about
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:12.680]   with the apple tv keep on getting new chips but we don't see a lot of things that really require
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:17.160]   those chips that really require that push the envelope of what they can do it makes it a little
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:21.080]   bit more convenient a little bit snappier but i gotta tell you i i barely don't know the difference
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:27.480]   between my ipad pro two years ago to my ipad pro one year year ago to in my eyes they're you know
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:31.880]   they're not interchangeable the one has a better screen and you know i can look at you know i
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:37.960]   but they're pretty close we will see in sales but i i agree 100 especially for people like
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:47.480]   doc rock and i who have a m1 um ipad pro there's no compelling argument to step up no at all yeah
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:50.280]   and i think that's the that's the issue is that is that we just don't see
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:55.160]   don't don't see a lot of um and again i think that's partially working with developers it's
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:59.240]   communicating better there's definitely things that push these computers but they have a problem
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:03.720]   where they're building all these apps and a lot of them aren't there's no apps out there this is
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:08.920]   the proper pcs is that excel runs as fast as it's ever gonna run or on a pc you know silver for 99
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:12.840]   percent of the world or maybe if you have a really complex table it's gonna it's gonna slow down a
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:18.200]   little bit but you're trying to tie it into your erp or something like that but in general it's
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:23.400]   going is what people use their pc for is going as fast as they can i think that ipads you know you
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:28.600]   go you go back years and your ipad still does most of the things that all the other ones do because
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:33.160]   the developers aren't really pushing that and i think that apple needs to if they want i think
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:38.840]   they can improve sales by working more closely with developers to get them to get um yeah better
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:43.560]   tools that push it harder yeah it's always a question of what can this what can this thing do
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:48.200]   this new thing do that my current thing can't do uh and if you can't answer that question really
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:53.720]   speedily that's a problem i mean even even me the reason the reason why i'm by the reason why i
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:58.360]   bought an apple silicon macbook was because my old one really couldn't keep up with a lot of the
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:02.920]   streaming that i'm doing the reason why i'm upgrading my mac mini even though it's 10 years old is isn't
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:07.960]   even necessarily that it won't run ventura but the fact that i really want to have multiple displays
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:12.600]   right now it can't it doesn't have the i/o that i want for for what i need otherwise i wouldn't just
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:19.800]   be saying that oh well jesus it's real honestly the the uh truism for decades has been
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:26.040]   cpu's and operating systems are fast so fast that most of the time a faster process of just
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:30.200]   means it's got more duty cycles between flashing the cursor waiting for you to type the next thing
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:39.400]   i mean apple does say m2 is up to 15 percent i'm looking at the press release faster than the m1
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:44.840]   with advancements in both performance and efficiency cores and the 10 core gpu delivering up to 30 up to
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:52.920]   35 percent faster graphics for the most demanding users uh neural engine can process 15 trillion
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:58.360]   operations a second that's 40 percent faster than the m1 but all these specs i think i agree with
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:04.280]   you Alex it's like yeah but i don't need that but what what what what do i have right would take
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:09.640]   advantage of 20 percent faster i don't double the memory bandwidth 50 percent more memory bandwidth
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:15.720]   i mean yeah but why what i don't need it i'm maybe apple's just done too good and there are apps
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:20.120]   that push these things that there are apps that can push these but we apple i think needs to
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:24.440]   promote more of a maybe that's the issue pro as capture seems like the single biggest
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:31.960]   difference frankly and uh as soon as they stay here is photocup pro for the ipad
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:39.560]   yes everybody will okay m2 ipad here i come see you i didn't hear that would have been automatic
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:44.600]   for me i would just be ignore the fact that this one is still a dope if it only runs on m2 but
[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:51.400]   here's photocupo for ipad here's the image in the press release of an ipad editing solution but
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:55.640]   but what what pro this is not an apple program is just it's just made up
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:31:02.840]   can i know does it mean no no this is um it well it doesn't look like luma fusion but maybe
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:07.080]   there's a new version of luma fusion because it does it does have some elements of luma fusion on
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:13.320]   there and this is this is definitely uh luma well i don't know what it is actually i think that's uh
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:17.800]   i think that might be a fact that no that's is serif affinity design affinity yeah
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:23.560]   yeah this looks like infinity that the toolbar does but i don't know what the video editor is
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:30.040]   media stake transitions titles effects homelands documentary maybe it's just made up
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:34.920]   but that's kind of a cheat if you don't have final cut on the ipad why are you showing this
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:38.840]   well i don't think it's fine yeah but i think it's not final cut but what is it
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:45.880]   it's very odd anyway oh what makes a goth wait a minute i want to read this article
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:56.120]   sisha eebara it's too many bright colors for that yeah well it's all about the bright colors apparently
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:32:00.280]   well what do i want to ask you Alex though like when we're taking a
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:06.680]   da Vinci resolve that's what it says daai da Vinci resolve okay oh i forgot about da Vinci
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:13.560]   bizol and for back is there a result i didn't even know that result yeah look at me mmm
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:19.160]   that's uh i mean that's a good choice isn't it sorry Annie go ahead no no i was just i was
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:25.000]   going to ask like how when you when you talk about people who are using stuff on set for
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.720]   production how important it is or how valuable would it be to be able to shoot something on a
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:33.480]   device and edit it on the device and then i'll put from the device without doing any sort of an
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:39.160]   uh and any sort of an ingestion of of data like would that mitigate the fact that the ipad is not
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:43.560]   using the best camera system that is available from apple yeah i mean i think that i think that
[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:48.680]   that so where you see that as previous you know the previous is the thing that we would do that
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:53.560]   the most for like i'm i'm gonna walk in i'm gonna do a scene i'm gonna go click click click like they
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:58.120]   can go here and then we're gonna go be here and i wouldn't have a whole crew i probably let's say
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:04.520]   i have a restaurant scene i might go into that restaurant and you know have that uh you know to
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:09.480]   shoot the the different pieces and normally we do it out of over just stills like there's gonna be
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:13.000]   this frame and then there's gonna be that frame and then there's gonna be this frame but sometimes
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.360]   we might shoot video and have them talking back and forth and then you want to cut it all and
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:20.920]   send it to a director or producer and say this is what what i think we could do and then then they
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:25.080]   might come back and go okay well that's good and and that is really useful but we usually i have to say
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:29.880]   usually do that on a phone but the the advantage of doing on the ipad is if you're gonna
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:34.760]   tie it in with like luma fusion so you take you know you cut you know you shoot all those things
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:39.400]   drop it into luma fusion edit it all out which is a little faster than transferring it from your
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:43.480]   phone to your ipad or letting it go up and then pulling it back down or whatever so
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:47.080]   so you you found a good article uh that explains this
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:54.040]   da Vinci Resolve is not available on the ipad pro apple has like apple has teased in effect that
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:34:01.960]   it's coming in fact from the video here is a little bit of the video of da Vinci Resolve on an ipad pro
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:11.720]   so uh that's complex here it is so very interesting this is from dp review thanks for finding this
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:17.560]   doc rock i think we've actually found a little mini uh scooplet here aside from the small kitchen
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:23.080]   apple they had the icon in the dock yeah yeah you see that the icons in the dock and i completely
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:26.760]   missed that watch the video like four times i don't know why i missed that apple doesn't explicitly
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:31.800]   reveal any other details about da Vinci Resolve for ipad but it does say the new
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:39.160]   m2 models can convert video projects to pro res up to three times faster and they say that was
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:45.480]   done in luma fusion dp review has contacted black magic for additional details on da Vinci Resolve
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:50.600]   for the ipad so that's an unannounced new product and spokesperson responded oops
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:58.120]   no that's not an oops well i don't know what what happens there is that is that you know apple has
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:01.160]   you know they have their screen captures they have what they're going to use and they're going
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:07.320]   down and they probably talked about it months in advance and um and then the you know the the
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:12.760]   partner um may or may not be ready to to up there might be a couple little glitches couple things
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:16.120]   they have to fix whatever and apple's gonna keep on you know not gonna change they're gonna pull
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:20.680]   the slates out of it so they're gonna keep on keeping on i don't think apple surprised them i think
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:25.720]   apple's not really a big big company on surprise um i think that probably if i was gonna guess i
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:30.040]   probably say black magic i was trying to close up a couple little things before they put it out in
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:34.920]   the video at the eight-minute mark they say powerful new apps are coming to ipad as well
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:42.280]   da Vinci Resolve for ipad with color correction editing and visual effects so yeah would that solve
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:50.280]   would that be as good as final cut for you doc? well most so many know i love resolve and i used
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:56.520]   it before it became damn near free you know when they were the original like you know da Vinci boxes
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:05.080]   no not bitter at all right um but here's the thing you you mentioned you mentioned something um
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:09.400]   aleck and it was to Andy's question but let's take this differently so there's
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:13.640]   aleck's level of content creator and then there's my level of content creator my people
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:20.680]   would absolutely love to be able to shoot edit host on the same device right because i'm teaching
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:27.800]   the youtubers the instagramers the takers you know the above so for us having that type of power
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:32.920]   right at the at the bid summit conference you know that happened this last week in l.a. when there's
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:38.120]   like 200 000 youtubers running around they would love to do everything in one little device
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:43.800]   many people are doing it with the phone and struggling so in this case the ipad would be amazing and
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:48.040]   absolutely that i was doing it from a point of view of sets and previs but you're absolutely right
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:51.880]   that that a lot of people who are doing whether it's sick talk or youtube being able to cut on the
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:56.280]   phone now a lot of them are using iMovie and then they graduate to final cut or they use enlightened
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:01.560]   or the built-in apps like tiktok's built-in yeah and so so there's there's a couple of them that
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:06.520]   kind of float around there so you absolutely can do that with the ipad and the ipad does give you
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:12.200]   more tools i think that it'd be interesting again with resolve the issue that i guess and this is
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:17.240]   just the way we use it so i think i think that they definitely black magic really wants to engage
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:22.040]   that audience i think for us the reason we use resolve is for heavy lifting so you know i'm shooting
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:27.880]   it some stuff tomorrow and i'm we're shooting on an airy super 35 with an issue lens and that's
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:32.200]   all going to resolve interesting that don't you know and you know that's a resolve project
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:37.320]   where i use the free version for that or do you have to no no yeah need to the pro version but
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:42.040]   the pro version's 300 bucks i mean the the project is worth is cost more oh yeah yeah so so the um
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:46.520]   so the you know the and we have the big thing is if you have lots of black magic cameras you have
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:50.760]   lots of resolve because it's 300 bucks but every camera comes every black magic camera comes with
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:55.480]   it so i've got like it you know i got a lot of resolve laying around i do want to say doc rock that my
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:38:01.400]   uh little son who does is kind of a tiktok youtube kind of guy
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:07.480]   shoots in fact just bought a a r6c a c 70
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:15.720]   edits in premiere i don't i don't think he's doing it on the ipad i'm just saying i don't think so
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:20.360]   and there's plenty that there there's there's the guys like me that come yeah the guys they
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:25.960]   meet that come from the space like i'll shoot on you know my a7s or you know an fx3 or something
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:31.080]   like that but from going to conferences and coaching and stuff i so many people are like really
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:37.000]   start that one yeah they start that way sure and then so even Henry started that way he was
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:42.520]   doing with his iphone for a long time right everybody they get a feel that i need something
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:49.080]   better and then they start looking for that one higher piece but like even to like point though
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:55.800]   like when we do see stuff with the with the small red the vinci just handles it so much better so a
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:39:00.200]   lot of times we'll do the basic stuff right vinci because it's really really quick right and so for
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:05.800]   um for his heavy lifting as as you're saying even for the color correction like still nobody
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:09.720]   color corrects like the vinci so like if you're doing something really important at the end you're
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:14.200]   going to color correct at the vinci and i just don't know how you can do nodes on an ipad nodes
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:19.240]   would be really weird on ipad to me because yeah i know most i have all yeah running fusion on an
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:23.320]   ipad would be really interesting but the the key is this is the kind of app that is going to now
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:29.240]   press down on potentially press really down on using the m2 inside the ipad i could definitely
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:35.240]   see like getting resolved and going okay i need an m2 to do whatever i would do there and again i
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:39.000]   think that it'll be interesting to see how you integrate because the real possibility there is
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:44.280]   integrating that ipad view with you know to preview something you know i'm going to have
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:48.920]   somebody working on a workstation and they're going to have you know a really high end
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:53.880]   color correct monitor but can they send me something or whether it's a you know a derper or whatever
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:40:00.280]   that i can open it in my ipad see what they're doing and make you know and the ipad theoretically
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:04.280]   has the ipads actually pretty accurate i mean one thing we find with the ipads and the iphones is
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:08.840]   there the color is pretty accurate i wouldn't say it's as good as 11 000 colors good you know
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:13.000]   flanders but but i think that it's it they're definitely pretty strong so
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.720]   be interesting yeah they're pretty amazing
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:20.440]   and luma fusion colors are like victor's gobs and stuff which at first i thought was crazy
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:24.760]   but it's great it's actually pretty good yeah and luma fusion right now is kind of rules that whole
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:30.120]   area i mean if you want to cut stuff and have a detailed um you know way to to work with it
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:36.200]   luma fusions definitely a way to go i'm looking back at german's uh post yet last week where he said
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:40.920]   imminent release of the ipad pros he says well the new macbook pros are on track to launch in the
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:46.120]   near future i wouldn't expect them to be released alongside the ipad pro check the company has
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:51.080]   historically launched new macs in november so i think you were all in agreement the other the
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:55.480]   other thing he said which is kind of interesting google at its event couple of weeks ago
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:03.720]   teased but did not ship a google tablet that magnetically attaches to a speaker to turn it into kind of a
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:11.800]   uh you know a photo frame screen thing and he says that apple is also he believes working
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:15.880]   on uh on that which would be kind of an interesting google said
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:22.520]   um our research shows that the tablet isn't something you have around with you all the time you kind
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:27.240]   of pick it up to do a few things and you only use it once in a while so it made sense for us to have
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:32.680]   uh magnetic attachment that you could attach it to the speaker so it's in a static position and
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:37.320]   then showing pictures or playing music or whatever and then you can it's charging at the same time
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:42.840]   and then pick it up as you go i think that would be very cool uh for an ipad yeah they were very
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:46.520]   at the event they this this is this is probably the reason why they were referring to this as a
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:51.160]   pixel tablet not as like a nest home display but hey you can remove the display it looks just like
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:57.000]   a big nest home right because it will have that it has a really really they didn't show it off they
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:02.040]   would just simply updating the status of that project but yeah it looked the base looks like a
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:08.440]   beautiful a big nest home speaker display uh that has that will would have really good sound
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:15.080]   react to uh to uh smart commands all the sort of stuff um it's this is i hope that i hope that uh
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:22.200]   google really does decide to finally start to think about giving the ipad a challenge because this is
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:26.920]   this is was this is was one of google's big themes that there developer conference that hey look we're
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:32.680]   we're really basically not necessarily rebooting the idea of uh tablet apps on android but we recognize
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:37.000]   that we have not been given developers enough support to make great things so that we so we are
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.680]   adding so much extra support to the stuff and i think that the reason why they're making a tablet
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:44.760]   is to demonstrate to sam's song and everybody else here's how good android can be on a tablet but
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:52.120]   we'll see german also points out that having an ipad and have a stand like that is really in a way
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:57.400]   making it a smart home device which apple has really struggled with a little bit he says i'm told
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:02.360]   this is a quote apple is working to bring similar functionality the ipad as soon as 2023
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:07.160]   the idea is to offer something users can place in a kitchen counter in the living room or on
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:12.760]   their nightstand it'll be creative if they if they use to talk to andy green about that
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:20.280]   who's andy green sorry oh uh 12 south and andrew oh yeah yeah 12 south can do something like that
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:25.320]   yeah because if you go it like you got a little base right your baseball mini mini home pod sits
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:31.000]   right here the little arm comes up and you met like you just snap the ipad to it and if through
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:37.400]   the proximity of being that close it would switch to the speaker because even a single i call them
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:43.160]   baseball even a single orange home pod like it sounds so good and i've got enough
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:47.800]   find a way to work those two together oh they'll be a great viewing experience while i'm in the
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:54.200]   kitchen making a Kentucky fried chicken in my rice pot i actually uh with my goop because i
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:59.960]   have a lot of those google nest hub maxes that are basically that they're permanently attached
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:04.440]   unfortunately but i have them all over and that is a good way to keep up on news or sports
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:09.640]   when i'm when i go in the bathroom or wherever i can say a play the the major league baseball
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:13.960]   playoffs and i can have a little screen it's not the ideal but it's something that i can keep an
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:18.360]   eye on mom doing other things so i think that's a great idea i hope apple does that i really would
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:23.560]   like to see that yeah just just a simplest saying that there's a doc there is a ipad doc type that
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:29.960]   can communicate to the device that hey when you are doc to me go into display mode and for apple to
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:35.000]   just just like this car just like this car mode say when you're doc to this device turn it to run
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:39.560]   the built-in app that turns you into a smart display and become a smart old device and become a tv
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:46.280]   device and amissive device and charge the ipad it's where you put your ipad in between to charge
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:50.120]   yeah not only that but but what if it became an airplay target as well exactly so that i can
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:54.120]   yeah so i can basically play send send send send a send a movie or a video directly there
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:57.480]   yeah exactly let's make it now that we're talking let's make a big nice speaker
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:02.280]   of course apple's gotten out of the big speaker business but that would be a really nice thing to
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:08.840]   have kind of a google hum max um google home max a speaker size uh on that make it a nice little
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:13.800]   stario college and i love my home pod yeah the little ones are fine i have two
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:17.880]   area ones in the bedroom with the books and music and i have the big one in the kitchen
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:21.320]   the big one yeah they don't make that anymore yeah lisa has a couple of those yeah
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:31.400]   yeah uh couple other shorties uh apple is now going to let you take your daily cash in your apple
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:36.920]   card and put it in a they call it high yield savings account they didn't say what the yield
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:43.880]   will be you know saving turning into a bank just like you thought i'm so surprised
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:49.080]   yeah goldman sax uh the current goldman sax high yield accounts i think are at one point some
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:52.920]   percent they're not you know they're not keeping up with inflation but it you know it's better
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:58.040]   than just letting it sit in the wallet and i have a actually considerable amount of uh apple cash
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:03.320]   in my card balance that should be getting a little interest while it's sitting there right
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:08.280]   well and i i often put a lot of money in my my apple cash is that because you like to pay people
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:13.000]   no i don't i mean i do it occasionally use it to pay people but i buy i buy a lot of stuff that
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.520]   way the big thing is is that when you use apple cash you're not using your you know any of your
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:21.800]   credit cards or atm cards you know like you're not it's like it's a secret much more secure way
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:27.000]   to do that so that if you're you know someone if someone like target gets all their credit cards
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:31.640]   taken all you have is apple cash connections and so so that's a much different um you know
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:36.280]   connection there so it's safer it's more secure for you to buy stuff also it's much faster so i
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:40.120]   don't have to type anything in well i mean some people make you type something in so like whole
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:44.520]   food strikes me exactly same type it in no matter what i'm like hey i got apple cash this is just
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:51.240]   being boom and i'm and i walk away um and so but it it generally is much faster to to get approved
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.720]   you know to for it to move through and so i just do it out of convenience and then and then a lot
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:00.360]   of friends of mine and i trade money back and forth with apple cash like just text each other money
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:05.240]   and um it's kind of feels like free money even though it's not like it was one second-jader bucks
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:09.080]   so you're much less likely to spend it on rent you know even though you could you could put it
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:13.480]   you know like you could push it back into your account or whatever but you never do you you
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:17.640]   sit there and you have some great lunch you know or some good coffee the good part about the savings
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:23.400]   thing to me is apple's going to be able to work this into a thing okay so like in october we're
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:28.760]   coming out with the ipad m3 and you probably have enough to buy one in these in your apple savings
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:33.400]   because apple cash cart used all year the crazier thing is is that if apple really takes this
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:37.400]   we've talked about this before but if apple takes us the end degree they can build a closed loop
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:43.400]   where they're lending money we're saving money into apple and they're lending that money out to
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:46.280]   the people who are buying their products there's no company in the history of the world that's
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:51.000]   been able to build a closed loop that big um and so it's it's a pretty interesting opportunity for
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:55.400]   apple and it does sound like it does now seem very much like they're sneaking up on it like we're
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:59.880]   just gonna add one little thing one is the nichmos loop yeah it's an infinitless
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:07.080]   st peter don't you call me because i can't go i owe my soul to the old store
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:07.560]   stole
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:16.440]   yeah absolutely in fact uh mckenzie and others say this is the biggest threat not dfi
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:21.960]   the biggest threat to banks is big tech banking because big tech has all this information about
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:27.960]   you it's got the convenience factor uh there's just naturals and we we the banks have not been
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:33.000]   great at keeping their relationship very very positive with their customers and so
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.720]   a lot of customers would dump them in a heartbeat like that's that's the issue is that for big banks
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:42.520]   you know uh they would if apple came out with something there's just a lot of apple users that if
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:46.520]   if they really came out with this and formalized it and you know they they kept on adding those
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:52.120]   services a lot of their customers will just dump out of their current bank because the banks have
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:57.800]   been really i use us a it's all digital took so it's can be all digital right i don't because i don't
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:03.080]   need to go to it go into an office but one of the keys and i wonder if apple could do this is i
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:11.080]   can use an at my atm at any atm and they reimburse atm fees so now i have a huge atm network if apple
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:15.560]   did that i won't go in a minute and usa is probably the one that would hang on to people
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:19.880]   probably longer than almost anybody else because their service actually is pretty good and you know
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:23.720]   they're small like i'm on a co-op you know in redwood or whatever and so that's a that's an easier
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:28.280]   often though those those uh those big ones are just those community co-ops and things
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:33.240]   don't have the best software right yeah i mean arse is pretty good i might the one that i use is
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:37.080]   actually pretty good the um but i will say that like if you're a bank of america or whatever they're
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:40.920]   not your friends yeah they may be friendly but they're not your friends and they will bury you in a
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:46.040]   heartbeat and so the thing is is that and everyone knows that the bank will bury them you know and so
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:51.960]   because of that the uh you know if apple comes out with something that you know we just have a much
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:56.360]   different most apple users have a much different relationship with apple than they do with their bank
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:50:01.240]   and there's a pretty high probability that they would keep on you know and apple has the luxury of
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:05.560]   not you know setting the bar high you know you have to have an apple card right now to do this so
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:09.480]   it's not just apple cash you have to have an apple card so that's a you know that's not they don't
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:14.360]   have to deal with as many problems as well as as banks would so that's that's to their advantage as
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:19.960]   well yeah we would love to see the end of will's for it would be a happy happy thing i mean that's
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:24.120]   the whole thing is that these companies to squeeze a little bit more money out of all of us for so
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:29.480]   long and these banks have done you know and then we we bailed them out you know the greatest the
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:33.640]   greatest theft of money from the for poor the rich effort so um so this is the threat of big tech
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:38.440]   though it's certainly been the threat in streaming is because they don't have to make money on that
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:44.920]   service they're making money in many other ways they they can compete they can compete against you
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:49.880]   and this is in a way as an antitrust thing because they are so big and have so many revenue streams
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:55.480]   how is a bank going to compete against them well the bank would have to i mean again they have a
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:58.760]   lot of the bank have a lot of advantages of infrastructure and so on so forth that they don't
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:04.120]   have i think that it would be hard i think that antitrust apple would have to get pretty big to
[01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:07.240]   have to worry about antitrust with a bank with the banks because the banks are pretty
[01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:11.960]   into well and they're using Goldman Sachs so and that's the other issue banks are very heavily
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:17.240]   regulated apple doesn't want to be regulated as a bank well they would let Goldman do that right
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:22.040]   and and also but apple also doesn't probably won't get into all the crazy things that other banks do
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:27.320]   like savings you know like hedge funds and you know all that stuff they don't they can just go
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:32.680]   right down the middle and just deal with people just using it and just and just pushing through so
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:38.520]   well exactly like an amazon prime uh tv it's just right it's a thing they don't have to make money on
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:45.240]   it it's just a thing that makes people spend money on them uh speaking of tv and streaming you may be
[01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:51.240]   wondering where do we stand with nfl sunday ticket it's the last nfl package that has yet to be allocated
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:59.560]   uh apple of course a big bidder into this um the only remaining broadcast package that hasn't
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:07.400]   been renewed until 2030 disney amazon and others also bidding for it and according to cnbc the
[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:14.280]   issue between apple and the nfl is not money of course not it's that apple doesn't like the
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:23.000]   restrictions the nfl puts on the networks uh apple wants to do better stuff at eq said we aren't
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:28.040]   interested in buying sports rights there's all kinds of this is it the last uh this week at the
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:32.360]   paly center for media panel in new york there's all kinds of capabilities we're going to be able to
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:36.920]   do together because we have everything together and so if i have a great idea i don't have to think
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:41.320]   about okay well my contract or the deal of interest will allow this in other words he doesn't want to
[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:50.520]   be constrained by the nfl as to what they can do i'm sure that their mls deal is much lucy goosier right
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:55.160]   because they've got a 10 year deal with major league soccer and i'm sure they can do all sorts
[01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:58.600]   of cool things that's what you can do anything yeah that's what you were saying and so they can
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:03.240]   innovate i mean that's the big thing is they can they can innovate and you know the nfl is a
[01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:09.080]   is i'm sure they're bidding on but they uh you know the the mls is is much will allow them to experiment
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:12.840]   they need frankly they need to have more than the nfl needs apple
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:17.560]   sanif nfl is in a much more like better power position uh but but you know that apple has a
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:23.800]   lot of money you know and so so they can that that's useful for the nfl too and so if apple the big
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:29.320]   the real exciting thing for apple if they're able to pull it off is to have their foot into nfl
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:34.120]   and then innovate in mls innovate those you know and then be able to transfer those those
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:40.840]   innovations and mls to nfl you know within a season would be pretty exciting for apple and so and it
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:45.160]   would be pretty useful for the nfl as well but you know i think that what they don't want to do is be
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:52.680]   yeah limited to um you know terrestrial broadcast limitations roger goo and nfl go ahead
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:59.160]   sir nfl has basically screwed up the last couple of times right okay first of all direct
[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:04.760]   tv that was a lot of direct yeah there's a lot of direct tv subscribers and it didn't really work
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:09.640]   that well which is why direct tv even given it out for free recently right because the play didn't
[01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:14.760]   come out like they thought yeah and then they they tried it with you know Verizon okay we're
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:18.680]   gonna give it to you if you get a Verizon phone because a lot of people got Verizon phones uh no
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:25.400]   not really not as much as you thought right so the way the thing that direct tv was giving you
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:30.120]   for the last couple of years costs them a billion and a half dollars a year a lot a lot
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:35.320]   apple deal is looking at three million i'm three billion right now so we're between
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:41.080]   two and a half to three billion so the one thing by going to apple directly it's not based on the
[01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:48.760]   carrier that has 30 of iphones it's not based on a cable type you know replacement that has say 30
[01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:56.600]   percent of households so many people have apple tv access even if you're android you have apple tv
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:02.360]   access now so the advantage of going to someone like apple apple actually has a lot of weight
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:08.200]   than the nfl but the NFL might do like the record association people did back in the day when we
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:12.200]   were trying to get apple music going they're going to fight because they're still thinking old model
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:16.680]   and apple's trying to bring them to a new model and i think actually actually has more power right
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:21.640]   now because they can prove the amount of heads that they can get into and and if those been
[01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:27.000]   suffering lately not growing like super bowl numbers are horrible because really people just
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:32.520]   go for yeah people are just going for the commercials now the games have been trash i have to say the
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:38.200]   last couple of monday night and thursday night games or have not been fun to watch at all well
[01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:43.400]   not as a razor stand that was like a mopel i bet it did but last night's game was not a great game at
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:49.800]   all i don't know if the nfl's picked poorly for its national broadcast but i would think the nfl is
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:58.600]   the apple of football i mean why which i mean they have a lot of power they're not yeah i
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:04.360]   can't imagine they're hurting so badly you know one step that apple has i don't one stick on sorry
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:08.760]   real quick one step that apple has that the nfl doesn't have is how many people are on their apple
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:15.480]   devices looking for places to steal the streams so they can give them well and according to cnbc
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:20.680]   that's another thing is direct tv is really hoping that whoever i don't know how much cloud they have
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:24.840]   the negotiation because they're not bidding well whoever buys the rights will let them continue to
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:30.920]   sell it to bars which is a is where they do make some money uh or maybe even be a pass through
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:35.560]   so that they can give it to their customers i don't know if that's in the uh equation or not
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:39.080]   and the problem is that tv is it's still got a bunch of blackouts i tried to watch the you know
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:45.160]   try to watch the stealer game yeah so so the so nfl has made a mess let's face it of tv rights
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:49.800]   they've completed all the blackouts that that that have been created around all of these things
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:56.600]   don't make any sense anymore and whether it's mlb or or nfl it's just such a disaster as a user
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:02.280]   you know that i want to pay to watch a show i want to pay to watch uh the stealers get pummeled by
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:08.360]   the bills i mean and and um i'm willing to pay for that and i can't find a place to give them
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:13.960]   anybody money to watch it like it is just that's a disaster bills lost this week so that's okay
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:19.080]   it makes me feel a little better a little better it makes me wonder if the chiefs are that much
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:24.760]   better than those stealers because speaking of upsetting apple tv news the great pumpkin will not
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:34.440]   will not be on tv this year last year apple allowed npr or rather pbs broadcast it uh this
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:43.080]   year you'll have to watch it on apple tv now they are going to have three free dates so uh you can
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:49.800]   watch the great pumpkin october 28th through 31st on apple tv without a subscription is that right
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:56.120]   free window but that's but that's still a big deal the the difference between i have an
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:58:02.040]   i have an internet connection i have uh i have a streaming box i have all this stuff is not as good
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:07.400]   as if i have a tv i can share this with my kids they're they're more i agree i think you don't have
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:11.560]   broadband access and don't have the technology for even having a three dollar dongle on a hundred
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:16.680]   hundred so people have been following this apple bought all the charlie brown shows
[01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:24.040]   you know in the first couple of years let pbs broadcast it on broadcast tv no more broadcast tv
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:30.200]   so i agree this this leaves a lot of people out and i it's a tradition in a lot of families
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:35.080]   it's not just the great pumpkin it's the christmas especially jolly brown thanksgiving and
[01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:40.840]   yeah and it's also bad because i i have to double check but uh when i when i checked this last year
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:45.400]   that year before when this first became a thing they even pulled all these all the stuff of uh
[01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:49.880]   from purchase on like the google play store on a purchase store you have to have a subscription
[01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:54.360]   in order to access this which is absolutely the trend that's going on now where uh you can no
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:58.680]   longer i i often get away without having cable by saying if there is a show that i really really
[01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:04.920]   like like better call salt great all by a season pass on whatever whatever tv store that i want
[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:09.320]   and i'll just get i'll pay twenty dollars and get it for the season for hd and now it's like nope
[01:59:09.320 --> 01:59:13.000]   we don't even want your money we you have to subscribe to our service to get access to this
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:19.400]   and i i always wonder what the calculus is like when you are the managers of of of an intellectual
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:24.520]   property like the like the peanut specials where you're like are we willing to suddenly
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:30.360]   withdraw it from general use and put it behind this wall which will be definitely we can definitely
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:34.440]   see the the paychecks coming in on how much this is going to pay off for us but there's a certain
[01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:39.560]   amount there's a certain degree to which you have to make sure that people are still thinking about
[01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:44.840]   peanuts people are growing up watching these specials as a tradition so that they are even again
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:51.720]   even even i'm like i i'm gonna be home on i'm gonna be home on the halloween i've got like a playlist
[01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:55.880]   of programming they're gonna watch it of course the speed the the the charlie brown special is one of
[01:59:55.880 --> 02:00:00.360]   them and once you break that connection where it just becomes a piece of old television that
[02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:06.520]   people have heard have been ever seen that kind of devalues the the value of of even these classic
[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:13.880]   characters um this is really good apple post the football out from one that charlie brown i was
[02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:19.400]   gonna say that chicken had 21 apple pulls a football out from under charlie brown again
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:28.120]   to all other streamers you get a rock you know it's you know the you know the
[02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:35.240]   you know just curb your enthusiasm for kids yeah so it's i get you know i understand why the charlie
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:40.600]   brown the charl's chilter state would want to cash in and etc etc etc and maybe these shows will not
[02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:45.560]   be watched forever so but it's kind of sad i i don't know if my kids even know what
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:49.320]   char yeah charlie brown it might like i don't know if they they have any
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:55.320]   yeah registration all i mean all i'm saying is that like when i growing up like i had no
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:01:00.280]   conscience no real conscious understanding of who micky mouse the disney characters were
[02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:04.440]   because the only way you can get them is on the disney cable channel they they weren't make or
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:09.560]   they weren't make them a villa for syndication so for me bugs bunny they were the shiz they were
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:14.440]   like and they were absolutely like i grew up knowing these characters loving these characters
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:19.480]   meaning of quote these characters this being part of like my cultural heritage these characters and
[02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:24.200]   these shorts whereas micky mouse was i would occasionally see some toys in a toy store of this
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:29.000]   character that i have heard of but i have no idea what this character's deal is and i would just i
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:35.960]   would just hate it if i would hate if if if characters sort of fade off and die because
[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:41.640]   they really are just like the the property of a very very walled-in channel but you can get
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:48.360]   you can't get it elsewhere that's just that'd be a bummer mmm by the way a little plug for our
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:54.920]   advertiser express vpn and one of our chatters shutter bug says he uses express vpn logs into europe
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:59.960]   the netherlands signs up for nfl game pass and then you can watch any game
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:05.720]   i do that out of indian i found that europe i couldn't get all of them i couldn't get all
[02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:10.760]   the stealer games but if i go through deli with with it the problem really is is that you're still
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:17.800]   streaming from deli and it's real quality isn't that great yeah uh speak it by the way i'm just
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:24.840]   this is a side note but netflix crushed expectations with their quarterly results just announced 2.41
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:32.280]   million subscribers so people were worried about the future of netflix mmm they they shocked the street
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:40.040]   so good i'm glad i guess everybody cares about jeffrey dawmer i don't know why i don't understand
[02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:47.880]   but anyway do you want a polished apple watch ultra i i like the titanium finish but it's matt
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:55.880]   there is a jeweler who will sell you a shined up one you like that that pretty looks pretty
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:03:04.040]   nice yeah uh this is uh debilis luxe watch plating prose they're a jeweler in arizona
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:15.320]   uh it's not cheap doubles the price uh of the uh apple watch but uh it does look very pretty i
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:20.920]   guess they have to strip off the coating and then polish it up i don't think they have to show you
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:26.840]   on a different angle i don't want to i hope they don't uh have to take it apart i don't i don't know
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:32.120]   i don't know they're coming out they kind of have to yeah it looks nice do you think so i think they
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:36.040]   could just put liquid how about the glass and then polish it with the with maybe that's it
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:40.760]   the the watch started as a new apple watch ultra made out of titanium dull silver finish
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:46.840]   electro treated to remove previous finish including the orange button color and then deep polished
[02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:52.040]   for the mirror finish so you lose your orange button thing it's a stealth oh no maybe they paint
[02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:58.760]   it back on because there it is i just don't see myself doing that i was happy with my watch i'm not
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:02.840]   gonna i'm not gonna eat it buffed i will say something there are people who are like posting
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:06.840]   like oh my god i've had this this new ultra watch for just like four days and look at all the nicks
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:11.240]   and scratches on the on the on the the pain or the coating of the thing and number one this is
[02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:15.320]   supposed i think this is supposed to be a watch that like bears it's yeah you want one with good
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:19.240]   honest words that you're out there adventuring but but if there are people who are wearing it
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:25.160]   just as sort of an a stylish watch if it looks like it's been baffed up like after six or seven
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:30.200]   months maybe that is something that those consumers would get upset about and maybe a treatment like
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:35.640]   this would make it look a little bit better um i'm sad the mind is not dinged up but clearly i have
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:45.000]   not been yeah i've not been the people that are the people that buy a land Rover and then like
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:50.280]   drop it to the ground i'm like uh you could pick any vehicle in the world but the one that designed
[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:55.400]   the climb mountain didn't be like lowered it so they need to go away do people really lower
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:05:03.720]   drain traverse that's crazy yes that's just nice rain Rover is bad enough the land Rover is
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:08.920]   worse because that's the one that's a legit beast right like it's a hundred thousand dollar rock
[02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:13.800]   crawler and then you just shrink it to the ground you know for coolness i guess i should do that buy
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:17.160]   the three hundred thousand dollar callek and just get it over with you know
[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:23.880]   well maybe that's like another opportunity so you have this this jeweler who can like strip it
[02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:27.960]   off and make it look more like a stylish sort of like polished watch maybe like for
[02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:32.600]   nine hundred dollars they will take it and they will not basically they will ding it up
[02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:38.680]   specifically so that looks like you've been rock i keep in mind with it like they can call it the
[02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:47.480]   the stolen valor edition i love it apple watch the stolen valor edition uh metta has to sell jiffy
[02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:55.560]   giffy jiffy this gets into like i did ask my my daughter i was like are the are the gifts uh
[02:05:55.560 --> 02:06:00.520]   out she's like oh yeah that's awesome yeah as i was like something that
[02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:04.920]   netta has to give up something that no one cares about it uk anti-trust watch dog says you can't

[02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:13.800]   is a lot better but i asked that you know i i my gauge is always when i'm hanging out with my

[02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:22.280]   like you can't that's like i still say it but i'm like but i just got used to it and i just got into
[02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:27.160]   gifts and i've got really creative about it i know i know it's uh Alex Alex have you ever have you ever
[02:06:27.160 --> 02:06:32.440]   consider that maybe like your kids just want to keep the old man off of like their favorite social
[02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:38.120]   media i read it i read it on the internet and i confirmed it with the kids and they confirmed that
[02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:46.040]   that's old from Jason O'Grady comes this leaked apple memo oh Grady's power page now that now
[02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:50.040]   that we know the way to O'Grady's power page we're gonna have more O'Grady's stories in here
[02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:58.280]   leaked apple memo acknowledges iPhone 14 sim card software error per leaked memo the company says
[02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:05.640]   some users of its iPhone 14 14 plus 14 pro and 14 pro max may see an error saying sim not
[02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:11.880]   supported on their device and then the unit freezes apple says it's investigating the issue
[02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:17.240]   notes it's not a hardware problem adding the customer should keep their software up to date
[02:07:17.240 --> 02:07:23.640]   i don't know how you would do that once your phone is frozen meantime they advise you wait a few
[02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:29.800]   minutes to see if the message disappears should the message remain apple says do not attempt to
[02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:37.160]   restore the device go to the apple store or an authorized service provider the issue can be resolved
[02:07:37.160 --> 02:07:47.560]   i presume there will be an update with ios 16.1 so yeah that's fine the the iPhone 14 the 14 pro
[02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:52.440]   it's been relatively drama free as it has actually yeah so yeah that's that's good news for everybody
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:08:00.680]   people this this is affecting all right i think let's see what else
[02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:09.640]   yeah you know i think oh the one other thing i guess is i don't even know how important this is
[02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:18.120]   but apple has apparently had to put on hold using memory chips from yank c memory technologies is
[02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:25.480]   subsequent to the us governments restriction on all Chinese chip technology
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:33.400]   so apple does use those memory chips in its i-phones or was planning to i'm sure they have
[02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:39.720]   an alternative choice but yeah just that's so that was an expensive move because once you
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:45.880]   certify stuff to go into an iPad that is a lot of work yeah and also it's it's another supplier of
[02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:54.520]   of of memory that is often what can constrain availability of the hardware itself once if
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:58.760]   there's a limited availability of memory that's a big problem for all the way down the supply chain
[02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:03.960]   so that's interesting move apple's probably not happy about that all right we'll take a little
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:11.160]   break when we come back your picks of the week please gentlemen prepare them meanwhile a word
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:21.320]   from our sponsor the folks i love at it pro tv we have been friends with don and Tim since they
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:27.640]   started it pro tv nine years ago and i've just watched them just grow and do so well they've
[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:31.640]   been advertising on our shows since then but i don't want to take credit for it i think they
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:38.760]   just have a great product and and because they have seven studios now we went out to their
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:43.480]   old grand opening in Gainesville a couple years ago running Monday through Friday all day

[02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:52.040]   recording we already have isolated audio but the dope part about isovidio is going to mean
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:57.960]   and the show like ours i could have a video track for each one of us uh lovely elderly men
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:05.240]   and i don't have to ask people to do a a uh double-ender which is you know old school term for

[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:32.760]   but it's not my pick of the week i know it isn't i just but i wanted to give you i wanted to give
[02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:38.520]   you a plug i appreciate it doc works with them thank you and uh and uh you know i just i think
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:43.880]   it's a great product many of us here at twit use it so i know they that's what they really cool that
[02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:47.960]   scooter mentioned in the chat yeah scooter mentioned in the chat because somebody was asking about
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:51.640]   getting stuff out of an iphone and it's like yeah there's this cool program called phone view for
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:56.440]   me cam i was like i know some people over there yeah actually um but we recommend phone view all
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:01.160]   the time that's a great product uh they're still doing it because it's not like featured in their
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:08.280]   page anymore so good it's still around been around for that in skype car recorder been around forever
[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:14.520]   yeah anyway uh and uh uh alike the funny thing is i'm not going to spoil you but i got your pick
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:20.360]   yesterday i literally just needed a foundation and i'm in love with it anyway so this is the uh
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:28.520]   envy 88 plus this is from shore and for people that are making this smaller uh content for your
[02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:34.360]   your iz your tik tok your instagram your twitter's or even just her own video content basically what
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:40.680]   it is is it's a microphone for sure as you know they made really quality mics it fits right on top
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:46.680]   of your phone comes with this whole little contraption with the monfoto pixie and the little adapter
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:51.960]   comes with a requisite cable to put your headphones in here what i like about this guy is it has
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:59.240]   adjustable patterns so if i'm doing an interview i will go like this turn it sideways switch it from
[02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:05.960]   stereo or mono cardioid i can switch it into a bidirectional cardioid and so it'll pick up both
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:11.640]   sides so i can talk here record myself but this camera is recording that person so in a program
[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:17.160]   like you know filming pro uh double take or whatever they call it that would be able to work but it
[02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:24.280]   has really nice EQ compression stuff all built in it really changes the way the audio sounds on your
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:31.480]   mobile recordings it's not super expensive um and i think it's a big big upgrade if you're doing a
[02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:36.680]   lot of recording using your mobile device and you don't need a rig to base a car jumping up you
[02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:41.800]   know poke out new and say friend like the ipad but it's really really incredible comes with
[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:48.920]   everything you need rolls up into a little chef's sleeve like such and it has been super handy
[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:54.840]   over you know the last two months of traveling nice it sounds i might have to get this for
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:17:02.280]   for Henry this looks good yeah oh yeah Henry would love this well as you know his videos sound is
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:07.800]   really important you know he uses some hundred percent some like off-brand shotgun like that i've
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:15.320]   never even heard of but his sound is like and once you know the difference is it sounds way better
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:19.720]   you think so Henry to email uncle and i can put him in contact with someone that's shorter than
[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:23.480]   might be able to help him because he has a decent size following oh my god he gets everything free
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:28.760]   now i was i was looking he's got like 10 lights around i said where did you get those you know how
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:35.400]   they just uh i met the guy at the party he sent him over it's like what everything everything's free
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:42.120]   now you get to a certain point in uh in influencer status and you know this always bugs me rich
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:47.240]   people get free stuff normal poor people we got to pay for everything rich people they give them
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:52.920]   everything free they don't need it wait it give it to us okay sorry this is so true it's really so
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:18:00.440]   true it's crazy uh anti-annoco we'll get to Alex is picking a bit but first anti-annoco you're

[02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:14.280]   just a little light and bow tie it's very subtle it's just a little lightning it's it you're just
[02:22:14.280 --> 02:22:19.640]   giving off a shibboleth to other Bowie fans to simply point at you and go yep dude it's the hand sign
[02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:29.160]   the secret signal uh that's kind of awesome Alex Lindsey your pick of the week yeah so um i have
[02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:34.920]   for my work i've been using a lot of QR codes um and it's been a little bit like you start when you
[02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:40.280]   start i'm trying to save everybody little trouble with the with the QR codes you'll search QR codes
[02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:46.520]   and what you'll see is a bunch of URLs that'll let you create QR codes for free and then when you do
[02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:52.280]   that just remember they're pushing them through them to your URL if you and then they'll they want
[02:22:52.280 --> 02:22:58.040]   you to pay for it and pay pay them on going Lee you're giving up all your privacy everybody uses
[02:22:58.040 --> 02:23:04.360]   it privacy yeah it's it's really a sham and so what you want to do is buy an app that does this and on
[02:23:04.360 --> 02:23:10.200]   the Mac there's a thing called QR factory which is what i use to build these so um so anyway yes
[02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:15.400]   this is QR factory and i think i can actually put a QR so the big thing is is that if you you know
[02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:21.080]   you can put up this little QR code on the bottom and people can use that and the big the big thing is
[02:23:21.080 --> 02:23:25.320]   is that you own it and of course i gotta move it see like this is this is what i'm gonna watch this
[02:23:26.280 --> 02:23:32.520]   oh i was gonna move it's dense oh that's cool anyway um that's cool so yeah you could put a logo in
[02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:37.560]   there or something right you put a logo in the center you can put text below it um you can do you
[02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:43.800]   you know you can redesign you can make it more robust or less robust if you're um uh you know it
[02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:47.560]   depending on how how complicated the big thing is to keep them as simple as possible so if you're
[02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:52.920]   gonna do a QR code what you want to do is i use a shortener like bitly but i also just build
[02:23:53.640 --> 02:23:59.880]   mostly for work what i do is i go to hover i get a new URL that is something really short
[02:23:59.880 --> 02:24:05.400]   dot something um that kind of makes sense for the show and then i you know for seven bucks i just
[02:24:05.400 --> 02:24:10.600]   build that and then we build redirects from there that way we kind of own the whole pipeline um but
[02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:15.080]   this is the best one i found on the Mac um and it gives you lots of options you might have calendars
[02:24:15.080 --> 02:24:20.920]   you might have URLs you know text social all those things that you want to create and so um those are
[02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:26.200]   uh you know those are you know it really gives you the control that you want to build these out and so
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:33.800]   um let me just let me just scan the code that Alex has put up on the screen i'm just really curious
[02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:38.680]   what i'm just going to do it is a serious uh recommendation i just want to say before you
[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:44.040]   if it's if it's a music video i'm going to be very disappointed oh my golly gosh
[02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:50.680]   there you go okay what do you have to do it so anyway here's the funny thing the reason i got
[02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:56.520]   into this i brought it up was kind of saying that rick rolling is the dad jokes of QR codes it's
[02:24:56.520 --> 02:25:03.000]   like it's great though it's so great so so what what happened was a twitter and so i use i so
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:07.480]   in all seriousness i build QR codes with QR factory this is what i use i just thought it would be fun
[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:10.680]   to have something i couldn't think of what to put in here so i put this in because no that's
[02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:17.560]   person to talk about someone on twitter talked about it they they crocheted a um a QR code to
[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:22.440]   rick roll people and then just put it behind them in their set and they said when they're
[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:26.840]   in a meeting almost every they said like almost every meeting like someone someone gets hit with
[02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:30.040]   it you know like because they're curious what the what the crochet is and i was like i have to do
[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:35.400]   that for my new set so um anytime when i eventually do something other than gray i'll um i'll do that
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:40.760]   so anyway um but uh it is uh you know it's a good it's a good tool it gives you all the tools that
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:44.360]   all the things you need and and again it's just hard to find something that is going to actually
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:48.680]   generate the link and it shows you the raw code and you're not going through something else now
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:53.720]   it is a subscription i think it's like 15 bucks a year or something so you know but it's it is uh
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:59.960]   it it works really well it's solid it'll output EPS PDF as well as TIFF and Ping so you can have
[02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:04.120]   transparency but you can also send it out to what i'm planning to do which is send it out to a router
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:09.640]   to route out to route out the whole thing so i can have a little plaque in the back that that
[02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:14.120]   people can either you know it'll just look like part of the part of the background but um if you're
[02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:19.640]   looking for QR don't use the web don't use the web yeah how hard would it be to write i mean i've
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:26.440]   got to look at the QR code it's pretty easy to write is it so and Alex Alex is right i was
[02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:32.360]   basically going to redo a code and i had recently did one and it worked out fine everybody liked it
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:37.480]   it was a really pretty code so i go back to go make a next one and they're like oh first one the one
[02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:42.920]   you had is expired doesn't work you can't delete it yeah and to make the next one is $40 a month
[02:26:42.920 --> 02:26:49.480]   and i was like words i can't say on the stream so i'm looking and i speak from experience this is
[02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:54.040]   all of these sites are distinct yeah great they get you all these sites are the same here's the
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:58.280]   funny thing so i cure our monkey and a bunch of the other ones that are out there that do this
[02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:04.440]   stuff for free if you look at the bottom they're all from the same basic place yeah right so they
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:09.000]   look like their competitors but they're the same thing reskinned in about 20 different sites and
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:15.000]   so i go wait a minute cure code is not very hard to generate and back in 1994 when
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:21.000]   masa hito from dencel made it up it was something that we used to just write in code before so i went
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:26.280]   looking and i found this term really thing yesterday oh and you can do it you can do it definitely do
[02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:29.720]   it with a terminal the main thing is is this one just gives you a nice gooey that you can sit there
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:32.920]   and do all the things you want to do and change the things you want and throw the things in and
[02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:36.680]   you don't have to it's really quick and easy and especially if you want to customize it a little
[02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:41.240]   bit make it a little rounded add that logo add the other things it's just a lot easier to do it for
[02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:46.120]   the money it's pretty it's pretty it's pretty good tool but to your point that's exactly what i got
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:51.960]   caught in and i we had somebody in office hours who put that QR code on their business card oh and
[02:27:51.960 --> 02:27:56.200]   now they have to pay that subscription because all those people have business cards you know so
[02:27:56.200 --> 02:28:00.440]   so really whether you can't get another one make sure that you're using one that's generated a
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:05.960]   direct link to whatever you want it to go to and again i like to do it through a through a link
[02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:09.960]   so that i control that link and i can keep on redirecting it wherever i want it to go
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:13.960]   so it's not going to the raw raw location but you may decide you don't want to use something
[02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:19.640]   like bitley or or or something like that but you can build a URL that's that bounces it to where
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:24.840]   you want it to go and uh yeah if you're a programmer there are python i bet there's apple script there's
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:31.000]   lots of ways to generate QR code if you do one side note one side note sorry one side note that
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:34.280]   this is the best way to do it because you do absolutely want to control the URL you want to make
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:38.440]   sure that not only not only you're not paying subscription fee but also that the traffic that you
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:43.560]   are creating is not being sent through a third party if you do have to get something in a pinch and
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:48.920]   you don't time to search for whatever there is a QR code generator as the standard export sheet
[02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:55.400]   in in google chrome obviously google will know what that URL is but if of all the options that are
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:29:01.320]   not as good as anonymity people google are google already knows who you are google already knows
[02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:06.600]   where you've been so again in a pinch if you decide that i just need to spit out a QR code i don't have
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:13.480]   time to find the right tool it will you probably already have one uh yeah well can canva does it too
[02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:19.400]   now if you need something really quickly but i trust me i think this thing is where i picked
[02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:23.640]   this dope and the reason why i went and did it did the subscription everything being able to insert
[02:29:23.640 --> 02:29:29.240]   a logo and like you make them colorize for various different prints and things like that that's where
[02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:34.280]   it comes in handy because it's really weird that the us is catching this now when i was in college
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:39.720]   back in o6 QR code was everywhere and you did it for everything when we got it to iphone everybody
[02:29:39.720 --> 02:29:44.680]   made these weird apps that they wanted you to pay for to be able to scan the code so finally apple
[02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:52.760]   and android build it into the the camera and then now here it is way late you know almost 20 years
[02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:59.080]   later the us is like oh look QR codes it's a thing it's like oh that's funny yeah yeah i thought i
[02:29:59.080 --> 02:30:05.240]   thought these will never take off this is a terrible idea this is as bad as you know the qcat and bar
[02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:10.680]   codes but it really has taken off it's it's as soon as it's as soon as apple put it in the phone
[02:30:10.680 --> 02:30:15.240]   like that's the power that apple has is the apple put it into the iphone into into the camera app
[02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:19.400]   where you can just pick it up and take a picture so everything took off like it just you do yeah
[02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:24.120]   do it for android like just just the ability to it's it's so good for everybody because there's
[02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:29.240]   there's a poster for there's a there's a bank c exhibit in new york city that closes in a couple
[02:30:29.240 --> 02:30:33.640]   months didn't have time to see it when i was in new york last week i saw the poster for it i might
[02:30:33.640 --> 02:30:38.120]   not necessarily have stopped long enough to write down the information or really actioned on it
[02:30:38.120 --> 02:30:41.800]   apart from taking a picture but hey look this qr code on the poster bip okay great now i've got
[02:30:41.800 --> 02:30:45.800]   the book mark now i've got all the details great i move on and when it's there it's there it's just a
[02:30:46.360 --> 02:30:52.200]   it's it's clums it's it's like the uniform it's like the the uniform resource locator it's not pretty
[02:30:52.200 --> 02:30:57.560]   it's not terribly user user efficient but damn it's a standard that everybody appreciates and
[02:30:57.560 --> 02:31:02.120]   understands that makes that's what makes powerful the people that's always everybody uses it and so
[02:31:02.120 --> 02:31:05.720]   easy because i do it on we put it on big screens and on those big screens we just put it if you want
[02:31:05.720 --> 02:31:11.400]   to ask a question just put it there and boom it just it's so it the response is so high like if you
[02:31:11.400 --> 02:31:15.560]   watch this video that we thought it would be so funny to link you to because it's 19
[02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:23.400]   i love it what was it the dad joke i've uh the it is the dad joke on the internet it's like oh god
[02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:28.760]   i put i put the link in the run down leo but it's the story of the ricko and i literally just
[02:31:28.760 --> 02:31:37.800]   watched this on saturday it's only the story and and what's amazing is rick embraced it and he's a
[02:31:37.800 --> 02:31:43.960]   don't cat like he is funny because i've known about him being the buttered his joke for so long
[02:31:43.960 --> 02:31:48.120]   but like seeing that interview for the first time i've seen him interviewed in forever he's a
[02:31:48.120 --> 02:31:54.600]   legitimately don't cat and it's worth the watch it is the story of the ricko actually really
[02:31:54.600 --> 02:31:59.080]   don't cat yeah exactly whatever that is show title sorry
[02:32:00.440 --> 02:32:07.240]   see i already i already graphic for the show title so of microbacon microbacon we're gonna have
[02:32:07.240 --> 02:32:13.800]   to fight over that you made a micro let's see microbake oh geez oh like i know that is so good
[02:32:13.800 --> 02:32:21.320]   me and mid journey we sat and we made a new i made a microbacon i probably want to cook that another
[02:32:21.320 --> 02:32:29.560]   five minutes on high i should have typed that into diffusion bay and see what it came with exactly
[02:32:29.560 --> 02:32:37.640]   that's funny because i already made a qr code for microbacon so there oh there you go scan that
[02:32:37.640 --> 02:32:45.160]   buddy so all right all right this is a python script by the way that you can download and and
[02:32:45.160 --> 02:32:49.800]   make qr codes it's not as cute and fun as your pick which is a wonderful pick but
[02:32:49.800 --> 02:32:55.640]   this is this is just running it on your computer let me see if it won't know yep i think that
[02:32:55.640 --> 02:33:02.280]   basically basically it's if you if you if you scan it it says search microbacon
[02:33:02.280 --> 02:33:11.560]   cuz me mike i'll show you i'll show you how you do this you can do this in in your command line qr
[02:33:11.560 --> 02:33:24.840]   what should we do uh Alex lindsey is the dad joke of the internet and then we send that out to
[02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:34.760]   Alex ping and there you go and then just open that Alex ping up in the in the qr code and let's see
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:40.360]   scan that what does it say fun with qr codes ladies and gentlemen
[02:33:40.360 --> 02:33:48.760]   it's interesting it's bigger the more you put in there it's kind of fun dad juice with weight
[02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:58.520]   butler ladies and gentlemen this concludes the next one what what did you get it put up a picture
[02:33:58.520 --> 02:34:04.760]   alan from club twit we that's great there you go that works great it works great it's exactly
[02:34:04.760 --> 02:34:13.160]   how it's supposed to work cqr codes will the fun never end we can't have nice things never thought
[02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:21.720]   i'd say that that's Andy and i go when are you gonna be on wgbh in boston next i'm off this week but
[02:34:21.720 --> 02:34:30.840]   i'm on next thursday a day early at at 12 45 p.m. eastern time go to wgbhnews.org to stream it live
[02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:36.680]   or later or go to do wgbh news on youtube to watch the video in much the same sort of set and
[02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:41.800]   surroundings only i don't wear my headphones because i don't know because because i can i can i can
[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:46.520]   suffer with earbuds for like a half an hour i also that if you want to see like if you want to see
[02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:50.440]   move without the hat without the earphones good opportunity but the same backdrop and uh
[02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:57.160]   Alex is i'm sorry Andy's hat today is a memento from the hayward fire department
[02:34:57.160 --> 02:35:04.360]   yes a listener actually sent me a job coat was the warmest thing i i own in it's it's like when
[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:09.080]   the hate goes out this is like great stuff and this hat which i i realized belatedly that i have to
[02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:13.000]   be careful wearing outside because i only belated really oh people might think that i'm an actual
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:18.360]   firefighter hey hey there's a fire over there quick they just wow i think the sideburns say
[02:35:18.360 --> 02:35:26.200]   fire fire they say 1882 firefighter but they say firefighter yeah yes thank you Andrew what
[02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:31.320]   which is great 1882 it means a great uh what what's your insurance coverage for for this fire
[02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:37.400]   because i'm only i'm i'm only the private private fire company for company exactly oh my insurance
[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:46.040]   uh mr. Alex Lindsey 090.media or office hours.duck global what have you been talking about these
[02:35:46.040 --> 02:35:51.560]   days so today we talked about presentations and i talked about you know not using so much text thank
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:56.440]   you let's do some pictures thank you pictures yeah i was like i was like i don't want to do that um
[02:35:56.440 --> 02:36:01.080]   and uh we talked we had a good time with that and then uh we had a great conversation yesterday
[02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:05.960]   about esports like how what's the business you know what's the business of esports just how does it

[02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:19.160]   it i learned something every day yeah like every single day i've got 900 and sometimes it's like
[02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:24.840]   a clubhouse it's great yeah it's really cool it's really office hours dot global and thank you so
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:30.280]   much i love seeing you doc rock you've always been a great resource for all sorts of stuff now we
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:37.400]   know how the apple genius thinks uh youtube.com/docrock he's on e-cam he's on the twitter is
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:45.640]   d-o-c-r-o-c-k what else is up anything you want to plug man uh just been busy working on this uh
[02:37:45.640 --> 02:37:51.480]   new podcasting show with um my co-host Katie she also works for me at e-cam she's our marketing
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:56.520]   director but we're basically talking to people who are wanting all of this time to get into the
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:38:02.040]   podcasting game but didn't really know where to start or afraid of the tech or whatever so we call
[02:38:02.040 --> 02:38:07.640]   it the flow and it's basically how to go from conception to getting your podcasts out because
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:12.600]   those of us that have been doing this forever this is just fun and we always known it but so many
[02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:18.840]   new people are jumping into the game and they don't know how great it is so i'm happy to see more
[02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:23.400]   people finally getting into podcasting and sharing their stories so we wanted to give them an easy
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:27.960]   way to do so and so yeah come and check us out on the flow the flow find it wherever
[02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:36.520]   better podcasts are stored yep my line is wherever podcast getting is got getting is got
[02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:42.440]   get the gotten nice do you do you start off saying do not try to make money in podcasting i
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:46.920]   hope you say that right up right yeah i keep trying to tell people that like i told you that
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:51.880]   ran away if that that that is that is a that is a great goal to set you will definitely achieve
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:56.360]   that goal you can come from there but just achieve the goal set the goal of not making any money at
[02:38:56.360 --> 02:39:01.880]   this i had a great conversation with somebody i revere a great radio legend we're going back and
[02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:05.960]   forth all sorts of exciting ideas and then i mentioned just off handling you know there's no
[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:14.440]   money in this and i haven't heard from him since so so it's probably the thing you should say up front
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:19.480]   i guess is what i'm saying there's no money in this yes people misunderstand that they think
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:23.000]   they think because it's cereal and you know a couple of the other things that came out like
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:27.880]   this is a lot of money and i was like nom and the jonathan thing is different and so what we've
[02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:32.680]   been teaching which is funny because i still say you're one of the very first pioneers i'm teaching
[02:39:32.680 --> 02:39:38.120]   people to start with like video and then pull your podcast from that oh you've always done it this
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:44.600]   way and when we figure out what 18 years running eight years it's the thing that has so my speaking
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:49.720]   engagement is this last couple of months at content marketing world and podcast movement
[02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:54.840]   and people in video was teaching people to start with video first from a podcast perspective
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:40:00.520]   and i swear your name came up so often it's kind of funny and i'm like yeah because it's been
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:04.840]   Leo's been doing it since day one and it is probably the best way because how we can see each
[02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:11.400]   other when we come i love it i love it it's a much it's a much more convenient way to do it now
[02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:16.120]   back in the day you needed to have a Alex around to set all this stuff up but nowadays things
[02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:21.640]   the e-cam and our contemporaries anybody can do this now so yeah time to get in people
[02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:27.400]   although ironically it was 2005 Alex Lindsey and i did the first Mac breaks as video
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:37.640]   it was crazy correct it was nuts but it was video first and then we i said i said well can we do a
[02:40:37.640 --> 02:40:44.360]   audio only podcast Mac break weekly and Alex very kindly let us do that and then eventually like
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:49.320]   by 2008 we went back and started doing video again but not as not the high quality video that
[02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:54.360]   Alex does not yeah it was funny when we did the first one hey well the first one came out really
[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:58.520]   fast you know because we shot it all with an EX1 and it was just all handheld and Emory Wells
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:05.320]   and Amber MacArthur and Leo and yeah and so we we we covered the Mac world and then that week we
[02:41:05.320 --> 02:41:12.360]   shot 20 some episodes but but i didn't realize how much trouble keen tenetty 444 footage
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:18.920]   in 2005 would be in a long time and so the episode two is the road to tenetty p because leo was like
[02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:24.360]   i'm getting these angry emails i'm like where's the next episode you know i was like oh gonna get
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:30.040]   one out here here here's one and that's still the most popular episode exist anywhere is it on
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:37.160]   youtube is it it's on youtube i think yeah but i i think i remember the old episodes from back then
[02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:42.440]   yeah i remember walking through mac mac world expo tells you how old it was
[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:47.880]   walking through max world expo with Emory and yeah that was really fun i think brand because
[02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:52.520]   also that we had i think the next year we had Justine i think just on the next one yeah
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:59.080]   yeah it's good those were the days my friends there's no money in podcast
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:05.000]   just don't look at what other people are doing so many so many great show champs today there's a
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:09.720]   there's a lot of money in podcasting just like there's a lot of money in the lottery yeah exactly
[02:42:09.720 --> 02:42:14.600]   it's really that's a better way to put it some people know who's in is how do you get it out
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:19.720]   yeah yeah exactly every every single time i've started podcast with people my mindset has always
[02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:24.440]   been i will do this for absolutely i will expect to get make absolutely no money on this for one
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:28.840]   year right after one year i get to decide whether hey look we're actually making money or
[02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:33.080]   be i'm enjoying this enough that this is a good use of my time i don't mind not making money off
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:38.440]   it so yeah you this is definitely a long long term investment of time so this it is on our
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:47.400]   mac break feed episode one from january 27th 2006 oh well i think this is ours right it's the
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:52.920]   problem there's so many that's here here is yours i guess this is yours because it has the music and
[02:42:52.920 --> 02:42:58.440]   everything i didn't realize we that's mac break one we've had that music ever since yeah wow there's
[02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:03.320]   amber this is all your this is your production yeah yeah
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:09.800]   i shouldn't show this because you're probably embarrassed at this point that's by how dark your
[02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:17.480]   hair is i know exactly very first episode i remember these oh my god they were so good
[02:43:17.480 --> 02:43:23.240]   something i'm very excited about uh by weekly maybe even more often mac and tosh show all max
[02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:33.320]   all the time uh by weekly by weekly we were optimistic wow thank you for finding that patrick
[02:43:33.320 --> 02:43:39.640]   bellah handy put it up in the uh in the uh discord that is one way somewhere i'm not really
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:45.240]   subsidizing not making money but subsidizing our efforts keeping the lights on keeping the staff
[02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:49.400]   employed is with our club twit and that's where the discord uh lives if you're not a club twit
[02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:55.800]   member i want to just put in a plug here my pick of the week seven dollars a month get all of our
[02:43:55.800 --> 02:44:01.640]   shows ad free get shows that are not yet publicly released like hands-on mac with mica sergeant hands
[02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:06.440]   on windows with ball the rot the untitled linux show with jonathan benet the gizfiz with dikki
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:12.120]   barterlo all of these are in the club only you also get access to the discord which is so much fun
[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:18.680]   so much fun uh it is more than just can talk talking about the shows that are ongoing
[02:44:18.680 --> 02:44:24.760]   it is talking about all sorts of stuff from gaming we have a our own minecraft servers to uh to
[02:44:24.760 --> 02:44:30.600]   to beer making and everything geeks are into plus you get the twit plus feed with material that did
[02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:37.560]   not appear uh on any other platform for most of the time for good reason if you're interested
[02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:46.040]   twit.tv/club it really helps us uh keep uh everything going and and i hate to be glum
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:53.640]   but uh people advertisers in our area anyway uh are getting very nervous about the future
[02:44:53.640 --> 02:44:59.560]   economy and so there's been a sudden drop off in advertising revenue and in fact i think next
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:06.600]   year looks particularly bleak so this club is becoming more and more important to our future
[02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:13.400]   survival if you like twit you want to see twit continue in the years to come twit.tv/club we
[02:45:13.400 --> 02:45:17.560]   appreciate it next week this week in rice cookers will be our new show right doc we're gonna it's
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:22.840]   gonna be great fun that's it's a great thing i want to know that one i know it's coming that's
[02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:28.280]   what i want to do uh office hours because uh you know we it's just do whatever you're interested in
[02:45:28.280 --> 02:45:34.600]   is the is the deal on that right you don't have advertisers or anything no it's just a labor of love
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:40.280]   yeah pretty impressive you can you entire episode you realize that Roger Ebert wrote an entire book
[02:45:40.280 --> 02:45:45.960]   on cooking in a rice cooker i have it what not just rice what because he was a big fan like you
[02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:49.800]   would go you would go i would go to his house and he has this amazing kitchen and then there'd be
[02:45:49.800 --> 02:45:57.640]   this like dollar store like rice cooker making stew and yeah i i have i'm buying it and i have
[02:45:57.640 --> 02:46:03.000]   a rice cooker that is dedicated to only cooking stuff that's not rice so it's like you're gonna
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:07.560]   want to mix and match them so i have one that's a rice cooker but yeah so yeah it's a it's a great
[02:46:07.560 --> 02:46:15.320]   book yep the the pot and how to use it the mystery and throw bets of the and it's written by it's
[02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:21.400]   written like Roger Ebert writes so you'll enjoy it that's insane it's really good that is crazy
[02:46:21.400 --> 02:46:27.400]   um i'm sending this to my my katie right now my my partner i'm gonna send this to her
[02:46:27.400 --> 02:46:32.680]   because she would just crack up laughing because Karen yoko published it no no that's that's the
[02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:38.440]   white bee i'm not katie's my boss technically white she's not she used to publish cookbooks
[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:43.160]   and so it'd be funny when she sees that Roger Ebert actually had a rice cooker cook and this
[02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:49.080]   is the rice you told me to get and i just thought i'd mention this because it's not too expensive
[02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:55.080]   it's a small one it's three cups which is enough rice for a family of five i mean that's a lot of
[02:46:55.080 --> 02:47:01.480]   rice and it just does everything including steel cut oatmeal sushi rice and i make
[02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:07.080]   gaba brown rice in it all the time and it's just the best taste and stuff and then you also told me
[02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:13.240]   to get some rice let me go look at my orders and find the rice because it's a japanese
[02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:18.280]   rice and it's the best rice it's so good it's not brown unfortunately but it's so good
[02:47:19.240 --> 02:47:27.400]   um this is the shira kiku rice from koshi kari koshi kari oh that's pretty good
[02:47:27.400 --> 02:47:35.560]   little oh hi kara master uh that looks it's really good i have to say but you do have to wash
[02:47:35.560 --> 02:47:41.880]   it off because it's polished do you because your unpolished rice place sell uh online or no
[02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:46.280]   you have to go down yeah go down to the whole race i think they sell online because you can
