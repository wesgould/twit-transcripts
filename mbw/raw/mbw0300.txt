[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers the back of Tasha at iOS.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   In obsessive detail, starting with Andy and not-co, Mr. Obsessive.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   The man, the myth, the legend from the Chicago Sun-Times and his swans.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Hello Andy.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   I'm not Obsessive, I'm pedantic.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   There's a difference in what the audience is right now.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   You know, I never knew the difference.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Well, I'm sure Andy will explain it in great detail to us in moments.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Great to have you, Andy.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And whose swans are those in the background?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   We have to explain for those listening on audio that Andy always has a background.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I guess.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Of course I was shooting some pictures in Boston's public garden.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   This is one of our two lesbian swans.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I don't know if it's Castor or Pollux, but it's definitely one of the match set.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   You know, it's funny because they always say, "Oh, swans mate for life."
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   What they don't say is they believe in gay marriage.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Again, we are first state to legalize same sex marriage.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Just merely the last in an ongoing step since we became founded our little Puritan fishing colony
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   three hundred and twenty years ago.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   But here's an interesting fact.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   The Queen's response, good place for industry.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   The Queen still owns every swan.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   It's by Fiat.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Yeah, but she owes us a lot for that feed.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And also the litigation damage waiver that we have to have in public garden.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   The swans are jerks.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   They're beautiful, but they know they're beautiful in their jerks.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   They're like most supermodels.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   They don't have the best personal skills.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Good to have you now from London joining us, Mr. Alex Lindsey of the PixelCore.com.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Alex is on a mission, a secret mission.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   He's in the mission impossible headquarters.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Or the man from uncle.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I'm not sure which.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I mean, I mean the Excel convention center.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Ah.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   So it's the big convention center in the Docklands, which is kind of on the east side of London.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And amazingly, and as is often the case, we get the best feeds from England.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And you look fantastic.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   The quality is crisp.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   So the thing is we're streaming and they still had a connection here.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   So I was like, can I borrow the big pipe?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   So I got to like, you know, this is the streaming pipe.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   So it's like 50 megabits a second.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   So it's good.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   You know, in case anybody wants to know how good Skype can look, if you throw a lot of equipment at it and ban with that, this is pretty damn good.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   You know, I just wish I had my, you know, nice camera with a little I O X T and plug it all in.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   It would just be perfect.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   So what do you use?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Are you just using your laptop camera?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   This is the C910.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   We like that.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I think that's a pretty good camera.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   It's the best webcam we've tested so far.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   The C920 is not good.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   The C910 is great.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   It's also using a countryman mic.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And an IFP.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   And an IFP.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I mean, this guy, this is like serious.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   This is like serious.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   This is like Dan Rather reporting for me.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   I mean, it's impressive, I have to say.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And you're dressed.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Well, I think you're Leo.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Yeah, no, it's great.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I mean, the quality is amazing.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And there's no latency.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   There's zero latency.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Right.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   It's, you know, you just need to, you see that everyone needs to have a frequency.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Right.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   You know, you just need to, you see that everyone needs to have a 50 megabit pipe.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I actually would vote up for a politician who said that 50 megabyte for everyone.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I mean, forget the, you know.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Forget chicken in every pot.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Forget the donkey.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Forget the donkey and the 10 acres.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Forget the chicken in every pot.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   We want 50 megabits for every person.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And they can have great Skype calls.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   It is spectacular.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And we want to welcome back somebody we haven't had on the show and ages and ages and ages
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   and ages.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And it's my fault and I apologize.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   John Moltz is with us.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Hey, John.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Hello.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   On the other end of the spectrum, the technology that you use to call your grandmother.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   That's me.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I mean, look, he's into coma.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I say, I say camera.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.200]   He's just up the road a bit and he, and, and compare this to just, it's kind of amazing.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.080]   So you still do the crazy Apple rumors site.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.280]   On occasion when the whim takes me, yes.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.960]   And you have a new site, the very, it's a very nice website.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.960]   Thank you.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.960]   In fact, it's, it's called.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.960]   And that's why I named it very nice website.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.960]   So that people would say it's a very nice website.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.960]   And what is the deal with it?
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.960]   Thank you.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.440]   We just blew it up.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.680]   What is the deal with the very nice website?
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.240]   I, it's a work in progress.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.320]   I could, I couldn't tell you, frankly.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.520]   I don't know.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.280]   I follow what, what I'm interested in and mostly what I'm interested in is, is Apple,
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.280]   Apple stuff.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.520]   Well, I'm going to start stealing all your.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.080]   I'm going to make it a little bit humorous and not try and take myself to you seriously.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.880]   And during, in his day job, which we, of, which we shall not speak, John is one of the funniest
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.600]   guys in the business.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.640]   So there you go.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.640]   There you go.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.800]   And finally, by the way, the Canadian country cowboy magazine is on iPad and you wouldn't
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.920]   know that if you hadn't read John's site.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.240]   And actually the reason I found out about John is because John Gruber has moved his radio
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.960]   show, The Talk Show to Mule Radio by Mule Design.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.760]   They've got a great app and you were his first guest, his premier guest.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.760]   And I thought, I'm sorry.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.480]   Damn, I forgot about John Moltz.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.480]   Whatever happened to him.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.000]   Very nice of him to have me.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.320]   No, it's great to have you.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.200]   This is what happens when somebody works pseudonymously.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.840]   One forgets the real person behind the mask.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.400]   So we're glad to get you back.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.400]   Thanks.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.480]   A top story this week and it has been for a couple of weeks, the new Apple MacBooks.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.800]   And this is all rumor, but you know, absolutely, I think accurate only because this Ivy Bridge
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.280]   part for notebooks is coming out next month from Intel.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.840]   It has some real advantages.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.880]   We talked about last week, the fact that it has a USB three kind of built into the system
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.520]   on a chip.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.200]   It has a much faster GPU, which will allow, we believe, and so do the rumor monkers, Apple
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.000]   to put retina displays in their MacBooks.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.280]   So the consensus seems to be we expect maybe at WWDC, although they don't do that anymore.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.280]   We do expect Apple to announce new MacBooks soon.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.960]   But here's an interesting point from Josh Lowens and a book cruthers writing at CNET.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.440]   Retina MacBook screens are already in the channel.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.560]   They say it'll cost about $100 more.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.400]   Now this is something we've heard before based on the fact that this display costs more.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:57.880]   And NPDIA display search analyst Richard Shim says that there are existing panels out
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.880]   there.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:06.040]   15.4 inches and 13.3 inches that are effectively retina displays.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.280]   What do you hear, John, anything about this?
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.280]   I don't.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.520]   Actually, this was the first that I had seen about this when I was looking through the
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.120]   show notes for this.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.960]   Surprise, surprise, surprise.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.520]   I mean, everybody had sort of talked about this kind of thing coming, but I hadn't seen
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.280]   anybody really come out and say that it was going to happen.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.320]   Shim is saying what-- I wouldn't take the $100 thing necessarily literally.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.320]   Who knows?
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.800]   And it seems like Apple is able to negotiate better prices than anybody else.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.520]   So it's not as if it's going to come out and it's going to be-- suddenly it's going to
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.840]   have to pay $100 more for a retina display.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:52.280]   The specs that Shim is quoting, 2880 by 1800 on the 15.4 inch.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:58.600]   It's 220 pixels per inch, doubling the current 15 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.440]   The 13.3 inch is the one I'm kind of intrigued by because I carry a 13 most of the time.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.360]   The MacBook Air would be 2560 by 1600.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.960]   PPI of 227.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.960]   Again doubling the existing MacBook Air.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.680]   Andy, is this something you're all excited about?
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.680]   Not really.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.720]   It's the one machine that Apple makes I think that you have to say that it's a little bit
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.720]   of a substandard user experience.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.760]   It's 1280 right now, 1280 by 800.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.760]   Yeah, and it's great for the kids.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:42.760]   Those skateboarding, Mountain Dew, Slammin, YouTube video watching kids.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.800]   But if you're above the age of 25, 26, you're like, "Okay, I can just hold this up a little
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   bit closer."
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.920]   I could see the menu bar.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.360]   It's certainly no surprise that Apple is looking at different kind of display options,
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.000]   especially in the MacBook Pro line.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.680]   They've always had the normal screen that everybody can buy.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.280]   But then for another 150, 200 bucks, you can get the one that is just the final cut
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.800]   pro ready with so many pixels on the screen that you can have, two windows plus a whole
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.960]   bunch of tool palettes on the screen at the same time.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.520]   The question is whether they're going to go all in and call this a retina display or
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.160]   whether they're simply going to say this is a good way.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.760]   If there were Steve Jobs keynote, you sort of imagine the keynote, which he's walking
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:29.840]   like this and say, "We found out we did such a good job engineering the 13th.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:35.360]   We had no idea so many people were using it for things we never imagined like Final
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.360]   Cut Pro.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:41.040]   So we're delivering to you a screen that can support that natively.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.760]   Applause, applause, applause, applause, applause.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.040]   I can see Tim Cook doing that.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:50.760]   One of the screen's technologies that Shim talks about is something called Indium-Galium
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.160]   Zinc Oxide, IgZO.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.240]   Use smaller transistors and circuit elements which allows more light through, which means
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.080]   thinner, more power efficient displays, which is something you would need if you're going
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.560]   to put more pixels.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.360]   However, IgZO hadn't been produced in large quantities until recently.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:12.160]   Sharp is now converting one of its plants to create IgZO panels.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:18.680]   So we don't know if that's what they'll use, but other companies like Samsung and LG also
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.000]   offer very high-res displays.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.640]   Do you think Alex, they'll charge?
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.120]   Here's what I would guess Apple would do because if they do it currently, you can buy
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.320]   for a little bit more.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.840]   You can buy a higher-res display on your current MacBook Pro, right?
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.160]   I think that the different sizes are all pretty much have the same resolutions now.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.840]   I don't think that they change the resolution.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.400]   So you're 17-inch has a certain resolution.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.840]   I thought you could do a BTO.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.080]   You can't write exactly.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:49.520]   As a matter of fact, when I bought my MacBook Pro just last year, the agonizing step at
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.560]   the Apple Store was, oh, wait a minute, but those numbers are higher than the numbers
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.840]   of the ones I was going to get, and it's only $130.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.960]   You always get the higher resolution display at the same frame.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.960]   So here's the deal.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.960]   Is that for the 15-inch?
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.600]   The 15-inch MacBook Pro comes with a 1440x900 display, but you can also choose a high resolution.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.480]   It's not much higher resolution.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.480]   1680x1050.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:19.320]   I think I probably just forgot it, because unless it's 1920x10, I wasn't interested.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.680]   And that adds 100 bucks, and I think that's where that 100 buck number comes from.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.680]   That adds 100 bucks to the price.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.640]   I bet you that's where that number comes from.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.360]   And then if you want an anti-glare, they're going to charge you more for anti-glare because
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.480]   they know they can.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.480]   Plus the rosoproofing.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.480]   You're one of those people.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.240]   If you want anti-glare, you're really picky and you have to have it.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.240]   Right.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.240]   So it's worth 50 bucks.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.240]   That's a little...
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.240]   Yes.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.240]   Come on.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.240]   It can't cost them 50 bucks.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.800]   Because when do they just put it?
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.480]   Oh no, I think it's just out of spite.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.680]   It's like a really...
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.680]   It used to be free.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.680]   It used to be free.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.680]   You used to be free.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.360]   You should have gotten the glass one, and if you didn't, and you still want the stupid
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.920]   anti-glare, we'll then screw you.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.760]   If it would be my guess that in fact the glass one costs Apple more, but they're still
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.960]   going to charge you more for the anti-glare because they...
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.280]   Well, just to try to...
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.280]   Really?
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.280]   It's like the black one.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.480]   Remember the black one used to cost more than the white one?
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.480]   Oh yeah.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.560]   I think it was literally just trying to do a little social shaping.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.920]   And I don't really want that.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.920]   But I paid...
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.920]   As many did, 100 bucks more for the paint.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.480]   And I still see people with black MacBooks.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.480]   And I think, yeah, you...
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.760]   The black MacBook was way cooler than the white MacBook.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.760]   Cooler.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.760]   Come on now.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.760]   Cooler.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.320]   And somebody's pointing out, Vick G in the chatroom, "Hey, eyeglasses cost 100 bucks more
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.400]   to coat any glare."
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.560]   But I think that's a different coat.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.600]   That's an actual coating they're applying to the glasses.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.600]   I don't know if the...
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.760]   I think the anti-glare screen is just instead of glass, they put a different plastic.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.760]   Yeah, it's an old...
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.760]   That's what I have on my 17...
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.760]   It's what everything was until they figured out how to do glass.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.760]   Right.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.320]   And then they glossed us to death.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.640]   And I think the glass cost must cost more.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.840]   But I don't know, I'm just speculating.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.840]   So we talked about this last week.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.000]   I don't think we need to belabor it.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.960]   I just think that it's happening.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.760]   And there's more and more evidence that it's happening.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.320]   And the question is when not...
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.840]   Do you think WWDC, John?
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.280]   I mean, that's next month.
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.960]   Well, they're kind of overdue, right, for updates.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.800]   And I'm just thinking that sometimes soon...
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.480]   The new Apple way of doing things is not to do this.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.000]   At WWDC, they'll do iOS 6, right?
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Right.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.160]   So it's a separate announcement at One Infinite Loop or...
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.120]   Maybe the hardware will be different announcement.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.120]   I bet it is.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.120]   Because they also...
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.120]   They also got to cover mountain lions, too.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.120]   It's going to be software at WWDC.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.520]   Because it's for developers.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.600]   By the way, we will be doing a special edition of Mac Break Weekly on June 11th and two
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.080]   weeks for that.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.920]   We'll do it on Monday so that we can cover the keynote, even though they won't be streaming
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.160]   it, no doubt.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.920]   And who even knows who's talking.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.280]   Is it Tim or is it Shiller?
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.280]   Or is it...
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.280]   Probably Scott.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.000]   Probably Scott more than any of them, right?
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.800]   Yeah, he could be all of them again, right?
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   Scott forced all those.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.800]   There's going to be their current format.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.280]   I mean, Tim will get up and say a few things and then Shiller will probably do most of
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.280]   it.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.280]   Right.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.280]   Because he's the marketing guy.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.040]   But Scott forced all of the iOS guys, so he'll do the iOS stuff.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.960]   And then there'll be a 3D hardware.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.520]   I think we saw hardware at WWDC because I just think Apple's really trying to put that
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.520]   in the back alley.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.520]   I agree.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.120]   I agree.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.520]   And then maybe this guy will be speaking because I just like how he looks.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.600]   Who is that?
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.600]   Anybody know Chattram?
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.160]   Who is that?
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.560]   It looks like...
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.560]   It looks like...
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.360]   Well, I love it.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.880]   Look at the eyebrows.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:46.880]   Look at the eyebrows.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:52.680]   Actually, it's like Eugene Levy is one of the Schmingy brothers on the PPP.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.120]   He's the vice president of the OS 10 team, Ted Danson.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.120]   No.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.040]   Henry Winkler.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.920]   And because we're all such handsome roots...
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:03.920]   No, no.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.920]   That's some sense of God.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.920]   Believe me.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.920]   This guy's a good looking guy.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.920]   I'm not saying he's not.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.560]   He has Chris Breen enviable hair.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.480]   He was very good.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.720]   And we loved him in quantum leap.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.560]   He was so good.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.280]   He was so good.
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.520]   I disagree with that Leo Laporte for people who aren't watching the video and don't know
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.120]   who's talking at winning point.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:29.640]   Of the four people here, three of which are probably hoping for invites to whatever
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.640]   media fed is.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.640]   Oh, yes.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.640]   That's right.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.480]   Let's identify Leo Laporte as he originally was actually...
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.480]   Absolutely.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.480]   Because I'm not going to invite it no matter what.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.800]   So, it's all my fault.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   I'm the guy.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.800]   I'm the guy.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.800]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.800]   John F. John.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.800]   No, there's...
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.800]   Oh, there's John.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.800]   There is a John.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.040]   John Moltz is here.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.640]   It's the name that fools me every time.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.640]   Alex Lindsey is also here from London.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.560]   Andy Inaco here from Boston.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.560]   We're going to take more...
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:01.280]   We're going to take a break and come back with more, including Campus 2.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.840]   We may get to visit Campus 2.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.000]   Well, you will maybe get to visit.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.800]   I will never be invited, but we'll tell you why in just a bit.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:12.840]   But first, a word from the newest iPad app of all go to meeting.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.320]   Yes, on the iPad from Citrix.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.320]   So go to meeting.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.320]   They keep adding...
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.320]   I love this with this.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.920]   What Citrix folks do is so cool because they basically have a product and just continually
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.160]   improve it.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.800]   But if you're a customer subscriber, you just get it automatically.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.600]   $49 a month, as many, many, as you want, as long as you want, you don't have to count
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.680]   them, you don't have to time them, just use it.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.000]   And that's nice because you pay the $49 and now you just use it a lot.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.320]   And it started with screen sharing, which was great.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.720]   It's the fastest, the easiest, the best screen sharing to use because it used NAT traversals.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.040]   You don't have to go through opening ports on the firewall or anything like that.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.600]   It just works.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.880]   Mac or PC, it was very easy for clients to use.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.760]   And I think that's a really important point with Go to Meeting is that if you want to
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.360]   do a sales presentation and your client is not on site or you can't go to them, which
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.960]   nowadays is more and more of the case, you'd say, "Well, look, you send them an invitation,
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.160]   you use Outlook, it's automatic, it's an invitation."
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.280]   They get it, the time comes, it's in their calendar, it beeps.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:15.920]   All they do, literally, is click a link and then everything else is handled, even if
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.240]   they've never had the software installed.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.040]   And so it's really easy for them to use.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.200]   There's no support involved in your part to get it up and running.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.840]   And then they see your screen, but now we add more.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.880]   So the next big upgrade was HD Faces.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.800]   This happened a few months ago and it's incredible.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.360]   If you've got a camera on your computer, almost everybody does now, you can see them,
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.560]   they can see you.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.600]   In addition to the screen sharing, and you can move it around, you can make it bigger
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.600]   and smaller.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.560]   So that's huge, I think, for sales presentations, for team meetings, collaborating where you
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.920]   could see the other person.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.920]   It's much more like a in-person.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:57.720]   They're bringing basically these very expensive video conferencing systems down to cost nothing,
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.200]   you know, because you now have the hardware to do it then, and this was the coolest one
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.200]   they just released.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.200]   It works on iPad now.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.760]   So you could always attend a meeting on an iPad, but now you can even broadcast using
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.520]   the iPad's camera and microphone.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.680]   You don't need to have a separate conference bridge.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.200]   It all works directly with the iPad.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.800]   It is so incredible.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.600]   Now I want you to try it free for 30 days right now, including the iPad app is free.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.880]   They do not charge for the app.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.960]   There's an iPhone app as well.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.840]   You can't send the video yet.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:28.120]   I have a feeling that's coming, but you certainly can attend the meeting and listen and see
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.240]   the screen sharing on the iPhone too.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.680]   So it is a great way to participate.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.360]   We do, well, we've stopped now.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.200]   We were doing three times a week team meetings on the web design.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.840]   That's the kind of thing where you really want to stay involved, and the company we were
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.960]   working with was not using GoToMeeting, and I think I'm going to say, "Hey, guys, from
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.840]   now on, can we just use that?"
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.520]   Because then you can show me the screen.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.760]   I can see you.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.640]   It's so fantastic.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.640]   And now on the iPad.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.720]   So try it free for 30 days.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.800]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.760]   Click the try it free button.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.040]   The promo code is Macbreak.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.920]   For training, for collaboration, for sales, there is no better way to do it.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.920]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.240]   Use the offer code Macbreak now on the iPad too.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.960]   Look how sweet that is.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.920]   Just works so well.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.840]   You have to start the meeting from a desktop, from a PC or Mac, but you can join a meeting
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.520]   and send your video from an iPad.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:24.720]   So Apple is moving along with their plans for the new campus, the Flying Saucer campus
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.760]   in Cupertino.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.840]   I really think it's going to take off.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.840]   I think it's going to take off.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.280]   You've been waiting to say that.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.440]   They don't want anyone to know, but once all the employees are there, it's going to
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.520]   be there for like a week, and everyone's going to get kind of in there, and then all
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.520]   the employees are going to go in there.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.880]   It's going to go straight up here.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.920]   Alex, I hate to be a contrarian, but I have to disagree with you.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.000]   I believe that that is actually a circular tunneling bit, and they're actually going
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   to be tunneling down.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.440]   They're going to be establishing an Apple store at the Earth's core where the markups
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.280]   are just going to be astronomical, but the experience is going to be everything that
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.920]   Steve Jobs hoped when he first conceived of the first round of Apple stores.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.040]   They're circulating, a brochure now, to the neighbors.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:13.180]   They're calling it Campus 2, and there's a little note from Peter Oppenheimer, who is
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.960]   the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Apple.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.880]   The neighbors sent a 9-to-5 mac a copy of the brochure.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.480]   I don't have a comment as to whether this thing is going to go up or down, but looking
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:29.640]   at this thing, I would just like to point out that to serve a man was a cookbook.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:36.640]   I'm just thinking, if you're in-coopers and you're thinking about responding negatively
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.640]   to this, think carefully.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.880]   You'll be first in line at the cattle's chute.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.880]   Yes.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.720]   How do you feel a bit of blue to the head?
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.800]   Campus 2 will not replace.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.000]   I was surprised to hear this.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   One infinite loop.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.200]   It's going to provide, according to this brochure, research, and the brochures like
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.200]   that.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   The brochures for show, wait a minute, my phone is ringing.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.880]   How do you like that?
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.880]   I get a little magnet on it.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.880]   I'm just going to clamp it to the back of the back of the back.
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.880]   I feel like you're my uncle.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.880]   You just pulled the border from my ear.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.960]   Yay, Uncle Leo, do it again.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.960]   Isn't that funny?
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.560]   I've got a glued.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.360]   I've got my uncle into the back of Andy's head.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.960]   Or I could just, you know, just, oh, phone call for you Leo.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.760]   Oh, thank you, Andy.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.760]   Do that again.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:26.760]   That was good.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.320]   Little fun, fun and games.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.320]   It's for you, Leo.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.320]   Oh, thank you, Andy.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.320]   Oh, we have fun here at Twitch.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.760]   Are we not so easily amused?
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.840]   John's thinking I'm never coming back here.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.680]   We're a good first day.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.240]   Thank you for the producer.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.680]   That Gruber show was so good.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.800]   I just wish I were doing that right now.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.320]   We had a two.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:52.720]   It's going to be a ratio for additional 13th, an additional 13,000 employees.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.520]   They already have 10 at one infinite loop, 10 grand.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.480]   And they're going to add another, according to this, another 13,000.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:07.160]   And there's room for 300,000 square feet of additional expansion space.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.320]   They're really planning to grow.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.480]   This will not be.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:14.600]   So mostly one infinite loop will be the museum because this will not be over to the public.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.160]   You can't just walk in and say, I'm here, where's the store?
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.120]   The store will stay at one infinite loop.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.920]   There will be no museum of Apple lore.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.720]   There'll be nothing.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:29.920]   But the good news, they're going to put in, quote, world-class auditorium in the southern
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.080]   tip of the new campus for product launches.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.760]   How much money do you want to bet that we'll have at least the capacity of your Ruben
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.120]   Center so that they don't have to tip their hats anywhere.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.400]   They also have to make sure they have complete control over the facility.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.400]   Exactly.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.120]   So that's big, by the way.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.480]   That's what 5,000 seats or something.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.480]   That's pretty huge.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.480]   They're a boy.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.480]   Something like that.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:57.040]   But I was most curious about dating back to the first presentation to the town council.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.280]   It seemed as though the plan that I saw back then, they're putting all the mechanical
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.680]   services and all the mechanical buildings on the highway side.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.840]   And so I was curious to see if as part of the aesthetic of the design of the campus
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:13.480]   itself, if they were giving a thought to, let's make sure that all the people in this
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.600]   community who have to drive past the campus, let's make sure they're not just going to
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:21.520]   see these boring, like cinder block, you know, block house sort of buildings with ventilation
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.520]   ducts on top of them.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.840]   Is there going to be something interesting on that approach for people to at least not
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:30.360]   be not not think they're in a Terry Gilliam movie when they pass by?
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.360]   All right.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.640]   I think they should all look like big apple cubes.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.840]   Just these big glass ones and then little metal in the inside.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.320]   I'm sure they'll look nice.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.000]   I'm sure they'll and they're going to put a ton of trees back on the property.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.480]   You know, that whole area used to be orchards until, you know, not so long ago, 30 years
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.880]   ago and 40 years ago.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:53.760]   And then of course, Silicon Valley sprung up all over there, but and Silicon Valley's
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.760]   ugly anyway.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.360]   It's all tilt what they call tilt ups.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.120]   They just tilt up walls and they put a lid on it and that becomes the building and that's
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.120]   everywhere in Silicon Valley.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.920]   Even some of the Google buildings still look like that.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.360]   So it, you know, any it'll be an improvement, I'm sure.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.360]   I can't.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.640]   I mean, this is land that land was zoned by HP.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.640]   Right.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.840]   And then apple bought it all up.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.680]   Yeah, that's who they bought it from.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:19.360]   They say apple is going to break ground as soon as the superintendent of city council
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.760]   approves the changes sometime later this year with plans to start occupying the space in
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.240]   2015.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.640]   And part of this brochure is because they're worried that the neighbors are worried about
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.640]   traffic flow.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.720]   I was about to say that I think you had 13,000 people.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.480]   That's a lot of people at nine o'clock in the morning.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.800]   Well, remember, I think that they said that the garage is underground right there.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.800]   The city's going to park underground.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.720]   They still have to get there.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:48.480]   I mean, it's, you know, that's the big thing is just that 13,000 more people that's a lot
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.560]   of cars that need to get in there sometime between eight o'clock and twenty and ten.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.800]   Well, there's there is stuff there now though.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.800]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.920]   Maybe there's nobody in it right now, but there are buildings there now.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.320]   So somebody's going in there.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.880]   It's probably not 13,000 people.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.520]   I think what Apple, the other thing that I don't think it's in the brochure, but I believe
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.200]   they've announced that they're going to create a new apple time zone that will be shifted
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:12.600]   seven hours from the curp Latino time zone so that the workers will arrive at a time that
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.920]   no one else is around.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.600]   I think that's a smart idea.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:22.480]   So it'll be Pacific Apple time or a hat from now on, just so you know.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.840]   That is a new thing because now that everyone's got the phone, you can just very quickly and
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.000]   easily just change the time.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.720]   Change the time and make everybody just be on Apple.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.000]   It's kind of sad because all of us who live in California or on the West Coast too is
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   probably YouTube, John.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.480]   The F5 phone says we're in Cupertino.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.120]   Everybody's in the Cupertino time zone.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.280]   Like that's the time zone.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.280]   No, it's not.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:49.720]   But it's better than LA because a lot of times like the Android phones, we were all in LA.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:56.240]   The Steve Jobs last public appearance actually was almost exactly one year ago, June 7, 2011
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:02.880]   at the Cupertino City Council meeting where he made a pitch for this building and he did
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.040]   look terribly frail.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.560]   And it's kind of interesting.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:13.280]   So in some ways I think this was his swan song.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:17.640]   I always wondered what it was about that facility that prompted him personally to make
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:24.640]   that pitch himself, given that it's unlikely that if the town is already factory town that's
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.720]   reliant on the contributions that you make to the finances.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.080]   When you say we've got a plan that we think is kind of self-evident, that's beautiful,
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:37.480]   we'll bring more jobs and more money into the community, you don't need to have the
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.840]   big guy come out, especially if he's so sick.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:46.120]   I imagine that it must have been kind of a point of pride for him.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.040]   That this is one of those things that he just loved.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:53.000]   He knew that he would never get a chance to do a keynote about this campus, the way that
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.200]   he was just as proud to do a keynote about the iPad and the iPhone, that this was his
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:01.560]   chance to smile and say how, let you know how much he liked the process of developing
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.560]   this sort of thing.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.440]   And there was no question, if you watch the video, which is an online to five Mac, if you
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:12.280]   watch the video, that the city council was just kind of thrilled to have him there.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:17.160]   It was like a royal appearance, it was a big deal.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.320]   And the people in the audience too.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.160]   Oh yeah, you can see what's not expected.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.160]   He wasn't really expected.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:25.200]   There's this little kid, there's a little kid he keeps peering out from behind Steve
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.440]   on the video, who's just so excited.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.480]   He said, I'm part of history.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.120]   He'll look back on this 20 years from now and say, look, I was there.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.480]   I remember Steve showed up.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:41.360]   How would you like to be the next person sketch that yes, there's a, my house now has
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.360]   one garage.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.760]   I'd like to expand that for two garage.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.920]   So I'm seeking construction permit as I didn't draw anything, but it's going to be a beautiful
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:49.920]   second garage.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:55.160]   I'm going to have an automated door that opens and closes it and I might even add some shrubs.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.160]   I could make it round.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.480]   I think Cooper Tino wants me to leave Cooper.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.600]   I think I bring a lot of jobs to this area.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:06.040]   I mean, and no one knew this was his last public appearance.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:10.480]   So it achieves a lot of poignancy after the fact because this was, I think the day or
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:16.280]   two after WWDC and he got sicker and sicker after this and never did in fact make another
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.280]   public appearance.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.120]   So this was really, this is kind of a historic moment.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.560]   And I do, I agree with you, Andy.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.000]   This is more than just a building for Steve.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.400]   This was, this was something important for him and it's perfectly round.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.240]   And it's interesting that they're doing this brochure.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.200]   I mean, I don't know if there's a lot of pushback from the neighborhood.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.880]   I don't even know if there is a neighborhood around there.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:42.080]   It really is pretty much industrial parks around there.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.680]   But they're clearly want to make the neighborhood happy and makes Cooper Tino happy about this
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.680]   building.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:53.440]   Cooper Tino, whoever knew the word Cooper Tino until now, you know?
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:30:00.120]   One first scenario that's very interesting that how communities get into this thing,
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.600]   like they want to deal with these companies that are, that are doing this.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.800]   And you're just like, you know, they're bringing 13,000 jobs, a lot more taxes, a lot more,
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.000]   you know, a lot of other things.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.280]   And, and it's always an interesting process.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.480]   I mean, this is one of the, this is the most highly valued by market cap company in the
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.680]   world who wants to expand into your community.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.520]   You know, and it's, and they're doing it in an environmentally sensitive way as best you
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.960]   can to do that kind of thing.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.720]   And they're, you know, they're going to bring a lot of, you know, high margin individuals
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:32.480]   from a tax perspective, you know, and, you know, just, but you, you do, I do find it funny
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.280]   when you have the city council pushing back on them.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.280]   I mean, I mean, they want a free Wi-Fi.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.280]   They push too hard.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.280]   John, I'm sorry.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.280]   What were you saying?
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.560]   Oh, just that part of that, that a lot adjacent to that is apartment building.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.720]   So it's actually kind of close, at least to some people are living there.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.040]   I had not watched that video until this morning.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.560]   I think when it came out, it was last summer.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.520]   I just like, I didn't want to watch it because of when people had said, yeah, he looks very
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.520]   good.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.320]   And so I decided not to and then watched it this morning for the first time.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:06.320]   It's kind of like, he didn't look too well, but he was, he was, you know, talking very
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:11.600]   personally from, you know, I mean, about how important it was him to buy HP land because
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.760]   he, that was one of the first places he worked and, and that kind of thing.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.760]   I think it's, I think now that we've got a little distance from it, you're right at
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.600]   the time, it's like, oh, but now that we've got a little distance from it, it's like watching
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.480]   your, your late grandpa, you know, and going back in time, a little bit saying, boy, you
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.680]   know, I'm right.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.480]   And, you know, at this point, we kind of treasure anything we've got from Steven, of course,
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:37.720]   the glow now as you, you know, is, is getting the halo will continue to grow as, as we get
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.840]   farther and farther from his life.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.840]   Go ahead, Alex.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.200]   Well, well, and I, and I think that you really get clear.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.280]   And when you watch that video a couple of times, you see how much pain he's in and you
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:49.000]   get really clear how important it was to build this building.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Yes.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.200]   You know, like, because, you know, he, this is his last public appearance.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.560]   He's obviously not well.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.680]   He probably knows at this point things aren't going to turn out well.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.160]   And he's still going to show up for a city council meeting to make sure that it's clear
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.080]   that this is very, very important to Apple to have this.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.680]   And I think that, you know, that, that says a lot about how important it was to him.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:12.520]   You know, it's interesting as Apple also has applied to the planning commission for a
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:20.600]   new off campus gym and cafeteria, because the current cafeteria at the Apple campus is
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.120]   open to the public.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.680]   And they don't want people to overhear their conversations.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.720]   Apple director of the cafeteria is not open to the public.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.720]   That's what it says.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.960]   Have you been there?
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.960]   No.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.200]   Well, the current cafeteria inside the building.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.800]   Inside, it's inside the, yeah, the hallowed ground.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.080]   I mean, you have to go through like two balls of glass.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.600]   I think you, I mean, you have to be invited in.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.600]   Right.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.080]   Maybe they're having some something where you can't even be invited.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.080]   Oh, you have to be.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.080]   Okay.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.080]   Here's the deal.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.920]   The new building will not be open to visitors signed in by Apple employees.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.920]   There you go.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.600]   So you, so, so they could sign us in and we could, we could listen.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.560]   And this way you can't even bring a friend.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.520]   You work for Apple or you don't eat here.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.400]   And this is what the director of real estate facilities, Dan Wiesenhand said.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:09.240]   He said, we'd like to provide a level of security so that people and employees can
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.680]   feel comfortable talking about their business, their research and whatever project they're
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:18.680]   engineering without fear of competition, sort of overhearing their conversations.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.440]   That's a real issue today in Kupatina because we've got other companies here in our same
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.440]   business.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.440]   I don't know.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.440]   Wonderful.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.480]   If it'll have a bar so they can leave their iPhones there.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.640]   That's just, that's just, that's it.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.640]   I'm leaving them in bars.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.640]   Go ahead.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.640]   Have a drink.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.640]   Yeah, right.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.640]   Leave here.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.640]   Wow.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.880]   That's a good idea.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.320]   But that just shows you how serious they are.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.320]   I don't know.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.360]   Are, are, you know, Google, you can go to a Google cafeteria.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.360]   I've been there.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:46.080]   You can, most other companies, employees can sign you into the cafeteria.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:51.400]   And I presume one of the things they're saying is that we have vendors and suppliers, you
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.120]   know, Samsung probably from time to time is here.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.400]   They eat lunch in our cafeteria.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:00.760]   We don't want them hearing what our super secret plans are for the iPhone 7.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.920]   Does that make sense?
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.920]   Makes sense.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.720]   We're going to take a break, John.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.920]   Moltz is here.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.920]   His new website is a very lovely, very nice website.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.440]   You have to say it right.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.000]   A very nice website.com, right?
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   Very, very nice website.net.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   .net.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   There one works.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Either one works.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   So you got post?
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   I got them both.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Spend the money.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Or am I, or am I, or am I empire?
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.720]   Yeah, I'm just, yeah, I'm just, just throwing Benjamin's around.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.720]   It's brand new, right?
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.440]   I mean, when did you watch this?
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.320]   A month and a half ago, I mean.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.320]   Okay.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.320]   Yeah, not that long ago.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.320]   Must read.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.320]   You have an RSS feed, right?
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.320]   I do.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.320]   Yeah, a Twitter.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.320]   You don't have an RSS feed.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.320]   It even has a Twitter feed.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.960]   Very nice, at very nice website.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:50.240]   So that means you can be on, nobody, you know, you only have about 36 followers.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.160]   We got to fix that.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.160]   Maybe it's the black triangle.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:57.040]   It's the, yeah, the black triangle's got to go.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.040]   I'm, I'm not.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.040]   You didn't spend any money on graphic design.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.040]   I got, yeah, I don't.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.120]   What's a shape, a triangle?
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.440]   Okay, make it black.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.440]   Okay.
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.440]   Here we go.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.440]   Okay, we're done.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.440]   We're done.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.440]   Drop shadow.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.680]   I don't want to say anything, but let's go to lunch.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.680]   I'm going to sign up.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:17.000]   I'm going to sign up on Twitter just so that I can, I can, I can follow of.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.360]   You can double my followership.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.520]   Yes, at very nice.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.200]   Well, let's double your followership today.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.200]   Followership today.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.200]   What do you say?
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.760]   I'm going to log in right now.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.120]   And, and actually that would be good flip board feed to follow because I'm, I'm not kidding
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.120]   this good stuff.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:34.920]   Does the, did you make the RSS feed full text or just excerpts?
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.680]   It is currently full text.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.520]   You rock John Mulz.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.520]   I know.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.480]   You rock.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.520]   All RSS feed should be full text.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.480]   Well, you know, unless you want to make money.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.480]   You're right.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.480]   I decided I don't want to.
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.480]   No.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.240]   It's least more problems.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.240]   Money.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.080]   Money, more problems.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.880]   Also, Alex Lindsey's here from London where he is.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.680]   You probably don't want to talk about what you're doing because it's a corporate event,
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.680]   right?
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   No, no, I can actually talk about it.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:09.520]   I'm, I'm, I actually posted, I think some stuff on G plus I was, we were doing the cloud
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:13.880]   forest stream for, for salesforce.com.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.960]   So we put, we do most of their live streaming.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.760]   And so we had a crew of about six or seven people to me that melded into the crew of 30
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.600]   or 40 that were already here.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.600]   Cool.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.560]   A couple thousand people and then lots of people online.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:32.080]   And of course, Andy and I go from the Chicago Sun times.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.440]   Great, great review on iPhoto a couple of weeks ago.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.440]   Completely agree with you.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:41.280]   This is iPhoto for the iPad and iPhone, I guess too.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.360]   That initially is very kind of obtuse and hard to figure out.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.360]   But once you figure it out, it's like, wow, I've got this on my iPad.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.360]   I can't believe it.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.160]   I mean, there are times when I envy those people who just like are the rumor sites and the
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.160]   news sites.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.920]   Like the first person to break a story, but I really like having a week and a half to
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.320]   really feel as though I can not only do I had not only do I feel like I've got the entire
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.480]   thing, but also I feel as though now I can be arrogant about it.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.400]   Well, no, you're wrong.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.360]   I thought it was a great app.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:14.000]   It's what's what Steven Levy calls slow news.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:21.040]   You take your time, slow cooking, slow boring of hard.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.880]   Accent on the boring, slow boring of high healed girls.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:28.920]   This is Mac break weekly more to come in just a bit, but first a word from Fird, our great
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:35.760]   friends at Fird, Ford, Ford, Ford.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:41.840]   Take two, but first a word from Ford probably should announce the sponsor's names correctly.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.840]   I would guess.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:47.160]   It just seems a minor, kind of courtesy.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:50.840]   And Ford, actually you could say Ford because I think everybody would know what Ford is
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.160]   because Ford is like the blue oval is what I'm talking about.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.840]   You know, that's Henry Fords handwriting, I'm told.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:01.320]   They haven't updated the logo because it's like classic.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:05.840]   And yet they've updated the vehicles to 21st century specs, including these new 2012
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.840]   Ford Focus electrics.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.640]   Oh, I love this.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.800]   I'm on the list to get one.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.720]   In fact, I asked my local Ford dealer right about my Mustang when you get in the EV.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.600]   He says, "As soon as we're certified EV, we will have it and that's soon."
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:25.680]   So if you can get it at a certified electric vehicle dealer, and by the way, get, look,
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.720]   go scroll down a little bit, Chad, and see that you want that home charging station exactly.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.440]   You knew where I was going with that.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:36.280]   That Leviton home charging station, not expensive to get installed, and it changes everything.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:40.480]   So you normally have 120 volts in your plugs and you can use that.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:45.120]   But if you have the 240 volt charger, it's got the best in class charge time, four hours
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.520]   from zero to full, three to four hours.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.960]   That's amazing.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.840]   I'm not going to say what the other guys do, but it's about twice that.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.440]   And it just, boom, you plug it in.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.640]   And here's the beauty part.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.680]   More and more places work.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.400]   Airports, the Oakland airport's got the best parking in the airport is an electric vehicle
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.400]   station.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.520]   So you only electric vehicles can use it and they charge you for free.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.520]   Not that you'll need it.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.840]   It's got the best in class driving range, 76 miles, which isn't really good.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.920]   I can get the airport back, which is nice.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.800]   The most fuel efficient five passenger vehicle in America.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.120]   I mean, electricity is fuel.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:24.760]   We got to acknowledge that, but it gets 110 MPGE, which is the best city rating in its
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.760]   class.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.680]   So that's a lot of bests.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:33.800]   Most fuel efficient, best city rating and best in class driving range, best in class
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.400]   charge time.
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.520]   It's the best.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.240]   And now you see why Ford waited a little bit and they wanted to get it right.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.680]   This is an amazing vehicle.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.800]   This is the new 2012 Ford Focus Electric.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:48.960]   You got to check it out, especially when the sync with my Ford touch, they've adapted
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:56.720]   it to do things like help you figure out the charge times the state of charge, the current
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:01.040]   range, all of that can also go to your phone, your smartphone.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.440]   You can program charge settings, download vehicle data for analysis to your phone.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:08.600]   They have that value charging feature powered by Microsoft, which will let you take advantage
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.360]   of off-peak or reduced rates from your utility.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.680]   So it's even more affordable, incredible vehicle.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.840]   I want you to take a look.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.800]   Here's the best thing to do is go to your EV certified Ford dealer and drive one today.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.600]   But you can also do what we're doing right now on the website.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:28.440]   Go to Ford.com/technology and just kind of browse around and look at it.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.800]   Then go look at the 2013.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.640]   See, I almost don't want to mention this, but I guess it's fair that we mention it.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:42.600]   Next year, they're going to do the 2013 Ford Fusion Energy plug-in hybrid.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:48.600]   So what that's going to be is a plug-in hybrid means you use the electric when you need it.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:54.440]   But if you're just dropping and putting around town and get 100 miles per gallon at E, but
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:00.040]   you also can turn on that gas engine whenever you need it and go, go, go, go.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.840]   So I was going to find the Ford Focus and then I thought, well, I might wait until early
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.240]   2013 and get this one.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.160]   This is so cool.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:14.960]   Plug-in hybrid or all electric, your choice from Ford.com/technology.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.400]   That's 21st century of Fugu when you're driving that.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:24.520]   I'm going to follow a very nice website on my Twitter.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:31.880]   This could be another generational thing that 120 miles before charging up again.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:33.880]   Amazing, huh?
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:39.400]   I'm going to go back at our 30 miles, just sort of wonder how we managed.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:49.360]   Samsung accuses Apple experts of slavish adoration and blames a cult-like following.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.280]   This is from a very nice website.com.net.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:56.720]   Yeah, it turns out that you get a cult-like following when you actually produce really
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.720]   great products.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.720]   Can you go figure?
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.720]   How does that happen?
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.720]   Slavish.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.720]   It's crazy.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:07.360]   Remember, Apple accused IBM users of being slaves in 1984.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:14.800]   Remember, we were just consuming the Apple, the IBM CoolAid, and now the we're mistuned.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.120]   You saw those computers in 1984.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.120]   They were crap.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.120]   They were crap.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.520]   Yeah, they were horrible.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.880]   There was a good reason for that.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:27.920]   Here's the introductory paragraph of Samsung's motion.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:38.600]   They're looking for a summary judgment so that they can just not go to trial, of course.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.000]   Apple's damage is expert.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.640]   Terri L. Musica writes in his report that, "Apple has built a considerable, at a times,
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:48.880]   cult-like following to all things Apple."
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.520]   That cult-like following apparently includes several experts who are appearing on Apple's
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.040]   behalf in this case.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.040]   They're cult members.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.640]   That makes plain-life cast aside.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:05.320]   Wow, they have cast aside established scientific methods and governing legal principles in
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:11.120]   favor of slavish adoration of their client and platitudes about its arrest.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.760]   Let's go and fire and brimstone.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.760]   No kidding.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.320]   Can I reel off for this one more?
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:22.160]   Just one small comment that I will just simply say, and that's all I need to say.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:27.640]   I know that calling Apple users a cult is overblown and overplayed.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.960]   However, a quick poll of this panel.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:36.920]   If Tim Cook or somebody high up at Apple were to say, "Offhandedly as a joke," that the
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:41.520]   best way to get a new iPhone quickly is to wear your underpants on the outside for three
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.520]   weeks.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.520]   Damn straight.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.520]   Damn straight.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.280]   I'll make people always see me walk around with underpants on the outside.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.680]   Hey, I'd make out with Tim Cook if you ask.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:52.120]   Of course, I'm a slavish adoration.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.040]   Fortunately, I already wear my underpants on the outside.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.280]   It's the only way that people can see that they're clean.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.280]   Just in case.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:04.520]   And remember, Leander Connie actually has a website called the Cult of Mac.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:05.520]   So you're right.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.520]   It's not that.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:10.720]   Now, one of the Apple experts I really don't like is a guy named Henry Urbak, who, according
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:14.520]   to Samsung, is unquestionably a loyal devotee of Apple.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:20.000]   It's designers, it's products in its retail stores and explains Apple's cultural significance.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.800]   This is all from Fospat in Stockholm.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:27.480]   And flowery terms, "Before being retained by Apple in this manner, Mr. Urbak wrote an
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:33.240]   essay on the design of Apple's retail stores called Garden of Earthly Delights."
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.960]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:36.960]   It doesn't matter.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.320]   Excuse me, but your expert is testifying on your behalf.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.480]   It's okay if he's a fan, isn't it?
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.000]   I'm not a lawyer, but...
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   Okay.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.240]   He did refer to Steve Jobs as a saint.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.240]   It might be going to...
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.240]   That's a question.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.240]   That's a question.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.960]   Whee, we're going to do fire.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:57.960]   You know, I don't know.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:01.680]   If you read the book, The History of the Catholic Saints, a lot of them are into some
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.680]   pretty freaky stuff.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.840]   13 hours, 14 hours, too.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.560]   I'm not saying he's the most likely candidate.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.520]   I'm just saying he's not the least likely candidate.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.440]   I wasn't sleeping with that.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.400]   You know, it's so hard to follow all this.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.880]   We have a great show.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.960]   Fos Patents, by the way, is a good blog.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:18.960]   Yeah, terrific.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:19.760]   I really like what he does.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:25.800]   I think he really is covering this in a way that we can't because, frankly, you have
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.600]   to be a lawyer and he is.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:33.240]   But we also have a legal show that's very good on these subjects, and I highly recommend
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.680]   you watch this week in law with Denise Howell.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.640]   It's every Monday.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.600]   And I think Florian has probably been on the show.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.960]   Florian Mallard, the guy who writes Fos Patents, has probably been on the show.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:50.360]   But she has really good people, including David Boyes, who is often arguing in cases
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:51.680]   like this.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:58.320]   And so it's a really great way to follow what's going on in a way that we can't do because
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.640]   I just, A, I don't understand it.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.080]   B, it's not that interesting to me.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.600]   It's because it's wrangling.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:12.520]   And so we can't, you know, we give it more weight than it deserves in all of this.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:16.040]   Tim Cook did meet with Samsung, however, which is interesting.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:26.680]   He met with the CEO of Samsung on Sunday, or no Monday, yesterday.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:32.360]   The chief at Samsung came to Tim, came to California.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.280]   It's a short article on Apple and Sire.
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:38.560]   Oh, wait, there it is.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.560]   So I don't know why I'm not getting any text.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.560]   It's just a full feed.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:42.560]   I need the full feed.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.560]   Invisible article.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.560]   So I guess these are settlement talks.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.960]   They're meeting in San Francisco.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:52.680]   So I guess this is pretty serious, although the federal judge mandated the mediation.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:56.240]   No, I think whether the Apple wants to settle or not.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:59.040]   I do think that Tim Cook is probably a lot more pragmatic than Steve John Moore.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.760]   I think he's more likely to settle.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.640]   That's what all the people are saying, right?
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:09.280]   But I also think that it's good appearances for Apple for them to meet with them, to have,
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:13.480]   you know, what at least look like authentic discussions, you know, from Apple's point
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.480]   of view.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.640]   I mean, if you don't do any of that, it's going to damage your position in court.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.400]   So you just seem obstinate.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:24.560]   So Reuters quotes a unnamed Samsung executive who said that there's still a big gap with
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:29.840]   Apple, but there are a number of potential negotiating options, including perhaps cross
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:30.840]   licensing.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:34.880]   People through suing each other for patent violations, Apple and Samsung are in response
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.640]   to Apple suits.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:46.600]   Apple has not yet lost in any of its, if I'm not mistaken, in any of its suits, where
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:51.880]   Samsung has seen a number of injunctions filed against both in Australia, Germany, and I
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.160]   think here as well.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:58.240]   No, it was HTC who lost here, wasn't it?
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:01.160]   So, you know, maybe Apple doesn't have a whole lot of incentive.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:04.000]   Maybe Samsung will do something.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.800]   They're kind of required to do this anyway, this mediation.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.840]   I presume it's also going on today.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.440]   Go to trial in San Jose in July.
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:16.440]   But it's always, no matter how there's a transition from one CEO to the other, it's
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.360]   always interesting to see what happens with all the lawsuits that were initiated under
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.040]   the previous regime.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.560]   When Steve Jobs came back to Apple, one of the first things he did was starting to settle,
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.560]   started to settle a lot of lawsuits that have been played for three or four or five years
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:33.920]   because a new CEO forgets about the passion and the outrage that institute that then
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.480]   cited the lawsuit.
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:39.880]   When the new CEO comes on board, they really just look at, okay, what is the problem here
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.320]   and how can we solve this problem?
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.680]   We don't want to, we're in the business of making hardware and software.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.960]   We're not in the business of ongoing litigation.
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:51.440]   I mean, it's a little bit different because Tim Cook was essentially co-CEO for three
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:56.080]   or excuse me, was it was as close to the top of the loop as possible for human to be without
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.440]   being a conjoined twin for the last three or four years.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:03.800]   But I do think that we've removed that, we've removed, Apple's removed that element of outrage
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:08.280]   that, oh, you've stolen our iPhone product, you do not get to steal from us and live.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:12.720]   And so therefore we must crush you as beneath the fist of an angry God, the bones of an
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.400]   unworthy, supplicant.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.280]   It just becomes, okay, well, we need to protect our property.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.800]   We believe that you owe us some money.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:19.800]   Let's sit down.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.720]   Let's have a condition, decide exactly how we're going to fix this.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.400]   I think it's better for us as Apple customers.
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:30.360]   I mean, if they can cross license these patents and then all of their products get better
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.320]   and the competition gets better, we end up getting better devices.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.720]   Well, it's definitely better for consumers.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.040]   I mean, I like Samsung's devices.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.040]   I use a Galaxy Note.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.040]   I love it.
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.520]   I just ordered a Galaxy S3.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.680]   I think Samsung makes great phones.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:44.040]   Maybe that's one of the reasons they're getting sued by Apple.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.960]   Yeah, well, let's see.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:49.040]   The phone market is getting really, really interesting because the hardware on the Android
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:53.680]   side is exceptional for the past six or seven months.
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:59.040]   The Samsung and HTC have been coming up with some really, really great devices that, man,
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:02.520]   if iOS were running on this, I would have absolutely no question that this was an Apple
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.520]   design device.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.520]   It's slick.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.520]   It's compact.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.520]   Battery life is spot on.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:08.240]   Performance is spot on.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:13.640]   And now even in the Android operating system on phones isn't up there with iOS yet, but
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:18.280]   it is close enough that for people who, I've said before, I'm the sort of guy who when
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.360]   I shop for a new car, I'm really looking for a boring fleet vehicle.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:25.240]   I'm not really a car guy for people who are just like that when they go to the Verizon
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:29.720]   store or the AT&T store, they're not necessarily looking for the hottest, the most coherent,
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:33.240]   the most cohesive solution that integrates all of your media and all of your personal
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:34.400]   and business life.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:38.440]   They're looking for a good phone that'll keep them in touch with people, let them text,
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:42.400]   let them post to Facebook and not very much more than that.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:47.120]   So I think that's where we're going to see a lot more Apple doing a lot more things that
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:49.560]   are, I wouldn't say atypical Apple.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:54.960]   But we wouldn't have all these rumors about Apple going to a foreign screen if not for
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:51:00.240]   the fact that Android is having such a great success in selling screens that are four inches
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.240]   at higher.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.400]   It's just, it's that competitive.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.840]   I think, I was, I was actually thinking about this this afternoon.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:10.800]   I think it's the only product category in which Apple, Apple actually sells a device
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:16.160]   that is price competitive with every other device that's in competition and how desperate
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:21.000]   does Apple have to be to sell something for the same retail prices as the competitors?
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.880]   You read that Wired article about Rockstar, right?
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.240]   That's a very interesting article.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.440]   I highly recommend it if you haven't.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:33.000]   It's from the Wired Enterprise blog, how Apple and Microsoft armed 4,000 patent warheads.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:41.600]   They've got a secret lab in Ottawa where they reverse engineer products and look for infringement,
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:47.960]   and it's funded primarily by Microsoft and Apple.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:54.880]   It's called Rockstar, or the Rockstar Consortium now.
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:52:01.360]   It's because Apple, Microsoft and some others bought those, those, those, nortel patents.
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:02.720]   That's what they're working on right now.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.480]   It's very interesting.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:08.000]   Rockstar owns the nortel patents, technically.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.760]   This is what often happens.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:17.600]   That works on your behalf because it's unseemly to sue about this stuff.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.920]   Very interesting article.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:25.000]   Robert McMillan writing in Wired Enterprise, if you haven't read it, but it's just the
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.520]   world we live in, I guess.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.840]   Look, I'm sympathetic.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:34.480]   If Apple really truly feels, hey, they stole our stuff, then I think it's appropriate for
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.480]   them to sue.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:40.440]   And if you're really kind of objective about it, you've got to say, well, maybe they didn't
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:41.440]   steal your stuff.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.840]   There was other stuff that looked very much like it.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.720]   There's one form factor.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:48.160]   If you've got a full glass touch screen and you've got icons, the stuff's going to all
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.800]   kind of look the same.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:53.840]   Is it really stealing or just that's the way it is?
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:59.200]   And often, I think that, good from the customer's point of view, as you said, John, it's best
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:06.680]   if they just make the best stuff they can and let the market inside.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:11.240]   I think that it's one of those things that Apple, I mean, part of what they do is innovate.
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:15.240]   So I think that they need to-- part of their business model is to get a little ahead.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:18.280]   And I think also, if other people were doing something that was kind of like it but not
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:21.120]   as good, kind of muddies the water if they don't get to do it first.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.960]   So I kind of understand some of those things.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:27.520]   I do think there are some of the Apple lawsuits that you just kind of roll your eyes like,
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.520]   really.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:29.520]   So everyone's doing that.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:35.160]   But I do think that there is a-- you don't do a patent if you're not going to defend it.
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.160]   Because if you don't defend it--
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.160]   Well, that's the point of patenting it.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.160]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.640]   Well, it's not defendable if you do that.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:43.240]   Now, it's another thing to buy someone's patents and then start suing everybody.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.720]   Which is what's going on.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:45.720]   Right.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.440]   And I think Apple-- I mean, I think Apple, Microsoft, they're at the top of the heap and
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.440]   they plan to stay there.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:52.440]   And I think that they're doing most of what they can to do that.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.720]   We're going to take a break.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:54.720]   We come back.
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:54:01.720]   We talk about the iPhone 5, which some say is-- back according to MacRumors, Steve Jobs'
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.440]   last big project.
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:07.080]   He worked closely on the next generation iPhone.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.280]   According to Bloomberg, actually.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:12.080]   We'll talk about that in just a bit, but first a word about as you get ready for the
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:16.960]   next generation iPhone, what to do with the old stuff, the stuff you don't want anymore.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.040]   Well, there's one place to go.
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:26.560]   The easy way to sell your iPhone, your iPad, your Android, your iPod is gazelle.com.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:30.200]   When you want the new stuff, you got to-- well, the wise thing to do would be to sell the
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.800]   old stuff, but it's a pain, right?
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.120]   So most of us just throw it in a drawer or a closet.
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:38.240]   How many of you, show of hands, have a bunch of crap in your closet in your drawer?
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.440]   That's-- yeah, we all do.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.720]   This is a way to turn it into cold hard cash for your next great thing.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:47.760]   Now gazelle is simplified and I think this is actually great for us because it makes
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.880]   it much easier.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:54.840]   They're focusing on Apple products, Blackberry products, Nokia products, and a few of the
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:58.320]   big manufacturers on Android, HTC Motorola Samsung and LG.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:59.480]   So it makes it very simple.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:00.880]   You go there and you select your product.
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.560]   I have an Apple iPhone.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:05.320]   Then you press the button, get an offer.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:09.920]   And then they show you the models and they'll give you a price right away.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:14.200]   Let's see, 64 gig, 345 bucks in good condition.
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:18.080]   You can get an Amazon gift card, a check, PayPal.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:21.240]   I would recommend the Amazon gift card because then they bonus you 5%.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:25.920]   They give you back and affect the Amazon credit.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:30.640]   So 5% additional on top of the price, they quote.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.200]   By the way, they give you some good information.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:36.920]   So they default to good, normal signs of use, and they say 9 out of 10 iPhones we see are
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:37.920]   in this condition.
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:39.440]   So you know, yeah, mine's probably there.
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:42.760]   Flawless means it's still in its package.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.120]   It looks like new has no scratches, no dust under the glass.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.760]   It might be and then it's worth even more.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:47.760]   Look at that.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:50.560]   And then if it's broken, they'll take it.
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:54.600]   If it doesn't power on, the LCD screen is broken or cracked.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.880]   They'll still give you 90 bucks for it.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.680]   I mean, look at this.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:59.680]   So you don't have to have it in perfect condition.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.400]   They pay the postage that quotes good for 30 days.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.680]   So at least go and get a quote.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.320]   And I got to tell you one thing.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.200]   These products are not gaining in value.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.040]   You know, they're really, they're not.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:14.520]   You're going to wait like 100 years, then maybe it'll be worth more as an antique.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:15.520]   Look at that.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:18.200]   You want to get rid of your Apple TV so you can get the next one.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:25.400]   Go to G-A-Z-E-D-L-L-E dot com and see what your gadgets worth.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:29.200]   Gazelle is not the same thing as an antelope, but it's similar.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.200]   It's spelled G-A.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.000]   Look at the horns on the logo.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.400]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E dot com.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.160]   Do you know my recommendation, choose the Amazon gift card.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:43.320]   And then the thing is just go now and get a quote because the quote is good for 30 days.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:46.320]   And I can promise you whatever it is, it's going to be worth less 30 days from now.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.720]   So don't waste time.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:51.840]   Gazelle it right now.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:56.080]   Steve Jobs worked closely on the design of the next generation iPhone with larger display,
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.880]   according to Bloomberg.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:05.320]   Apple's placed orders from suppliers in Asia for screens that are bigger than 3.5 inches.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:10.240]   The co-founder Steve Jobs worked closely on the redesigned phone before his death in October.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:14.560]   They've been working on this new device since before the iPhone 4S was introduced.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.600]   I think that makes sense, right, John?
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.840]   Because Apple kind of tick-tocks.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.480]   They didn't want to do a major upgrade to the iPhone 4 because people have two-year
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:25.200]   contracts.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.080]   But this is now the year that anybody who bought an iPhone 4 might be looking at a bit
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.080]   of a upgrade.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:33.640]   And he probably, I mean, I keep wondering when we're going to run out of these things
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:34.640]   to say that's too tough.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:35.640]   This is the last one.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:36.640]   Done.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:37.640]   You think?
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:38.640]   I think that's the last one.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:39.640]   Until the Apple TV.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.640]   Right.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.640]   Right.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.640]   That would probably be the mythical.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:44.640]   This is the unicorn of consumer devices.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.640]   Exactly.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:47.640]   The Apple television.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:48.640]   So what do you think?
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:51.360]   Do you have, I mean, we all see the rumors.
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:52.360]   Four inch?
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.360]   Is that what everybody seems to think?
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:57.560]   It seems to be what everybody's sort of banking on right now.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:02.480]   And then the question is just how, you know, what aspect ratio it's going to have.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.480]   Right.
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.400]   So I think it's going to be thin, narrow.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.400]   So I don't know.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:09.400]   Jinder, we're talking about this last week and he thinks it's going to be taller.
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:12.000]   It's just going to be the same width, but taller.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.720]   Cause the math works out listed the math works out and the argument that people seem to
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:21.240]   make about why Apple doesn't want to just simply scale things up is because they want
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:25.160]   to make sure that they maintain the same sort of radius that when you're, so you can
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:29.600]   still like touch the entire with the screen with one thumb without having to do this,
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:32.000]   which is what you have to do once things get a little bit larger.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.560]   What is the great negative of the Galaxy Note is that it's no longer one-handable.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.560]   It's so big.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:41.720]   I'm curious to see if this does pent, if this does work out, I'm really curious to see
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:49.920]   if this seems to be worth throwing in a different aspect ratio into the mix of iOS apps and
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:55.960]   iOS period because I mean, we all have used four inch Android phones and they're really,
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:59.880]   it's a little bit larger, but you can still really stretch your thumb and hit the hit
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:00.880]   the whole thing.
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:04.080]   And if you're making the screen taller, that's still some real estate you probably aren't
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.360]   going to be able to get with the top of your thumb anyway.
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:10.600]   So I'm just, every time I hear these rumors, they're starting to get a little bit firmer
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.480]   as we get, as we get closer to WWDC.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:20.040]   I just wonder why is Apple so terrified of making the iPhone a little bit larger physically?
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:23.720]   And why would they just simply throw this new thing into the mix just to avoid the obvious
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:29.160]   thing, which is same, same pixel dimensions, just make it's larger physical dimensions.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:33.920]   And the only real reason I can think of is that if they do the math and realize that
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:37.920]   they will no longer be able to call this a retina display given the rules that they
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.640]   themselves have defined for a retina display, because they would never want to simply say,
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:43.720]   oh, well, the four S is retina.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:47.080]   The five is not retina, but hey, look, it's larger.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:51.360]   Yeah, even the Wall Street Journal is now saying it's going to be a larger.
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:56.120]   And as these rumors get firmer, so am I, because I'm, I think a larger, I was about
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:59.640]   to say, you're getting excited about it later.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.680]   It's so title.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.760]   Because I just, I just, I like a bigger display.
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.800]   To me, size matters.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.520]   And I would love, I would love to see, I would just love to see it be a little long.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:13.560]   I mean, I would love to see 16 by nine aspect ratio rather than the little black, little
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.360]   black strips when I'm watching a movie.
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.400]   I mean, I don't really, I don't need much.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.040]   I don't, it doesn't have to be that much better.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.520]   I mean, there's going to be that much bigger just, just normalize the screen on a real aspect
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.480]   ratio rather than this weird in between that it that they have right now.
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.040]   Well, I think taller is a weird aspect ratio, isn't it?
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.840]   It's not 69 or anything.
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:31.840]   Is it?
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:32.840]   There's a reason.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:33.840]   No, no, right now it's not.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:38.880]   Making a 16 by nine iPad, they decided not to because you also the standard molecule of
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:44.920]   screen in a really nice tight mobile display is the is a classic Academy ratio.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:49.400]   I also have used devices that are wide screen.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.840]   They look okay.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:57.360]   It's just it's kind of a disconnective unless you use the that extra screen real estate
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.960]   as like a button bar or as a dock or something like that.
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:03.760]   There's just something that seems a little bit ungainly just to my eyes.
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:07.880]   I'm not going to say that as a universal observation, but just to my eyes, there's something
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:12.720]   ungainly about that wide screen aspect ratio, particularly when you consider that I almost
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.920]   never watch movies on my phone.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:20.720]   And when I do, it's not as though I'm looking for that sort of cinema experience where,
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.560]   oh no, Lawrence of Arabia has been ruined for me because it's in the wrong aspect ratio
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.440]   on the screen.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.160]   So I just it's weird.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.160]   I don't know.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:35.440]   Do we credit the rumors about this 7.85 inch iPad?
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.520]   Is Apple really going to do that too?
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.240]   I'd be very surprised by that.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.280]   The drum beat is so loud, but it doesn't sound right to me at all.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.800]   I'm trying to go for that.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:49.440]   And what's they're trying to just do the final strike on the pad, the tablet market, but
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.280]   it just seems like they're fragmenting.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:56.400]   But you know, according to Apple and Cider would be 1024 by 768.
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:01.600]   So existing, you know, Apple iPad one and two software would run the same.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.440]   That I kind of doubt because that because remember that that was a specific quote from
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.960]   Steve Jobs at the launch that you can't seven or screen like that and expect people with
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.160]   normal fingers to operate it.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:17.200]   So if you're just scaling down the existing for even first and second generation hardware
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.960]   screens to fit that, I think that sort of ruins it.
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.480]   I would I would I have no doubt that they have that plan in place for some way to do
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.400]   a $250 or $100 or $299 iPad.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:34.080]   That is pocketable once they start to see some pressure from that from from other manufacturers.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:40.680]   So if if Google really does follow through on the rumors that there is going to be a $200
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:46.480]   Apple ice cream sandwich, Tegra based tablet for $250.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:51.040]   And if Amazon follows through with what they've been doing with the Kindle historically,
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:58.600]   which is make a kind of a clunky first generation device that shows the value of the Amazon store,
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.520]   but keeps refining it year after year.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:04.840]   So I mean, imagine second or third generation Kindle fire hardware where it's thinner the
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:09.680]   battery that the touch interface works much, much better and it still costs $199 for color
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.680]   tablet.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.720]   That could be some pressure that would finally be exerted on the tablet market.
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.160]   So I think they're ready for it.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.040]   I'm not sure if they'll be they're ready to do it.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.760]   This Apple's ready to do it this year, though.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:22.960]   I think that if if Apple, I mean, I know that the Kindle fire, a lot of people really
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:28.000]   like their Kindle and everything else, but if Apple put out a a seven whatever screen
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.240]   and it was $199, how much market would there really be left for the Kindle?
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.920]   I mean, but who cares?
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.360]   The sales are down according to a but I think Apple.
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:39.480]   I mean, if the sales are really down, that's one thing.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:43.360]   But I think Apple cares because I think Apple doesn't want to give up any part of this market.
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.560]   I mean, you know, this is another they don't have to worry.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.560]   They own it.
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.560]   They are right now.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.560]   That's the thing is that it doesn't seem like they're really hurting for sales.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.560]   I cannot.
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.560]   I just I don't know.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:55.920]   I could see I think they have to do a four inch iPhone and I think we would all buy
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.320]   it because we'd be very happy to have a little more real estate.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.960]   I do not think they have to do a seven inch iPad and I don't think they will.
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:01.960]   I just I do not credit.
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:02.960]   At least not now.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.340]   I mean, it would be it would be interesting if if we're going to if we can take the
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:11.480]   luxury of extrapolating a little bit and think about we're we're dealing with two rumors
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:15.360]   in the past 50 minutes we acknowledge these are just rumors, but let's let's let's speculate
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.360]   a little bit.
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.360]   But if we're saying that Apple has now thinking about doing a seven inch iPad, they're also
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.640]   thinking about doing an iPhone with a different aspect ratio.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:28.060]   Maybe one that that would indicate that rumor number three that one of the bear when the
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:32.440]   core features of iOS six is resolution and screen independence that there is a system
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:39.020]   in place so that the operating system can figure out how to make the existing app work
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:44.300]   on a screen of varying size or varying shape kind of like how they did screen doubling
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:49.860]   on excuse me, that's where they called screen doubling, whatever on the iPad to let existing
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:53.660]   iPhone apps work, but they would make it work a lot better than simply doubling the amount
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:54.660]   of pixels.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:59.660]   So I don't know if I give credibility to either one of these things, but Apple's always
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:03.680]   very, very good at finding a way to make something that makes no sense in the abstract work as
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.800]   a practical thing.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.680]   I just I can't see it, but we'll we'll find out.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.280]   I don't believe in the Apple TV.
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.960]   By the way, John, you were right.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:14.440]   There is one more product that Steve worked on.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:19.600]   According to Mickey Drexler who's on the Apple board, he's the CEO of J. Crew.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.160]   Steve's working is this is a direct quote.
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:25.560]   Steve's dream before he died was to design an eye car.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:29.040]   I just want to point out that I said that a long time ago.
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.040]   Look at the car industry.
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:35.220]   It's a tragedy in America who is designing these cars says Drexler.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:36.700]   What would an Apple car look like?
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:37.700]   We'll never know.
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:42.900]   Drexler said jobs never ended up designing the dream vehicle.
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:47.700]   So I think, you know, I think when people ask like how big Apple can get, you know, I
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:51.460]   still think, I mean, obviously, if they get too scattered, they're going to fail.
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:56.060]   But I think that if they slowly keep on attacking markets, I mean, there are so many markets
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:06:01.800]   where there is nothing truly distinguishable about the people who are in them that Apple
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:05.040]   could very, you know, you kind of build on this kind of glow effect.
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:08.900]   I think you're going to hear a lot of these stories because I think Steve in his last
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.600]   days probably said, Oh, there's all these markets.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:16.440]   But I think Steve as the CEO is most famous for saying no to products and this is clearly
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.440]   a no.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:22.800]   Yeah, but I don't I think it's a no in the next decade, but I'm just saying that if
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:26.280]   Apple, let's say puts out a TV and then but the thing is, there's I'm not saying that
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.640]   it's necessarily a car tomorrow.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:31.560]   But what I'm saying is there are ever there are many, many, many markets that a lot of
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.560]   people use them.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:36.360]   They're base pro people could have designed a nice stereo to in fact, they tried.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:40.160]   I mean, you could go on and on, but I mean, let's really let's be honest, they're a computer
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.360]   company and John, go ahead.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:47.440]   Well, I just I mean, yeah, they're computer consumer electronics company.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:48.440]   That's I'm sorry.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:49.440]   You're right.
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:50.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.600]   Well, there's still some places that they can break into.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.480]   I think to Alex, what about closing cars cars?
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:59.000]   I think Steve had a really great fashion sense, but but isn't it?
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.120]   But if a car just not the number of labor, the point of a car is totally battery operated,
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.400]   doesn't that make it a consumer electronic?
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.840]   I think Ford's really actually moved very much in that direction.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:12.680]   That's why they announced the focus at the CES show, not the Detroit auto show.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.800]   I mean, I just can you drive it in your living room?
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.640]   No, little if it were little enough.
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:22.240]   Sorry, are you okay with not being able to turn right?
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.680]   That's not part of their vision for this first generation product.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.920]   They're thinking about it for this generation too.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.040]   No, but there will be no steering wheel.
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.040]   There will be no hot off.
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:34.640]   Study and find out that 90% of the users never turn right.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:39.160]   We just want the features for 90% of the people for relatives.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.960]   Simplify, simplify.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:47.560]   90% of the pedestrians are worth not running into the other 10% Hey, you know, I'm not
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:48.560]   going to be a little bit too much.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:53.320]   Well, John, this begs there begs to be a parody of the Isaac's in biography with Steve
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:57.840]   Jobs saying something like, I've been trying to design a car without an on off switch.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.240]   And I think I've licked it.
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.080]   Which is not driving well.
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.520]   It just means you're holding it.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.520]   You're just steering it wrong.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:06.520]   You're steering it wrong.
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:10.680]   That was my only that was my claim to fame is that my only ever I try not to make predictions
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.520]   because I'm so bad at them.
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:16.720]   But right before the iPhone came out, I, you know, and I was just joking.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.320]   And I said that it'll have one button.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.920]   I mean, and you're right.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.680]   It will be pretty much that one button.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.680]   It's one button.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:23.680]   It's a one button world.
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.800]   If you can't do it with one button, you shouldn't do it.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:26.800]   You don't want to do it.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:32.360]   I wonder how many times like Steve said, this is Steve, like was in his house and just happened
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.640]   to say, well, there was a visitor there.
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:34.960]   Hey, I want some more carriages.
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:35.960]   Oh, geez.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:38.920]   How come the refrigerating section is always on the wrong side of the fridge?
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:42.240]   That turned into, you know, that Steve Jobs is going to reinvent the fridge.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.800]   No, he just, he just decided to put maybe the eggs on the middle shelf the next time
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:46.800]   he does grocery shopping.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:47.800]   Maybe.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.400]   All right, we're going to do a lightning round and then we're going to get to our picks
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:55.320]   of the week iTunes Festival in London moving to September.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:59.640]   That's the annual thing that they now stream live on iTunes.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.480]   The only live streaming thing Apple does.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.840]   It'll be held at the round house.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:10.840]   60 acts, 30 nights in September usher and Millie Sande, Jack White of the White Stripes,
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.320]   Nora Jones in one direction, all been announced.
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:15.560]   30 nights of free music.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.920]   And if you're a resident of UK Ireland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, you can get into
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.480]   the lottery system to win tickets.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:24.480]   But of course, they'll stream it live through iTunes as they have in the past.
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:26.960]   And then I imagine this is a money maker for Apple.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:34.920]   Certainly promotes music and good for them.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:42.320]   iPhone 3GS will continue even after an iPhone 5, perhaps as a inexpensive contract free
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:47.360]   phone certainly available around the world at a lot less.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:51.040]   I think this is a good global phone for them.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.680]   The 3GS entry level.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:57.720]   It raises an interesting question though as to what happens when iOS 6 comes out if they
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:58.720]   will it run?
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:03.680]   Yeah, we'll run on that device.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:09.120]   Tim Cook, the according to the Wall Street Journal, highest paid CEO in the United States,
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:13.520]   which is interesting because it really hasn't had a chance to do anything, $378 million.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:17.800]   But you got to remember they include, I think, stock options and share awards and that he
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.960]   got one million shares last August.
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:23.640]   His base salary is only $900,000.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.520]   Only that much.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:28.640]   And he lives in the Bay Area.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.840]   So God, that doesn't go very far.
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.360]   You can hardly live on them.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.840]   How does he eat lunch?
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.600]   Brown bags it.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:39.640]   And those stock options which are sound like, make it sound like $300 million.
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.680]   You can't, he has to take him 10 years to exercise that.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:46.800]   So he may have it in the bank, but he can't use it until they vest.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.320]   So Twittlers and Centers make a lot of sense.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:53.840]   Low cash salaries and high stock options, I think make a lot more sense.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:54.840]   Oh, I agree.
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:01.680]   That's what we do here, except for the options.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.160]   Finally, we got to talk about this.
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:07.120]   I don't know if it's specifically an Apple product, but it's certainly the talk of the
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:12.800]   town right now, a Verge article on something called the LEAP 3D motion control system.
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.840]   It'll be $70.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:20.760]   It is, they say more accurate than Connect.
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.560]   CNET had the demo.
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.200]   In fact, there's a video if you want to see it.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:29.600]   The idea is it's compatible with Windows or OS 10.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:32.000]   It's available now for pre-order.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:41.240]   We'll certainly get one, but I would not maybe rush to get one yet.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:42.240]   There is an SDK.
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.520]   They're handing out free sensors to qualified developers that want to develop for the system.
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:50.600]   They say it's more accurate than a mouse and you let you mouse around.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.600]   I don't know.
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:52.600]   Would you pre-order now?
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.600]   There's a video.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.600]   No.
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.600]   I'm very nervous.
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.720]   Whenever I see these alternative pointing devices, we've been so disappointed in the
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:03.560]   past with head-mounted stuff and foot pedal mice.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.560]   This looks cool.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:11.280]   I'm not even that thrilled about using a stand-up desk and standing while I'm working.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:18.440]   I'm not sure how thrilled that would be if I have to keep my hands in zombie mode as
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.040]   I go throughout my work day.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:24.840]   For me, the sweet spot of this sort of technology is a TV screen.
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:27.560]   It's a large screen that you can operate at a larger distance because there are times
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.240]   when you just want to casual piece of information.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:34.280]   It's not worth even leaning down and activating a mouse or activating a keyboard.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:37.880]   You really just want the ability to make a gesture that says, "Okay, wake up."
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:41.720]   Another gesture that lets you page through information and then as you're standing up,
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:42.720]   you say, "Okay, I'm done.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.720]   I'm leaving the house now.
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.640]   Go about your business."
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.720]   It's really cool.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:53.040]   If the demo is as angry fruit or whatever that is.
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:57.560]   The resolution, both in frame rate of capture and also precision of being able to map your
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:01.640]   fingertips in three space, looks really, really awesome.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:09.320]   It seems like it's waiting for either a company to integrate this so holistically and so profoundly
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:14.840]   into the operating system itself where if you go into a full-screen mode on Mac OS, for
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:20.400]   instance, that is simply a way that you can do multi-touch and swipe gestures.
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:25.080]   If there were a way that it actually does affect every single app that you use and that's integrated
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.000]   into your day-to-day experience, that would be awesome.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.680]   If it gets popular enough, kind of like Grow where independent developers are always seeing
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:36.160]   places where they can add this functionality to it, that'd be another thing.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:42.800]   But if it really does become a way to go to the previous web page without having to hit
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:47.040]   two keys in your keyboard, not so much.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.280]   I think you hit the man in my head with it.
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:55.360]   I think even Steve said this, that the problem with putting touch on a laptop or desktop is
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:59.720]   your fatigue, your arms zombie mode is always out here.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:03.080]   I keep a magic trackpad on my desk in addition to a mouse and there's times when I want to
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.960]   use gestures, I just do it to the magic trackpad.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:09.800]   Maybe this is the kind of use that you would have for this.
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:14.160]   Just a little device, USB device you put in front of the screen and it senses as your
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:18.400]   hand breaks the plane, it's pretty sophisticated obviously.
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.120]   >> What would be really awesome is if you could actually use it not just for input but
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.120]   for 3D capture.
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:28.080]   I mean, if you could just hold up a 3D device in front of your screen, give it a turnaround
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.960]   and suddenly have a 3D object, you could integrate it with anything.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:36.120]   If you could just stick your face inside that magic box and suddenly put yourself in any
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:41.120]   movie from any angle, Forrest Gump is meeting you and Lyndon Johnson.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.120]   That would be cool.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:47.000]   >> I think the greatest feature of this is the fact that it's just 69 bucks and for 69
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.080]   bucks, a lot of people will say, "What the hell?
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.480]   I'll give that a try."
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:57.000]   If I only use it 14 times over the next month, it'll still be a fun thing to play with.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.960]   >> The other thing that I think they're doing right was they have an SDK and they're encouraging
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.200]   developers.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:05.440]   They're out of the box.
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:06.440]   There it is.
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:12.040]   There it is, angry fruit and with chopsticks, which I thought was kind of interesting.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:15.000]   That's a new way to play Angry Birds.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.280]   You don't want to play a game that long like that.
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.280]   But I think it's very...
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:23.320]   Look, the point of this demo, if you're watching the video, is that they see all of the hand.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.640]   They see 200 points on the hand.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.520]   Or it's 200 times more sensitive.
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.160]   So that's one of the other.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:35.400]   >> I think the Avengers movie success is going to really promote the success of this device
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:38.840]   too because we saw every computer, people holding things up in their hands and going
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:39.840]   like this.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:42.000]   >> It is what Hollywood wants.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000]   >> That's for sure.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   >> I'm waiting for it.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   >> Unless they're non-bored.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.640]   >> So I can use the computer floating in a sensory deprivation tank.
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:51.080]   I don't want to be doing this.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.640]   I just want to be in there.
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:55.920]   >> Well, it should be fried of all sensory input except for everything I can access by
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:56.920]   the internet.
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:57.920]   >> Exactly.
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.480]   >> It should be able...
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.880]   You should be able to do with your mind.
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.760]   If I can't do it with my mind, I don't want to do it with my hands.
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:06.400]   >> Pretty soon we're all trying to do these journeys.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:10.840]   There's going to be a little tap into the back and raw and little feeds.
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.920]   >> You saw that Pixar movie.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:14.920]   Was it Waldo?
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:15.920]   >> Wally.
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:21.040]   >> They're on the ship and they're all so bad because they never moved.
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.680]   >> They were on their way to that.
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:25.480]   They still were in their blobby self.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:29.240]   >> Thank goodness because they couldn't...
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:30.720]   It's just a matter of time.
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.720]   >> Yes.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.280]   >> All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.840]   We're coming back with your picks of the week, your iOS tip.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:38.360]   Do you have one in Alex or you can pass it?
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.360]   You are in.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.360]   >> I have my pick.
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:43.280]   It's always okay to recuse yourself when you're in England.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:44.280]   It's allowed.
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.280]   >> I didn't realize that.
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:50.720]   I was having some tea and I was thinking, do I really want to have a pick?
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:53.880]   >> It's one of the three rights we retain as former British subjects.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:54.880]   >> Exactly.
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:55.880]   >> You do.
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:56.880]   >> To do a take.
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:57.880]   >> That's true.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:59.520]   >> Our Mac always tip too, but first a word.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:00.680]   I got a tip for you.
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.640]   Hey, I got a tip right here.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:09.640]   If you're about to register a domain name, stop and go to hover, Macbreak.hover.com.
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:13.680]   There is the place to register domain names.
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.120]   First of all, because it's simple, it's clean.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.400]   There's not 100 clicks to get there.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.760]   They also include who is privacy automatically.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.760]   They know you want that.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.560]   They're not going to make you have to click there.
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:25.400]   Unlimited domain forwarding, advanced DNS management.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:30.480]   In fact, they have the best, most beautiful domain and email management tools out there.
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:33.400]   They don't try to upsell you on stuff you don't need.
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:37.600]   In fact, they don't even do hosting, but there is a hosting tab in your domain management
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.480]   tools where they can suggest hosting companies.
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:43.080]   They have over 25 top level domains.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:50.080]   Of course, you got .com.net, but also .co.ca.org, country specific ones, which are always
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:56.240]   fun to play with like .it.Asia.es.us.de.
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:03.800]   Some of the new ones too, if you want .terblex, sure they can do that.TV, we use it.pro.
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.480]   I could Macbook.pro.
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.560]   I should quickly reserve that.
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:12.760]   When you call for support, Monday through Friday, 9am to 8pm, Eastern, no hold.
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:13.920]   They will answer your question.
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.040]   They will support you.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.200]   And unlike those other guys, you will not spend hours on hold.
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:21.680]   I have never made a call to anybody without spending hours on hold.
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.400]   Anybody in this business except for Hover.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.400]   I just love them.
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.400]   Here's the deal.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.440]   When you want to buy a domain from hover.com, use the offer code, Macbreak.
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.640]   You get 10% off.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:35.840]   Make sure, now they don't put this in the app, but I'm pretty sure they're still doing
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:36.840]   it.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:40.640]   They're concierge service for transferring your domains, which is great.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.000]   I think they waive the fee on that.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.280]   It's only $25, but I think they waive the fee if you use, if you just say, "Hey, Macbreak."
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:51.320]   Leo said, "And they have a good deal when you move your domains over.
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:56.040]   They charge you 10 bucks per domain, but that extends the domain for another year.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:59.480]   And you get automatic who is privacy and everything."
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.480]   I really like Hover.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.960]   And I know you will too.
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.240]   We really think they're the best registrar out there.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:08.880]   So if it's time to register a new domain name, I want you to go to Macbreak.hover.com.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:09.880]   Just remember that.
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.600]   People are always tweeting me, "What was the name?"
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.840]   Because it's one of those things you don't do every day.
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:18.160]   And then in six months, you're going to say, "What was the name of that domain registrar
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:20.320]   Leo likes so much?"
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.320]   Hover.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:25.760]   Think of a little hummingbird hovering over you, spreading goodness and light everywhere
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.520]   it goes, twinkling off its wings.
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:32.120]   Hover Macbreak.hover.com.
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:35.560]   iOS tip time, Mr. Alex Lindsay.
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.960]   Hey, so where's my little headspace?
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:41.200]   I got a tip to glue your iPhone to the back of Andy's head.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.480]   That way, it's always available.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.480]   That is an awesome tip.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.480]   Look at that.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.480]   Oh, okay.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:49.000]   I have nothing to say now.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:49.840]   One of the things that...
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:52.920]   So I got the poll that you were talking about last week, right?
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:53.920]   So I have the little...
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:56.360]   The tadpole from K-TATEC.
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.360]   Yeah, love that.
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.760]   Oh, and you got the rock form case.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.320]   Well, after I saw yours, I had a book.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.480]   It's a lot better, isn't it?
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:04.680]   And then you can have a regular case.
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:05.680]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:08.320]   It's really great because I have that regularly and I just pop it on and then pop it off and
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.720]   it's really easy to get it on and off and it's great.
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:14.120]   But the problem is that once you extend it out, like I'm here in London and I'm finally
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:19.560]   going to get a little time to walk around tomorrow and you get this thing extended out
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:22.280]   and the problem is you can't now take a picture of yourself and you want to.
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:24.280]   You want to have it like way out there so you don't have to...
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:25.280]   You need a button.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.040]   You need a cord release or something.
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.040]   You need a cord release.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:31.960]   It turns out that I just as a reminder, if people haven't seen this tip or didn't know
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:38.040]   this, that the volume button on your little headsets that you might have worked.
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.040]   Of course, I forgot about that.
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:42.960]   So if you have your headsets plugged in, you can actually stick it out there and you've
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.240]   got this little cord and then you hit the little volume button and it takes a picture.
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:48.240]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:51.720]   And it's really, really useful.
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:56.720]   And I have been told that it works with Bluetooth as well so you can get up to 30 feet away.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.240]   I haven't tested that one.
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:01.720]   But that volume works really well and I've only tested it with the wired ones because
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:05.360]   I don't like the sound of Bluetooth ones but I'm thinking of buying a Bluetooth headset
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.960]   just as a wireless remote.
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:10.240]   So anyway, that's my tip for the day.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:13.960]   So with the Bluetooth headset, they all have that pickup button and you're saying that
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:14.960]   would take the picture?
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:15.960]   I think they have a volume.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:16.960]   Some of the Bluetooth ones have volume.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:17.960]   Oh, the volume.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:18.960]   And you hit the little volume button.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:19.960]   I haven't tried that.
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:24.360]   I'm told that you can use it with the phone and I will try that because I don't like Bluetooth
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.360]   headsets.
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.640]   You're using me either but you're just keeping your pocket and you could use it literally
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:28.640]   as a release.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:33.080]   Throw it out on a little tripod and then get everyone to say cheese and go click with
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:34.080]   your iPhone.
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.080]   I'm going to try that.
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:36.640]   Has anybody tried that in the chat room?
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:41.240]   Using a Bluetooth headset, the volume button on there when you're in the camera mode.
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:43.360]   I don't see anybody but we'll keep an eye out.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.360]   That's great.
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:45.360]   Next week we'll know.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.520]   Oh, well, no in a minute.
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:49.160]   And in fact, it works with some they're saying.
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.160]   Jacob says it works.
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.400]   Beatmaster says it does work.
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:54.400]   So it does work.
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:57.280]   Not with all but you should try it with yours and see if it works.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.800]   So if you're looking for that little extended so you don't always see that part of your
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.240]   arm like this.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:04.040]   I have about a million Bluetooth headsets at home.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:05.040]   I don't know why.
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.040]   Yeah, see, there you go.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:07.040]   You go.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.680]   I will try them and I will give you a list of the ones that it works with.
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:09.680]   There you go.
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:10.680]   Okay.
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.880]   Plantronics, Blue Ant, Motorola.
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.120]   I just got, I don't know why.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.120]   They seem to collect.
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:19.800]   And you know, they're just the right size to kind of collect in the bottom of the drawer
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:20.800]   there.
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.800]   Like a little cluster.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:22.800]   Yes.
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:29.280]   Are OS 10 tip from Andy and this is actually one of my oldest and most favorite tips that
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:32.720]   I had to reenact just a few weeks ago.
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:37.520]   iTunes playlists are never more effective and never more useful than when you've actually
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:41.840]   rated all of your music because that way you can say, don't just give me random rock
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:42.840]   songs.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:46.040]   Give me rock songs that I've rated as either four stars or greater.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:49.640]   But the problem is that you really can't you can't make it like a dull slog through your
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:52.600]   entire music library to just, okay, I'm going to
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.280]   look for anything that I haven't rated yet.
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.760]   I'm going to just listen to it.
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:00.400]   Instead, one of my standard playlists on my iPhone is a smart playlist that simply says,
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.360]   give me 25 songs that are unrated.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:07.640]   And so that's one of my as I take my my constitutional as I'm just looking for something to listen
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:08.640]   to.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:14.880]   I play that playlist and sort of make it a little bit of a goal to make sure that sometime
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:20.040]   during the time that every one of those songs is played, I take out the iPhone and actually
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:21.200]   rate the song.
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:24.840]   And then of course, the next time that I sync, suddenly all the songs that I've actually
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:29.000]   listened to and rated in this playlist no longer qualify for that playlist because this
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.200]   is a smart playlist of just songs that have not been rated.
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:36.560]   So iTunes obligingly fills all of those slots with or there's other songs that I have not
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:37.560]   rated.
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:41.280]   The first time that I set up this playlist and set up this little goal for myself, I
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:46.960]   got through several thousand songs and it didn't take me more than a couple of months
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.400]   to do so it seemed like I'm a shockingly short amount of time.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.560]   I was did that really stupid egotistical thing where you start to curse.
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:54.680]   I to oh, come on.
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:56.000]   This is my favorite playlist.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000]   You're not singing it properly.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.080]   Oh, you're not singing it because they're no they're not only eight songs left in my
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:02.080]   entire library that haven't been rated yet.
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.080]   Okay.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:06.600]   But now that I've sort of fell out of that habit, I've realized how many of the songs
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:08.760]   I've purchased in the past year have not been rated yet.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:13.760]   So I set that going to if you don't want to be quite that disciplined, a lot of people
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:19.360]   don't know is that iTunes tracks in your iPhone, your iPod and your other devices.
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.920]   Track all kinds of metrics about all of your songs.
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:26.200]   One of them is the last time that you skipped that song.
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.480]   So you can actually as a sort of a granular way of finding out what songs were like.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.520]   They're just part of the album and they're not one of the songs you really, really like.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:36.640]   You can then go into iTunes and say, give me a list of all the songs that I've that's
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.440]   been that have been played in the past two weeks, but I skipped them when I as soon as
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:43.000]   they started playing that will probably give you a good snapshot about the ones you want
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.640]   to sign like a one or two star rating to it.
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:48.080]   Just indicate that no, this isn't worth taking off my hard ride.
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:51.720]   Yeah, I'm only going to listen to this if I'm listening to the whole album.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:52.720]   Very cool.
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:53.720]   Very cool.
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:54.720]   Rate your music.
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.000]   Although somebody in our chairman says, I don't rate my music.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.440]   Marmot said, it's too much like picking a favorite child.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:03.840]   How many children do you have?
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:05.960]   Or should I say how many children do you have left?
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:09.680]   I have 25,000 and they're all my favorite.
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:14.240]   Let us get our pick of the week and yes, John Moltz says he has one of a very nice
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:16.800]   websites, John.
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:22.200]   My pick of the week is an app for iOS called Let's Sing.
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.960]   If you are familiar with, they probably hate this comparison, but if you're familiar with
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:30.360]   Draw Something, it's a little bit like that except with music.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:34.400]   What you do is you sign in and you find some friends to play with and then it'll throw
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:39.040]   up a list of, I forget how many three or five songs that you can choose from and then you
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:46.760]   have to hum or tap your foot or do whatever into your iOS device and it records that.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:50.240]   It sends it off to your friend who you're playing this.
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:51.680]   This is Mule, folks.
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:52.680]   No, this is not.
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:58.480]   This is from two great guys, Lex Friedman and Marco Tibini who got together to make this
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:05.440]   app and it's $5 to buy on iTunes, but there's also an ad supported free version, which I
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:07.440]   kind of like that model.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.440]   I usually, and I will buy this.
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:15.280]   So look for the one from beta testing, which has been a lot of fun.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:21.400]   I don't like to sing and particularly don't like to sing in front of people.
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:26.920]   This is actually, the fun part of this is even if you're bad at singing, it becomes
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:27.920]   a contest.
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:32.640]   So Lex and I were playing and it becomes a contest to really be bad at it and to try
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:39.000]   and sort of give the worst possible version you could to your friend to have to listen
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000]   to.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:46.400]   It's kind of a way to jab your friends and inflict some pain upon them while also having
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:47.400]   some fun.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:48.400]   So this is a good time.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:53.200]   I had a great time beta testing it and I think that people would really like it.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.000]   There's several Let's Sing on the iOS store.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.800]   It's the one with the red icon.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.320]   It's the one with the red icon.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:00.320]   It's from MTA.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.040]   In fact, do you have a close up chat?
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.280]   I can show you right here.
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.720]   I just downloaded it because I paid the.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:09.480]   It's also it's on Let's Sing App.com.
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:11.080]   Obviously without the punctuation.
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:12.080]   Okay.
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:14.960]   Yeah, don't get the there are other Let's Sing's.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.440]   It looks like it's your first time playing.
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.880]   Would you like a tour?
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:21.080]   Sure, why not?
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:22.640]   So yeah, it's a.
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:25.240]   And it's a nice and it's a nice they've done a nice interface too, I think.
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.840]   Yeah, cool.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:30.360]   So this this is kind of like those Smule apps though where you play instruments with people
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:31.360]   all around the world.
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:34.000]   But in this case, the instrument is you.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000]   Yes.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.840]   Cool thing is that it will it.
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:37.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:38.840]   Go ahead.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:44.360]   I'm just going to say I encourage people to try and to be as bad as they can be.
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:49.680]   Always going to say is that it integrates into like your address book by request only
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.400]   and your your Facebook.
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.320]   And so we'll look for people that you know who are already using the game.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:57.160]   So you can I set it up.
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:02.000]   I heard about it off of Jason Snell's Twitter feed this morning and just install it.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.440]   Not really think of that much about much of it.
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:06.160]   And then about an hour later was getting.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:07.160]   Oh, Jason wants to play.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:11.160]   It's Jason has a song for you and that's in here.
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.960]   Oh, dear.
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:15.040]   Oh, dear.
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.040]   This kid be a problem.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:19.320]   Not the best Freddie Mercury I've ever heard, but I got it.
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.160]   So you're supposed to guess what the song is.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:22.760]   And you're supposed to guess what the song is, right?
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:29.240]   So it's just you can record whatever you want, but you're supposed to just hum or tap or use
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:30.240]   it that way.
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:35.520]   And it's kind of like a draw something in which when you once your turn this the apple
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:40.600]   give you three choices and you know something like La Rezien from from an opera is like
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.200]   100,000 points.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:48.840]   But you know, but you know, love me do is probably like 10 or 20 points.
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:49.840]   So you.
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:50.920]   And so you this is another one of them.
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:53.240]   You get coins and the coins.
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.240]   Coins.
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.240]   Magical.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.240]   Came.
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:58.240]   Magical.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.240]   Canes.
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:00.240]   All right.
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.920]   Well, I guess I'll be chief twit on here in case anybody wants to send me a song listed.
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:07.280]   This worked out so well with draw something.
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:11.400]   I actually deleted the icon from my from my iPhone.
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.320]   So don't send me any drawings anymore.
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:16.080]   I feel back as my mom started playing with me, but I'm sorry.
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:20.320]   It's just like I can't draw something was a really classic example of like everybody
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.560]   used it and nobody used it.
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:27.360]   Apparently, apparently everybody's trying to use this at the same time.
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.560]   So I'll just have to register it a little bit later.
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:32.400]   A connection error occurred.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:33.880]   I am connected to the internet.
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:34.880]   It's you.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:39.560]   It's you that are not your pick of the week, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:44.120]   So I was looking for a good headset and I have a lot of them.
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:47.120]   I'm for some reason I've gotten to this spin of trying to find just the right headset.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:52.400]   And one of the problems that I have is that a I like driving with the windows open or
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.960]   the top down and all that stuff.
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:55.760]   And you want to be able to still talk on the phone.
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:30:01.080]   I also want to be able to do my little movies like at NAB or other things and be in a loud
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:04.520]   environment and actually be able to keep, you know, have an intelligible conversation
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:09.160]   as if you had like an SM58 that you were holding up, but without the SM58 part, the,
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:11.720]   you know, the handheld mic that everyone sees.
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:15.680]   And so I found a good and I had it for a couple months.
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:16.680]   I've been testing it.
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:20.120]   I didn't want to just tell it's expensive and I didn't want to tell anyone about it until
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:21.880]   I actually made sure that it actually worked.
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:24.440]   And so this is the this is the headset.
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:25.440]   It's not fashionable.
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:28.520]   I'll tell you right now, you look a little dorky with it, especially with this earpiece.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.000]   Look at this earpiece.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   This is like the weirdest.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000]   It's huge ever.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.120]   And it goes really deep into your arm, into your ear.
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:39.920]   And anyway, so it's like you're going to take your temperature with it or something.
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:42.160]   Anyway, but this is called the boom.
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:44.640]   It's actually a local company for you and me Leo.
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:45.800]   And I think they're in Santa Rosa.
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:47.240]   Oh, I know the boom very well.
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:48.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.560]   I've been using their stuff for years.
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:50.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:54.200]   And so these guys make, you know, the mics for pilots who are flying like Apache helicopters.
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:58.880]   And so the noise cancellation and, you know, all the stuff that they put the electronics
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:04.720]   they put into it, as well as all the mics and everything else, this is the best mic I've
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:09.240]   ever had like for the car when, you know, when the tops down or whatever or an allowed
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:12.120]   environment where you really need it to be, you need to be able to actually be able to
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:14.600]   hear you and you need to be able to actually hear them.
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:19.760]   The intelligibility is so is much higher in this than I've ever had in another with another
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:21.360]   headset.
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:22.760]   So it's about 300 bucks.
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:26.560]   So it's not it's not the cheapest solution for this.
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:27.560]   Wow.
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:32.080]   Anyway, so so I the the sounds good.
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:35.560]   I spend a lot of time in the car where I have recently.
[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:39.400]   And and to me it's like lost time because I can't no one can hear anything.
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:43.640]   And so and anyway, so I had my top down.
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:47.920]   I have a little convertible and I had my top down driving up from my view.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:50.720]   I'm glad you explained it was a convertible.
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:51.720]   Right.
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:52.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:53.720]   So I had to top off.
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:55.560]   I just actually I just hacked out.
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:56.560]   I just hacked out.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:01.040]   I just took a sausade to it and just just cut off the top.
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.040]   I hate having the top there.
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:07.760]   So anyway, so I was so I but I was literally making phone calls all the way back and I asked,
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:10.920]   you know, I asked my wife whether she thought that she thought it was in the office.
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:14.720]   I mean, you know, you know, like literally she couldn't hear anything around me.
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:16.360]   So it's just a really, really great.
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:20.720]   If you're looking for the one and I've been really kind of on this search for a great
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:25.160]   microphone for a long time that I can use in loud environments again, so I can make my
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:31.480]   little movies without having a huge set of stuff and also so I can talk with with my
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:32.480]   top down.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:35.680]   So anyway, so anyway, it's great.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:38.360]   Keep your top on.
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:41.040]   There it is.
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.040]   We say it again.
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.640]   The name full name is the boom.
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:47.360]   The boom and it's like the boom.com and they make lots of little ones and they have a little
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:51.160]   adapter so you can go into your iPhone or Android, but it also has they have like two
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:52.160]   eights.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:56.200]   And a USB adapter so you could use it with your computer and I'm going to get it because
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:59.400]   I want to see how well that works, but I haven't, haven't got a chance.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:00.400]   They've got a lot of solutions.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:05.160]   You know what I want to do because I have competitors, a product which is only 120 bucks
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:08.440]   and I want to give it to you when you get back and I want you to compare them because
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:13.760]   I use the blue parrot road warrior B250 XT also noise canceling now.
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:18.640]   They don't do helicopter pilots, but truckers use this a lot and I've been, I've been pretty
[01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:19.640]   happy with this.
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:23.800]   You know, the real key to both of these is they put the microphone by your mouth, not
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:24.800]   on fire ear.
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:28.560]   I think that everyone wants to make a fashion statement and they get it too far away and
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:29.880]   you really need that proximity.
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:33.080]   So I think that it's really, really important to have it there.
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:34.400]   What's the talk time or one?
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:35.400]   I couldn't find it.
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:37.440]   What's the talk time on the boom?
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:38.960]   It's not it's it's so wired.
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:39.960]   It's wired.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:40.960]   Oh, it's wired.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:41.960]   Okay.
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:42.960]   So this one's wireless.
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:43.960]   Got it.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:44.960]   Okay.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:45.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:47.760]   I think I think it's limited to, you know, you know, as long as you can talk, the battery
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:50.560]   life of your iPhone because it's wired, of course.
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.200]   You know, I prefer wired.
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:54.680]   Actually, I want to try that because I do prefer wired.
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:55.680]   I don't like the sound.
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:56.680]   I don't like the sound.
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:57.680]   I don't like the clicking that I hear with Bluetooth.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:58.680]   Right.
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:00.280]   So I've never had a Bluetooth mic that I didn't hear clicking.
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.280]   No, I'm with you.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:02.280]   I'm with you.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.280]   All right.
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.720]   You that might be worse than 300 bucks.
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:08.560]   Ironically, even though it does less than a Bluetooth headset, it does less.
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.560]   It's worth more.
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:11.560]   It's it's nifty.
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:13.040]   Yeah, that's the tech turn for it.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.040]   Nifty.
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:16.200]   Well, I'll let you compare it even though the other ones Bluetooth.
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.200]   Okay.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:20.520]   What you should do is make me make some phone calls from with your top down.
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:21.520]   Yeah, I'll call you.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:22.520]   I'll call you and then I'll.
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:23.520]   And we'll write around.
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:24.520]   You send video too because I'd like to see that.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.440]   And now ladies and gentlemen, it's Alex.
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:27.920]   I mean, Andy and that go.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:30.920]   No, no, I got a dirty mind today.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:32.840]   I don't know what it is.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.240]   I think it's because of Moltz.
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:35.240]   It's your fault.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:36.680]   I'm sure I have that effect on people.
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:38.640]   You do.
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:41.640]   Your pick, Mr. Naco.
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:44.320]   Hug-in is a good name for an app.
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:49.320]   It's an open source app.
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:53.760]   It's an open source app free and it is a panorama stitcher.
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:57.280]   Now there are a lot of good.
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:02.360]   It's kind of like it's a good example of what open source does really, really well.
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:04.720]   In that it's not really terribly easy to use.
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:08.960]   There are a whole bunch of different panorama apps out there where you it's truly just drag
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:13.260]   photos into this app window in any order you want to click a button and automatically
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:17.080]   align them automatically, you balance the exposure, spits out a picture.
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:22.940]   So it's not quite as one step as that for assembling a panorama, but the big win is
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:26.040]   that it gives you fine control over all of the results.
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:29.200]   You can, a lot of these easy to use apps.
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:34.220]   They work really great if you've set, if you've taken some really nicely aligned images.
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:35.900]   Otherwise, it's just not going to work.
[01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:40.000]   And if it doesn't work, there's no plan B. With Hug-in, you do have the option of saying,
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.020]   I want to tell you what points are shared between these one, two, three, four, five,
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:46.820]   10, 12, 40 pictures and how you should align them.
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:49.240]   You can also do things as you're seeing on the screen there.
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:53.740]   Maybe you don't necessarily want a very photographic flat image.
[01:35:53.740 --> 01:35:58.540]   If you want to actually do some distortion around it and have it, the maligned in a sort
[01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:01.740]   of an interesting geometric way, you have that control as well.
[01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:03.420]   But it also has a hidden feature.
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:07.620]   And this is how, what someone recommended this to me on Twitter after I start posting
[01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:13.800]   pictures of a new 180 degree fisheye lens that I got from my micro four thirds camera.
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:19.080]   That it will actually do lens correction on just about any parameter that you want.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:23.640]   So if you, so forget about a fisheye lens, even if you just have like a regular kit lens
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:28.460]   on your camera, there's always some sort of a barrel distortion to the lens.
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:31.960]   This makes it pretty easy to correct that and make it flat.
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:36.360]   Or if you're just taking a regular picture of like an architectural photo just by virtue
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:41.320]   of the fact that you're not on some sort of a crane dangling in midair in front of the
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:44.720]   building, there's going to be like perspective that's sort of skewed.
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:46.720]   It's just not going to shoot that way.
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.920]   You can also use this app to correct things like that.
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:52.200]   So it looks like all the right angles will look like right angles, all the verticals
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:53.800]   will look like verticals.
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:58.440]   So it really is, it takes a little bit of getting used to, but there's practically no
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:05.200]   kind of image alignment and panorama assembly or image correction.
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:09.680]   It's like optical distortion correction that you can't perform with this.
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:13.120]   And so it does take a little bit to learn, but there are, there's good documentation.
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:16.040]   There are tutorials for this all over the place.
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:21.520]   And the good news is that because they didn't care about making a nice clean consumer interface,
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:25.520]   you can do things like simply say, okay, this is my new Rokinon fisheye lens.
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:29.640]   From now on, you remember that whenever I tell you that I want you to unfish eye an image,
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:32.680]   here is the, all the parameters I've already set for you by trial and error and just use
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.560]   this and preload this already.
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.000]   So Andy, can't be the price.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.160]   It's free and the results are really pretty nice.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:43.720]   It's a Huggin with one G, H-U-G-I-N, and source average.
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:45.720]   Very interesting.
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:46.720]   Wow.
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:47.720]   It's free.
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:48.720]   I like the price.
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:49.720]   I don't mind playing around with stuff.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:50.720]   That's pretty good.
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:52.280]   I'll have to try it.
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.280]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:54.280]   Appreciate it.
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:59.840]   My pick of the week is something that has been around for a while, but I want to mention
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.720]   it again because they just did a big update.
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:06.520]   And for the first time ever, I've mentioned Sparrow before as being a great email tool
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:07.520]   for Gmail.
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:11.680]   If you use Gmail, you would love Sparrow, lightweight email tool on OS X and iOS, by
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:12.680]   the way.
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:13.760]   And I use it on both platforms religiously.
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.240]   They've just added popmail support.
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:19.200]   So now it works with pretty much any internet service email.
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:25.920]   It is a very lightweight, very easy, very fast email application that has some very handy
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.480]   features, highly recommended if you haven't tried it.
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:32.560]   It's in the App Store right now.
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:37.680]   Sparrow, and they just did a major update so that everybody can use it no matter what
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:39.200]   email package you're using.
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:40.480]   I'm a big fan.
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.120]   Check it out.
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:45.160]   That's about it for this week's edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:47.040]   I want to thank you, John, for being here.
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:48.800]   We'll have you back soon.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:49.800]   That'd be great.
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:51.800]   John's website is a nice website.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:52.800]   It's a nice website.
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.560]   A very nice website.
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:57.400]   Very, very pretty, very simple.
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.440]   Very nice website.net.
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:04.040]   Is there anything else John Moltz you would like us to plug?
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:05.040]   No.
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.040]   No.
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.680]   He does other stuff.
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:11.600]   He really does, but he won't say.
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:12.600]   It's a secret.
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.040]   The law requires me not to.
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:17.520]   The law prohibits him from any announcements regarding.
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:18.880]   But you know what?
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:25.640]   He's one of the funniest guys in the Mac world and started a very nice website.net.
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:26.640]   Great place to start.
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:27.640]   Thank you, John.
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:28.640]   Thank you.
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:30.840]   Good interview with John Gruber.
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:35.080]   Good conversation on John's The Talk Show this week.
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:37.720]   Now on a new site.
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:38.720]   Is it Mule?
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:39.720]   What is it?
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.200]   Mule Radio Syndicate.
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:42.200]   Mule Radio Syndicate.
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:43.640]   I wanted to give them a plug.
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:44.920]   We actually asked John if he could join us.
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:45.920]   He couldn't.
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:49.280]   We'll have Gruber on another time, but that's cool.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:50.280]   That's cool.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:53.480]   Alex Lindsey is in London working with the Salesforce.
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:55.160]   But will you be back sometime soon?
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:56.160]   I hope you will.
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:40:01.680]   I'm going to be in London again working with somebody else next week.
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:03.680]   But I'm going to find fast bandwidth.
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:04.680]   I'm committed to it.
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:05.680]   I should be around.
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:06.680]   And then I'd love to be back.
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:10.440]   I'm going to appreciate you taking the time to do that because we would miss you.
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:11.440]   You should see what it.
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.800]   I don't want to push it to it.
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:14.960]   You should see what I had to do to get this room.
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:21.800]   There's a 200 foot ethernet cable from the... that we strung through.
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:24.000]   I was afraid someone was going to cut it because they're breaking everything down.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.800]   I was just like, "Well, we'll enjoy this as long as it lasts."
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:31.200]   So anyway, but I'll be in London again next week.
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:32.840]   And I'll be back soon.
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:33.840]   Great.
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:35.960]   Alex is at Pixelcore.com.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:40.080]   If you want to know more about the Pixelcore.tv for his podcast, do you still do the Live Thursday
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:41.240]   night stuff even with your...
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:42.400]   We're not doing the Live Thursday night stuff.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:43.400]   You're not around.
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:46.080]   Because we're doing so much live for so many people.
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:47.680]   We don't have time to do it for ourselves.
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:49.080]   Sometimes it's good to get busy.
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.080]   It's okay.
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:51.080]   It is.
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:53.960]   Sometimes I'd like to have a little break.
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.320]   But I'm really enjoying what we're doing.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:56.320]   We're having so much fun.
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:00.480]   And you feel like you're kind of on the edge of a revolution.
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:01.480]   So it's a lot of fun.
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:02.480]   Well, just good news.
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:05.600]   The tweet will never be so successful that I won't be sitting in this chair.
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:06.600]   I ask what we want.
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:11.400]   You'll know when I'm really successful, Leo, because I'll always be in Petaluma.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:12.800]   That's the true success.
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:13.800]   That's the true success.
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:15.640]   It's never working again.
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:19.160]   Well, no, no, I'll be there and there'll be people that go do those things.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:24.600]   And I'm in the growth curve, but I'm not truly successful.
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:26.920]   Yeah, I'll just be hanging out around there.
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:27.920]   That's right.
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:28.920]   Smoked the cigars.
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:32.760]   I doubt Richard Branson actually flies any of his planes.
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:33.760]   Exactly.
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:35.320]   He's always taken it easy.
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:38.720]   He's got a super metal on one arm scarring a brandy on the other hand.
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:40.400]   And he's just living life.
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:42.520]   That's success.
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:43.520]   Exactly.
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:44.520]   I'm not successful yet.
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.480]   I'm just just nugging through it.
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:49.440]   And we hear Sir Alex Lindsey's on the line from London.
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:50.440]   We'll know.
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:53.200]   I'll be like, "Hello, and I'm here on my island."
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:54.840]   I just call it.
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:55.840]   How's the bandwidth?
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:56.840]   I just got the dish done.
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:57.840]   You know.
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:03.600]   And of course, there is the great Andy Inato, who's looking more and more like Wolverine
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:04.600]   by the minute.
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:07.120]   It's good to have you as always.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:11.640]   Chicago Sun Times, and of course his website, www.cwob.com.
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:14.320]   And Andy I on Flickr, because he's always taking great pictures.
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:15.320]   Now that new camera.
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:16.320]   He's loved.
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:17.320]   You bought it.
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:18.320]   And I'm glad you did.
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:19.320]   Yeah.
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:20.720]   I'm having a lot of fun with it still.
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:22.760]   It's just fantastic stuff.
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:27.560]   Look for the duck pictures with the energy.
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:33.660]   Not only that, but the last test I did in the public garden was the test of squirrel
[01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:35.440]   priority autofocus.
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:38.920]   Look at that.
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:43.040]   That is actually one of the actual tests in my test suite, because now most new cameras
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:45.040]   have motion tracking autofocus.
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:49.360]   And so basically my test is if I can take pictures of squirrels as they're moving, like,
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:53.280]   okay, I think this is, I think this motion, motion priority autofocus is working pretty
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:54.280]   good.
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:55.280]   It recognizes squirrel faces.
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:56.280]   Squirrel, exactly.
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:58.280]   That one's that one's Lonnie.
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:42:59.280]   Hi, Lonnie.
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:00.280]   How are you?
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:03.040]   Does he have a Facebook page?
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:05.520]   No, he's on Pinterest though.
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:07.120]   He's very, very active on Pinterest.
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:10.960]   I want to mostly nuts and legumes.
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:11.960]   Follow his nut feed.
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:13.200]   It's fantastic.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:18.000]   I want to thank you all for being here, because this is actually an important Mac break weekly
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.000]   for two reasons.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.720]   First of all, it's Chad Johnson's first Mac break weekly.
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:25.960]   Once again, excellent job Chad Johnson filling in for replacing Eileen Rivera, who's moved
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:28.040]   on to bigger and better.
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:29.560]   And thank you, Chad, for doing a great job.
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:33.520]   And it happens to be our 300th episode.
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:36.720]   And we did not really in any way commemorate this.
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:37.720]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:38.720]   There goes Andy.
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:40.640]   He's had it.
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:41.640]   He's left.
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:44.080]   He's got something but a squirrel left.
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:45.400]   So 300 episodes.
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:46.400]   I don't know.
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:47.880]   We should have done something.
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:55.880]   Alex, you've been here since episode pre 300, because of course, oh no, no, no.
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:57.680]   He shot us.
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:02.640]   Because Mac break weekly is a derivative of the video podcast you started, Alex, called
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:04.640]   Mac break.
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:09.720]   And I don't think Mac break ever got to 300, although it comes back, comes and goes.
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:12.320]   I think when you're out of work, again, we'll do some more.
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:15.900]   I'm really like, you know, you'll know that you'll know that the business has slowed
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:20.680]   down because suddenly there'll be this massive explosion of podcasts that come out of Picsquark
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:22.320]   because we're so well armed now.
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:23.320]   I know.
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:24.320]   We have got the gear.
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:26.680]   So the gear, we still don't have any time to do anything.
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:32.720]   So but yeah, we, you know, we inconsistently put out Mac break weekly and then you took
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:35.160]   it over and made it much more consistent and much better.
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:38.560]   So you really get, you get your pre history of Mac break weekly.
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:40.800]   So we thank you for creating this show.
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:45.880]   I'm just glad I'm glad that you took it and made it the great show that it is now.
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:48.040]   Well, and you're a major part of it.
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:49.240]   So thank you, Alex.
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:50.240]   Thank you all.
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:52.920]   I know there are some of you in the audience who've actually watched or listened to all
[01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:55.600]   300 episodes and we're grateful to you.
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:45:00.000]   And I have really only one thing to say, this is Mac break.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.080]   Okay, just 300 get it.
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:04.160]   No, yeah.
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:05.160]   We do this.
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:08.760]   I thought you'd bring back a touch.
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:11.360]   It's not going to show you my six pack.
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:12.360]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:13.360]   I got it.
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:16.680]   I thought you'd bring more Mac users than than than I did.
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:23.640]   What kind of computer do you use an HP and you we we do the show every and every Tuesday,
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:28.440]   11 am Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time be here for episode 301 next Tuesday and then on July
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:34.840]   our June 11th, we will be on a Monday because of WWDC and we'll talk about the worldwide
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:35.840]   developers conference.
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:42.480]   I'm sure iOS 6 and OS 10 Mountain Lion and Aaron Hillagas from the big nerd ranch will
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.480]   be joining us.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:45.520]   Of course, one of the top Mac developers out there.
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:50.000]   So you will have a lot to say about what Apple is offering to developers.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000]   That's June 11th.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000]   Am I right?
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000]   Chad, I believe correct.
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000]   Yep.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000]   Yep.
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.000]   And what else?
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:00.400]   I think that's a that's about all I have to say about the show.
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:05.400]   So my friends, I think you should get back to work because break time is over.
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:06.000]   At least for now.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.580]   (upbeat music)
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:11.160]   (upbeat music)
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:13.740]   (upbeat music)
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:16.580]   (upbeat rock music)
