[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.320]   And joining us right now, back from La Jolla, California.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.880]   Yes.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.040]   What were you doing La Jolla?
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.960]   We were shooting, we were doing graphics and shooting
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.600]   for the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.680]   Alex Lindsay, ladies and gentlemen, the King of Fish.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.000]   I learned a lot about tuna.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.800]   I know a lot about--
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.520]   Is tuna sustainable?
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.520]   You know, that was the question that I asked, actually.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.040]   Oh, no.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.760]   It is sustainable, but they need to change the way
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.680]   that they're fishing it.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.240]   So it's not currently.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.120]   The crazy thing is, is that the ISSF and the groups
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.080]   that are related to it are-- it's an industry
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.920]   trying to regulate itself and the governments are actually
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.040]   the ones dragging their feet.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.800]   I think that's great.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.280]   Because the industry is trying to figure out
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.880]   how do we keep tuna working, but they have to get all the
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.680]   governments to agree.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.480]   And it's just-- and so that's what they're all trying to
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.000]   figure out.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.680]   As Adam Smith would say, they have a vested interest in the
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.120]   sustainability of tuna.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.160]   They had a good graphic.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.960]   It was like, you're making lots of money here.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.960]   You'll make a little less for a while, but if you don't do
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.120]   this, then we won't make any money.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.600]   I'll make no money for a long time.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.320]   Also joining us from Mr. Andy Inako from Boston.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.600]   Hey, Andrew.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.880]   He's silent.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.600]   Are you doing that to me on purpose?
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.520]   Are you trying to make--
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.880]   Sorry, no.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.960]   I was opening a refreshing beverage for this.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.400]   Beat the heat.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.480]   And I thought that perhaps that would have to be a good
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.240]   counterpoint out.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.840]   It's a description of what he's been up to.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.840]   Although I was going to say that the sustainability of tuna
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.040]   is oddly enough, is the name of my indie spec script.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.440]   I'm hoping that--
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.520]   not sunda-s, but me.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.880]   I can get into slam dance for sure.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.960]   Just trying to raise that funding.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.640]   It's going to be a Kickstarter project.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.440]   Well, I always-- when I hear weird phrases,
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.640]   think that's my band's name.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.480]   But I think you're good.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.280]   Indie spec script.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.560]   Good.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.440]   I like that.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.960]   Little better than a band.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.320]   Well, tuna's very important to me,
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.000]   because my favorite dish that my wife makes is actually
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.160]   tuna fish salad.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.520]   I love--
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.640]   She makes a lot of great things.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.560]   But I stopped eating--
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.680]   because it's loaded with mercury.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.440]   You don't want to eat that high on the fish chain.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.360]   Oh, I love tuna fish.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.760]   It's not good for you.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.040]   You know what?
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.320]   I love tuna tartar.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.960]   I love ahi tuna.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.720]   I love seer-dahi tuna.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.640]   I love all-- what is it?
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.360]   Homachi?
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.680]   I love all that stuff.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.760]   But I don't eat it because I'm worried about the mercury.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.320]   I figure I'm going to die of something else probably.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.080]   We want to welcome you to this week in tuna.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.720]   Let us talk about the makotosh.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.440]   There are rumors afoot.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.640]   We've been thinking for a while.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.640]   The Thursday was going to be the day for lion.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.440]   Now we're hearing perhaps that Apple stores will close overnight
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.920]   on the 13th.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.640]   That's usually how they prepare for a new rollout.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.160]   9 to 5, Mac has a rumor not only that there'll be a new Mac
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.360]   book here featuring Thunderbolt and Sandy Bridge,
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.680]   but new Mac Pros, the high end.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.240]   I'm very excited about that because we
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.440]   are just about to buy new machines for the new studio.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.640]   And so I've been holding out.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.960]   I was like, I can't hold out much longer.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.960]   I'm going to have to start buying Macs if I don't already--
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.280]   we purchased all of them.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.880]   Mac Pros, the new studio.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.960]   But really, honestly--
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.400]   Do you think it matters that much?
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.000]   What is in the new-- what do you think the new Mac Pro would--
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.320]   Besides Thunderbolt, 9 to 5.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.760]   To me, well, there's two things that I'm really
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.360]   hoping to see out of them.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.960]   It is-- one is Thunderbolt.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.840]   And the second is a new form factor
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.640]   that possibly would let us rack it.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.920]   So so--
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.840]   Oh, rackable would be kind of cool because they did kill the X
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.120]   serve.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.880]   So we don't have a rackable Mac.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.040]   The dream machine for me would be like a 2U box.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.120]   2U is--
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.600]   It's 2 units high.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.200]   2 units high.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.280]   So 2U box, maybe 3, 19 inches wide,
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.600]   has maybe two slots in it.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.920]   I don't need a lot of slots because we're
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.520]   going to have Thunderbolt.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.360]   We're going to not--
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.320]   You don't need slots.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.440]   We don't need a lot of slots.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.960]   And so that's what I'm hoping to see
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.680]   because that's what we need.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.600]   Because I want to be able to connect those downstairs,
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.680]   have all of our machines in the basement
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.680]   and the monitor's upstairs.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.600]   I see you sitting in front of 8 and 11 inch MacBook Air.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.040]   Yes, it's the old one.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.440]   I love it.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.680]   All right, Thunderbolt, that would
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.640]   make a big difference for you.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.000]   Sandy bridged a bit much, much faster processors.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.400]   These processors are very anemic.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.960]   But really, I think--
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.560]   I love to see a Sandy bridging here.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.760]   For this machine, whether it has Thunderbolt,
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.240]   I don't really care.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.920]   Same thing with--
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.760]   I have the 8-way Intel Mac Pro, whatever that is.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.440]   Is it Sandy bridged?
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.840]   No, it's the predecessor.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.360]   But I think 8 cores is fast enough for me.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.960]   But Thunderbolt could make a difference.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.040]   And you know what's going to make a difference on that little
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.760]   bugger, that little MacBook Air sitting right in front of you?
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.240]   Yes.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.600]   Backlit keyboard.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.360]   Backlit keyboard.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.280]   Yeah, I noticed that.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.280]   That's the rumor, right?
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.680]   I was thinking about it.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.800]   Backlit keyboard.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.480]   It's amazing that this feature that so many people thought,
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.360]   oh, it's just a frill.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.880]   Oh, it doesn't realize the flash, typical Apple.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.000]   But then after you have one, you realize
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.440]   that it's only a terrible feature except for that one time
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.480]   per week that you realize that you cannot use this machine
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.080]   in this lighting situation unless there's
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.560]   a little bit of backlighting.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.960]   I think people are almost as excited about the idea
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.440]   of backlighting on a MacBook Air as they
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.360]   are about the Thunderbolt.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.640]   I agree.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.200]   More so, because Thunderbolt still is really more speculative.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   I mean, it's not like there's a whole lot of stuff
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.280]   that I can't wait to do with Thunderbolt.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.520]   There's a lot of stuff that I can't wait to do.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.320]   Well, you're a very unusual case.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.360]   You're the edgiest of the edge cases.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.560]   I mean, you're talking about hard drives.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.880]   When we talk about edgy, though, I mean, when you look at the sales,
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.000]   I mean, there were 2 million people using Final Cut,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.920]   as last count, all of those people are
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.360]   and more are going to be interested in a Thunderbolt connection.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.560]   Because that's the--
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.960]   Well, that's why I can't use Final Cut, I realize,
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.680]   because I don't have-- I need a Sand connection.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.040]   And I don't think Final Cut's-- that 10 has Sand.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.760]   Rumor is that that's--
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.400]   Well, rumor ain't going to help me right now.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.680]   I need to actually record.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.760]   Rumor won't help me record.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.480]   I definitely-- definitely.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.720]   We're not rushing to any new platforms.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.240]   Unfortunately, we have the licenses for Final Cut, bro.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.640]   And we--
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.120]   Exactly.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.520]   --studio.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.480]   We're sitting there, and we're going to continue to use them.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.040]   But as I add machines, then we have the decision.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.120]   Believe it or not, I mean, Jeff Stewart upstairs,
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.960]   one of our most senior editors is saying,
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.680]   well, let's look at Avid, let's look at Premiere,
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.240]   let's not look at Final Cut.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.320]   Well, and we're going to take a good hard look at it.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.920]   We're doing that training.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.640]   We're having some of your guys come to.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.640]   For Final Cut Pro 10.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.200]   Final Cut Pro 10.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.880]   And that is-- so we're going to-- but to us,
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.960]   that's us exploring what-- making sure that we know what
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.200]   it can do and what it can't do.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.680]   Right.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.960]   That's going to be the-- so in August, we'll know that.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.480]   What else do we speculate?
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.400]   Because we don't know.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.480]   But what else do we speculate about announcements this week?
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:56.520]   So concurrent with Lion, New Mac, Pro's, New Airs,
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.520]   faster processor than the Air, backlit keyboard,
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.040]   Thunderbolt.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.240]   Obviously, any new Mac's going to have Thunderbolt.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.120]   How about the Mini?
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.240]   Will we see a new Mini?
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.160]   Well, a Mini with Thunderbolt would be a big deal.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.560]   Thunderbolt Mini would be very hot.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.280]   Because the thing is, is that there's
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.760]   a lot of things you want to do with it that's a server-like.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.440]   But we can't interface a lot of the things
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.160]   that we want to interface with it, because we don't have
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.040]   a fast enough connection.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.720]   All we have is USB and Firewire.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.840]   And so a slightly faster Mini that
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.240]   can be doing a lot of the processing and so on and so forth,
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.160]   I think, would be very, very, very useful.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.720]   So I'm really hoping that we see a Thunderbolt.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.240]   We're actually-- I'm actually, in some cases,
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.760]   more excited about the Mini than I am about the Mac Pro's.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.680]   We've got a couple of Mac Pros.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.760]   We've got a lot of Minis.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.080]   The question is, would they actually
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.480]   do three announcements like that at the same time?
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.040]   I think it will because they don't think they care.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.080]   I don't think they'll be announcements.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.960]   I don't think they'll have any fanfare.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.460]   Yeah.
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.760]   Well, no, I don't even mean announcements,
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.920]   but I'm saying I think that they would
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.480]   want to get the attention for the revamped MacBook
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.400]   Airs because there are going to be a lot of people.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.480]   There are far more people who are going
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.040]   to be in the market for one of those than on a revamped Mini
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.880]   or a revamped Pro.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.720]   Both of those are the milkmen's son
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.760]   that we don't talk about because it's on the price list.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.720]   Apple's happy to sell them.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.640]   Apple's happy to tell you how many they're selling.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.960]   But it's never the sort of thing that gets front and center
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.080]   attention anywhere in the store.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.640]   I'm also trying to figure out if it's
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.160]   going to be this week or next week.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.640]   Don McAllister made a really good point last week
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.680]   about how they have an analyst call coming up Apple
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.040]   on the 19th.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.800]   And it often makes sense for them to not make--
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.680]   not actually release these things until after that call
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.440]   because it's one of the four times a year
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.520]   when you can-- a room full of analysts and reporters
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.480]   and people who can affect the stock price
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.600]   can ask a direct question of a senior Apple official.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.200]   And demand an instant response.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.400]   So--
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.920]   Also, Lion.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.920]   And I'm starting to see now from people like-- well,
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.240]   Gizmodo wrote an article, OS 10 Lion.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.280]   This is not the future we were hoping for.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.240]   Starting to see a little negativity about Lion,
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.960]   saying it's somewhat like Snow Leopard, just kind
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.400]   of an incremental addition.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.120]   I don't know if you could make a big new splashy operating
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.360]   system nowadays anyway.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.080]   I think Apple was clear a couple of versions ago
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.720]   that they were going to slow down the number of innovations
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.160]   that they're doing and work on stability
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.040]   and simplifying the process.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.080]   This really is like the International Space Station,
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.800]   where it's a brand new thing they start building with 10.0.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.440]   At some point, you have to say that it's complete
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.720]   and that now you're just sort of fine-tuning and polishing
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.520]   and adapting it to modern needs and that you're not ready yet
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.240]   to take this whole thing that you spent 10 years building
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.960]   and scrap it and then totally redo it.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:44.760]   I can't talk about Lion just yet, but I'm not sure
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.600]   that it would be appropriate to even say that people would
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.080]   even want a 10.7 that is so radically different from 10.6
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.200]   that you're going to have to throw away all your training
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.040]   and start a little bit.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.000]   So it's more than 10.7, but less than 11.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.600]   Is it going to go?
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.440]   Oh, there goes Andy.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.400]   Wow.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.440]   Maybe Apple heard him talking about it a long time.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.800]   He's like, he said Lion, and we haven't released it yet
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.640]   to get rid of him.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.320]   It was pretty clear.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.640]   I'll say this while Andy's not on,
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.480]   then Andy is obviously looking at Lion.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.560]   Yeah, and his NDA done what he wanted to look at it.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.560]   I mean, I like to do he has to have a developer license.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:16.920]   Right.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.240]   In fact, I intentionally have not done that
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.760]   just so that I can talk about it.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.520]   Right.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.960]   But obviously, there's some advantage,
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.040]   especially if you're in the print media
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.120]   to having a little bit more advanced notice than that.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:26.640]   Right.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.760]   We have no lead time here at the--
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.560]   Elluigan.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.440]   The Golden Twit.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.520]   Yeah, hi.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.280]   We welcome back.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.760]   Sorry, we lost you there.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.280]   I think that I still think that Apple's focus
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.280]   is not on Lion or Leopard or any of the truck software.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.240]   I mean, I think that they want to keep on progressing it,
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.920]   keep on tightening the bolts.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.680]   But I'd be really surprised to see anything happen radical
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.320]   in that space ever.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:51.920]   Here's what--
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.320]   I don't know about ever.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.520]   I think the signature thing about 10.7
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.160]   is not going to be the features that you get with 10.7,
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.200]   but the features that you get with the third party software
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.640]   that ships and takes advantage of all this cool stuff
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.960]   is built into 10.7.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.240]   So it's a hardware plus play.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.480]   So what will be--
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.200]   is it thunderbolt?
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.000]   What is the new hardware that's going to--
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.080]   what about the air is going to take advantage of Lion?
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.360]   Is it the cloud?
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.720]   I think that you said that--
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.600]   You actually wrote a great article.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.440]   I'll give you credit for this, saying that now that Lion's
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.760]   at or coming out and a new air is coming out,
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:33.240]   we're seeing really that the MacBook Air--
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.560]   what did you call it?
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.280]   I called it the iCloud book.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.280]   The iCloud book.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:42.040]   It's the Google Chrome book that Apple should have shipped.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.000]   I mean, if you filter the idea of a machine that's
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.520]   optimized to work with a cloud through Apple's
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.360]   sensibility instead of Google's, I really
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.240]   think that the $64 gig, $999 MacBook Air is what you get.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.520]   I think that Apple is genetically speaking.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.520]   They can't ship a notebook that costs less than $999.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.480]   So the idea of a $500 Apple notebook
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.800]   is just not going to happen in this reality.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.240]   But it really makes a lot more sense to me
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.280]   with iCloud in the picture than it did when I was just looking
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.840]   at the 64 gig machine.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.080]   64 gigs is just not a lot of storage to do anything really
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.800]   productive with.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.000]   You truly have to pick and choose and redefine this
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.160]   than not as a real notebook but as an accessory.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.400]   And when you drop this into a brand new world in which
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.600]   you can just simply tag all kinds of things on your desktop,
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.160]   on your office machine, on your real MacBook,
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.480]   if you happen to have one of those as well, simply saying
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.520]   that these are projects and files that are so important
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.200]   that I really do want them everywhere.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.120]   And now you have this MacBook Air that
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.160]   has a small amount of storage, but it's only
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.880]   going to be receiving stuff that's really important to you
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.720]   anyway.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.720]   I was actually doing some of the math and working out
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.600]   that if I were to take all my applications with me
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.480]   on a 64 gig partition, I remember that because iCloud is
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.560]   not going to be hosting your apps.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.280]   You still have to be running local apps.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.840]   If I took my entire application folder, if I took all the music
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.840]   that I-- all the music and videos I normally carry on my iPhone
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.960]   all the time without having to rely on iCloud syncing,
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.240]   my usual photo library and all the documents
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.520]   that I would ever have to work with that will fit very nicely
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.840]   into 64 gigs with 10 gigs to spare.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.200]   But it would only be really practical if I had the ability
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.760]   to use that machine as an adjunct to my desktop.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.240]   And so on that basis, whereas I was able to tell myself
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.360]   that, well, Andy, you've got an iPad,
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.200]   and you really like that Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:36.920]   You're using with it.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.640]   And you don't need a second one almost exactly like that.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.720]   But with iCloud in the picture, now I'm thinking that, yeah,
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.680]   but October, you're going to be traveling like 38 days
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.320]   out of the month.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.600]   And it'd be nice to just have that little receptacle
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.360]   for all of your documents and be able to take them with you
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.080]   without having to really actually sync everything back and forth.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.480]   It's really a tempting machine.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.800]   With iCloud in the picture.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.280]   Well, it's been a tempting machine for me all along.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.680]   I love my--
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.800]   I really like it.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.360]   I don't even know if I need--
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.600]   the backlit keyboard.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.680]   But see, I'm using Dropbox.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.880]   Actually, you know what?
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.760]   I didn't even know this.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.160]   And don't yell at me for this.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:19.000]   But Microsoft's Windows Live Mesh works great on the Macintosh.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.440]   And it's five gigs.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.080]   So if you were looking at-- it's pretty much the same as Dropbox.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.360]   So if you were looking at a way to do Dropbox
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.760]   like syncing on a Macintosh, I could pull it up here
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.480]   if you want to take a look at it.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.800]   This actually works pretty well with cross-platform.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.880]   This would be good for somebody who's using Windows or Mac.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.440]   Point being, we already do have these kinds of cloud services
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.120]   available, right?
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.600]   Yeah, you can already pick and choose.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.280]   Nothing's going to be as instinctive as iCloud.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.560]   Or transparent, I guess.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.520]   Well, instinctive, inherent, sophisticated,
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.320]   is iCloud.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:01.360]   Dropbox works great, but it's still just a remote volume,
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.120]   which is the same stuff we've had since no VEL like 25 years ago.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.640]   I think iCloud is really--
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.360]   it really is the beans because I just--
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.880]   at some point in the life of this document,
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.200]   I've said that this is important to me
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.320]   that I want to use it everywhere on every device that I have.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.760]   And as soon as I've done that, as soon as I've
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.760]   clicked that checkbox, as soon as I've
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.680]   activated that menu item, I never
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.400]   have to think about where this document is ever again,
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.920]   because I know that it'll be on every device that matters to me.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:28.840]   So that's what bothers me.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.120]   I just want that to work, because I have to admit, I have--
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.280]   I look at Sync.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.800]   I realize I had to speak next week in New York.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.680]   Dropbox works.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.120]   You trust Dropbox, don't you?
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.920]   No, I don't use Dropbox.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.640]   See, I think that the problem I have with iCloud--
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.360]   and correct me if I'm wrong--
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.320]   when I have a 64 gigabyte machine like that MacBook Air,
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.000]   I don't really want everything to sync.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   That's my problem.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   That's my problem.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:52.560]   That's what Dropbox does.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.520]   And as far as I can tell, that is not what iCloud does.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.080]   That's the transparency is you just get what you get.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:58.920]   No, no.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.440]   I can choose--
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.920]   Well, the way that iCloud works inherently
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.720]   is not that you have a big volume of storage that's
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.520]   shared between multiple machines.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.760]   It's that if you select a specific document
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.760]   and say that this is what, again, according to the public demos
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.280]   that have been offered so far, if there's
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.440]   a piece of media or a document that you want to have access
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.480]   to everywhere within that app that you manage it with,
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.640]   within your desktop, within your MacBook,
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.920]   you simply say, please share this on iCloud.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.440]   And now--
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.160]   So as granular as document by document?
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:31.660]   Exactly.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.680]   You're simply saying, this is important to me.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.360]   Please sync this across all my devices.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.960]   So it's not as though you have to have this one folder.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.920]   I think that that's actually an improvement on Dropbox,
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.880]   where with Dropbox, there's a way to say
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.240]   that I want you to sync this subfolder, but not the rest of it.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.120]   My Dropbox folder is--
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.520]   I like it enough that I actually have the 50 gig upgrade on it.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.800]   And I'm not sure that I would want to necessarily have
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.040]   an old 10 or 15 or 20 gigabytes of stuff on my MacBook Air.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.600]   I wouldn't have room for it anyway.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.280]   But that's why--
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.280]   But that's why you go folder by folder.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.640]   I guess I have to occupy my documents better.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.040]   Is it default?
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.840]   I know, Andy, that you are not speaking from your own experience,
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.080]   but from published reports.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.680]   Is it the default that every document does sync
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.880]   or do you have to remember to check that box?
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.400]   Based on public statements and things
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.840]   that developers have been showing on their blogs,
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.120]   it's the sort of thing where it'll
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.960]   be supported on an app by app basis, where if--
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.040]   So you get to choose in the app.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.360]   You will have control.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.280]   It's not as though you'll be surprised three months later
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.960]   to realize that you put all your honeymoon pictures up
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.800]   on iCloud or that.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.680]   The thing that the report that you edited
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.840]   that you really never wanted your boss to see
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   is actually in a shared folder somewhere.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.280]   So yeah, I guess Jerry's out until we try it.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.280]   But we should be soon, which we hope will be Thursday.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.080]   Now, Jesus Diaz writing in Gizmodo--
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.480]   and admittedly, this is a little bit of link bait--
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.680]   called OS 10 Lion, the Windows Vista of Apple.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.040]   He says, I don't need Lion, and you probably don't need it
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.640]   either.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.160]   I think that the--
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.360]   By the way, that's exactly what it said about Snow Leopard.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:10.880]   Yeah, it is.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.320]   And I was right.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.600]   Except now you're starting to need it.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.800]   Now we're starting to see apps more and more apps that really
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.160]   say you got to run a Snow Leopard.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.440]   Well, I think that the other issue is
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.040]   that Apple has made it very inexpensive to move forward.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:22.840]   It's $30.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.120]   It's not $129.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:24.840]   I think that's--
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.360]   $300.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:25.880]   It's $30.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.040]   It's easy to upgrade.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.720]   And kind of an unlimited license, too,
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.240]   because you buy it on the app store.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.200]   And you just kind of put it wherever they're going to put it.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.880]   And so it's really-- it's almost free to upgrade.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.320]   The other side of that also is that Apple and other developers
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.080]   will continue to develop for that platform.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.240]   And you'll feel this pool that, oh, I can't run that.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.080]   Or I can't do this.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.760]   And they're much more likely to do that,
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.120]   because they know that it's cheap.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.880]   They know that it's easy for everybody to upgrade.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.960]   They can do it on the app store.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.520]   They can put it on all their machines.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.520]   And so why bother have backwards compatibility?
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.880]   We're seeing a lot more of that in the professional apps.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.960]   We're starting to get this thing that when line comes out
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.800]   within a month or two, we're not going to support Leopard.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.320]   You know, like--
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.600]   That'll happen, of course.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.480]   And they're going to-- and so that's, I think,
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.880]   is part of what's going to push people,
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.840]   whether they need it or not.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.640]   Right.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.140]   Yeah.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.300]   I agree completely.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.560]   My take on it is just that it is so cheap.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.300]   And there are so many-- if you think about it
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.860]   in terms of utilities that you will get for free with it,
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.580]   little enhancements that you would probably pay $5, $10
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:25.500]   a shot for.
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.860]   There are probably six or seven of them
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.780]   that are just worth getting just for those little enhancements.
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.780]   And then you just know that the next time
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.980]   that you will see a really cool app that will require you
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.300]   to run 10.7, you will have 10.7 up and ready to go.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.940]   If you don't-- if you're running a 10.5
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.740]   and you're facing a double upgrade,
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.820]   that's kind of more interesting because not only
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.980]   is it more expensive, but it's also more trouble.
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.780]   And also, if you've gotten by this long without upgrading
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.780]   10.5, you're probably not going to be convinced that anything
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.220]   new is going to be worth whatever you could go through
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.020]   in order to upgrade it.
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.060]   Well, I have a 10.5 machine sitting right next to me.
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.980]   And we didn't upgrade because there was an incompatibility
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.620]   with the driver that we need and use, our audio driver.
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.540]   And now I think now it works, but I didn't bother.
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.700]   And I didn't feel any urge to.
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.900]   For one thing, it has Rosetta.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.620]   And I have a Rosetta application.
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.900]   However, my question is still unanswered, I think.
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.180]   Can I take the DMG file out of Lion
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.700]   and upgrade this 10.5 machine?
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.420]   I know I can't get it on the store
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.820]   because I don't have the store on 10.5, but can I do that?
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.060]   I think that you can--
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.340]   I think there's a way to back end in--
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.500]   You can open package contents and extract it.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.340]   There's a DMG file which is the full install.
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.900]   I could put that on a USB key.
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:35.900]   You should do it.
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.900]   I can insert that USB key.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:43.020]   And then I can do it.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.260]   And I don't know if I can do it.
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.060]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.820]   But I think that's the thing.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.900]   I think it's a very important thing.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.660]   But I think that's the thing.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.220]   And I think it's a very important thing.
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.700]   And I think that's the thing.
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.780]   And I think that's the thing I want to do.
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.700]   And I think that's the thing that I want to do.
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.060]   And I think that's the thing that I want to do.
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.540]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.540]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.540]   I'm not going to do it.

[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:10.540]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.540]   I'm not going to do it.

[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.540]   There's additional steps, by the way.
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.540]   I'll point you to this.
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:51.540]   Can you then run it against Leopard or even Tiger and Korea?
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.540]   I bet you can.
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:55.540]   Well, you could update it or you could just do a clean install, which is...
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:57.540]   Well, you can always do a clean install, right?
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.540]   Well, that's what I'm...
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.980]   I guess my suggestion, if you're going to move, especially if you're going to move all the
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.540]   way from 10 to 5, is not to update.
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.540]   You know, this is going to be the time you make an excellent point.
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.540]   You do not want to try to update that.
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.540]   That's going to be ugly.
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.540]   So the thing is, is that clear out your...
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.540]   Wipe your...
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:18.540]   Collect everything, organize everything, use this as an opportunity to do a little spring cleaning
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.540]   and install something nice and clean.
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.540]   You'll find that your computer, it'll be the fastest way to upgrade your computer is to
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.540]   put a nice clean new system on it.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:29.540]   Because most of our systems get really junked up.
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.540]   It's really a good...
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:31.540]   I am...
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.540]   I second the motion.
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:39.900]   Oh, and somebody in the chat room is pointing out that the hardware that shipped with Tiger
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:44.540]   was not Core 2, so Core 2 Duo, so it wouldn't be compatible anyway.
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.540]   So the best you could do is upgrade Leopard.
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:47.540]   Is that right?
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.540]   All right.
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.540]   Anyway, that's what they're a vurring.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.540]   That's what he's a vurring in the chat room.
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.540]   Blake and Tash.
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.540]   His name ends in Tash, he must know what he's talking about.
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:57.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:00.540]   If your name ends in Tash, I'm going to...
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:01.540]   Peter Tash...
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.540]   Peter Tash...
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:06.540]   I'm going to say people, good Reggae man, excellent, excellent IT guy.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.540]   Oh man, he's the guy.
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.540]   Very, very focused.
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.540]   Yeah, he's the go-to guy.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.540]   Him and Nati IT man.
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.540]   Anyway, I got this iMac.
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:19.540]   I probably will do exactly what you said, which is why I've had to install Lion on that.
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.540]   I do that with every upgrade.
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.540]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.540]   Weird thing happened to me, I got the new 27-inch iMac, by the way, sweet.
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.540]   And I have the 256 gig SSD drive.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.540]   Oh.
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:29.540]   Is it a snappy?
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:30.540]   Yes.
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:31.540]   Snappy is a good word.
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.540]   It is very, very nice.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.540]   You can go see it, it's in the new studio.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.540]   It's going to be my go-to computer in my new office.
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.540]   Yes.
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:45.540]   But now maybe I accidentally dragged the utility folder to the trash, but I don't see a utility folder in the app folder, which is, you know, a little disconcerting.
[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.540]   So I guess I'll be doing a clean install on that one as well.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.540]   That's always that.
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:57.540]   You know what I did was that I made the data drive be the spinning drive, as one would expect, and the 256 gig is the apps and OS X.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.540]   So it's going to be trivial, I don't have to, I'm not even touching the app.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:06.540]   I mean, the data partition, because it's a separate drive, so a clean install would be a fairly simple thing for me to do.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.540]   Right.
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:17.540]   Let us move along in just a bit new pricing from Netflix and a few people not too happy, but right now I'd like to talk a little bit about somebody I love, and that's the good folks.
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:18.540]   Hello, Gene.
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.540]   At Smile Software.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.540]   We love Smile Software.
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:26.540]   And let me see, they wanted me to talk about, oh, tech expanders today.
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.540]   You know, they have great programs.
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.540]   I don't know.
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:37.540]   I just realized when you said that, I was like, this little computer, one of the things that's been driving me crazy is that I have tech expander on my other machine, and I haven't installed it.
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.540]   And I was wondering, I was like, is this on the tech expander?
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:48.540]   Well, I didn't install it on this machine, and it's making me crazy because it's like when someone asks what's your mailing address, I have like, you know, mail ad, and boom, it's there.
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:55.540]   You know, like, I don't have to, you know, so there's all these little shortcuts that I have built in for all those things that people ask for all the time.
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.540]   And I, boom.
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:06.540]   I like the little bubble sound, although I have to turn it off on these machines because when I first, when I was first doing this, and I had audio coming from my Macs, people would say, what is that?
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:12.540]   Roop sound, because you hear it like five times on a show, because I text expander, I use it all the time for my email.
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:20.540]   I just type a couple of letters and boom, it fills in my shipping address or my contact information, or even a whole email saying, sorry, I can't answer your question, that kind of thing.
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.540]   I mean, it's just fantastic.
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.540]   Now, here's one of the things I really like about text expander.
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.540]   It supports Dropbox.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:37.540]   So, this is the new text expander that is one of the main reasons, one of the main reasons to go to Snow Leopard is this new text expander is just fantastic.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:41.540]   And if I go to the preferences, I haven't set it up on this machine intentionally.
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.540]   I'll click Synchronize Message Dropbox.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:51.540]   Now, I'm going to link to Dropbox and all my snippets come in off Dropbox.
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:56.540]   So now, all of a sudden, let me just reopen text expanders so you can see it.
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:02.540]   All of my snippets, all of my expansion, by the way, there's the bubble sound.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.540]   Love that bubble sound.
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.540]   You have other choices, but I just like the...
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:11.540]   All of my snippets from text expander are automatically synchronized.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.540]   So, I have a whole bunch of them.
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.540]   This is the tidbits auto-correct.
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.540]   By the way, that was not there.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.540]   You remember, I deleted all the snippets.
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.540]   These are all coming from my Dropbox.
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:21.540]   Accented words.
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:26.540]   So, next time I type Angstrom, it'll actually have the right little oom-lout and whatever the hell it is on the A.
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.540]   You can never find those on the keyboard.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:29.540]   They're there.
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:30.540]   Doppelganger.
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.540]   I've got all these great symbols.
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:33.540]   It's so easy.
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:37.540]   You just type, if I type /equals, I get a does not equal.
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:44.540]   If I type +- I get +- if I type H-H-E-A-R-T, I get a little heart.
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.540]   If I type A-A-P-L-E, I get a little apple.
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.540]   All my email boilerplate is in here.
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:53.540]   And this is the ones that we're just kind of floating along for the ride.
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.540]   I mean, text expander is fantastic.
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.540]   Whoops, I just disabled it.
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.540]   There are so many letters that are kind of like form letters that you just kind of...
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.540]   All the time.
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:06.540]   I have like NFR requests or test requests or whatever.
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:11.540]   And I sit there and I have like, for different shows and different whatever, you just type
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.540]   it in and boom, it's all there.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.540]   And then I just fill in the little...
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.540]   This is fun too.
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:15.540]   This is fun too.
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.540]   Now, I don't use this machine for typing because it's too far away.
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.540]   Keyboard's like a cross for me.
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:25.540]   But there have been 19 snippets expanded, saving me 418 characters and .02 hours at 80 words per minute.
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:29.540]   So you actually, if you've been using it for a while, like in my main machine, you know,
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:33.540]   thousands and thousands of characters, many hours saved.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.540]   So you need text expander.
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:39.540]   Let's face it, a Mac without text expanders like a day without sunshine, a kiss without
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.540]   a mustache, a fish without a bicycle.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:45.540]   You need text expander and I want you to try it absolutely free for 30 days.
[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:50.540]   Go to smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.540]   I think text expander has been a Mac break.
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:57.540]   Are you doing the same thing I'm doing with your like re-perposing apps on the Mac app store?
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.540]   I did.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.540]   I just realized I bought it.
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.540]   I was like, "I'm just going to buy it again until I have it on the Mac app store."
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.540]   So it's registered and everything.
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:09.540]   So, you know, if you downloaded it from smile software and now you want it on your app store,
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.540]   you can just buy it there too.
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:12.540]   Buy it twice.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.540]   It's not expensive.
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.540]   But you can get it free right now for 30 days.
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.540]   Text expander 3.
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.540]   It's got form snippets.
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:19.540]   So you can now do variables.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.540]   Did you know that?
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.540]   Have you not done that?
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:22.540]   I haven't done that.
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.540]   That's a new feature and I haven't really done it.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:27.540]   But you can say here's a form and now here's the, you know, here's the, here's the, here's the
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:32.540]   boilerplate and now here's the three things that you want to add to that to customize it.
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.540]   You didn't know about that.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.540]   I know.
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.540]   I know.
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:37.540]   I love it.
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:38.540]   And I love the Dropbox support.
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:39.540]   Man.
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:40.540]   $35.
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:41.540]   That's the regular price.
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:42.540]   Try it free right now.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:51.540]   Smile software.com/MacbreakandDon McAllister did a great screencast on this, which is on
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:52.540]   the Smile software page.
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.540]   And there, Merlin Mann on his blog on Confield Grip.
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:00.540]   He's the guy who really taught me everything I know about Text Expander.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.540]   He's got a new one on this new feature.
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.540]   Everything about doing something really, really fast.
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:05.540]   What about Merlin?
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:06.540]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.540]   No, it's, it's, you know, if you're still doing email and I think there's a move a foot to
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.540]   eliminate email entirely, which I'm about to adopt.
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.540]   We're, we've moved like a huge amount, how away from email?
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.540]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.540]   Like where all of our company stuff now is not an email.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:22.540]   But there's, anytime you use a computer, there's stuff that you type again and again and again.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:24.540]   It's so great.
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.540]   Didn't you love how I populated all the snippets?
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:26.540]   I love that Dropbox.
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:27.540]   I just love that.
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:28.540]   Smile software.com/Macbreak.
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:30.540]   Wish I could do that with a lower thirds.
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:35.540]   It would save me a huge amount of time.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:39.540]   No, I worry about how dynamic those would be.
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:43.540]   I'd be talking about, but the thing you have really have to understand about Apple is
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:47.540]   that they have a personality online that'd be suddenly a super say, hold on.
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.540]   He'll be wanting to sub soon.
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.540]   If he, if not, don't worry people.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.540]   I'll, I'll cut him off.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.540]   I'm giving you another 10 seconds.
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.540]   Slash A-I-R slash Anionco Red.
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.540]   So this is interesting.
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.540]   Something else in Lion that might solve my problem.
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:08.540]   You tell me Alex Lindsey, built into Lion the X-SAN file system allowing any Mac with appropriate
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:11.540]   connectivity to access an X-SAN volume.
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:16.540]   Is this why it's not in Final Cut Pro 10?
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:22.540]   Because if I'm running Lion, but an X-SAN is Apple's proprietary hardware, which they don't
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:23.540]   know.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:27.540]   Yeah, I don't know if that's going to be the solution yet until it comes out and we test
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.540]   it.
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.540]   Because it says, I mean, I have to use an X-SAN to make that work.
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.540]   I don't know until I test it.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.540]   Somebody else said that there's a workaround.
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:39.540]   If you create a sparse image on the SAN, the SAN folks for those who don't know, and I
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:43.540]   didn't know until recently, is a high-end storage area network.
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:47.820]   It's like a throw-boer array array that has very high availability fiber connections to
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:48.820]   these machines.
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.540]   Looks local on each machine.
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:55.540]   What we do right now, I'm recording to the SAN from a Final Cut Pro instance down here
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:56.540]   in the studio.
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.540]   As soon as I press stop, that recording is available upstairs to the editors.
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.540]   I don't have to move files around over the network or anything.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.540]   It's just there.
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.540]   And it's fast enough that they can edit.
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:05.540]   I can record at the same time.
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.540]   And we can have multiple editors working off the SAN.
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:10.540]   It was $20,000, which I'm also told is cheap.
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.540]   Yeah.
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.540]   Like that cheap SAN.
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:15.540]   We had one in the office for a test and it was awesome.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:19.540]   I mean, it was like, we were just, we were like, oh my, you know, we felt like we were really
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.540]   like, we're like, we're like, oh, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.540]   like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.540]   like $65,000.
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.540]   And I was like, here, here you go.
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.540]   It's right there.
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:28.540]   You can put it in this box.
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:31.420]   I think it's the single most expensive piece of equipment in the studio, but it saved us
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:32.420]   so much time.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.420]   You really need it.
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.580]   And if Final Cut Pro doesn't support it, that's going to be a problem.
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:39.260]   Anyway, apparently the work around, I'm not sure I would adopt this, is to create a sparse
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:45.100]   disk image on the SAN, which you mount on the Mac and then you can edit.
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:52.420]   I think I'm of the thought is to move slowly into Final Cut X and allow Apple to make some
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:56.620]   upgrades and make some adjustments before you start doing too many heavy workarounds.
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:01.180]   If it doesn't have what you need, don't try to bend your entire SAN system so that you
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:02.540]   can make Final Cut X work.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.020]   I think that you're fishing for charcoal.
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.020]   You're fishing for charcoal.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.020]   Yeah.
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:08.020]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:09.020]   How about this virtualization?
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.740]   Arnold Kim writing on, I love Arnold.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:14.500]   He's brilliant at MacRumors.com.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:19.740]   Apple is going to allow in lion multiple virtual copies of OS 10 on the same machine.
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.260]   That's a huge deal for so many people.
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.660]   Why would you do that, Andy?
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:30.340]   Well, that's a huge admin thing where the people who have to support multiple, multiple
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.340]   configurations.
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:37.180]   If you're administrating a couple hundred Macs and you've got some people who are outfitted
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:42.460]   just for really heavy production, some people who are outfitted with a different version
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:47.060]   of the OS because they're using older hardware and you need to make sure that you basically
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.220]   have all these configurations set up and running and double checked.
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:55.180]   You can have multiple Macs essentially on one Mac Pro and always be tapping between
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.180]   one or the other.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:00.500]   The other cool thing is that it does mean that there are some people whose operating
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:05.820]   system is a virtualization environment where they don't even really think of having a
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.980]   main OS and an alternative OS is that run under virtualization.
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:16.340]   So the ability to have multiple instances of the Mac OS on the same box at the same time
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:21.220]   without having to result to any skullduggery is a big, big win for a lot of people.
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:25.020]   So now, Andy, they're both running both the operating systems are running at the same
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.020]   time, right?
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.820]   So this is like virtual.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.820]   This is like VMware.
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.820]   Well, you actually apparently, according to this post, according to Arnold Kim, you need
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.980]   VMware or or fusion.
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.900]   You need fusion or Pia parallels or you need a virtualization software in addition.
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:38.900]   This doesn't provide that.
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:42.500]   But it provides you because we have there's a bunch of things that we do like, for instance,
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.540]   VPN, we do all of our key servers for the pixel for when we provide people software.
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.260]   Our members have all access to lots of software.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.700]   And to control all of those, a lot of times we're using the PC side of things because we
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:58.060]   want to run multiple instances of Windows, you know, because we haven't been able to
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.900]   instance the OS 10.
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:00.900]   So right.
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.300]   So it looks like that'll be a I can see why that solution will be important.
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.300]   Okay.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:07.180]   This is something that you could do on server until now, but you couldn't do on the client.
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.940]   And now I guess they're role there.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.740]   Are they getting rid of server edition?
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.980]   It sounds like lion is both server and maybe that's what's going on.
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.020]   It's just kind of using it on the thing.
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.020]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.020]   Yeah.
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.020]   Okay.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.540]   Netflix kind of pissing people off here.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.860]   Making adjustments, making adjustments.
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:30.780]   You got to, you know, I have to say, and I'm not, I'm not sure why this happens, but every
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:36.300]   night around five o'clock, my Comcast cable really slows down in my mind.
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.820]   And it stays slow till 10 p.m.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.540]   And I'm thinking it's Netflix.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.420]   It's they're all they're doing what I'm doing.
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.420]   They're all watching Netflix.
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.420]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.420]   No, I've noticed it.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:46.420]   430.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:47.820]   So it's not yes, right around 430 just dies.
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:51.140]   Everyone gets home starts all the kids start watching Comcast has to put some more bandwidth
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.140]   on there.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.540]   We're probably saw in the same head.
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.060]   I don't think Comcast needs to put in do anything.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:58.460]   I think that Sonic needs to bring that gigabit that they're that they have up.
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:37:59.460]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.460]   I might switch to Sonic.
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.340]   I am so ready for that gigabit.
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.860]   You got to wonder with more, you know, what is it?
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.620]   40% now of prime time traffic is Netflix.
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.620]   Yeah.
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.460]   You got to wonder how long before this just, I mean, it's good.
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.740]   It's actually bringing infrastructure to its knees.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:13.740]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:17.060]   That's what that was the thing that really struck out at me about the about these changes
[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:21.780]   that they're making with the reason why so many people are upset is that right now if
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:25.780]   you want to get DVDs by men, but you also want streaming, essentially, you're buying
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:30.620]   this, the streaming for $7.99 and you get the DVD service for two bucks more.
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.660]   Now they're splitting that up saying that you want to get DVDs.
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.020]   That's seven, that's seven and a half bucks.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.260]   If you want streaming, that's also seven and a half bucks.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:40.380]   So basically you go to 16 bucks for streaming plus.
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.380]   Right.
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.500]   So, so now that's a technically that's an increase for the same amount of money, but
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:49.340]   the significant thing I think of an announcement is that not only are they breaking those out
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:53.660]   into two distinct and equal products, but also they're putting the DVD business under
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:54.660]   one management team.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.260]   They're putting the streaming business under, under their own management team.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:02.700]   Do you know what they call the management team for the for the DVD business?
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:03.700]   The legacy.
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.700]   They call it the pasture.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.980]   So, I mean, I think this is it's become really clear.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:13.060]   If you are like, if you are a streaming Netflix viewer, no change.
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.180]   If you're just paying the $7.99, no change.
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.180]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:18.860]   It's just that if you're both streaming and DVD as I am, you're.
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.900]   Well, the funny thing is I get a DVD.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.980]   I get a DVD and I send it back every once in a while.
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:23.980]   Oh, yeah, I got to put that DVD back.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.700]   And then another one shows up and I'm like, okay.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.940]   It's going to save me money because that's going to push me into canceling the DVD, which
[00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.500]   I should have done long ago as you should have.
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.500]   Yeah.
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.500]   Right?
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.780]   I had three DVDs sent to me in four years.
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:36.780]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.340]   So I think what Netflix is.
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.300]   I don't think this is a price increase.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:41.700]   I think this is a pivot.
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:42.700]   Right.
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.900]   Netflix saying we are streaming.
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:44.900]   Right.
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.780]   Well, I think it's that it's more convenient to have two distinct branches of the same
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.100]   company.
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:53.140]   For what it means that it gives them some agility and how they're going to run each
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:57.860]   part of the business because it's clear that these two businesses are on divergent paths.
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.540]   They're not, but branches of the exact same service.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:04.500]   It also makes me think, getting back to the point about how much traffic every night of
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:09.180]   the prime time programming is being served by Netflix, it makes me want to look into what's
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:14.660]   sort of government oversight and regulation they'd have to follow if they decided that
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:18.940]   they're going to define themselves as a broadcast network as opposed to simply a guy who does
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:24.340]   a company that delivers DVDs digitally via IP.
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:29.700]   Would it be not possible for them to do make a whole bunch of booms they want to make over
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:34.140]   the next couple of years if they're also in the physical DVD business.
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:41.460]   They're the major brick wall that I often run into when I look at stuff like this is
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.340]   I don't know anything about how corporate law works.
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:49.140]   It's always fascinating to me when I talk to an attorney who works in this business and
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.940]   they can tell you no, the reason why that they pulled out of this market specifically
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:57.620]   is because believe it or not, there is a regulation that says that if your company is in the food
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:01.500]   business in any way, shape or form, you cannot operate in this state and still get this tax
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.500]   statement.
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.260]   So if you simply take this part of the business, this part of the online store that has food
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:11.100]   stuffs and make it their own brand, all you have to do is incorporate it that way and suddenly
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.620]   you can say $1.8 million per quarter.
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.220]   So you think if they're only doing streaming, they don't have, there's no, they don't have
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:20.020]   to worry about state taxes, but if they're sending physical discs, they might something
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.940]   like that along those lines.
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:22.940]   Something like that.
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:28.100]   I wouldn't be surprised if there isn't some sort of advantage to just simply structuring
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:32.020]   the company that way where you have two separate divisions that are in two separate business.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.460]   One is digital and one is DVD delivery.
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.660]   One of the things is to get those DVDs to you quickly.
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.740]   They need to have fulfillment centers all over in every state.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.900]   And so now they're a taxable entity in every state.
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:46.420]   If they are an internet company, they only have to pay the taxes in the states that they
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.460]   have a physical location.
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:54.020]   And so, so the issue is that that could save them tens of millions of dollars.
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.660]   But I think the other thing is that I think this is going to be a, there's two things
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.380]   that I think we should applaud this for.
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.460]   One is, it's funny because you're the only one applauding.
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:04.180]   I got to say there's such pain.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.180]   And I agree with you.
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:09.340]   I think it's just reshaping of the business that the movie industry is pushing them into
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.340]   this.
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:11.340]   I think it would be a good experience.
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:12.340]   Oh, they prefer streaming.
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.900]   Oh, not Netflix streaming.
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:19.060]   Well, what the, no, but what it's doing is it's reflecting what the movie industry's
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:23.140]   interests are, which is there's the Blu-ray camp and there's a streaming camp.
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:26.540]   And I think, you know, you don't see a lot of these new, very few new releases go right
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.540]   into streaming.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.540]   They're, they're a Blu-ray.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.580]   What the movie company would like to do is get you both times.
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:32.780]   Well, but the thing is, is here's what's going to happen here.
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:37.060]   By separating these out, people are going to start choosing between plastic and online
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.060]   streaming.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.060]   And they're going to stop.
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:42.100]   I haven't had a DVD player working in my house for two or three years.
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.180]   Again, you're an outlier.
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:47.620]   I know, but, but, but I think a lot of people are just getting their first Blu-ray player.
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:50.860]   My parents got, I don't, but which by the way comes with Netflix.
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:51.860]   Yeah.
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:52.860]   Yeah.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:57.540]   What would they, the, my parents got Netflix and the, and immediately they're bought, you
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.820]   know, they're, they're downloading stuff and they're not buying as they're not getting
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:01.820]   as many DVDs.
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:05.180]   The thing is, is this is by making you choose, you're no longer going to have a play.
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.180]   Well, they don't make you choose.
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.180]   You can do both.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.180]   I know, but, but a lot of people are going to go, well, if I have to choose, you're no
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:09.180]   longer going to have a play.
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.180]   Well, if I have to choose between them, I'm just going to do the online because that's
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.660]   a little more convenient.
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.900]   And then what happens is they stop using their DVD player.
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.860]   They stop having it in the living room.
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.420]   And then that kills off and the Hollywood business.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:21.420]   I don't think so.
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.140]   I think there's plenty of people who say, I want the extras.
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:25.540]   I want the, because you don't get DVD extras on streaming.
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:28.460]   I want the high quality Blu-ray because you don't get 1080p.
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:32.140]   Well, they mean to make better extras maybe, but I, I don't think they think they're making
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.220]   bad extras.
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:36.140]   You think they are the only reason I buy a DVD.
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:37.140]   You're an outlier.
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.740]   You're not like a normal person.
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:40.740]   You understand that.
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:45.420]   Also, also realize that you can't take Netflix streaming with you in the car when you're
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:49.380]   driving the kids, hit her in yawn over the next couple of weeks to all the errands that
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:50.380]   you go on.
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.260]   So there's always going to be a room for DVD.
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.460]   I suspect what happened, and I could tell you right now in the Netflix headquarters,
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.460]   they're all going like this.
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:58.900]   Okay, we're going to, it's going to be a storm.
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:02.180]   There's going to be some poo-poo coming from the sky for the next six weeks.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.300]   Just batten down the hatches.
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:08.180]   Hold on, because six weeks from now when that storm is over, and by the way, we're seeing
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.180]   the storm.
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.180]   People are furious.
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.740]   It's going to actually work out great for everybody involved.
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.940]   Those people who just want streaming will just get streaming.
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.020]   Those people who love the Blu-ray will get the Blu-ray.
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.700]   There are a few people who want both.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:23.620]   Look, $16 a month is still less than you probably paid for VHS rental.
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.220]   Just a, I mean, my late fees alone were twice that.
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:31.540]   When I, when I, you know, when I'm using Netflix, the thing that I want is actually for them
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:35.300]   to move all of the prices up a little bit so they could pay Hollywood more so I get
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:36.500]   more movies that I want.
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:39.500]   I don't think, it's not about, I don't think it's about money for Hollywood.
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.620]   It is because they're making nothing on, Hollywood's making nothing on the streaming.
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:46.540]   But Hollywood is working, is working, I think more strategically than that.
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:49.780]   I think that they, if they want to put Netflix out of business, that's, you know, they, they
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.820]   really putting pressure on DVD.
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.340]   They hold back a movie for 30 days from Netflix.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.180]   They totally control Netflix.
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.980]   Netflix operates at Hollywood's Mercy, I believe right now.
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:05.020]   Yeah, but you know, Hollywood is a, is a frog sitting in water that's getting slow.
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:06.020]   I understand.
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.180]   You know, they're, you know, they're, they're, and so I think they're, they're, they're,
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.180]   they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're.
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.180]   Right now they have the upper hand with Netflix.
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.740]   They control absolutely.
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:15.740]   That's why there's only crap on, not crap, but there's less first run stuff on streaming.
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:20.300]   That's why they say to Netflix, yeah, we'll give you the movie 30 days after it's on DVD
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.300]   in the stores.
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.300]   They totally control that.
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:24.500]   What is Netflix leverage with Hollywood?
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:28.700]   Well, Netflix, Wellbridge is 40% of the, of the bandwidth in the evening.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.780]   I mean, it's, it's the fact that I, well, that's why.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.140]   Hollywood's playing it both ways.
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:35.260]   They're encouraging the streaming because in the long run, they prefer streaming because
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:36.860]   there's no piracy issue.
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:37.860]   It's lower quality.
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.860]   So maybe they still sell the blue rays.
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:41.860]   I think it's good for all that.
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:46.660]   But it's sort of like the gazelle.com for old movies and TV shows.
[00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.420]   They have, they have this old content that they own outright.
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:52.780]   That's generating no, that's generating no revenue for them whatsoever.
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:57.380]   The fact that Netflix will put them on means that suddenly cold episodes of Colombo and,
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:01.260]   and Murder She Wrote and Rockford Files and Rockwell.
[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:02.260]   Star Trek.
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:06.220]   Star Trek's a bad example because it was already valuable, but Rockford Files is just
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:07.220]   doing nothing.
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:08.220]   Well, I agree.
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:10.860]   I think it's incremental income for them.
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:13.660]   It's free money is how I heard one put on an exact describe it to me.
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:14.660]   I think one of them.
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:17.260]   In other words, the movie industry is getting exactly what they want.
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:21.540]   The one issue that the movie industry I think is, is some people will talk about when you're
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:25.060]   in Hollywood is the lack of constraint on supply.
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:31.020]   And so like for instance, next generation came out on the first, July 1st.
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:33.060]   Star Trek Next Generation is released.
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:38.380]   I now don't really need to get something new for months.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:42.740]   I mean, I'm going to go through, I'm going to watch Next Generation from the first episode
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:47.260]   to the last episode slowly over the next couple months because I just want to, there's so
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:51.180]   many that I just kind of want to go back and watch all in one continuous thing rather than
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.940]   the mess that I watched them in the first round.
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:59.660]   And the thing is, is that by having this, even if they're not all first run, by having this
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:04.180]   huge collection that I have access to, I'm less likely to go out and buy DVDs.
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.620]   I'm less likely to go to the movies.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:09.180]   I'm less likely to do all of those things that Hollywood would like me to do on a day
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:11.580]   to day basis because I can kind of fill up my time.
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:13.940]   It gets into that whole great versus good enough.
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:14.940]   Yeah.
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:21.020]   The danger of Netflix to the industry is that it truly convinces everybody that a lot of
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:25.620]   the consumer patterns that they've been in for the past 10 or 20 years just don't make
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.060]   any sense of them anymore.
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:31.860]   That it's no longer really important that they get to buy a deep, they get to the avatar
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:37.260]   as soon as it's released on home video because it'll come, you know, it'll come around eventually.
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:41.380]   And there's probably about nine other movies that are just as entertaining release.
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.420]   Same down the sofa with a couple of friends you just want to watch something.
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:47.180]   You don't necessarily know it's going to storm up because, oh, he told me we get to
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.180]   see avatar.
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.180]   He gets to avatar now.
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:54.180]   And we're leaving, but you'll probably find maybe even episode of the Rockford files.
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:55.180]   What is it?
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.300]   Or you'll be able to fix our movie.
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:58.300]   You'll be able to see the conversation.
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.020]   You'll be able to see Secretariat.
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:03.380]   There's also which we didn't mention that there's income to them from cable on demand
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:06.140]   too by making it available to cable on demand.
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:07.260]   First, you know, look at it.
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:08.260]   This is what the movie company wants to do.
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:09.340]   Milk it, right?
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:14.620]   So first, first run DVD, Blu-ray, stores only, then cable, then maybe sometimes day
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.580]   and date cable if they pay enough money.
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:18.500]   Otherwise it goes to on demand.
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:21.900]   Then later Netflix and then later Netflix streaming.
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:25.620]   And possibly if they do it right, they can get you four times.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:28.660]   You know, I mean, I think that they're making a ton of money on cable on demand.
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:30.140]   They're not going to dump that yet.
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.740]   Well, I think you talked to a lot of executives though.
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:35.220]   And to them, it's pennies on the dollar compared to what they were making when people were
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.660]   buying, building up big DVD collections.
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:40.860]   Well, that's my other point everything else is that people are complaining that 16 bucks
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:45.060]   a month is still a lot cheaper than anything you've been doing up to now.
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.060]   Right.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:48.260]   I mean, let's, I mean, that's what's going to happen is people can go, oh, well, wait
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:49.260]   a minute.
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.260]   Yeah, at 16 bucks a month.
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.060]   But and if you want a great service, the thing to do right now is not to leave Netflix
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.140]   because they moved, they changed the price by $7.
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:59.820]   It's to not buy anything other than watching on Netflix and keep on pushing the economic
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:03.380]   pressure on the economic pressure on like, this is what we want to, you're much better
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:08.860]   off paying 20 bucks a month and not doing any olekart than you are.
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:10.340]   But but that takes the users.
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:14.780]   And that's part of the reason that I'd very rarely buy anything online from, from on demand
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:20.300]   or Apple TV or whatever is that I want, I don't want that model to be successful.
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:26.940]   Also because it because you start to question your traditional buying patterns.
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:33.020]   I come to realize how rarely I truly need to own a piece of media.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:38.900]   If if something's available for rental for $4.99, I can buy it on Blu-ray for 22.
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.620]   I'll rent it once.
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:43.060]   If I want to see it again, I'll rent it a second time.
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:48.060]   If I rented a third time and then that's pretty much does me for the rest of the year, I'm
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.620]   still $8 or $9 a head.
[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:55.700]   I bought the John Adams mini series from HBO only because it was 50 hours of content that
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.380]   I could then rip and put on my iPad.
[00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:01.580]   And I think that was the first DVD I've bought in about a year.
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:05.700]   Well, and I have to admit that I I've been winding through like for instance, I've been
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:10.300]   going through Dexter from the beginning to end and and they took it off.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:14.540]   The first two seasons were on Netflix and then and then they took it off in Netflix.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:17.820]   And then this is exactly what Hollywood wants is that that was the one where I was I was
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:18.820]   already in the middle of it.
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:19.900]   The hook was set.
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:28.980]   And so I now I've been buying them on iTunes in HD, but but the the that happens is what
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:31.540]   happens is it depends on the content.
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:34.620]   So some content you want Blu-ray, some content streaming is fine.
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:37.260]   I mean, just depends some content you see in the theater, right?
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:38.260]   Yeah.
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:41.180]   So it really depends on what I mean, I want to see Harry Potter in the theater because
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:44.140]   it's going to be a big screen thing.
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.220]   I may buy the blue raised down the down the road.
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:50.260]   I mean, I think this is not I think this is I do not feel like I do not like feeling
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:51.260]   like I'm being manipulated.
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:52.260]   You are with the transformer.
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:53.260]   With the news.
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:54.980]   I know I used to be the manipulator.
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:55.980]   So I understand.
[00:50:55.980 --> 00:51:00.500]   I mean, I was like, you know, there was there was a seasonal seasonal recurrence and, you
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:04.700]   know, burn rotations and hot rotations and I mean, that was all of us hooking you and
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:07.540]   okay, we're gonna we're got the Pesh mode coming up right after the commercial break.
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:09.780]   And I mean, you know, we I know what that is.
[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:13.660]   It's just welcome to the, you know, welcome to the music industry or my welcome to industry.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:14.660]   Welcome to business.
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:15.660]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.660]   It's business 1.0.
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:17.660]   Yeah.
[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:21.660]   We all have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize value to the shareholders.
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:25.300]   If I had shareholders, I'd be maximizing their value too.
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:26.300]   Exactly.
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:27.300]   I don't like to be maximized.
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:31.980]   You know, the good news is I'm too stupid to really make the connection between making
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:33.700]   money and what I do.
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:35.060]   So I have no idea.
[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:36.060]   Right.
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:39.940]   So it's just like, yeah, well, as long as I get a parry check, I guess I'm all right.
[00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:40.940]   Exactly.
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.540]   I'm doing things that are from a business point of view.
[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:43.540]   Not me.
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:44.540]   Not, not.
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:45.780]   But in the long sense, I mean, I do the same thing.
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:46.780]   I mean, I'm completely passionate.
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:48.460]   We're in it for the, you know, we're in it for the fun.
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:49.980]   We're in it for the most of our podcast.
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:52.740]   Most of my, your podcast, most of my podcast don't make any money.
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:54.900]   You know, it's just we do them because we like to do the, you know, it's like, you
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.540]   think I look at a podcast and say, Oh, I'm going to do that one because I can make money
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:58.540]   and oh, I don't want to do that one.
[00:51:58.540 --> 00:51:59.540]   I can't make any money.
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:13.540]   There's no measurement.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:16.540]   There's us going.
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:21.540]   And maybe some rumors about the new iPhones, which I keep floating and everybody keeps shooting
[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:22.540]   down.
[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:23.540]   I don't know.
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:24.540]   I'll keep doing it.
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.540]   I have a sound effect for the, for the online folks.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.540]   They have to guess.
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.540]   Okay.
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:29.540]   Oh, wow.
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:32.220]   Oh, just from just keep listening.
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:34.380]   And in a moment, we'll explain what.
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.380]   Oh, wow.
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:36.380]   He is.
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:37.940]   That's the, that's the phrase that pays.
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.940]   Listen to the next 10 minutes.
[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:40.940]   Oh, wow.
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:44.940]   Next time you see the K Twitch party, what does that front?
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:45.940]   If you're listening.
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:46.940]   Wow.
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:47.940]   All right.
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:48.940]   Keep listening.
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:49.940]   I don't know.
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:50.940]   Meanwhile, a word from Carbone.
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.700]   I, we were talking about the cloud.
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:57.300]   There is a cloud service out there that really is a useful tool for anybody on a Mac or Windows
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:58.660]   for that matter.
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:03.220]   Backs you up, keeps your data safe, makes it available online whenever you want it.
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:04.220]   Does versioning.
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:09.500]   Actually, I think the, maybe the Windows version does versioning, but not the Mac version yet.
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:10.500]   Just a lot of great features.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:11.500]   I can't remember.
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.500]   There's also a new carbonite for business.
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.500]   I just tell you, these guys are hitting it out of the park.
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.340]   They really know what they're doing.
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:21.140]   When it comes to backup, it's just the way to go.
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:22.140]   It's automatic.
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:23.140]   So you don't have to think about it.
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:24.140]   Very important.
[00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:25.140]   It's off site.
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.260]   So even if the worst happens, you've never lost any data.
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:31.860]   And your data is always accessible from any computer, just log into your carbonite account,
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:36.660]   or your smartphone, Apple, Android, even Blackberry.
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.500]   You get your files back in just a few clicks.
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:42.780]   And because they're encrypted on the way up, you're always private and you can add additional
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:47.900]   encryption pre as Steve gives and calls it pre-internet encryption to make sure that only
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:49.180]   you can see your data.
[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:52.540]   And all that for just $59 a year, unlimited.
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:56.580]   That means all the data on your internal hard drive, unlimited amount, even if you have
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.940]   one of them big two terabyte babies.
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:00.780]   I got a big hard run.
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:02.620]   Although you know, it does.
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:04.740]   And he cannot lie.
[00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:08.500]   I have to say, yes, I have to say there are people I get emails from sometimes saying,
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.900]   you know, I'm backing up three terabytes on carbonite.
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:12.060]   It's just taking the longest time.
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:13.060]   Well, what do you think?
[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:14.340]   You're using your internet access.
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:17.020]   You might want to think about how much data you're putting up there, put the stuff that
[00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.740]   you really need to get.
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:23.020]   It is online after all, and carbonite's very gentle with your both your connection and
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:24.340]   your CPU.
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:26.140]   You don't want to know that it's doing its stuff.
[00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:27.140]   It's doing it in the background.
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:28.900]   It won't hog your internet connection.
[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:30.940]   So you know, that's why they give you two weeks for you.
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:31.940]   Try it.
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:33.180]   See how it goes for you.
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:36.820]   Go to carbonite.com, use the offer code MAC break.
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:37.820]   No credit card or anything.
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:42.300]   You just try it for two weeks and see how it works for you.
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.420]   Usually, for most people, that two weeks is enough to back up your entire data set.
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:51.220]   And now from now on, it's easy to stay updated if you decide to buy $59 and we'll give you
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:56.020]   14 months with a price of 12 when you mention carbonite.com.
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:55:00.940]   14 months with a price of 12, two free months when you mention MAC break.
[00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:03.100]   That is carbonite.com.
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:06.780]   Offer code MAC break.
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:08.340]   It's a real lifesaver on laptops.
[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:12.500]   I know, as soon as a laptop goes into production for me, it's got carbonite on it.
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:14.500]   Really is the way to do.
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.500]   iOS 5.
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:24.140]   A couple of things about iOS, first of all, according to ReadWriteWeb, iOS owners buy 61%
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:25.780]   more applications.
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:26.780]   Is that a surprise?
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:28.860]   It's been that way on the MAC too.
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:30.860]   MAC users buy more apps.
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:34.620]   That's why it's good to develop for the MAC.
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:36.140]   The average of consumers.
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:40.740]   They're well, you know, you could say some might say, well, they paid more for the Apple
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:41.740]   in the first place.
[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:45.900]   They're maybe more willing to spend money on quality.
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:48.500]   They have more money to spend.
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:51.980]   The average price for iOS applications is now $1.44.
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:55.420]   That's up, 14% year over year.
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:58.980]   Consumers are buying 61% more apps this year than they did last year.
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:02.300]   This is from Piper Jaffrey.
[00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:07.860]   Today's iOS device owners will download on average 83 applications in a year up from
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:08.860]   51 and 20.
[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:09.860]   That's a lot of applications.
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:10.860]   83 apps.
[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:11.860]   How many apps are on your iPhone?
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:12.860]   You don't want to know.
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:13.860]   I don't know how many are on my iPhone.
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:19.180]   You know, you can go to the settings and usage and it'll tell you how many apps.
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:20.500]   Let me see the chat room.
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.940]   Check how many apps are you running on your iPhone?
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:25.300]   I bet our audience is far more than 83.
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.300]   Where is it?
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.300]   Is it under general?
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.300]   Yeah, general usage.
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:32.260]   It'll tell you how much storage you're using, how many apps you've got on there, all that
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.260]   stuff.
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:34.260]   Let's see.
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:35.260]   I don't see usage.
[00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:36.260]   183, 168.
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:39.060]   This is the chat room.
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:40.060]   Where is that?
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:42.060]   158, greater than 300, 206.
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:45.740]   I believe you want in about not usage.
[00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:46.740]   I'm sorry about.
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:47.740]   Thank you.
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:48.740]   And 232.
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:52.460]   232 for Andrew and not co.
[00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:54.660]   437 from web 1261.
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:58.060]   267 from iPad, Matt.
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:56:59.060]   237.
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:04.580]   237 for mr. 483 on his iPod touch.
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:07.580]   945 on X942's iPad.
[00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:10.380]   Oh, I missed read.
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:12.980]   I left out the leading two, 2,232.
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:16.180]   I don't know if there's a limit.
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:19.980]   Since we're just throwing out numbers here without any proof.
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:21.380]   I believe these people.
[00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:22.380]   Okay.
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:24.220]   You think they're inflating their numbers?
[00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:28.380]   Well, now they are 9.1, 5 billion.
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:31.220]   Okay, enough.
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:34.940]   Scoble did this once and he said that the average user is somewhere around 100, which
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:36.860]   I think is accurate.
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:39.340]   But the geek, it's often double that.
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.340]   And we've proven that here today.
[00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:43.540]   I really wish that actually I actually double check.
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:48.220]   I really wish that iTunes could track number of launches the way that it can also track
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:52.940]   number of plays because that would really help me to organize the apps that I actually
[00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:53.940]   use all the time.
[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:58.340]   I can name probably the top eight apps off top my head.
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:02.220]   But there are others that just don't ever bubble to the surface until I'm in that one
[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:06.020]   instance of which this thing is the only thing that I'll actually do the job for me.
[00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:07.020]   Number of apps.
[00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:12.740]   Well, I thought Apple had half a million, but according to this article in ReadWriteWeb,
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:15.980]   it's 425,000.
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:19.580]   Maybe the 500,000 was total and 425,000 active apps.
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:21.340]   I'm not sure the difference.
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:22.740]   Android just 200,000 apps.
[00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:27.580]   You know, I think anything over maybe 150,000 apps is probably sufficient.
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:32.860]   I just, you know, I find myself changing the way what I look for in an application.
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:34.700]   It's so hard because it's a needle in a ace deck.
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:37.500]   But with the new Mac App Store and with iOS and everything else, I've noticed that I
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:40.420]   used to want an application that did everything I needed to do.
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.900]   And now I want every application to do just the thing.
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:44.380]   I think that's the correct answer.
[00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:46.860]   It was a developer showing me one of their apps and I was like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:48.020]   you're doing too many different things here.
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:53.020]   I only want, I want a $6 wrap that does exactly what I'm asking for and integrates well with
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:54.020]   other apps."
[00:58:54.020 --> 00:59:00.100]   But it's almost the old, remember the old conversation about what was it, Doc?
[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:01.860]   This was in the nine, like, "Rhapsody."
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:02.860]   What?
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:03.860]   Dashboard?
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:07.580]   When they were talking about Rhapsody a long, long time ago, you know, in the '90s when
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:11.660]   they were talking about OpenDoc, you know, where you would have lots of little applications
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:14.260]   that integrated with each other and it's not quite the same.
[00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:17.140]   But I have this, you know, I want each application.
[00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:19.140]   I absolutely agree.
[00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:26.460]   I've been looking at photo apps for an upcoming column and there are some really nice camera
[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:29.380]   apps that have like 800 functions to them.
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:30.380]   Yeah, too much.
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:33.740]   They're simple and they're straightforward and they're useful, but you know what?
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:39.700]   When I'm in a mode where I really need that feature where the shutter doesn't trip until
[00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:43.460]   the thing is steady, I don't think I'm going to launch this one app or then access this
[00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:44.700]   one feature within that app.
[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:47.780]   I think I'm going to launch that app that works that way.
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:51.020]   And I've got a single all-in-one app.
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:55.700]   I really want five separate apps that just focus on making panorama.
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:58.220]   Panorama is just focused on low-life photography.
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.340]   One that just focuses on the, "Yes, I know that.
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:04.780]   That app will spend $8 million developing a really cool camera, really accurate camera
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:05.780]   in a package."
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:07.820]   But here's how to make your photos look like crap.
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:10.020]   Somebody says, "I want those, I want those to start with things."
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:13.820]   Somebody just said, "Could you end soon so we can get lion?"
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:15.940]   I don't think it'll be right after we end.
[01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:17.740]   Maybe it'll be a couple of days after we end.
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:18.740]   Here's the important point.
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:23.140]   I think we'll, well, chat room, how much is it worth to do you?
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:25.540]   I can pull this show right now.
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:26.540]   Yes.
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.540]   Your donations here.
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:28.540]   Have you again.
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:32.740]   On the plus side, it's not like we're going to be killing hostages until we get what we
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:33.740]   want.
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:34.740]   We're just going to delay these things.
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.540]   How much do you want lion?
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:37.540]   We could get hostages.
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:40.140]   I'm not saying we couldn't get them.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:43.420]   We just choose not to.
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:45.500]   So that was their URL that's--
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:51.580]   Speaking of hostages, this is actually the seminal point Chris Whitmore, Deutsche Bank
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:01:00.260]   makes with the average of $100 content on every Apple mobile device.
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:05.380]   He says, "It's increasingly difficult for users to justify the switch from iOS to a competing
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:06.380]   platform.
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:07.380]   You've got an investment now."
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.460]   I've got a lot more than $100 invested.
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:15.580]   I realize I went through the thing and started doing a calculation and realized that I had
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:21.140]   spent about $1,500 on applications on my iPhone and iPad.
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:24.780]   That means that I'd feel like I'd have to replace all of them because a lot of them
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:25.780]   were dead ends.
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.380]   But that makes it sticky.
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:29.340]   It makes it really sticky.
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.340]   It is really hard.
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:34.580]   I think that that's different because people are buying a lot more apps on the iOS than
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:35.580]   on Android.
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:39.340]   Android has a much larger free market, which they're trying to move.
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:42.500]   I think there seems to be some kind of cultural thing there.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.180]   Getting stuff for free on Android.
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:48.540]   E-cardoshinsky in our chatroom says, "I've never did the math on how much I've spent
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:52.420]   until now, and now I'm depressed."
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:53.420]   It does.
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.420]   It ties you right in.
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:56.420]   You might not want to do the math if you're thinking about a different...
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:00.420]   There's just a lot of apps I use on a daily basis that I just don't know if I don't want
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.420]   to find another one.
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:02.420]   I think that's the issue.
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.540]   I have to say increasingly.
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:09.500]   I say that as a dual platform user, everything you could do on one, you could do on the other.
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:10.500]   It is.
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.500]   I just have to buy it again.
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:14.100]   That's the problem is that once you start to choose it, I know that I could do it on
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.100]   Android.
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:17.540]   I'm buying an Android as soon as the Galaxy 2S comes out.
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:24.700]   I'm getting an Android phone, but I'm not going to feel the need to replace everything
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.380]   on my iPhone, on my Android.
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:29.100]   I'm just going to get some new apps that I like on the Android.
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:32.500]   The good news is that most Android apps are free.
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.980]   Android does not have the ecosystem.
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:35.220]   They're often ad-supported.
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.220]   For instance, Scrabble.
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:38.940]   EA just puts Scrabble out on Android.
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:39.940]   What does it cost?
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:40.940]   $5 on iOS.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.440]   It's not cheap.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:43.940]   Free on Android, but you get ads.
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:44.940]   I'll be honest.
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:47.340]   I'd rather pay $5 on not have an ad.
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:50.980]   On a mobile device, the ad takes away too much space.
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.380]   iOS 5 rumors.
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:54.380]   What is the...
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:56.180]   I went by in the chatroom.
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:59.300]   Bluetooth support in iOS 5.
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:00.300]   Support for what?
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:01.300]   Bluetooth tethering?
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.300]   I don't know.
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:07.420]   I don't have to do a search now because it went by and I didn't copy it.
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:11.740]   Chatroom, what was the story on that one?
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:14.780]   Apple TV will get Bluetooth with iOS 5.
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:20.820]   The code pulled from the latest iOS 5 beta shows that Apple TV, which will presumably
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:30.100]   be an iOS 5 device, will support Bluetooth keyboards and the mice.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:34.100]   And soon after that, it will support the full iOS.
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:35.420]   And that is a killer.
[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:38.820]   I've been saying that since day one, I want apps on my...
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:44.300]   By the way, by the way, that puts all sorts of additional HBO Go and all sorts of things
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.300]   on there.
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:48.980]   You connect that with the iCloud and now you're talking about every person that's a
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:49.980]   $99 computer.
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:50.980]   Wow.
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:54.020]   You know that has access to all of your documents, all of your...
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:59.500]   You have a magic pad where you can move things around, you have your wireless keyboard, and
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:03.180]   you have a $99 computer that you can access all that basic stuff.
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:08.180]   And I know a lot of people who are like my parents and who don't really need a computer
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:10.100]   beyond what they could do on an iOS.
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.380]   Is it as Dave McD says in our chatroom, "The Return of Web TV?"
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.380]   Is it maybe two complex?
[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:16.380]   Do we...
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:17.380]   I don't think so.
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:22.140]   Apple, if you look at the times when they've built a device that we have a template for,
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.820]   they never do it the linear way.
[01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:25.780]   They never do the idea of, "Well, they got Apple TV.
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:27.540]   If you had a keyboard, I'm obviously got a computer.
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:31.620]   Now you'll have a computer with a word processor and a web browser off your TV."
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:35.500]   They usually twist it in such a way that it makes sense within the larger ecosystem
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:36.500]   that they've built.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:42.140]   So I could definitely see iCloud syncing where you could display a keynote document.
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:45.700]   You could display and do quick edits to something.
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:50.260]   I could certainly see Bluetooth support for keyboards so that you could actually do searches
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:55.540]   for things inside Netflix and other apps without having to go.
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:05:01.900]   I don't see the Apple TV turning into something that we would recognize as a computer.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:02.900]   Oh, no, no, I don't think so.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.660]   I think it'll be much more simple.
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:07.060]   But the point is, I think a lot of people, that's all they need.
[01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:08.380]   I don't think that they need to have...
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:09.780]   I don't think they need this air.
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:10.780]   A lot of people.
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.660]   I thought that the Magic Trackpad was designed for Apple TV.
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:17.620]   I thought that that was kind of like, "I'm going to have that on my coffee table and then
[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:19.780]   I can pinch and zoom and do all this stuff."
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:20.780]   That's really what I thought.
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:21.780]   Well, because iOS doesn't...
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:23.020]   It has an on-screen keyboard.
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.020]   It doesn't really need...
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:27.860]   The other thing is I can imagine in a business having an Apple TV with iCloud, you could
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:31.460]   have an Apple TV connected to your presentation box or whatever.
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:35.300]   And people could be uploading their presentations or whatever they want to show at an event
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:39.780]   or whatever and simply just have access to those all running really quickly and easily
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:40.740]   across the phone.
[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:44.620]   Netflix was killing the neighborhood bandwidth coming this fall.
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:51.140]   Apparently iTunes, according to a rumor, will offer 1080p movies that you can stream and
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:52.140]   download.
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:57.340]   1920 by 1080, average bit rate encoding of 10 megabits.
[01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:58.340]   Nice.
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:05:59.340]   Yeah.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:00.340]   That's good quality.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:03.340]   It's about a little less than half of what Blu-ray is.
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:04.340]   Not what Blu-ray is.
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:05.340]   Okay.
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:06.340]   So it'll be...
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:07.340]   It'll be more macro blocks, but it'll still be great.
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:09.940]   It'll look nice and sharp.
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:13.300]   Are people really going to be able to tell the difference between 1080p and 720p?
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.380]   Only if you understand the word macro blocks.
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:16.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:17.620]   No, if you...
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:19.860]   I am quite happy actually watching 720p.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:27.140]   I have a 50-inch in my lab and I have...
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:29.180]   And I'm quite happy watching 720p.
[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:33.300]   In fact, I'll be honest with you, the scaling software is so good that I really...
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:34.740]   It doesn't even bother me to watch standard death.
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:35.740]   I hate to say that.
[01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:39.540]   But obviously it looks great when I can watch full res, but there's stuff on Netflix that
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:40.540]   isn't.
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:42.980]   And I play it and I'm like, "Oh, this is fine."
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:44.620]   Yeah, I see.
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:49.740]   There's math that says that for most screens, most people have people's homes, you really
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:54.580]   have to be sitting at a very specific golden triangle to appreciate the difference between
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:56.380]   720p and 1080p.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:57.380]   And I've seen them.
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:00.300]   I talked to people who put this together and I believe what they say.
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.780]   That said, when I came time for me to buy a new TV set and I could just...
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:09.460]   I could either get the 720p version for 300 bucks or the 1080 version for only 50 bucks
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:10.460]   more.
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.460]   Yeah, I think I'll get the 50 to...
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:13.460]   I got 50 bucks.
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:14.460]   I'll get the 1080p version.
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:16.460]   Well, and this is a question in the chat room.
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:17.460]   People believe big numbers.
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:21.620]   Someone's talking about a higher bit rate 720p or a lower bit rate 1080p and I'd rather
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.540]   have the 720p at higher bit.
[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:28.860]   I'd rather have a 10 megabit connection, 10 megabit 720p with less damage done to the
[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:29.860]   user.
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:30.860]   But you're right, that's a perfect...
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:31.860]   And now that's scaled up.
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:32.860]   I'd rather have that than the 1080p.
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:33.860]   Me too.
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:34.860]   I downloaded all my porn at 720p.
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:35.860]   1080p is good market.
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:36.860]   1080p is good market.
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:37.860]   720p, I find it's sufficient.
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:38.860]   Yeah.
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:43.260]   So within, I think it's six or eight feet with a monitor over and I believe it's 60
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:46.100]   inches, you don't need more than 720p.
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.100]   You're not going to see it.
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:50.420]   I think Alex missed what I said.
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:53.940]   UBS analyst, main art home, it's fine.
[01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:55.980]   The chat room, heard it.
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:08:02.100]   UBS analyst, main art home says that Apple, if it does make an internet connected HDTV
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:07.980]   or maybe just the Apple TV connected to your regular TV, could be worth 50 to 100 billion
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.660]   in market cap.
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:14.860]   There already a 328 billion, the second largest US company in market cap, it's worth another
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:20.540]   30% if they can get in this lucrative TV business.
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:22.500]   Mainly because they own the ecosystem, right?
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:23.500]   Oh man, I just...
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.580]   I don't buy it.
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:25.860]   You don't buy it?
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:27.700]   I just don't buy it.
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:31.100]   There's so many different kinds of TVs for so many different needs and there's so many
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:37.940]   people who just are going to look at $300 versus $4.99 or $380 versus $7.99.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:44.740]   I think that Apple simply says we've got this $99 box, you plug it in with one cable
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:49.340]   and you can take what buy whatever TV you want to buy our little box.
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.340]   You don't even have to take a look at it.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:52.980]   I never understood the idea to make a TV.
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:53.980]   Why make a TV?
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:54.980]   Well, they're already making them.
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:55.980]   They're called the monitors.
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:58.740]   I mean, the thing is that there's a lot of companies in this business and look at Pioneer
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:00.740]   couldn't even make a living making TVs.
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:04.500]   Yeah, but I guess the thing is Apple's already making a living making, making TV monitors
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.180]   that are so close to TV.
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:08.860]   I mean, the iMac is I think they're making it.
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:10.660]   I think you think that's a big business for them.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:11.660]   iMacs?
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:12.660]   No iMacs.
[01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:13.660]   Well iMac is.
[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:14.660]   Well iMac is a TV.
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:17.540]   But that's what I'm saying is it's got more horsepower than it needs.
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:20.900]   You give it iOS and make it a little thinner and you already have all the manufacturing.
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:23.140]   Give it my 27 inch iMac was $3,000.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:26.540]   I mean, I can get a beautiful 50 inch TV for half that.
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:29.980]   But with iOS and without all the gear, you could get that down.
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:30.980]   It wouldn't be the same price.
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:32.540]   And I think it'd be a market segment.
[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:34.420]   I don't think it's worth $50 billion.
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:39.780]   I think that the Apple TV going to iOS might be worth, I mean, 30 to 50 billion market
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:40.780]   cap.
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:42.620]   I don't think that the TV itself is.
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:48.340]   But I do think that Apple want to do it because they want to have control of that ecosystem.
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:51.540]   And Andy, you think no way they're doing a TV?
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:53.740]   I'm always prepared to be surprised.
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:10:00.860]   But nothing I've seen Apple do in the past 20 years tells me that they'd be so dumb as
[01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:03.460]   to take this big of a risk.
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:06.380]   They've got the money machine well greased up, well geared.
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:10.140]   They know that they put the few drops of little things in the center of the machine and money
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.060]   comes spilling out this other end.
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:17.340]   And that doesn't come from contaminating their product line with lots of esoteric products
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:21.820]   that you have to have the exact right person coming into the store and order by this.
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:26.620]   And given that there's so much competition and so many companies are going to be able
[01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:32.260]   to sell the $300 TV, the $250 TV, the $219 TV.
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:36.380]   I just don't see them being competitive if they're selling something that's being sold
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:37.580]   as a TV set.
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:38.860]   Okay, but look at this chart.
[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:41.340]   I'm trying to think of where this.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:43.060]   No, they're charts involved.
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:44.980]   Okay, I changed my mind.
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:47.900]   This is actually an interesting chart if we can parse it.
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:51.620]   It's Apple's ecosystem flow chart.
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:53.860]   And this comes from the analysts report.
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:55.620]   This is figure two.
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:11:01.540]   So you've got in green the stuff that Apple's doing now that's strong.
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:06.540]   In yellow, the stuff that Apple's doing that needs improvement, the hash yellow is coming
[01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:07.540]   soon.
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:09.860]   I don't see any of that in orange and red.
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:14.620]   So you see PC tablet smartphone Apple completely dominates TV.
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:17.140]   No, not so much.
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:21.620]   Cloud storage is coming on, but local storage right now content.
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:27.340]   And then looking at the content, music, movies, apps and books, Apple owns email and chat
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:29.460]   Apple owns social networking and office sweet.
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.020]   And that's so strong.
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.300]   I okay, now where's the data coming from?
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:37.700]   Because I got to take issue with books and movies and TV.
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.740]   They could certainly be stronger.
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:45.740]   I mean, they've they got a bookstore, but it's not terribly competitive with the market
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:46.740]   leader.
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:47.820]   Here's what Adam says.
[01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:49.460]   This is main, main or dumb.
[01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:54.140]   We believe Apple will have to build its own content ecosystem out such that a set made
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:57.940]   by Apple could be differentiated enough from content perspective to potentially lead to
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:02.940]   cord cutting.
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:07.940]   However, cord cutting is the key phrase.
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:09.940]   This is where all the value comes from.
[01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:12.940]   We do not believe the market is ready for cord cutting, nor do we believe the content is
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:14.940]   robust or cheap enough.
[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:19.940]   So it doesn't they don't need to be dominant Apple, but they need to have it to the degree
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:22.940]   that people can be willing to say, I'm going to live in the Apple world exclusive.
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:24.940]   There's a lot of people who are happy living in the Apple world.
[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:27.780]   I'll play other connections and just have Apple.
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:34.380]   Well, the thing is, is that if I have, you know, I know I'm not normal, but if I had
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:39.460]   the option to have a nice big TV that had my FaceTime built into it and I had and it
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:43.860]   was syncing with my iCloud and I could check my email or things would pop up and it was
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:47.860]   all integrated to the rest of my life, I'd find that pretty compelling argument.
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:51.820]   You know, I don't know if I would, you know, I don't know if they're going to make a big,
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:54.900]   big TV, but I think that could be a pretty compelling armament for businesses and for
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:55.900]   individuals.
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:59.380]   iOS 5 is now in beta 3.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:06.980]   That's where we're hearing all this new stuff about iOS 5.
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:11.460]   If they're in beta 3, I think we're pretty close to a release candidate, Andy, don't
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:12.460]   you?
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:14.460]   I wouldn't speculate.
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:19.580]   They'd, I mean, they remember that they have said September and for them to advance that
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:22.460]   ship date would be just unprecedented.
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:25.420]   I don't think they would, I don't think they'd have any need to move it up.
[01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:27.340]   Test all you want Apple.
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:31.580]   Also also also from published reports, I think that there are still some features that have
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:35.900]   been talked about, but still haven't really appeared inside the Speedy yet.
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:36.900]   New stuff.
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:45.780]   I'm not sure if anybody's written about their new messaging app appearing in the Speedy
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:46.780]   yet.
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:50.260]   So that's a major, major product with lots of infrastructure behind it.
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:51.460]   That hasn't really turned up yet.
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.460]   That's key, isn't it?
[01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:53.460]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:56.340]   So we're still, we're still kind of in the middle of this process.
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:00.100]   I don't think we'd see it go faster in time before another big release.
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:02.780]   Goalmaster won't run until iMessenger is done.
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:06.180]   Well, I got a contract.
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:07.180]   Excellent.
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:08.180]   Okay.
[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:17.740]   New in iOS 5, beta 3, according to, uh, Engagit, a bevy of toggles controlling location service
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:24.660]   in detail, probably response to privacy complaints, I think, and a new switch for voice roaming
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:27.460]   in settings, voice roaming.
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:31.500]   Well, don't we already have a switch for roaming for voice?
[01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:32.500]   Maybe not.
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:33.500]   Well, there's data.
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:34.500]   Maybe it's data.
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:37.980]   So you can say, I still want my data network, but I don't want to have my voice or dis-
[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:38.980]   or disconnected.
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:41.700]   I guess the presumption's been that you're always going to want to roam the voice.
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:43.420]   Otherwise, it's not a phone.
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:44.420]   Right.
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:46.940]   So most phones don't let you turn off voice roaming.
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.140]   That's using Skype or FaceTime.
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:50.140]   Right.
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:52.500]   Then roam away.
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:55.780]   Are we going to ever see FaceTime in 3G or 4G?
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:56.780]   I think so.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:57.780]   When?
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:58.780]   Next.
[01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:00.980]   I think when they have a new iPhone that's taking advantage of it.
[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:03.300]   Not hyper, iPod touch.
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:04.300]   Mm.
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:05.300]   That was 3G.
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:07.420]   Do you think, guys, we haven't talked about the Facebook announcement because it happened
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.060]   after the show last week.
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:13.980]   Do you think that what Facebook did with Skype kind of jeopardizes FaceTime?
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:18.260]   It certainly is going to have 750 million potential users right off the bat.
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:19.260]   Right.
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:24.900]   It's not because the Facebook video chat still isn't a mobile tool.
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:26.380]   It's a mobile, yeah.
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:29.180]   Remember that FaceTime, you got your phone in front of you.
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:30.380]   You got the kid in front of you.
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:32.780]   Congratulations, grandma and grandpa are looking out.
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:34.420]   I think that's what FaceTime's good for.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:35.420]   I have cute kids.
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:36.780]   But I think that's what Facebook's good for too, by the way.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:39.500]   I think that that's exactly the use scenario for FaceBooks.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:42.620]   I think, automatically, I think it makes a lot of sense for them to do what they're doing.
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:45.980]   I think they had to compete also with Google+, so I think that they have to go down that
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:46.980]   path.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:49.340]   Well, it's funny because I see Google Play.
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:53.180]   I think people often, in my mind, get the wrong target.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:57.780]   It's Google+, to me, doesn't threaten Facebook as much as Twitter.
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:00.860]   And Facebook Skype doesn't go after Google Hangouts.
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:02.020]   They're two different products.
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:05.900]   It goes straight after the FaceTime market because it's for the normal user who just
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:07.180]   wants to see the grandkids.
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:10.260]   That's what Apple's use scenario is and all their ads.
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:14.500]   That's why I think that's why Apple's use scenario is because they're not going to
[01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:15.500]   be doing it.
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:19.700]   I think that's why Apple's use scenario is because they're not going to be doing it.
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:23.980]   I think that's why Apple's use scenario is because they're not going to be doing it.
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:27.980]   I think that's why Apple's use scenario is because they're not going to be doing it.
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:31.420]   I think that's why Apple's use scenario is because they're not going to be doing it.
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:35.420]   I think that's why Apple's use scenario is because they're not going to be doing it.
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:38.420]   I think that's why Apple's use scenario is because they're not going to be doing it.
[01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:42.180]   I think that's why Apple's use scenario is because they're not going to be doing it.
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:46.060]   I think that's why Apple's use scenario is because they're not going to be doing it.
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:50.060]   I think that's why Apple's use scenario is because they're not going to be doing it.
[01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:54.460]   I think that's why Apple's use scenario is because they're not going to be doing it.
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:58.500]   I think that's why Apple's use scenario is because they're not going to be doing it.
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:02.700]   I think that's why Apple's use scenario is because they're not going to be doing it.
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:06.740]   I think that's why Apple's use scenario is because they're not going to be doing it.
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:09.020]   The main thing to it is simpler.
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:12.060]   I think that that is what Apple does really well and that's what nobody else does well.
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:13.060]   I don't know.
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.300]   I have all kinds of stuff on my TV.
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:15.780]   I don't understand how to work it.
[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:17.060]   I don't understand what to do.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:19.380]   I go through it and then I go, "Ah, I don't want to deal with this."
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:27.300]   I think the ubiquity of Facebook and I think the ubiquity of this video of Skype in Facebook
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:29.540]   is a game changer, to be honest.
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:33.300]   I think the real benefit of FaceTime because it's going to get people used to video calling.
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:36.620]   I think one of the reasons FaceTime hasn't taken office because people just haven't
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:40.100]   really gotten used to the idea of making a video call as opposed to an audio call.
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:44.380]   I think also the problem with FaceTime is that it's not ubiquitous.
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:46.940]   Does FaceTime Airplay?
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:49.180]   Can I make a FaceTime call and then put it up on the big screen?
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:52.740]   That would be a good way to do it because then the camera and the mic are near you but
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:54.140]   you could look at the big picture of your face.
[01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:55.900]   The problem is you don't get that face to face.
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:18:01.060]   The distance, if you have a camera right over a monitor and you're far enough away, the
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:02.060]   TV...
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:03.660]   It's like, "Here's the sofa.
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:04.860]   Hi, I'm back here."
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:08.300]   I think it's too much of a lean back experience for video calls.
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:09.900]   I think my problem with it.
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:13.380]   I think that when you're looking at the primary of watching your kids or your grandkids or
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:16.900]   whatever over it, I don't think that they're not really looking at talking to one of the
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:17.900]   life sites too.
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:22.100]   They just want to see a full screen of your grandkids running around.
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:26.580]   I think that there's a real opportunity there.
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.260]   I don't know whether...
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:31.980]   I feel like Skype has been almost permanently borched.
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:34.380]   I mean, it's just like the new version is so bad.
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:35.380]   What?
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:36.900]   That's the beauty of Facebook.
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:37.900]   You don't see any of that.
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:39.380]   You don't see any of the interface stuff.
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:40.380]   It just works.
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:41.380]   Have you used it?
[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:42.380]   I haven't.
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:44.380]   If it doesn't crash on you.
[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:49.380]   Remember the first thing you got to do is download a Java applet and how stable Java
[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:52.660]   is on just by any platform you're going to be using it on.
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:56.940]   Plus it's running inside a browser and how happy browsers are to always remain up and
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:57.940]   running 24/7.
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:59.940]   Have you had a lot of...
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:02.780]   The first thing I did is call Andy, by the way.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:05.260]   And so that was my...
[01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:09.300]   Thank you for helping me write the first paragraph or two of the column because I'm
[01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:15.300]   watching the live stream on Facebook and just not like 20 seconds after Zuckerberg's
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:16.300]   talk.
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:17.300]   But it's so simple.
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:21.140]   Even if you're not configured, you'll just click this one button and then as often...
[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:24.740]   The other part is once it starts, it starts to...
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:25.740]   Great!
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:26.740]   I'll learn about this right now.
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:31.740]   I'll run the camera button and the entire browser just goes...
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:33.740]   No, please don't do that mean thing to be...
[01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:34.740]   Oh!
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:37.540]   I had to do a force quit and redo it.
[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:42.980]   And by the way, Andy is no longer my Facebook friend, I noticed.
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:43.980]   So...
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:44.980]   I don't know, friend.
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:45.980]   You've been surprised.
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:47.980]   Oh, you're not on chat, probably.
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:48.980]   That's all.
[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:49.980]   I'm just not.
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:51.580]   So these are people who are online on chat that I could call right now.
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:56.320]   And if I click a button, Tom's not available, but if I click a button, I can send him a
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.140]   message by clicking this video camera.
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:01.980]   And I think this really shows you what the whole point was.
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:06.780]   I don't think that Facebook particularly cares about competing with FaceTime or killing
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:07.780]   FaceTime.
[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:10.900]   I don't think they're particularly concerned about Google+, I think that they know that
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:13.140]   they have a contained ecosystem.
[01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:17.080]   Their users are very, very happy to get all of their social services through Facebook
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.080]   directly.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:22.940]   And the fact that they have not been able to deliver video chat features to them, that
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:27.600]   was just a gaping hole on the chart they needed to fill in.
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:33.160]   And there's also no accident that in addition to adding the SkyChat feature, they've also
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:36.400]   made chat more prominent and easier to find.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.400]   It's not just...
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.400]   There's no need to hunt for it.
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:43.240]   There is now a big bar to the right-hand side of your window that will instantly show
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:47.360]   you, "Hey, why just simply post something on their wall?
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.360]   You can just simply talk to them right now.
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.360]   I want to talk to them right now."
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.000]   I didn't argue.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.780]   I wasn't arguing that Facebook wanted to kill FaceTime.
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:55.020]   I don't think they're even...
[01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:56.180]   It's not on their radar.
[01:20:56.180 --> 01:21:00.020]   I think what they wanted to do was make Skype so easy to use.
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:01.980]   I mean, it's just such a natural app.
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:05.260]   It's definitely the easiest Skype.
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:11.420]   If ever there was just a really mutually helpful partnership, it's FaceTime plus Sky.
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:13.420]   Plus Microsoft, that might lead to it.
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:14.420]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:17.940]   I do think one of the challenges they're going to get into with doing it inside of a web
[01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:23.040]   browser is exactly what happened to Andy, which is that doing this really media-rich
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:30.280]   stuff inside of a browser is putting a 440 engine into a Dodge Colt.
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:32.360]   The frame isn't really built for it.
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:36.360]   I don't think that as people keep on pressing this, I think we're going to continue to see
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:38.240]   more and more stability issues.
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:42.000]   The reason I don't like doing a lot of heavy media in browsers is because it's less...
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000]   Java, it's less stable.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000]   It makes me crazy.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.840]   I don't have any problems.
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:47.840]   You're right.
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:50.280]   If it crashes a lot, that's going to discourage people.
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:52.780]   I haven't had any issues with it.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:54.140]   We're going to take a break.
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:55.440]   Come back with more.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.680]   Alex Lindsey is here.
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:59.880]   He is, of course, the man at PixelCore, PixelCore.com.
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:03.980]   If you'd like to know more about his guild of multimedia artists who are learning and
[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:07.720]   working together, I met your friend from Kenya the other day.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:08.720]   What was his name?
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:09.720]   Mina.
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:10.720]   Mina.
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:13.400]   One of the first PixelCore members in 2000 or so.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:17.520]   He's just moved here with his wife and he's working in graphic design.
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.520]   I'm so cool.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:23.480]   We're going to have a couple of other African guests coming in for our training in the fall.
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.480]   We're very excited.
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:25.480]   He was really...
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:30.240]   He was great because he was a little shy because he said, "I watch you all the time."
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:33.000]   I was sitting at my new 27-inch iMac in the new studio.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.200]   It was really nice to meet him.
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:35.840]   He's really a nice guy.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:39.400]   He worked for the PixelCore for quite some time as well and then went back to Kenya.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.480]   Now is back in the US.
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.480]   Check it out.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.480]   I'm really excited to have him back.
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:47.240]   PixelCore.com and all those money-losing podcasts at PixelCore.tv.
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:48.240]   That we love to do.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.960]   He doesn't for the love of it.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:50.960]   We do.
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:56.160]   The best thing to do is to follow us on PixelCore or Alex Lindsey because we announce everything
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.160]   there.
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.760]   The irreverent announcements are done by me.
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:01.040]   Well, there's lots of stupid stuff that I put on my feed.
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:02.120]   I'm just warning you ahead of time.
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:03.120]   Don't complain.
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:06.920]   Then just the pure, the next podcasts, next live feeds.
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:08.960]   We're doing live feeds every Thursday at 6.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:12.640]   So you can go to PixelCore.com/live.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:13.640]   We'll always find it there.
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:15.880]   We'll run the announcements on the on the Twitter's.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:18.120]   Alex is in our space.
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.120]   We share this.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.720]   It is such a great space.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:24.200]   The two spaces together I think are very interesting.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.200]   It's interesting.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.960]   There's angles on the same idea.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.680]   Yours is this gorgeous, I just love your studio.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:31.000]   I feel like I'm in a-
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000]   It's a work of art.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000]   I was so pleased by the work that Roger Ambrose did.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000]   It is just fantastic.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   Just design this.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   And the NARS is really industrial.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000]   Yours is to get jobs done.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000]   It's green screen and you have black curtains.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000]   And motion capture.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000]   And it costs you one hundredth of what it costs.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000]   Well, NARS is kind of an open slate too.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000]   So that's, we have to do lots of different things.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   But I wanted some physicality.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000]   It's the clubhouse.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000]   When I look at the best of both worlds that way.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000]   I love that there's both of those in the studio.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000]   We will be opening the studio on July 24th, our first show.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000]   No pressure.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000]   Huge pressure.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   We're not, we're so far off.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000]   We're having a meeting today.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   I might even broadcast it if we're not doing anything else.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000]   We're having a meeting today of all the studio heads.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   Oh, somebody's waving.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   Who's that waving?
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000]   Is that your Chris?
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   Look, over there he's a mystery man waving at us.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000]   That's Kevin.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000]   Oh, Kevin.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000]   Okay.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000]   He came over and waved.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000]   That's the spy cam.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   You can go to bit.ly/twepto.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000]   You need a lot of work to do in the next week.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   Well, we got to get our video set up.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000]   That's going to be replacing Skype for our video calls.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:40.000]   We've got to get the video monitors, which are big monitors on stands that we'll put around
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000]   the table.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   So to look like Andy, it'll be, "Look like you're actually sitting with us."
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000]   It won't be next week, it'll be if all goes well.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000]   It'll be the week after next Andy.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   Instead of being in this Skype of Saurus behind me, you'll have a seat at the table literally.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000]   All right.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   That's the table over here on the left.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000]   As you can see, cameras haven't been put in.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000]   30 cameras.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000]   All the video drops are there.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]   The cameras are there.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.280]   But we have to make manufacture, and even the stands and the holders are there, but we have
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:13.240]   to manufacture a little box to hold the power supply and the black magic converter box.
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:15.400]   Each camera gets one of those.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.000]   So the video has to go in.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.720]   Oh, and sound isn't done.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.120]   But all the lighting's up.
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:21.120]   Brent Baez finished that.
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.680]   The lighting looks awesome.
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:26.000]   And yeah, you don't see it now because it's just got work lights on, but it is gorgeous
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000]   in there.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000]   We did it.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   We did the live feed last week was with Brent talking about lighting.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000]   Is that recorded anyone?
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000]   We had a little recording problem.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   I heard you yelling.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000]   That's the one thing Leo have to get to.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.600]   I'm a little high strung in the opposite, but it was good because it was kind of like
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:42.600]   a sound test.
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:46.600]   So he's over in his area way over there, and I'm sitting in our studio and I can hear you
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:47.600]   loud and clear.
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:50.260]   So I'm thinking maybe we're going to have to put a little something there for those
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:55.000]   times when Alex or I because I'm occasionally raised my voice.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.600]   Yes, it happens.
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:57.600]   Yes.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.480]   Well, a thing like you do that and it doesn't get recorded.
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:00.480]   That's kind of bad.
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.320]   It wasn't recorded on the key pros.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.240]   It was recorded on a backup system.
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:05.640]   That's what we got the backups for.
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:06.640]   It is.
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:11.720]   But anyway, it was an amazing two hours with Brent talking about color theory.
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:12.720]   I do want to see it.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:13.720]   It's awesome.
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:14.720]   It'll be on YouTube this week.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:17.040]   And he's done a fantastic job in this studio.
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.240]   I'm just the only way to go.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:19.560]   Oh, it's amazing.
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:20.560]   Everybody has.
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:24.760]   I mean, it's funny because this is not, if I had six months ago when we started this
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.960]   project, it really realized what we were talking about.
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:29.280]   I would not have done it.
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:31.880]   But everybody has stepped up to do an amazing job.
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:37.080]   John Slanina, Burke McQuinn, Colin Weir, our studio team.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:38.080]   Amazing.
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:39.080]   It is.
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:43.600]   Both studios are coming out much better than we thought.
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:44.600]   Much more expensive.
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:46.640]   But they're really amazing.
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:48.280]   They're amazing studios.
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:53.280]   I think it's unique north of, I mean, I don't even, I don't know.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.280]   I can't think of another place that I've seen like it.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:57.080]   You know, it's really pretty exciting.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.680]   Well, somebody in the chatroom suggested I show this and I should show this.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:02.880]   Tom Merritt made, we're doing now on Twitter a little video.
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:07.160]   Let me see if I can launch this here somehow.
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:11.280]   A little video kind of what's coming up in the week ahead.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:14.000]   And Tom Merritt makes this every time for us.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.560]   And he, this time, did it from the new studio.
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:25.600]   So I think we have, this is probably the first high quality video we've shown out of
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:26.800]   the new TNT set.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.800]   It's not exactly done.
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:28.800]   Hey, thanks Leo.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.800]   Here's a look.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.440]   But there's a little bit of a look at what it's going to look like.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:35.560]   First of all, very high depth, very clear.
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:42.440]   This isn't quite the lighting for TNT set, but it's roughly what TNT set will look like.
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:45.680]   That there's that big X behind him, the brick wall, but there's another bookshelf, the three
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:47.920]   bookshelfs will go and there's a ladder cross it.
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:48.920]   This is his desk.
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:49.920]   I love the look.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:50.920]   I think it's just going to look beautiful.
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:51.920]   Very wobby-sobby.
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:54.920]   Look at that.
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:55.920]   That's just, I think it's just gorgeous.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:58.520]   A little preview.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.520]   We are over budget.
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:01.320]   So where are we?
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:04.160]   We're all over budget.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:06.400]   Yeah, we're all over over budget.
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:07.400]   We're going to have a meeting.
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:12.760]   I hope we can do this studio meeting on the air this afternoon with all the studio department
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:16.080]   heads saying, you know, how far they are off because we've got to get this done.
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:17.400]   We've got less than what do we have?
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.400]   We have 12 days.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:19.400]   No pressure.
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.400]   What?
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:28.800]   Ken Mary-Lee's, our contractor Russell Tammany, our IT guy, Brett By, of course, for lighting,
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.640]   Roger Ambrose, the designer.
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:35.880]   These guys have all done an amazing job on this.
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:37.640]   And there's a few things left.
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:39.080]   We stopped at the Axia audio.
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:43.280]   You know, one of the things we did in here, we took the digital audio out of this room.
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:45.000]   We did a little brain surgery a couple of weeks ago.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.840]   That's why the audio has gone downhill just a tad during our shows because we went back
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:51.840]   to the old school and a long way.
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:53.640]   And you forgot how old school it was.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:54.640]   I forgot how bad it is.
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:58.520]   In fact, it caused me to spend another few thousand dollars to do digital audio in my
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.400]   office as well as throughout the building.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.160]   We're going to have Axia everywhere.
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:05.120]   We had to buy an extra another mixer and more boxes and stuff.
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:07.720]   That's the kind of thing that happens is it gets a little more expensive.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:11.160]   But that was a good learning process.
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:14.800]   You know, we know we've got to do the best possible audio.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:19.520]   So if you would like to support it, we are inviting everybody to be a part of a permanent
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:22.720]   part of the Twit Brickhouse by buying a brick.
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:29.320]   If you go to bricks.twit.tv, you can see, you know, the different bricks are available.
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:34.160]   We've got the four by eight brick size brick with two lines of 15 characters each.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:35.640]   You can get an eight by eight with four lines.
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:38.720]   You can even get an eight by eight with a custom logo.
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:41.280]   And the money goes to say, we're not a nonprofit, understand.
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:42.720]   I'm not going to give you a tax break on this.
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.840]   But the money really does go to help pay for all of this.
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:49.240]   And as these additional costs come in, Lisa keeps saying, don't worry.
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:50.640]   We've got the brick fund.
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:51.640]   Don't worry.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:53.680]   We've got, I don't know how much longer that's going to work.
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:54.680]   Don't worry.
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:55.840]   We've got to build in.
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:59.080]   But we really, the money is going to a very good cause to making Twit better.
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:00.240]   And I want to say one thing.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:04.240]   We're not, I think sometimes you see this and you say, oh, they're trying to get to
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:07.600]   a bigger audience or change the spirit of what we're doing.
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:10.160]   And it's not, it's exactly not what we're doing.
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:16.920]   I really know very clearly that what makes Twit work is very super serving you, the people
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:21.880]   who listen to Mac break weekly, this week in Google, this week in tech, Windows weekly,
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:23.800]   really giving you exactly what you need.
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:27.920]   This new studio will let us do a better job serving you, not reach a broader audience.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.520]   That is not our goal.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:34.400]   So the money you put into this really helps us do a better job for you long term.
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:36.640]   And we're talking for the next decade and more.
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:37.640]   So that's why it's really appreciated.
[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:40.400]   Yeah, you don't build something like this for the next couple of years.
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.400]   Oh, no.
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.800]   I'm never doing this again.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:49.680]   The next studio will be the next guy because I think this is my studio forever now.
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:50.680]   Right.
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:51.680]   Famous last words, right?
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:52.680]   But no, this is it.
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.200]   And the brick wall is going to be fantastic.
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.160]   Right as you walk in, it's right on your left.
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.200]   You don't, you know, you'll be in the, it's the in the entrance lobby.
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:01.800]   So everybody's names or logos will be visible to everybody who comes in.
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:04.840]   And it's just, it's very inspiring to see these incredible messages.
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:06.680]   Everybody's sending to us.
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.200]   So we really thank you for that.
[01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:09.200]   Everybody who's bought a brick.
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:12.680]   And if you haven't still a few days left, but don't delay too much.
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:15.200]   Because at some point we got to put these things up.
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:20.560]   I think the first shipment of bricks is being laser etched right now.
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.560]   That's how they cut them.
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.320]   They do a little laser edging.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.200]   And I think we'll come to us first week of August.
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:26.200]   We want to get them all.
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:29.520]   And by the time we have our party, our grand opening is August 21st.
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:35.960]   So we're hoping, we're hoping, brickness talk with TV is so close.
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:37.960]   Oh my God.
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:43.400]   Oh, Andy, I hope you come out and be part, be part of the, the opening.
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:49.200]   No, no, I'm, I, I'm sending so positive, positive vibes your way.
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:53.240]   This is the, I know how much stress, how much stress that you're under right now.
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:54.240]   It'll be fine.
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:55.720]   It'll be great.
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:57.040]   We all support you.
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:59.760]   We're all going to help you.
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:02.920]   If it's all going to be great.
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:03.920]   And you know what?
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:07.000]   If, if when I visit, I find out that the cook machines like in the break room are 250
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.280]   per can, just offset the, you know, the cost, I will do that too.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:14.880]   No cook machines, free Coke for you, free cane sugar Coke.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:15.880]   Always in stock.
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:17.040]   Oh, in case Andy shows up.
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:18.040]   No, that's the truth.
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.040]   We've got some.
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:20.040]   Chris, you're for PUNYs.
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:23.440]   We have it right here right now, just in case.
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:24.640]   We go over here to pedal in the market.
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:27.240]   They have Mexican Coca-Cola, which is cane sugar.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:32.280]   And that's, and we buy only that because in case, for some reason, Andy just shows up.
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:35.080]   We want to have his, his, his, his desert of choice.
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:38.720]   Have a bottle like set in front of me, like in front of the virtual monitor.
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:41.640]   I will, you know what?
[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:42.640]   I will.
[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:43.640]   It'll be like Elijah.
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:44.640]   Who's that?
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:45.640]   Hold on, say it's like a seder.
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:50.360]   Like we keep this, we keep this screen blank for Elijah Elijah.
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:51.360]   Elijah not go.
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:54.680]   And it's, and then wait for five seconds.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:55.680]   Okay.
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:56.680]   He's a no show again.
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:58.240]   So instead of Andy and he's Ed.
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.240]   Now I can't wait.
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.800]   I don't know how that's going to look.
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:04.760]   We've done some tests and it really is cool because so we're at a round table and we had
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:08.960]   to figure out a way to put Skype in and instead of this kind of way of doing it, we haven't,
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:13.680]   we haven't built it yet, but we will have in the next 12 days built a stand with a big
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:14.680]   monitor.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:18.400]   We decided four by three and not 69 big heads.
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:19.760]   Yeah, basically it's a big head.
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:20.760]   I think you need mannequins.
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:21.760]   I know.
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:24.280]   Well, we have to size it and we may, we may need some help from Andy.
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:25.600]   I think you're actually just about right.
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.600]   We'll have to size it.
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.160]   So your head size is roughly the same size as mine.
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:30.800]   I got the biggest old head.
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:31.800]   I think it'll work.
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:37.600]   I'm going to be like that standard meter made out of like uranium that they keep in London
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.480]   at Greenwich Observatory.
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:41.960]   So I will be the standard like headness.
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:42.960]   Exactly.
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:47.320]   The standard volume based level that will establish this is the head volume.
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:52.200]   We'll in fact have a still picture of you in the freeze frame so that people can say,
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:54.280]   is your head as big as Andy's then you're right?
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:57.760]   Your head must be at least this overflow.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:02.600]   I think we also somebody was saying it will be like Sheldon in Big Bang Theory.
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:04.360]   That's exactly right.
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:06.080]   We want it to be able to roll around.
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.080]   Right.
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:08.080]   So if we...
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:10.080]   I mean, that's not the first time I've been compared to Sheldon in the Big Bang Theory.
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:11.400]   Usually not in a positive way.
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:13.400]   Well, it won't be autonomous.
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:15.920]   It won't be able to...
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:18.360]   But we could take you with us if we decide to go somewhere.
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.840]   I still think they come along Andy and we'll roll you out with us.
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:23.120]   I think proper mannequins though matching each person.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:25.320]   Is you sitting there like this with a little...
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:27.720]   Well, I said I'm not going to build a new set but there is one thing I plan to do.
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:28.720]   In my lifetime.
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:31.040]   And I've already talked to the people who can do this.
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:34.040]   Do you remember that I was a 3D character on MSNBC.
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:38.720]   Protozoa made a silicon graphics onyx machine with a protozoa software and it generated
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:43.840]   this character DevNol that was in real time volumetric a character.
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:45.560]   I've talked to the guy who did this work.
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:47.520]   He says you can do it now on a PC.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:48.840]   I can do it.
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:54.880]   I want to have eventually instead of monitors, that's just an interim.
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:35:00.320]   I want Andy to be a 3D holographic 3D sitting next to us.
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:05.520]   Okay, well I fully support this because this means that finally I can ask a tax deduction
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:07.560]   by a complete set of Jedi robes.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:11.960]   You think I'm not going to do the Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:12.960]   So you could do it.
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:14.040]   You're right because you've got the 3D mocap.
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:17.080]   So we'd have to have him come out here and mocap him, right?
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:19.200]   But the thing is that was you were running live to that.
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:20.480]   This was live in real time.
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:21.880]   No, we need to do it to compot.
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:23.400]   Because you're not talking about you.
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:28.280]   Well, basically what happened, the way it would be is we'd want to mocap Andy and create
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:32.320]   a character, but then lip sync the character to Andy's speech.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.320]   It could be done.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:35.920]   And perhaps have a puppeteer or even have Andy be able to do it.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:38.520]   If Andy was in front of green screen, we could composit him on the table.
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:39.520]   Exactly.
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:40.920]   Oh, so he could do it at home.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.520]   He could just be sitting there and it would look like you.
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:45.360]   But every Tuesday, Andy would have to put dots on his head, right?
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.360]   No, I'm talking about you could have Andy.
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:48.880]   I'm not very much on hygiene.
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:51.280]   You could just leave him there.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:52.280]   Don't watch him off.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:54.880]   You go to these dark people say, you know you have black dots and you're facing you.
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:56.480]   I know it's just for the mocap.
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:59.900]   And if you keep doing this with all your regular guests, you could have like your own
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:03.640]   version of electronic arts MBA jam only with like Twithose.
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:07.080]   Wait, we use the connect.
[01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:09.360]   Hack the connect.
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:12.760]   So all you would have to do, Andy, is put a connect instead of a camera in front of you.
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:13.760]   It wouldn't do them.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.840]   You'd have to do a lip sync from the phone heaps for the mouth.
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:18.840]   Right outside of that, like basic motion and everything else could all be done with it.
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:19.840]   Okay.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:21.240]   That's phase two.
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:25.280]   So if you buy a brick, maybe this is part of what you're underwriting.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:27.600]   All this could be yours.
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:28.600]   We get back into that whole thing.
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.440]   Like we're not really pushed by money.
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:32.600]   We're pushed by that would be absolute.
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:35.040]   You know, you know, what's so ever.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:40.520]   I think what everybody's witnessing right here is a live demonstration of the technological
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:45.520]   Peter principle that your goals will always expand so that they're always just beyond
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:46.760]   your technological reach.
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:49.960]   Until it looks like right now, right now we've got a system so that we could get high
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:54.680]   def moop high def camera, copper ethernet, conferencing for like multiple guests.
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:59.080]   And that's actually working, which means we got to start screwing.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:02.200]   And by then they'll be bricks engulfing the entire building.
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:03.200]   Yes.
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.200]   I got a holographic right now.
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:07.960]   So like the rest of the grid of like multiple multiple tracking cameras.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:11.960]   I have to be finished with one of those suits.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:12.960]   I think we can do.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:17.560]   I've been very excited by the idea and I think connect might actually be the missing
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:18.560]   link.
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:20.440]   So I think we can do a virtual Leo and a virtual Andy.
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:25.760]   Well, basically every host we'd created, they'd have to come out, do the mocap in your studio.
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:29.320]   And what we need to do is create software that allows us to animate that using connect.
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:30.800]   I think connect is sufficient.
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:36.560]   I really am thinking right now, do I know anybody at LucasArts who could like do a clone
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:41.560]   wars version of me because if I got to be virtual, I want a clone wars Jedi version of
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:42.560]   me.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:43.560]   Well, absolutely.
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:45.760]   I mean, one of the advantages is costuming is, you know, is easy.
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:49.160]   I think think of like young, lowy ones beard, think this is going to look great, like rendered
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:50.160]   like that.
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:55.200]   Furthermore, furthermore, if anybody says anything, I don't like it hit the button and
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:56.680]   they blow up.
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:57.680]   Nice.
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:58.680]   Where was it?
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:00.640]   Or I could have an ejector seat.
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:05.360]   John C. de Boric, you're full of it out of here.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:06.360]   Boom.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:07.360]   But I bought you Leo.
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:12.800]   If you strike me down, I should become a little powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:15.520]   We're going to take a break, come back with our picks of the week.
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:21.440]   Andy Anako is also here from the Chicago Sun Times, a foil for all of my evil plans.
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:24.960]   The man with the mutton chops is, oh, I just love the people who do this show.
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:25.960]   It's so much fun.
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:27.760]   They're so, they're visionaries.
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:32.560]   Hey, let me tell you, if you were a freelancer, there's a very, very bad thing that happens
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:33.760]   at the end of every month.
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:36.000]   It's called invoice time.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.920]   And as a long time freelancer, it was always the worst day of the month.
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.520]   I frankly get to the point where I just wouldn't do invoices.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:44.760]   And of course, you don't do an invoice.
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:45.760]   You don't get paid.
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:46.840]   That's how they get you.
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:48.600]   That's how they get you.
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:52.000]   Then I found FreshBooks found it in 2004.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.280]   One of two million people who have since used FreshBooks to do their invoicing.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:56.280]   I uploaded my logo.
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:59.320]   I was able to make very professional looking invoices.
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:01.560]   By the way, not just email invoices.
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:05.440]   They'll also, for an additional fee, print, stamp and mail your invoice.
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:08.400]   So some of the older clients tell I'd do that too, just to make sure.
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:14.480]   But the beauty of doing the paperless invoice, the email invoices, there's a button on it
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:16.720]   that says pay Leo now.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:22.880]   And they can use a credit card, PayPal authorized on an 11 payment gateways in total, to absolutely
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:25.040]   streamline this transaction.
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:28.840]   You could even do it in such a way that the invoices are automatic if it's the same amount
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:31.040]   every month, and the payment is automatic.
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:34.040]   A lot of clients, it's not the problem, it's not paying you.
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:38.600]   They have the same resistance to doing bills as you have to doing invoices.
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.120]   It's just something they don't look forward to.
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:41.120]   You got to make it easy.
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:44.960]   Make it easy for them to pay, and they will pay you faster.
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:47.200]   It means it's absolutely true.
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:49.920]   If they don't pay, hassle free invoice follow up.
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:52.520]   You know exactly which clients owe you how much.
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:56.960]   And you could automatically set it up, they call it the butler, to send late payment reminder
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:59.000]   email emails.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.480]   Automatically, the invoices look really good, really professional.
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:08.720]   You can even do time and hours, time and expenses in there.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:13.920]   If you build that way, they have an iPhone app, iPad app, they also would have a web app
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:18.680]   that works anywhere, and all the hours are automatically just sent right into the invoice.
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:20.800]   Really saves time.
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:21.800]   I just love it.
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:22.800]   I want you to try it right now.
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:24.800]   Go to freshbooks.com.

[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:46.280]   It doesn't have to be your birthday to win the cake.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:50.560]   Make sure you tell them you heard it on Macbreak Weekly.
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:51.560]   Freshbooks.com.
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:53.680]   They're the greatest.
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:57.000]   Let's get our picks of the week starting with Mr. Andy and Akko.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:02.360]   I have one main pick and one incidental pick that I just realized.
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:06.920]   One of the biggest hassles, whether you are traveling just down the street to working
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:11.320]   the coffee shop or you're traveling all the way across the country in the world for the
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:15.720]   next three weeks is all the little bibs and bobs you have to take with you in order to
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:17.440]   keep your devices running.
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:19.600]   You got power bricks.
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:20.600]   Those are big and bulky.
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:21.600]   You got little styluses.
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:22.600]   Those are tiny.
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.160]   You got memory cards.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:29.160]   There's just no way to really keep them in your bag and keep them organized so that when
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:36.160]   you need to get the little tiny little USB adapter for your memory cards, for your iPad,
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:39.960]   you can find that thing without having to pick out a bag and dump it out like grandma's
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:42.160]   purse and spread things out.
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:45.000]   I came across this awesome system.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.680]   It's called Griddit.
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:55.200]   It's a company called cocooninnovations.com to make the system called Griddit.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:42:02.560]   Basically, it's the clevers thing in the world because all it is is like a pad of nice back
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:04.400]   and sea nylon.
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:07.680]   On top of it is a grid of straps.
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:12.640]   It's just like a lattice with gaps here and everywhere.
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:17.080]   You are simply free to simply stick things inside these loops wherever you want them
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:18.800]   to go.
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:21.840]   It works so exceptionally well.
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:23.160]   They come on various sizes.
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:28.720]   This one is the perfect size to slip into either of the little gadget pockets of my
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:29.720]   laptop bag.
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:32.960]   It also fits perfectly inside my iPad bag.
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:38.840]   Whenever I want to grab my headphones, whenever I want to import a video or something into
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.720]   my iPad, I don't have to fumble for it.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.640]   I just pull out this one thing and it's right there.
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:49.560]   It's so good that after I bought the first one, I wound up buying two more.
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:54.320]   I also, the second most important one in my life is this one.
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:55.320]   There you go.
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:56.320]   Giant Andy.
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:57.320]   Giant Andy.
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:58.320]   That's what we need.
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:42:59.320]   Exactly.
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:00.320]   This is your future.
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:01.320]   I am the moth.
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:02.320]   I am the flame when you are the moth.
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.320]   The palm is before me.
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:04.320]   Right, my brook.
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.320]   I see.
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:15.840]   On top of everything else, it's great for these short haul trips.
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:20.760]   But also, I have the one that's like eight and a half by 11.
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:23.920]   It's like a big full size palette.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:26.520]   And that's the grid, right?
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:27.520]   They're all called the grid.
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:29.680]   They're just available in different sizes.
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:32.280]   This is the one that's good for my little date.
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:36.240]   And the ones that are bigger are big enough that they can really hold.
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:41.080]   This is got the charger for my camera, for my phone.
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:42.520]   It's got every cable that I need.
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:47.120]   It's got every little tripod accessory I need, every little camera flash.
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:51.480]   And the last thing I do when I pack my bag, because I usually travel carry on, is just
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:57.880]   put this flat thing nicely organized right on top of my bag, which has a two pronged effect.
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:01.240]   Because usually when I travel, especially if I'm gone for more than a few days, I'll
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:05.600]   unpack the hotel and say, OK, so here's an iPhone sync cable.
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:08.680]   And here is another iPhone sync cable.
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:12.600]   And here is a third iPhone sync cable, because I have this little mesh bag that would just
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:13.960]   throw things in.
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:16.680]   And as I'm packing, I think, oh, God, I hope I didn't.
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:18.520]   Well, OK, let's just put another one in there.
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:22.640]   I'm sure that there's one in there already, but just in case with this system, you can,
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:27.200]   before you close your bag, you can see exactly what you have and you don't bring duplicates.
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:30.680]   But it also means that when the TSA puts that through your scanner, everything is
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:32.760]   flat and it's right on the top there.
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:36.920]   So everything will image and shadow just perfectly and they'll be able to see it.
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:38.480]   So they're available in different sizes.
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:39.920]   This one is something like 12 bucks.
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:43.000]   The larger ones are 15 to 18.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.120]   Just buy this by the small one experimentally.
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:50.440]   And boy, just like me, you'll be placing another order pretty soon because it just works
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:52.760]   so exceptionally well.
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:55.760]   And the second thing is because I they happen to be in here.
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:58.760]   This something that I also recently bought.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:02.720]   Different technology, one of my favorite tech companies because they are not afraid to
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:07.760]   do things that are just barking mad because it seems like a good idea and they'll put
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:10.640]   it out there and maybe it'll be a success, maybe it'll be a failure.
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:14.440]   But at some point, someone had a conversation in the conference room that said, OK, I just
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:16.120]   got to totally see what that would look like.
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:18.120]   We actually built it.
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:23.160]   This is this is a three pack of USB cables that they sell that work obviously really
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:30.560]   well for travel for like 20 to 25 bucks, you get a USB to iPod connector.
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:36.320]   You get a USB to mini micro USB connector and a USB to mini USB connector.
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:41.120]   So with these little two three little things like inside your pack here, you now have the
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:46.880]   ability to charge and sync and copy your amount just about anything you could possibly encounter.
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:51.040]   You'll never be in a spot where, yeah, this would not be a problem if I had thought to
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:55.600]   bring a micro USB cable, but I did bring just the mini USB cable so I'm pretty much screwed.
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:57.600]   Oh, well, lesson learned.
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:02.240]   But with this, not only is it no longer that it needs to be just to get the job done, the
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:07.280]   fact that it is so specific to just being out of the house, you sort of short circuit
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:11.120]   the problem that I normally have and keeping one of these in my bag.
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:15.880]   You know how it works where at some point you're your your your home, you need to charge
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:21.720]   something up, you can't immediately find the micro USB cable you normally use.
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:25.800]   You know that the only one that you bet you know for a fact there's one inside your laptop
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:26.800]   bag.
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:30.560]   You're not really going to rob your laptop bag to get the little three inch one here.
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:33.480]   So these ones tend to stay exactly in your travel kit.
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:38.840]   So these are two things that are they instantly became like my so my favorite of the favorite
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:42.120]   of things just to keep technology organized.
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:45.200]   And let's let's also praise the the grid it again.
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:50.520]   I love these things are these things where you know this technology is not brand new.
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:54.800]   The idea of having elasticated bits of rubber that could be sewn onto something.
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:58.960]   We've had that technology since the Apollo program, but it only took recently recent
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:02.120]   days to some of the thing, hey, you know what, if you sort of a grange these in sort of a
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:07.240]   grid pattern, then you could actually dig this into a really handy sort of cable organization
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:08.240]   tool.
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:10.080]   We should build one of those.
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:12.640]   I just bought one of each.
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:14.880]   Yeah, literally while you were talking.
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:17.080]   No, while while you were talking, I bought one of each.
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:18.480]   I was like, I don't know what size I need.
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:20.480]   So I'm just going to get them all and then we'll figure it out.
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:23.760]   And I know that I think that what these are going to actually end up as standardized.
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:27.600]   We have this problem with wrangling cables in our supply.
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:28.600]   Yes.
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:31.200]   You know, where they're just there's a whole bunch of stuff that's really carefully organized
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:34.240]   and then they're just a pile of cables and or in a they're in a bag, usually like an
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:36.560]   Eagle Creek bag, but it's not sure.
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:38.520]   I need everything to have its place.
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:39.520]   And that's perfect.
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:42.440]   Your picks of the week, Mr. Alex Lindsay, I have a couple.
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:47.440]   You guys are overdoing it.
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:50.680]   I was talking earlier about sound effects.
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:51.680]   Yes.
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:52.680]   Are you going to make set, make noises?
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:53.680]   I'm not going to make the noise.
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:54.680]   It's going to make the noise.
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:55.680]   Hopefully it'll make the noise.
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:56.680]   I heard a bloop.
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:57.680]   Wait a minute.
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:47:58.680]   That was Andy.
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.680]   So this is.
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:06.360]   That's a that's a halo you're playing right there.
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:08.840]   This is no, this is not halo.
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:10.680]   It's not this is.
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:13.600]   This is no, no, it's marathon.
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:14.600]   Yes.
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:17.280]   Actually, it was my iPad pick of the week on.
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:18.280]   Oh, there you go.
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:19.280]   I love it.
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:20.680]   So you can you turn it up?
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:21.680]   It's free.
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:22.680]   I was trying to figure out why.
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:23.680]   It's not making any noise.
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:24.680]   You have the mute button on?
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:25.680]   I don't know.
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:26.680]   Because it's really fun.
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:27.680]   I love marathon.
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:28.680]   It is a pick.
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:29.680]   I don't know why.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:30.680]   Anyway, so it's.
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:35.920]   I don't know how we can show this to the camera, but here, candid, handed over to me.
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:37.880]   I can show it to the camera.
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:38.880]   It is.
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:39.880]   If you remember playing marathon?
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:40.880]   Classic game.
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:44.360]   We even did a group like Mac break marathon where we brought down the entire like online
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:45.360]   network.
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:46.360]   So much fun.
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:49.520]   So one of the things that that HD mode is replacement.
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:51.360]   Oh, so now you're able to start upgrading.
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:52.560]   They're starting to sell stuff.
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:54.880]   They're starting to sell so you can upgrade the quality.
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:56.040]   It's free.
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:57.040]   Look at this.
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:00.120]   Did I say it's it's free and it's all it's the it's the classic and to be honest with you,
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:01.880]   I don't need the graphics to be any higher.
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:06.320]   Do you like the oh, oh, oh, how do I shoot the red button red button?
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:08.280]   There you go.
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:11.720]   You know, you do need the better graphics on is the the enemies.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:14.920]   Yeah, but yeah, yeah, the old alpha channels are really.
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:15.920]   They're really floppy.
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:17.120]   The old alpha channels are a little rough.
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:18.680]   When they blow up, they're suitable.
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:19.680]   Yeah.
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:20.680]   So that but it's fun.
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:24.840]   And now what now what of course everybody is asking is when are we going to get network
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:27.840]   play because marathon is what was all about.
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:31.600]   Yeah, I mean, this is all fine and it's good to get it's good for you to get good at the
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:33.080]   weapons and everything else.
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:37.640]   And I think there's an obligatory like we have to make a some kind of story with the
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:38.640]   game.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:42.400]   But really all you want to do is this the original marathon is the original marathon
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:45.840]   one is really it's now this was open source by Bungie a long time ago.
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:47.360]   So there was it was being made available.
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:48.360]   It really is.
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:54.160]   I mean, if you if you this was the original Halo, I mean, this was this was the I hate
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:55.440]   it when the call week is it?
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:57.200]   It's very hard not to have colic.
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:58.600]   We interrupt you all the time.
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:04.920]   So yeah, so the anyway, so the it is so the thing is I know that they have to be working
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:08.960]   on networking because I think they have to know that that's what everybody wants.
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:13.400]   And this is going to be I think this is going to be a massive game when how do I get under
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:14.400]   here?
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:15.400]   Can I squat?
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:16.400]   You have to hit a button.
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:18.400]   There's a button there somewhere that you have to hit.
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:21.120]   No, you have to I think you how do I hit buttons?
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:25.880]   I think you just got it.
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:27.720]   No, those are all just paint.
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:31.880]   My buttons anyway, so so am I making everybody at home sick?
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:32.880]   Exactly.
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:36.600]   So the so anyway, so definitely check it out.
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:37.600]   It's free.
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:38.600]   Here's my other one.
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:39.600]   It's iPad.
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:40.600]   It's on the iPad.
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:41.600]   Yep.
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:42.600]   It's awesome.
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:43.600]   It's your other one.
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:44.600]   So we were talking about iPhone cases.
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:46.360]   This is the best iPhone case I've ever I've ever used.
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:47.600]   And it's actually part of a kit.
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:48.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:49.600]   Okay.
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:50.600]   I got a story about that.
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:51.600]   But go ahead and finish.
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:52.600]   Okay.
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:53.600]   So this is the this is the amazing case.
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:54.600]   Yeah, the game.
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:55.600]   This is the gimbal.
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:56.600]   Okay.
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:57.600]   So here's what it is designed for is designed for.
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:01.240]   Okay, you got a tripod and you take this tripod.
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:02.240]   Let me see.
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:07.120]   You take this tripod like this and you can and then it pops out and it's the best tripod
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:08.120]   that has been made.
[01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:12.040]   I mean, the this is from you, Bic you use your UBI Q and check this out.
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:17.880]   So you pop this in and now what you have is you can either have it like this or like
[01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:23.840]   this and it suspends your camera over top of the nodal point or close to it.
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:24.840]   Not exactly.
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:25.840]   So it's good for panels.
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.800]   So if you want to do panels and to be honest with you, it actually works their software is
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:30.240]   a little wonky, but the with photosynthesis.
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:31.240]   Amazing.
[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:32.240]   Our favorite.
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:35.360]   Anyway, so but as just a tripod, it's awesome.
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:38.920]   Now this is the pro version and here's what the pro version number one is black, which
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:45.160]   is better much pro black is more pro and number two is that it so and remember this all folds
[01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:47.280]   up.
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:55.080]   So you can you can hold it can hold this on and it to me.
[01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:56.640]   Actually, you know what I'll do?
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:58.520]   I'll put you in camera there.
[01:51:58.520 --> 01:51:59.520]   Right.
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:00.520]   And then you'll show it.
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:01.520]   We're getting high tech.
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:02.520]   No, no, no.
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:04.520]   Take it in rid of Andy.
[01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:06.520]   Andy is and he's bitter.
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:09.760]   He's like, don't take me.
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:13.240]   So anyway, so I'm trying to guess your card right now.
[01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:14.960]   So anyway, so then and then here's the handle.
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:16.800]   Now this is one that you can just put on a tripod.
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:20.680]   So this is what the pro one does is it includes this extra little bit that now both of these
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:23.200]   have quarter 20 mounts in them.
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:24.960]   So you can actually screw this to the top of a tripod.
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:28.680]   So if you want to add it to a tripod now, what's great is if you want to try pod quickly,
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:31.560]   a lot of times there's like trying to attach stuff to your iPhone when you want to put
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:32.560]   it on a tripod.
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:37.560]   Well, now you have a case that is you have a case that is built for it.
[01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:40.800]   So you leave it in the case and anytime you want to pop it on a case like case has this
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:45.280]   slam bam and and you're just slides right into the notch.
[01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:52.720]   The crazy thing is is that the case is better than any case I've had for my iPhone by itself
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:55.280]   without the tripod and the tripod is great.
[01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:56.280]   So like the tripod is great.
[01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:57.280]   You can put it.
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:02.040]   My my Scottie best, you know, like one of the pockets is like the tripod pocket or am I in
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:03.040]   my thing?
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:05.320]   And so you can you got it in kind of a wonky way.
[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:06.320]   I got wonky.
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:09.960]   So anyway, but the get the idea, but it's very solid.
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:15.280]   It's a very very and the thing is you can feel the quality of build is very, very high.
[01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:17.440]   When they came out, they were a little bit more expensive.
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:19.880]   And I think that a lot of us said that's really great.
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:21.480]   It's too much.
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:26.320]   And so now it is the pro version, I think is $99 and the consumer version without the
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:29.960]   quarter 20 and the extra piece and not black is $69.
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:34.960]   And I just have to say that at that price, I think it at $149 and $99, I think it was
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:37.440]   a little pricey at $69.99.
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:40.200]   Well, we're given the quality of the bill.
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:42.400]   Given what you're you know, if you're looking for a tripod and what's great is you have
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:46.760]   a little tripod that can attach to a big tripod with the pro one, I would get the pro one.
[01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:49.120]   I wouldn't get the because of the it's got the thread.
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:50.120]   It's got the thread.
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:51.560]   So you can just pop it on to any tripod.
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:55.120]   So now you have a camera mount, a tripod mount for any tripod.
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:56.120]   That's a good point.
[01:53:56.120 --> 01:54:02.600]   And a nice little tripod and as I said, the best iPhone case that I have.
[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:05.120]   Well, I'll tell you how to do this iPhone cases.
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:07.320]   What do you like about the case?
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:09.840]   Assume that no one is ever that someone is never going to use this.
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:11.160]   That's a good fair question.
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:12.960]   It's it is solid.
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:13.960]   It's very solid.
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:16.240]   And there's something about that little lip that I really like.
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:17.920]   It's just really comfortable to hold.
[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:19.400]   I'll tell you what I like about the case.
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:20.800]   You can't get the damn thing off.
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:25.640]   So I was demonstrating this on the daily gizwiz and we had people in the audience.
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:26.720]   I didn't have my iPhone four.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:29.680]   So somebody let me as I phone four, I put it in the case.
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:33.960]   I had to give him the gimbal pro because I couldn't get the phone.
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:34.960]   By the way, Jeff is calling.
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:39.880]   Gaze you want to talk about the phone out of the case.
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:44.360]   And so one of our fine viewers is now the owner of a gimbal pro.
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:48.720]   So if I can you figure out how to get it out there?
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:50.720]   Oh yeah, you can do it.
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:51.720]   I've done it.
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:53.720]   You just have the pull heart in my in my haste.
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:54.720]   Yeah, you got it out.
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:55.720]   I just could.
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:56.720]   But you just you have to you can't be afraid of breaking it.
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:58.720]   It really won't break.
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:05.440]   So so the but the if they had a battery version of that, it would be the the absolute perfect
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:06.440]   case.
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:10.640]   Well, Jim Levine now has a Brooklyn, New York now has his very own gimbal pro.
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:11.640]   It's awesome.
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:12.640]   Anyway, that's my.
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:13.640]   It does.
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:17.680]   It really it really reminds me that this I was just thinking about this this morning
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:22.240]   that I wonder why case manufacturers people make cases for the iPad and the iPhone.
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:28.040]   They're so afraid to make a case that goes on and attached that holds together with screws.
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:34.240]   My I usually have two I usually have two complaints about about these cases either they are like
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:38.920]   you said impossible to get off once you put them on or once you put them on, they don't
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:40.200]   really fit very snugly.
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:42.120]   They don't fit like very integrally.
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:46.200]   I am perfectly happy that the time I need to take it out to service it or put it to something
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:47.200]   else.
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:49.960]   I will simply have to that point have to get a little screwdriver in order to take it apart.
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:53.360]   So on such as scooter one, two, three, four, good case pops off.
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:54.640]   There's a little gasket there.
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:56.600]   So it's it's held together really, really well.
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:58.680]   And also I like the look of screws.
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:55:59.840]   I believe they look cool.
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:01.360]   Did you look at the element cases?
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:05.600]   I believe they're they actually screw on and they're like me that a titanium.
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:07.520]   They're they're pretty hardcore.
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:14.800]   So I'll take titanium if there's no carbon fiber on carbon fiber screws that splinter
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:18.280]   when you twist them, but still you can say these got covered fiber screws, man.
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:24.200]   I have since you guys did now have done four picks, I think I'm just going to do not a
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:29.720]   pick but just to thank you first of all to OpenX who gave you this Alex Lindsay to hand
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:30.720]   off to me.
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:33.480]   We've talked about OpenX many times on the daily giz whiz.
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:36.440]   This is the solution of those blister packs you can't get open.
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:41.480]   It's basically an exacto knife with a shield on it that you can slide in and then it has
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:44.240]   a little protruding blade, but it's spring loaded.
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:45.440]   So it's much safer.
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:47.840]   And for some reason it has the Mac break weekly logo on it.
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:48.840]   I don't really understand why.
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:51.360]   Robert Louis is a Mac big Mac break fan.
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:52.360]   He invented it.
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:53.360]   Yeah, no, I know.
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:55.480]   And we've done we've done this many times.
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:56.480]   Oh, he's a producer.
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:57.480]   He's the producer for Dexter.
[01:56:57.480 --> 01:56:58.480]   He's the Dexter guy.
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:56:59.480]   Yeah, he's the Dexter guy.
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:00.480]   Well, no wonder.
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:01.960]   So, so he so I was down there and he showed it to me.
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:04.800]   He was like, Oh my gosh, this is like a huge complaint I have about blister backs.
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:05.960]   I can never open them.
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:11.040]   Well, we talked about many times on the daily giz whiz and and Dick uses it all the time.
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:13.000]   My open X.com.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000]   I didn't.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000]   Andy, I have one for you.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.760]   He gave him what he sent with me and I have one.
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:19.960]   In case you're wondering, if you forget to take it out, it will go through TSA, but I
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:20.960]   wouldn't suggest it.
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:21.960]   It will go through TSA.
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:22.960]   I forgot.
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:23.960]   Take it out of that.
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:24.960]   And you had to explain it.
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:25.960]   No, they didn't.
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:26.960]   They didn't ask.
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:27.960]   They didn't ask.
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:28.960]   Well, you couldn't.
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:29.960]   It's kind of that's the beauty of this is you can't really hurt anybody.
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:30.960]   And if they see this, you couldn't even really.
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:33.520]   I mean, you could cause a scratch with that.
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:35.920]   But boy, I tell you, if you have blister packs, great stuff.
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:37.640]   You scrape it once and pull it over.
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:39.800]   So that's something you can all get at my open X.com.
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:43.600]   But then this is something you can't get that the chat room is going crazy over.
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:46.200]   And I look forward to seeing this when they release it.
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:52.440]   If you go to persona mail.info, three Danish guys have created what they say is.
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:57.440]   The future of email is a new email client for Mac that focuses on simplicity and on the
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:57:58.440]   human touch.
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:00.440]   But you can't get it.
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:02.240]   Persona organize emails by people.
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:04.560]   I figure they've got a really good video.
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:07.480]   A conversation or attachment.
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:09.360]   We're all going to be excited about this soon.
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:13.240]   So I just want to send people to this website and watch the video.
[01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:17.360]   It's a new way of thinking about email, which I agree is probably more sensible.
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:19.560]   She likes to use the people view.
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:21.400]   Organizes emails by their sender.
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:25.680]   However, I have to point out, I think email is dead.
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:27.680]   But she now wants to share a video with you.
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:33.520]   If you're going to still use email, persona mail.info for more information.
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:35.120]   We're trying to kill it off.
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:36.120]   I think it's got to die.
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:42.400]   We're using a mixture of, for most of my communications with everyone, it's like Twitter and Facebook.
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:43.400]   Mike Elgin is doing.
[01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:44.400]   And we're just doing it.
[01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:46.960]   Mike Elgin has announced he's no longer in respond to email.
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:47.880]   I think M.G.
[01:58:47.880 --> 01:58:50.160]   Seagler is also doing this from TechCrunch.
[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:54.760]   I think they might have been inspired by a University of Carolina professor, but named
[01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:59.520]   with Paul Jones, he's a friend of mine, who decided to go on the no email policy.
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:03.000]   And doesn't mean that he's a lotite, that he's rejecting communications.
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:07.120]   And it's just that he realizes that there's so many much better electronic communications
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:09.120]   networks that why--
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:12.200]   These guys all seem to be using, as you said, Twitter and Facebook social networks.
[01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:18.240]   But one of the reasons that I think M.G. and Mike decided to do it now is they have fallen
[01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:21.000]   in love with the Google+ system.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:25.880]   And because Google+ makes it very easy to send mail to anybody, it's hard to get anybody
[01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:27.480]   actually into it.
[01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:29.680]   Well now, I don't know if-- yeah, I guess if you're not on it.
[01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:30.680]   So we use--
[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:32.080]   They have invites now, you know.
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:33.080]   I know, I've tried.
[01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:34.080]   But they--
[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:36.760]   Not only do they have invites, but they're growing very fast.
[01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:39.160]   It's estimated they'll have 10 million users by the end of the week.
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:43.640]   Yeah, because we run all the kind of day-to-day comments of what's going on in the company
[01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:44.960]   is all run through chatter.
[01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:47.800]   Well, I think this would replace that, actually.
[01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:49.800]   It's got the groups.
[01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:52.400]   Anyway, I'm not putting a plug for Google+ by any means.
[01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:54.520]   I'm mostly saying I can't wait to get rid of email.
[01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:56.240]   My problem with Google's, I always get confused.
[01:59:56.240 --> 01:59:57.240]   It's like too much stuff.
[01:59:57.240 --> 01:59:58.240]   I like Google+.
[01:59:58.240 --> 01:59:59.240]   I just want it to be like Google+.
[01:59:59.240 --> 02:00:01.240]   Well, I'll show you how to use it.
[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:04.400]   I got-- I got-- I got-- I got-- I got-- I'm just not a very smart guy.
[02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:07.880]   It does beg the-- no, no, it does beg the question of if I have to show you how to use
[02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:10.400]   it, how effective is it going to be?
[02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:11.400]   I don't think it's that difficult.
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:13.400]   Like Andy, you're pretty prolific on it.
[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:14.400]   I see you a lot on it.
[02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:18.840]   Yeah, I mean, I'm trying to-- I really think that I'm sort of navigating to a world in
[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:25.440]   which I'm going to be having to use Twitter, Google+ and my blog as like the three bears
[02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:29.400]   where Twitter's the baby bear for just like quick links and quick like quips.
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:34.040]   Google+ is for those things that two or three paragraph ideas and when I want to write something
[02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:38.520]   that's really at length that is so in-depth that the implications that you're probably
[02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:42.240]   going to want to tap the Insta paper button and save it as an ebook, that's the stuff I'm
[02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:46.680]   going to use the blog for because it's so easy and so natural and so-- and you get so
[02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:50.880]   much-- in this early stage of people where almost everybody on this service is somebody
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:56.120]   that I know or know someone that I know, it's amazing that I post up that I immediately
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:00:57.600]   get like 30 or 40 responses.
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:00:58.600]   Huge engagement.
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:00:59.360]   Huge engagement.
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:03.440]   It's not that you want the attention but you write something so that hopefully other people
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:07.320]   will see it and so that's sort of-- I really-- I do like it a lot better than Facebook,
[02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:08.320]   I have to say.
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:09.320]   I mean, it's like--
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:13.120]   Well, it's more of a Twitter killer than a Facebook killer but it has some very interesting
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:15.960]   features in terms of filtering and so forth that maybe make it--
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:19.320]   I still think the magic of Twitter for me is the simplicity that I just don't have--
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:20.560]   Well, I'm kind of with Andy.
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:21.560]   I'll keep the blog.
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:23.480]   I'll keep Google+ and I'll keep Twitter.
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:24.640]   I think you're right, Andy.
[02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:26.840]   There's three different use cases for each.
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:30.360]   Maybe it is Facebook that's going to hurt the most from this.
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:33.320]   You certainly don't need Facebook at this point.
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:37.240]   Unless you want to hang out with family members who aren't using this kind of thing.
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:41.120]   No, it's-- if that Facebook's role is always going to be-- it seems to be the one that
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:43.440]   all my nieces and nephews and sisters use.
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:49.120]   So that's the one that will always be-- Oh, so my nephew got married last week.
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:52.680]   It's so nice to find out along with 8,000 other people that you shared with.
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:53.680]   But that's OK.
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:57.440]   But I think the lesson also is that-- I think the MySpace lesson is that, yeah, everybody's
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:01:58.440]   using it right now.
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:02.560]   But a lot of times those connections, my daughter was only using MySpace and there was some
[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:04.800]   point where she just MySpace wasn't cool anymore.
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:05.800]   It was gone.
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:06.800]   Right.
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:11.240]   I also asked you one question before we sign off.
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:16.880]   Is the element case, Black Ops case, is it nearly as awesome as it looks like on the
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:17.880]   picture?
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:18.880]   It's pretty awesome.
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:21.520]   Because if so, I might have to say $100 and $100.
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:25.280]   It looks pretty dangerous.
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:30.600]   I think one of the things that they fixed that was a problem in the first round of these
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:36.080]   when I was testing them was that they-- I mean, these are the most gnarly looking cases ever
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:37.760]   made.
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:40.640]   And they're just machine-- it's machined.
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:44.360]   Now, one of the problems at the bottom was that you couldn't get your standard USB connector
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:47.040]   to pop in there, but I think that they fixed that now.
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:50.200]   It's like-- but also where it looks like the headphone jack at the top looks like it's
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:52.200]   kind of hidden by the case a little bit.
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:56.880]   Yeah, but it's definitely-- but you put them in and you screw them in and you feel like
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:01.160]   the thing has now become like some kind of futuristic tank.
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:04.040]   You feel like it will stop a bullet if you put it in your shirt pocket.
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:06.280]   And these are really like-- they're not mass produced.
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:10.960]   They're like hardened-- I mean, they're machined pieces.
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:12.200]   It's quite a piece of artwork.
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:14.640]   I'm showing a video.
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:15.640]   This is the case, right?
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:16.640]   They're going to show the case.
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:17.640]   I don't know.
[02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:18.640]   I haven't seen this.
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:20.320]   I think they're going-- that's what they're going.
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:21.680]   If not, I apologize for the completely--
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:24.200]   Did you have safe search turned off when you put the search?
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:25.280]   Leo, well, here it is.
[02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:26.280]   See, there's the case.
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:28.800]   Oh, there you go.
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:35.080]   Apparently, that was just a long way around of showing that this case is tough.

[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:37.960]   I said, I guess, the reviewer.
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:39.040]   So this was a review.
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:39.760]   All right, I get it.
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:40.760]   I think so.
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:41.280]   Someone had this.
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:42.280]   This is the real--
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:43.280]   That's what I call a serious review.
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:47.760]   Frankly, this is the real problem with YouTube is that you do a search for Black Ops Elements
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:48.280]   case.
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:49.280]   It is.
[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:50.280]   And you get this.
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:51.280]   Complete with 223.
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:53.280]   No, just like I said, I was--
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:54.280]   I was--
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:56.280]   I was scared that you recognized that ammo, to be honest with you.
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:04:01.280]   I'm looking for an excuse to buy Obi-Wan Kenobi robes and write it off.
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:05.360]   This guy wanted to be able to buy a whole bunch of SWAT gear and write it off as a reviewer's
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:06.360]   expense.
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:08.360]   Now he has a gun and he has a helmet and he has ammunition.
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:09.360]   He has two ideas.
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:11.680]   I think he's going to shoot the case.
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:13.680]   I think he's going to shoot it.
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:15.480]   I don't know.
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:18.560]   I am now scared.
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:20.560]   Well we'll just have to leave that to--
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:23.240]   You have to go to YouTube today.
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:30.360]   This is an exclusive first look from BuyMeAniPhone.com if you want to know more.
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:33.280]   I hope the guy gets an iPhone because his other hobby is a little scary.
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:36.880]   Well, because he has a gun so he can pretty much get whatever he wants.
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:40.480]   He was smart to buy the gun before the phone case and the phone goes with the gun he can
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:42.680]   pretty much take care of it.
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:46.120]   Meanwhile Darth Vader is still dancing.
