[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. There's lots to talk about. Google I/O was this morning,
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.920]   so we'll get an Apple-y take on what Google announced. We'll also talk about Apple's Q2
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.000]   results that came out last week. We've had time to digest those. And you ever want to be a paper boy?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.560]   How about, well now you can. Thanks to Warren Buffet and Tim Cook, we'll explain next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.040]   Netcasts you love. From people you trust.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.400]   This is Detroit.

[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.280]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple. Starting about an hour
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.800]   and a half late today, only because Google had a little thing going on, a little fun and mountain
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.160]   view. I know you were watching at Renee Richie, because I saw you tweeting ReneeRitchie from iMore.com.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.760]   I'm actually not Renee. I am Google's new assistant podcast post now in beta.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.120]   Kind of give you realistic decision tree matrix responses, Leo.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.560]   We call you Renee Duplex.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.920]   Yes, yes, but I am ethical A.I. So don't worry. I'm only partially taken over the world.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.120]   And also here, and boy are her fingers tired, typing away like crazy Lori Gill.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.040]   She's managing editor at iMore.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.720]   That's me. I was there listening, but only my attention was split between listening to Google
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.680]   I/O and writing all about PowerBeats Pro.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.160]   Oh, yeah, you and Renee both got them.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.320]   I'm going to have to backtrack and re-listen to a bunch of stuff.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.880]   I went last year to I/O and it was so much fun. I wish I was there again. It's a really great
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.440]   experience.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.640]   Microsoft and Google for some reason book back-to-back developer conferences,
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.480]   which is a little frustrating. I think Microsoft's going to have to rethink that strategy because
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.480]   after slogging through Microsoft's keynote yesterday, which was just fumbled,
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.400]   fingered and uninteresting.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.600]   They don't pick a clear audience. They put a little bit for everybody. That means everybody's a
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.440]   little bit bored. And it sadly began with a massive demo fail before we talk about that.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.240]   Let me introduce Andy and Naco from WGBH Boston. Hi, Andy.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.960]   Hello. I know you're a space buff. Are you old enough to remember the moon landing 50 years ago?
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:27.760]   No, not quite. My youngest memory that's space related is I think I have a distant memory of
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.600]   being in preschool and maybe seeing Apollo 17. I vividly remember it.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.200]   Mine is Columbia. That's the first one.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.520]   Oh, I've vivid Columbia. That's a shuttle.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.240]   First shuttle launch.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.680]   Yeah, the first shuttle launch, Leo.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.760]   I vividly remember Neil Armstrong stepping off the lunar module, watching Walter Cronkart
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.400]   through many holds of not just Apollo, but Gemini and Mercury.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.040]   And I was 12 when they landed on the moon. So was Andrew Chekin, who was on stage
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.520]   yesterday at build along with John Knoll, who with his brother Thomas Knoll created Adobe
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.800]   Photoshop, then became creative director at Industrial Light and Magic, worked on both Star Wars
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.280]   and Star Trek effects. And I felt so bad for them.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.320]   And they listened to the show.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.440]   What?
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.160]   Yeah, I went to ILM and they came running up and John came running up and talked about something
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.400]   we talked about in Macbreak Weekly and he was listening on his way to work.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.840]   Oh, my day.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.880]   Well, John, I just feel so bad because I was just as excited as they were.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:38.320]   And John was seven. Andrew was 12 when people walked on the moon for the first time.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.080]   In fact, Andrew wrote the book about it.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.120]   And did you read the Janko Wreckers article about it in Variety? I guess
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.600]   Thomas, John Knoll had been planning this since the late 90s. He found a bunch of telemetry data
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.000]   and was starting to work on a program to image it because he wanted to image it.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.120]   And so he'd been working on this is a lifelong 20 year in the making project for him.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.360]   If you, by the way, if you get a chance, read this article and then watch the rehearsal video
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.360]   because it did work in rehearsal. It was supposed to be a demo of HoloLens 2.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.760]   That kind of showed the Saturn spacecraft, talked about it. The launch
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.400]   showed the lunar module landing on the moon, the difficulty Armstrong faced in landing it correctly.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.080]   And then his first step onto the moon in augmented reality. And it was just great.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.880]   And apparently they were having trouble getting the demo working.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.600]   The event that was prior to the keynote, which we had the privilege of watching as I got up early
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.720]   by accident, they stretched it for like 20 minutes, making up questions for the participants and stuff.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.680]   Finally, Wreckers writes, they ran out of questions. They had to go to the main stage,
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:07.040]   up come Chae-kin and Knoll. And it just the thing will work. And they said something like,
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.920]   well, it just shows getting HoloLens to work is even harder than a moon landing.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.080]   And hung their heads and walked off. And I just felt so bad for them.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.640]   But if you get the chance to see the rehearsal video, it would have been spectacular.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:33.840]   The best projects that ever happened are led by people who are just mad people,
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.720]   just mad men and mad women who just have this idea that is not commercial,
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.840]   there's no market for it, there's no audience for it. But they just realized themselves in their
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.200]   hearts that this would be an amazing thing to exist. And they have the ability, the drive and
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:55.600]   the resources to make it exist. And that's why this idea of saying, we have all of this data
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.200]   that will tell us every second, every step of this moon landing from preparation to
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:08.960]   trans-earth injection and landing, that we can actually rebuild this in such a way that's no
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.560]   longer grainy footage or statically radio. We can actually make it a real experience so we can
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:21.760]   actually refilm it in IMACs. And so people can just really see in front of them what was happening.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.000]   And again, it's not like there's a big market for this, but it was such a cool idea. You can't
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.760]   get rid of it and you have to do something with it. And that's why I think that humans are definitely
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:40.160]   still at least three steps above the elk and the porpoises in terms of being entitled to run this
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.440]   planet. I mean, I don't know if it was a great HoloLens demo, but that's what makes us geeks,
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:51.040]   right? Our enthusiasm for passion projects. And I just, well, John, if you're listening,
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.720]   sorry, but everybody's got to go, here's the video, I'm just looking at it right now and
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.280]   watch this. What a great and interesting demo of what you could do with HoloLens. Of course,
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.040]   what we're seeing is not what you see in the whole lens. We're seeing something much more
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:12.640]   impressive, but still the way they're interacting with it and that use the Unreal Engine. Epic Games
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:20.320]   participated in the recreation of this. So that's another amazing. Yeah, really, really looks realistic.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.880]   Yeah, it's very, very cool.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:30.320]   I mean, I hate to talk about a Google event on a Mac show, but I guess we kind of have to.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.000]   So much of it is coming to iOS anyway. Is most of it? Or you're a Mac on a browser.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.560]   Yeah. So the assistant's going to be updated. They say 10 times faster.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.680]   They're really taking it a page from Apple's playbook, Renee, because they're,
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.600]   there's a lot of this stuff is on device now as Apple stuff has been for some time.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.160]   Yeah, I mean, I want to be both optimistic and pessimistic about this, because we're just
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.800]   coming off Facebook F8, where they decided that they could say the word privacy and that would be
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   enough for most people without having to actually do any privacy stuff.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.680]   And I think Google has way better intentions here, but Google still needs massive amounts of data.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.520]   And they're candid about that. Like, you know, they'll give you the ability to erase your data in
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.440]   three months, not today, but in three months. And that's those are certainly steps forward.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.880]   And what they're doing here is they managed to shrink the data set from, I forget what they said,
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.080]   like 400 or 200 gigabytes. Some massive amounts of money. They got to talk about 200 gigabytes to
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:28.080]   200 kilobytes. Yeah, it was amazing. And because of the speed on device, it was the closest thing
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:34.400]   we've seen yet to like an actual Marvel Studios Jarvis or like Knight Rider kit style demo,
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.680]   where you could actually have a conversation in real time, not say something pause wait,
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.160]   say the command word again, pause wait, say the command, but just talk conversationally. And
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.400]   it was launching apps and keeping up and doing everything with it. It's not shipping today,
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.600]   not shipping tomorrow shipping later this year on the new Pixel phone, not until Pixel 4, but yeah.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.560]   And so I just want to go back to my mind. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.920]   I think that comes to my mind when I hear them talking about how this,
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:09.280]   this AI can kind of answer these questions sequentially without needing to have the trigger
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:15.200]   word used. But then I immediately start thinking, well, how long is this thing listening to me,
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.520]   then? And I think that's where it gets a little bit concerning when they talk about privacy and
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.600]   security. But then is this AI always listening? And is that something that we want?
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.040]   Well, it is now, but it's always listening for a pattern.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.600]   The only difference, I wish they had spoken about it. Like I wish they'd explained it, but
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.320]   it's like before you had AB, you had on off, it was binary. Now there are if statements in between,
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.560]   and that introduces complexity, but complexity is manageable. They've just talked about before,
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.040]   I think there's a two minute window. Siri has this to this contextual.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.040]   If you don't know or stop with the alarm clock, right? So if the alarm clock is going off,
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.440]   then listen for no instead of the trigger word. I love that, by the way.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.680]   Yeah. It's the single most important feature that when you're Google,
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.160]   I got the biggest applause. It did. The alarm is going off. You could just shut stop, and it will
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:09.680]   stop. And I mean, but it's this was by far the most interesting announcement of the entire thing,
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:15.280]   moving the AI model onto the device. And for me, yes, it was privacy. But also the,
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:21.280]   I'm glad that they pointed out all the implications of this, that now that we don't have to force
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:28.560]   everybody to be using the same central AI model, we can actually customize the AI model on device
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:35.760]   directly. So the one of the big demos they gave, and they actually have a project named for it,
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.800]   is that well, not a lot of people, they might have speech impediments, or they might have
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:47.520]   certain handicaps that will make it difficult for traditional voice models to understand them.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.240]   But now they can create a model that will make sure that they understand their voice, particularly.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:58.880]   And the ability, and also the ability to, if it's on device, and it's not necessarily exchanging
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:04.080]   data with Google, and like Renee says, we have to wait for further announcements and further
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.360]   sessions of IO to find out the details of this. But if it's really is going all on device,
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.400]   and the ability to say that certain data is absolutely never be uploaded to Google,
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:19.440]   now you have the ability to have it listen in on all of your converse, all of your phone conversations
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:25.520]   and all of your texts. They had a great demo where they basically turned a phone conversation
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:32.720]   into a text message interaction, because it could on the fly interpret, turn it into text,
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.640]   whatever this person on the phone, on the end of the phone conversation was saying,
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.720]   and then turn whatever you were typing into natural sounding speech.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.920]   I have that right here.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:48.000]   So people who again have show that that's Project Euphonia, by the way, Andy, and they did solicit
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.480]   people who have speech difficulty. If you have somebody who knows somebody who might help them
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:58.560]   with Project Euphonia, g.co/ufonia. Can you hear is my sound not?
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:04.640]   I love the non-obtrusive UI, too. It doesn't block out the entire screen unless you still see
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.120]   it. They're saying claiming 10 times faster.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.920]   The biggest thing for me, though, that was different this year is when they talked about
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.600]   duplexing technologies, they said it was part of a conversation. They weren't just giving you this
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.200]   massive tech demo. They said, "We understand it's sensitive. We want to discuss this. We want to
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.960]   have all this." And just that subtle difference makes it so much more approachable for people.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.840]   I'm so less stressful.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:27.520]   That's the difference, I think, between Google and Facebook. I cannot be convinced that Facebook
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:33.120]   gives a damn about security, gives a damn about privacy. And you have to convince me that if
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.480]   there's any opportunity they have to collect information and make sure that you don't know
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.680]   that they're collecting it, if it's valuable, that they'll take it. Whereas Google, like you
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:48.720]   said, like you said, Renee, I do think that they're open and honest about why they want your information.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:54.880]   But I do think they make a very sincere expression that we take this thing seriously. Obviously,
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.760]   there are things that we would like to be able to track for you. And that does benefit our business.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:06.640]   However, in addition to explaining that to you, we would also like to explain how that allows us
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:14.640]   to do things that Shlomo on Apple can't do or can't do as well as our AI can. So as we've been saying,
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.760]   for a long time on the show and elsewhere, it really is about the transaction between the consumer
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:24.160]   and the company that's collecting data. So long as this transaction and the details of that
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:32.640]   transaction are open and controllable by the user, I don't trust any company, even Apple. But
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.520]   for the lowercase version of trust that I extend to a billion dollar companies,
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.000]   I'm willing to trust Google and I'm willing to trust Apple.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.320]   Yeah, I think Google-
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.600]   So from the perspective of someone from the perspective of someone that uses an iPhone
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.360]   pretty much exclusively, if I ever use an Android device that's really just kind of
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:58.640]   testing something out, it's not on a daily basis. I look at this assistant from Google and think,
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.840]   "Yeah, but nobody's ever going to use that in the real world." And here's why I say that,
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:07.200]   because Siri doesn't work on iPhone very well at all, so it's useless to me. I don't use it
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.720]   ever because I'm constantly having to recorrect it and make it do what I want it to do. So I give
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:20.480]   up and I stop using it. So for Andy, do you use an Android product? Do you use the Google Assistant
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:26.560]   a lot? And do you see this as something that the average Android user might use all the time
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:33.920]   because of its convenience? I would say so. I use an Android pixel, a Google pixel as my daily driver
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:43.040]   and my smart speakers are all Google home devices. And as soon as the biggest impediment,
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:49.440]   I think, to using the Assistant and these other voice devices is just that you have to know that,
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.480]   "Oh, by the way, you don't have to format when you want to create an appointment. You don't have
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.280]   to format it. If you just simply give all the details in your request, it will figure it out
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:05.120]   and then confirm it back to you." And I think that people will continue to use this more and more
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:13.120]   as it becomes more like natural English speech. It sounds very, very naive and simple, but
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:19.760]   a big breakthrough, I think, came when one of the most basic commands like, "What's the weather
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.800]   tomorrow?" And, "Oh, the weather will be this." And then you can simply say, "Is it going to rain?"
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.960]   Like, "It's not expected to--" It will rain tomorrow afternoon from four to six.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.840]   Well, what about in Boston? In Boston, it will be clear and sunny. How about in Boston the day
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.720]   after that? And you're not saying, "You don't have to repeat these commands over and over again. It
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.760]   feels like a natural conversation." When they're able to expand that little by little, month by
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:52.400]   month into other things that we want to do, like, "Hey, Guillermo, I've got some avocados that are
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:58.880]   going to go bad tomorrow and also some sour cream, and I really bought way too many carrots. What
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:04.320]   can I cook that can use all this stuff up?" And it will tell you, "Here's what you can do."
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:13.440]   And these are times when Shlomo responds with, "Here are some things on the web I found about."
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:19.120]   About this thing, it's like, "Oh, Shlomo, I love you, but I really want you to be better than you are."
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:26.080]   Yeah. Well, Google has the same problem. Apple has this problem, too. In order for this stuff to
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:32.160]   work, they need more information. Apple's choice is not to collect it as a result. Shlomo ain't that
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:37.760]   great. Google, I think, probably is taking the middle road here. Facebook's just going to collect
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:42.000]   it. And Google's trying to take the middle road saying, "Well, we're going to let you know we're
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.160]   collecting it. We are going to give you some options." But honestly, if you want the best
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.720]   experience with Assistant, and they showed things, the contextual understanding that the Assistant had
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:57.360]   that really required it knowing everything about you. They made restaurant recommendations.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:04.560]   Well, in the past, you could ask, "What should I cook for dinner tonight?" And they would show
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:09.440]   you based on your search results. It's not like they know what's in your fridge, although that's
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:14.880]   just a matter of time. But what's important is that they said at the bottom of each recommendation
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.800]   how they knew that. And they need to do more stuff like that. Do more stuff on the phone.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:24.480]   Collect the data, but tell you, give you the chance to delete the data after a period of time.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.640]   And that's what I think that's going to be the new Google.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.160]   Imagine if Instagram ads did that. People would stop panicking about their devices listening.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:38.960]   Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And that's... I also like the fact that Google does appear to be listening.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:45.440]   The fact that they made privacy as one of the three pillars for the next version of Android,
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.560]   saying that this is explicitly something that we're working on. Because
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:54.240]   not just because we know that we're about to be regulated out of existence by the EU,
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:19:00.320]   and by Congress any day now. But we do know that this is something that is important for
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:06.480]   us to do. So that's what we're going to do for you guys. It was another intriguing thing of saying
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.440]   that we're going to add in Cognito mode to Maps. We're going to add in Cognito mode to search.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:16.800]   So if you don't want certain things to be visible to Google, you can still use Maps,
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:22.880]   a dumber version of Maps. But they won't know that you were going to a certain part of
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:29.840]   your time today. I suspect if they give people the choice and people can see the trade off,
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.520]   the people will choose to give Google the information because there's value in it.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.960]   Right, Laurie? Yeah, I completely agree. We just need the choice. When it's done without our
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.080]   without our knowledge, it feels like somebody's trapping us or somebody's
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:48.080]   spying on us. But if we're giving them that choice, I've always felt this way. Transparency
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:52.080]   is the most important thing. We can look at this information and decide for ourselves that we want
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.080]   to give it to them in exchange for whatever convenience. But when it's all being done without
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.680]   our knowledge and without us understanding what's really being done with our data, that's when it
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:06.320]   starts to get creepy and weird instead of something you feel like you're exchanging for a good service.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.280]   So yeah, I think that's very true. Let us know what we're doing, give us the choice to
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.920]   accept or decline that. And then we feel like we're in charge of what's happening with our data.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:27.040]   At this point, it looks like Google is ascendant in terms of what it can do with AI and its voice
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:31.520]   assistant. It isn't the number one seller by even close. Amazon's Echo beats everybody.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:37.920]   Should Apple do what Microsoft has done? Microsoft threw in the towel yesterday and it basically said,
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:44.720]   "Yeah, so we got a voice assistant, but we figure you'll use it to interact with other voice
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:49.840]   assistants, which is their strategy. And then you're going to use it in business. What should
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.000]   Apple? What do you think Renee? What should Apple do about Siri at this point?
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:00.400]   I think I would be more concerned if they hadn't just made a huge investment in building up a
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.440]   whole new organization within the company. They got John Jean-Andre and used to run Search and AI
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.280]   at Google. So he's got the credentials. They're hiring people, I can blank you on his name,
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:14.320]   but the guy who did the adversarial networks. And they're really-- Yeah, again. And they're
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.880]   building out that team the way they built out Johnny Saruji's Silicon team. They can have the
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:24.880]   smarts, but they don't have the data. So I'm not sure about that because there are
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:31.120]   different ways to handle data. And I think there's a lot of conflation that goes on here. One is
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:36.720]   that there are a lot of sources for data. So for example, they trained Face ID on tens of thousands
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.560]   of faces. They just didn't use customers. They brought in tens of thousands of volunteers. That
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:46.560]   doesn't scale, but there are ways to accumulate data and not use it for business. So for example,
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.800]   if you're okay with data harvesting, but you don't want that used for drone programs,
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.240]   you don't want that used for advertising, you don't want that used in a business sense,
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.160]   that's still a huge opportunity. And I think they also realized when they started getting to
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:02.480]   the healthcare stuff that you can't be absolutist about this. There are situations, for example,
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:07.040]   they talked about it with the MS study where people just-- They can't enter their own data,
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.480]   and you have to provide ways for them to share that. And I think that there are a lot of--
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:15.360]   Jim Andreas' whole thing is ethical AI. He was one of the biggest proponents of doing AI,
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:20.640]   but doing it in a way that was ethical and for the good of the people sort of thing.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.720]   And they can do a lot of stuff to collect data, to anonymize it where it makes sense,
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:30.080]   to de-identify it, to do a lot of other things and still get enormous value from it without
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.080]   been turning around and using it to fund an advertising business, which some people just see
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:38.000]   as a conflict. Yeah, that is a conflict. I mean, that will be-- As Google's bottom line,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.520]   it's not Apple's bottom line. So inherent conflict, Google is taking a page from Apple's playbook,
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:49.280]   though. I mean, they're clearly seeing all that. Well, I remember that a few years ago, they did
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.920]   what was a pretty outrageous step at the time, which is to find themselves as we are an AI company.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.760]   We are-- All of our products are extensions of artificial intelligence,
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.880]   just like Apple, I think, has not announced, but they do define themselves as a design company or
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.840]   as a human product company. And everything that they do gets filtered through that mindset.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:15.760]   But although we're slagging a lot on Shlomo right now, realize that Apple does a lot of things
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:21.600]   inside the labs that aren't constrained by their own rules. So they are definitely looking at ways
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:29.040]   that they could create-- Ways that they could make Siri as capable as the assistant,
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:34.560]   once certain technologies that allow them to implement these features in a private and secure
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:39.600]   way becomes available. And there is a whole bunch of theory on differential privacy
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:45.680]   coupled with the ability to move the AI model from the server onto the device,
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:51.440]   we don't know that maybe in two years from now, all of these legos will click back into place
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:57.760]   inside the labs inside Apple. And rather than being able to create a really great and impressive
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:04.240]   new demo and new release every single year, we'll get all of that all at once in two years time,
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.280]   only with all of the privacy that comes with an Apple product.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:15.520]   Maybe. It's also important to remember that Steve Jobs died.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.000]   Scott Forestall was fired and Bill Stainer joined the company and took over Siri. I think he'd been
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.160]   there for weeks at the time. So there was a whole lost dark age of Siri where just nobody cared
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.840]   about it. And now there's someone with the best credentials in the world caring about it.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.880]   There's a point at which you do what Microsoft's done, which is that we are so far behind now.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:40.240]   I mean, the race is really to Amazon and Google at this point.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.080]   But that's okay. That's what happens when a company knows what it's about,
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:49.120]   like knows what it's businesses. Microsoft, I think one of the smartest things they ever did was
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:55.040]   forget about being the first to anything or being the we've got the next and greatest and
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:59.680]   most wonderful and speculative technologies. They know that we are the ugly,
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:04.800]   greased gun that keeps the wheels of business moving. And it will never be pretty. It will
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:11.440]   never necessarily be elegant. But if we can, although we'd love to have like the sort of
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.920]   artificial intelligence assistant that everybody thinks, Oh my God, I can't believe
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:21.680]   that such thing we are living in a world of the future. If it makes Microsoft Office suite and
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.960]   Microsoft Windows, a better business product to say, You know what, why should we try to compete
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.760]   with the greatest AI is in the world when we can just simply make our operating system and software
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:37.760]   the most open in the world to whatever AI voice assistant that you're using. That's a really good
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:43.120]   thing. That's exactly what Nadella's done. Although yesterday at Build, they did have a video of
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:50.720]   continuous conversation with Cortana. But a couple of big differences. One, Google's was a live demo
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:56.480]   with an actual person holding a phone. Two, it was a woman walking through her day, her agenda,
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.840]   her meeting schedule. It was very business focused for Microsoft for Google. It was,
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:09.840]   let me show you pictures of my last trip. And you know, obviously they both could do either.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:15.280]   But I think it's pretty clear from a consumer point of view that people are going to want
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:21.200]   to what Google does. Yeah, I think it's very telling that we are perfectly, I say, I almost
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.280]   naturally say whenever there's a microphone in my presence, wherever it is, I always say
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:33.200]   Aliosa. And I always say Guillermo and I always say Shlomo. But I say Cortana without a pro without
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:38.400]   any mental. Nobody nobody's chance that someone has nobody's begging us stop saying Cortana.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:45.680]   Not yet. When it comes to AI and this digital assistant thing, the race to be the best.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:50.400]   You know, like you're saying, it comes down to Google and Amazon really. Who are the ones that
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.880]   are making smart home speakers that are the most popular? It's those two companies. That's
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.240]   right. Apple only makes a home pod. Is there any windows? There's one. Yeah, it's from Harmon
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:08.880]   Cardin. It's called the end. When you think about what makes a smart assistant really important
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.440]   to people, it's it's that speaker on their phones. It's a little less important because you can
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:20.400]   just do it on that. So I'm thinking that in this situation, Amazon and Google, they have multiple
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.640]   smart speakers out on the industry. And that's why they're trying so hard to be the best at what
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:30.480]   they're doing and why they're working with AI so much. But I don't think that in terms of
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.560]   who's going to buy the next Apple product versus who's going to buy the next Google product,
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.920]   I think they're so different that Apple is not assuming that because the Google Assistant is
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.000]   better than the Apple Assistant that you won't buy an iPhone for it. So they're not working. It's
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.280]   hard to meet that. A lot of that Google stuff is available on your will be available on your
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:55.840]   iPhone. Although Google today announced that they have what was it? Two and a half billion active
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:01.360]   devices, which is almost exactly double what Apple announced in its analyst. Yeah, but that
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.960]   there's a big difference there. Remember that two and a half billion devices equals like the
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:10.960]   blister pack phones. But they're still but all of them are collecting data regardless of how much
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:16.160]   it costs most of them are. Yeah, you're right. So they have a lot more inputs. Actually,
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:21.600]   let's talk about the quarterly results, the second quarter results because when we part
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:27.760]   it last week, Laurie and Renee were about to launch into a marathon analyst call and I'd like to
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.800]   know what they asked. I think that's one more Google question before I move on, Leo. Sure.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.760]   So the one thing I thought was really interesting is the way that they positioned the Pixel 3A.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.480]   If I was them, I would have come out and said, look, we made the Pixel and it's obvious that a lot
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.800]   of more of you want access to that technology. So we made the Pixel 3A, but they decided to kind
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.960]   of sort of blame higher end phones for some of the Pixel woes and talk about how they could make
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.360]   a cheaper phone. But at that point, when they start saying, we don't need the hardware,
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:58.160]   we can do it all in software, I just want to ask why not just release that camera app then?
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.440]   Because they're like third party ports of it to other phones and people are saying,
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.800]   "Works great on my poker phone." Yeah, the fact that 3A does not have that dedicated DSP chip,
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:12.320]   yeah, that the more expensive big brother has. And yet, I was looking at Dieter Bones' review in
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:18.320]   the Verge. He had an early version and his review was off and bar go as soon as they announced it.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.720]   He said, "It's every bit as good. The cameras, every bit as good on the 3A as it is on. It's
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.800]   more expensive." And if they're competing with their own vendors and they're competing based on
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.560]   camera, then that camera turns out not to be hardware exclusive. And Google is Google. It
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:34.400]   makes you wonder why there just isn't a Google camera. Well, I wouldn't be surprised at some
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.240]   point if they do that. In fact, one of the ways Google's handling the problem Android has with
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:44.400]   updates and they double down on it again today is while we're moving more and more of the system
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:50.560]   into the App Store. So whether the manufacturer, the carrier wants you to or not, we can update it
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:55.120]   and you will update it from the App Store. That's big news for people who are stuck on Android 4,
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:01.280]   Android 5, and there's no way to get it updated. To answer Renee's question, I think the
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:10.560]   competitiveness is part of the equation for sure. But I think another part of it is how binary
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:15.600]   the operation of a camera app is. One of the greatest features of the iPhone's camera app will
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:21.600]   always seem to be that without question, if you tap on the camera app icon, it launches in a split
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.920]   second. And every time you tap that round button, you get a picture. If you hold it down, you always
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:32.400]   get a sequence of pictures without delay. And with the, even on a Pixel phone, the Android camera app
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:40.240]   works that way 97% of the time. Every once in a while, you just stand and hold in the bag.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.920]   Well, I guess, I guess, like, like, hey, Guillermo, open my drawing app because I need to drop
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:50.240]   picture of the thing. I guess I'll memorize this right then. So apparently they don't get in the
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:56.640]   memory fast enough or something. So I imagine, I think that part of the problem is releasing it as a
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:01.520]   general app and making sure that people will not have a horrible experience on their phone, even if
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.120]   they were limited to the, to like the top six phones. That's what Apple advantages, they make the
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:11.680]   hardware and the software. Yeah. And even and to be fair to Apple, even when Google does make the
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:17.280]   hardware and the software, it's not always perfect. Yeah. So that's good. And that may be an Android
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.840]   limitation as well. One other thing, as long as we're talking about the phone, I was thrilled to see
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:28.560]   no notch and a headphone jack. Yep. But is that saying that people who can't afford more expensive
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:34.800]   phone don't deserve a notch? I think this whole three, this whole three and that's
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:40.240]   announcement is Google's version of what Apple did with the Mac Pro. We goofed is what they're saying.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:45.200]   Miacalpa. Miacalpa. Because in fact, in their quarterly results, they said there were the pixels
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.560]   did not sell well. They were what they call it headwinds. This is like a pixel, right? Like,
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:53.200]   this is a Google phone that everyone is used to. I think they're expensive. Exactarian. They
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:58.320]   acknowledge we're charging too much. People don't want to notch. And they do want a headphone jack.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:03.840]   And I think, I hope in a way, this is Google's Miacalpa saying, okay, you want that? We'll give you that.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:08.400]   I think I think it's that there are no they they can read the numbers as well as anybody else.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:13.840]   There's not as much money in the Android market, both for apps and for hardware as there is in the
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:19.760]   iOS market, which remember that any Apple product is almost by definition of that logo, a premium
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:26.560]   luxury brand product. So I think they acknowledge that there are people who started to the market
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:31.840]   has started to lose its taste for $800 phones, particularly when there are really great $500
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:37.120]   phones out there. And we want to sell hardware. We want to put devices in people's hands. So we're
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.600]   at least going to add this to the mix. And like one plus is getting huge buzz. There's a lot of
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:47.280]   really good, not too expensive. I think like the rumor was that Google really badly wanted an
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.720]   iPhone. I think we already have an iPhone. There's something that Google can do that's way more
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.360]   interesting than an iPhone. It sounds like they're getting back to that.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.080]   Does that what we're going to talk about the quarterly results in a bit, but this
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:01.600]   Apple's not seeing the same headwinds on the high end expensive phones at Google seem, right?
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:08.160]   I mean, they're down, but they're yeah, I mean, everyone is the other it's not just
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.280]   that the phones are expensive, because there's always going to be people who for many different
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:16.160]   reasons want a premium phone or just want an iPhone. But the phones are so good. It's like what
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.000]   happened to computers a decade ago. There's only certain things you need to do with them.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.480]   And they can all do those things. And so you start to do the math in your head about how often
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:30.960]   do I really need the new version? Right. Yep. As I said before, my daily driver is still a pixel
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:36.880]   version one, because I just every time that there's a brand new phone, I contemplate spending
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:42.800]   $800 for the latest phone, whether it's an iPhone or a pixel three. And then I look at my
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.400]   existing phone, which is working great, and actually doesn't even have a scratch on it.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.800]   And I think there are other things I could do for that $800.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.840]   Wow. And you're not alone, Andy.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.960]   It's exactly what's going on in the in the phone market these days.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:57.440]   The new phones now offer you a couple new features. The new phones then offered you
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.760]   much less pain in certain areas. And that was an easier move.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:06.240]   Let's take a little break. Come back with more. Renee Richie, great to have you from iMore.com.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.400]   He's getting ready for Detective Pikachu day, which begins in 15 minutes.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.280]   Do you still play Pokemon? Go. I can't remember. I do. But I've told you declared Pokemon
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:20.560]   bankruptcy because they were just too like I think someone on Reddit did the math and it would take
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:25.040]   42 minutes just to do the basic stuff every day. And I don't I don't have that kind of time. So I'll
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.880]   do like Community Day. I'll do like the new raids when they come out. I'll do anything special,
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.040]   but I'm not doing like the cupcake factory time management stuff.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:38.400]   Yeah, I used to like that kind of game, the cupcake factory time management. You know,
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:43.120]   the pre get the princess to the woods before they would. But then I lose my time. Like I lose my real
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:47.760]   world time management to the stupid game. Suddenly you realize my god, if I had spent that much time
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:52.320]   learning how to play an instrument, I could drive to Ottawa and back in the time it takes
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:58.320]   for a community daily. What am I doing? Exactly. I read the the news a lot more now that I stopped
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:03.920]   playing Pokemon. Yeah. I don't know if that's a good thing though, Lori Gil. She's managing
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:10.480]   editor at imore.com along with Renee Richie. And of course, from WGBH Boston, it's Andy and not
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:17.840]   co our show today brought to you by our IT department, frankly, I'm looking at you guys,
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:23.360]   you do a great job. If in fact, really every business, it's not not just podcasts, but every
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.760]   business relies on the cloud these days more and more. That's where your data lives. That's
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:35.040]   where your apps live. That's where your customers live. And IT teams are at the center of the revolution.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:40.000]   Staying competitive in an increasingly cloud based world requires IT teams to plan,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:47.600]   to execute faster than ever. Incidents require open agile and smart coordination between teams
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.840]   between ops at the software dev teams. They require communication with the customers,
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:58.880]   the stakeholders, your boss at lassian powers at all, a lassian collaboration software powers,
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:05.760]   IT teams around the world. It all starts with Jira. I've used Jira for a long time. Any agile
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:10.400]   developer knows Jira, but you know, it's not just for programmers, it's not just for developers.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:16.160]   Jira can keep track of all your projects with Jira. We know who's responsible for what stage it's
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:22.560]   at, how it's going. It's really a great way to keep track of what's going on in your IT department.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:28.080]   And then of course, we really rely on Jira's partner confluence because that's where we document
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:34.720]   the changes, the workflow, so that we can communicate better. Atlassian software isn't just for developers.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:39.200]   Atlassian offers an affordable, reliable suite of tools for teams of all sizes,
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:47.840]   from dev ops to agile, IT apps to ops to ITSM and whatever is next. Atlassian provides the technology
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:53.680]   backbone to help modern IT organizations plan, service and support the kind of change it propels
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:59.440]   business. So you got Jira, you got confluence. If you've got a code database, you need Bitbucket.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:04.640]   If you've got operations to manage websites or apps or SaaS solutions, you need ops,
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:11.040]   genie and status page. They help teams better detect incidents, coordinate response issues,
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.040]   resolve issues faster, keep customers and stakeholders updated.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:20.880]   It all integrates seamlessly with Jira and confluence, kind of the hub. That way your
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:26.000]   team doesn't have to bounce around from app to app. Everything you need, every tool you need,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.720]   whatever your current framework is and however you grow is available at Atlassian.com. All the tools

[00:37:53.760 --> 00:38:02.080]   the colors are out. Jason Snell, he says it's just a script. He just runs a script and all the graphs
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:08.240]   are generated. Let's go through it. You, Renee and Laurie, were on the phone call listening last week.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:14.640]   What's the top line, Renee? What is the number that we should be paying attention to?
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:21.280]   You typically forecast for next quarter. They beat the estimates, which is always important,
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.240]   because you always want to do less badly than Wall Street thinks you might.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.760]   That helps the stock price.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:33.040]   That's the weird thing. If we dig down deep into this, Apple for many, many years, for almost a
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.840]   decade made more money than companies that had oligopoly control over fossil fuel resources.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.920]   And Wall Street punished them for it because they thought each time they will never be able to
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:48.400]   repeat it. They did it. Now the iPhone business is going down. It went really far down. Now,
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:52.320]   maybe it's leveling off, but the services story is going up and Wall Street was like,
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:59.280]   "Yay!" They rewarded the stock. Company posted revenue of $58 billion. That's down
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:05.280]   year over year, about 5%. But there are some bright lights. iPad revenue, up 22%. Of course,
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:09.040]   they had new iPads. Services. Although with the Pro, they said that drove that. The
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.400]   US has the newest one. Oh, the newest one.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.080]   It's like frosting on the ProK. Yeah, interesting. Well, I love those, that Pro.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:19.920]   And with the prospects of iOS 13 making it really a Pro device, I can see why people might be interested.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:27.360]   Services revenue, we knew that would go up 16%. Mac revenue, said to say down 5%. I'm not surprised.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.520]   The most interesting thing about that, though, is that Apple is typically really classy about Intel.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:35.840]   They didn't mention Intel's name, but they said that Mac revenue was down because they could not
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.840]   get the chips from a supplier. And that had they been able to get the chips they needed,
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.640]   Mac revenue would have been up. Not everybody is as classy as Apple. Intel's name has been.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.440]   People are shaking their fists at Intel. They're not only can they not do 10 nanometer,
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.600]   they can't supply the 14 nanometer chip that they're supposed to supply in a timely fashion.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:58.240]   And on top of that, they still haven't built in basic things like support for the for larger
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:03.520]   amounts of the faster lower power memory or things like better display port standards.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.920]   So you have to still work around the chips even when you get them.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.200]   Apple said if we'd had the chips, we could have sold many more
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:14.320]   MacBook Airs, right? The demand was high, but they just couldn't fulfill it.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:23.920]   Looking at the revenue on the pie chart, iPhone is a little more than half 54% of total revenue.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.000]   And then I think it's actually fairly well divided up. Services is growing and growing.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.240]   Now one fifth of all happened with revenue, but I think that's a fairly good distribution.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:36.880]   You'd like to see, you know, iPhone continues strong, but you'd like to see services make up some
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:42.080]   of the difference. The revenue is pretty much what you'd expect for a fourth quarter. You could see
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:47.600]   those dips every second quarter, every Q2. You could see those dips.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.840]   And wearables did great again too, both watch and AirPods performed really well for them.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.920]   That's good revenue down a little bit. But again, this is a very cyclic business.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.560]   When you look at charts like that, you can really see the cycles. It's just, you know, exactly what
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.600]   you'd expect. iPad revenue changed the best ever 22% year over year.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:13.280]   Wonder what that says about the iPad market these days where people it's the big 10-pole
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:18.400]   release last year was the iPad Pro, whereas the 10-pole release the year before that was the
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:24.400]   $329 education oriented iPad. So I wonder what that says about what the overall market for iPad
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:30.080]   is. Is it people that really do want to spend $1,000 for something that will allow them to keep
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:35.280]   their laptops at home or home users who want something that throws away everything that's
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:40.960]   that cumbersome about a desktop operating system? Or is it really people who want to get the lower
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.880]   price points who really just want an ancillary product for their computing world?
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:51.120]   Is the, Renee, is the mini or the new Air? Are they in this or no? They came out after.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:55.280]   They are at the very end of the quarter. So they had, forget how many weeks, it was only a couple
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:01.360]   weeks into the quarter. So you won't. So as you said, it's the iPad Pros driving this.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:05.920]   That was a big update trigger for a lot of people with new design comes out. A lot of people make
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:13.680]   that. It helps them. It encourages that decision. Yeah. And it was a substantive update. It feels
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:18.800]   different. It moves differently. So yeah, if you were waiting for a new iPad Pro, this is what
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:24.000]   got you to go. Yeah. I'm glad because the iPad had been kind of moribund for the last few years.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.080]   So I'm glad to see that. Services is exactly as I think on target as Tim Cook probably wanted.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:37.200]   I mean, that is a very steady growth. I don't, you know, what more can you say? This is going to be
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:43.440]   a revenue driver going forward more and more revenue up 16%. It's been up more in other quarters.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.600]   But as you can see, when you look at the graph of revenue quarter by quarter. And this is still
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:53.040]   pre-TV plus pre-apple card pre-apple arcade. Absolutely. That's right. That's right.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:43:02.160]   Wearables home accessories increase of 5.1%. I'm sorry. No, 5.1 billion, my apologies.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:09.120]   In revenue, that's down from last quarter. But highest for Q2 in some time. In fact,
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:14.480]   ever it looks like total Apple revenue also down a little bit. But as you said, they beat the street
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:23.360]   profit, $11.6 billion. A tidy sum, but still. And we have that in 20s and singles.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:30.640]   Yeah. So I don't know, is there anything else to say about this?
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:35.440]   Cook said they buy a new company like once every two weeks, like once a week, every two weeks,
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:39.600]   there's nothing to deal with. Wow. China, he said, is starting to come back. That's going to be very
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:48.080]   important. I worry you were listening. Anything you heard that you thought was important on this call?
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:53.920]   I mean, the numbers that you're talking about are basically the same. I think, for me, the one
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:59.280]   thing that stood out the most was one of the last things that was mentioned was whether or not the
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:06.800]   market in India was going to be difficult for Apple to break into because there's so many
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:13.760]   Android users there. And the response was, well, it's actually good that there's so many people
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.080]   using Android because that just means there's more people for us to get to turn into an
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:25.680]   user. So that's the silver line. And okay. Yeah. Not just that unstated is that if they
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:32.720]   Apple has yet to indicate that they can really compete on anything that's mid-range price or
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:38.240]   lower. But if the entire world is buying phones that are capable of running Apple music, that are
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:43.200]   capable of running Apple TV, that are capable of subscribing to Apple News, that can also be a big
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:48.880]   win for Apple. So they'll take money from anybody. They don't care to see if their blood runs in
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:55.920]   the Apple original logo colors. China stuff was good. And we had, sorry, we have tariffs.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.000]   Yeah, we had the tariff news come out right afterwards and all those gains are going to be
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.800]   clodried. Yeah. Is Apple so in the past, the iPhone has not been subject to those tariffs.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:09.360]   Is this new plan, which is not yet in effect? But would it affect iPhone? It's so ambiguous
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:14.080]   because everything is classified differently. Like in some countries, if it looks like a watch,
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:18.160]   it's a watch, but otherwise it's a computer. And it's hard to tell country by country. But if
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:22.800]   you apply, let's just say you apply a steady 25 to everything, then that changes a lot of stuff.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:29.360]   We really did surprise me that Apple's bought two dozen companies because you don't really hear,
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:34.080]   that's in the last six months, you don't really hear about these. They're not big news. Are they
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:39.840]   smaller companies? Is that why or specific talent and technology acquisitions? And Apple, if you
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.440]   find out about an ask, and they will say Apple from time to time acquires a company, and we don't
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:48.480]   generally dispatch our future plan. Right. Typically, they're like $8 million to $20 million
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:54.720]   acquisitions. So they're not. Yeah, still stunning. Because they're not that big. I would like Apple
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:46:01.680]   to buy my company for $8 million. Thank you very much. You get worried, if you're listening,
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:07.120]   I'll underbid her by $80. Oh, let's get a bidding war going.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:15.360]   I'm a freelance journalist. I will take canned and dented food within his non-perishable date.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:22.080]   So Tim was at the Berkshire Hathaway meeting when he gave this interview to CNBC. I'm not sure.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:27.440]   He did a lot of interviews over the last year. Yeah. But still, that's kind of an amazing
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:34.720]   statistic. If we have money left over says Cook, we look to see what else we can do. We acquire
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:40.400]   everything we need that can fit and has a strategic purpose to it. Well, I mean, M and A moved under
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:43.600]   Tim Cook out from Luca Maestream. People were assuming that that meant that Apple was going to
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:49.040]   finally target Tesla and Netflix and Disney and all the giant purchases of their of their
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:52.960]   pundit dreams. And I think this was Cook just saying, no, we do this all the time. This was a
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.880]   change in reporting structure because we want to stay dynamic. Please don't, please don't read too
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:03.760]   much. Yeah, I got schooled. I can't remember who schooled me if it was Horace Dettio or maybe
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:10.320]   John O'Egasse or perhaps it was from Neil Seibart. But I think it was Neil Seibart who's
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:16.960]   explained acquisitions. Big acquisitions are tough. You have the culture clash. You have to merge
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:22.800]   these two big behemoths together. Little acquisitions make a lot of sense for intellectual property,
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:29.200]   for engineers. They're useful. Strategically, a lot easier to assimilate into the company.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:35.680]   They're still integrating beats. I was a big one in 2014. I think beats, you know, they still have a
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:39.840]   lot of beats people in Los Angeles and they still have a lot of offices. Well, they have the power
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:45.680]   beats. And go ahead. I'm sorry, Lori. When these large companies are just buying up a bunch of
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:53.280]   small companies, is this beneficial to creative development or does it stifle it? Because
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:58.880]   on the one hand, I see it as being good for creative development because the end goal would be that
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:03.280]   somebody like Apple or Google or Amazon or somebody like that would buy you out. So that
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:08.000]   means you did a great job of creating and innovating. But on the other hand, if the end result is
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.640]   that somebody's just going to buy you out anyway, how far are you going to grow creatively?
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:18.160]   Yeah, no, that's an excellent, excellent point. There's there's, I really do think that there's
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:25.360]   a brain drain that happens as these small companies get bought and subsublimed into Google and Facebook
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:29.760]   and Apple and all these other companies before they can become the next Apple, before they can
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:37.920]   become the next Instagram or Facebook. It's it's going to be difficult to see if that's good for the
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:42.800]   industry or bad because we need we need pirates. We need mutants. We need people who are like,
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:48.640]   yeah, so is anybody ever going to be the next Apple or is Apple just going to buy them up
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.840]   before they get the opportunity to do that? And if that's the case, are they
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:59.680]   like Google never sold to Facebook never sold to Google Google never sold to Yahoo and Snap refused
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:05.360]   to sell to Facebook or Google. So some of them keep going. Yeah, but that was eons ago that was
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:10.080]   like the early 2000s is could be like a hundred years ago. It's like it's like a steam based
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:14.480]   economy back there. Really? It was the Guild of Age.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:25.520]   So you, Renee and you Lori have power beats. Power beats pro. Make sure you say that right.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:29.040]   The new ones. There's a lot of different things called power beats. So you got to make sure you
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:32.640]   use the right. I'm not hip with the kids as you know, I don't really know much about it. You got
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:38.640]   to find a flex your power beats. So the power beats pro or the ones that basically are
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:41.200]   beats versions of the AirPods, right?
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:48.160]   Yes, in terms of software. Yeah. Yeah. They have a little charging case. They do have an over
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:54.400]   the ear hook. So who should I start with? Should I start with you, Lori? What do you think?
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:58.640]   She's the expert. Yeah, start with me. Start with you. Turn it 50 bucks. That's one thing.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.320]   Well, yeah. So just from the time I got them yesterday morning, I think at 8.30 in the morning
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:10.560]   popped them in my ears immediately and spent seven hours with them in my ears. I took them out
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:15.920]   for about 20 minutes to charge them up again. But they were in my ears all the rest of the day.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:23.520]   So I have a little bit of experience already in their quality. And I can say that in terms of
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:31.120]   how well they work, whether or not they're the great top of the line quality.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:36.640]   For that extra $100, you're paying for the Beats brand. So if you're talking about
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:40.880]   AirPods versus PowerBeats Pro, you're paying for the brand power.
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:47.760]   And the Beats waveform, right? I mean, because they sound really good bass heavy sound.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:52.160]   Yes. So then I, of course, had to experiment with a bunch of different music. And thank you
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:56.720]   to everyone on Twitter who suggested songs to me because that gave me the ability to really
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.880]   expand outside of what I would have. What did you ask? You say, what's a good song to listen to
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:05.520]   on Beats headphones? I said, what do you want me to test with it? And so a bunch of people,
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:09.440]   I even had somebody recommend their own personal band, which I thought was pretty cute, which,
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.080]   sorry, I haven't listened to yet. I had a really long list to go through.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:17.680]   How is voice? That's always what I'm interested in as a podcaster and radio.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:22.320]   Well, so I haven't done any phone conversations with it yet, actually speaking on the phone with
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:26.640]   anybody yet. But I've been using this for like right now, I'm using it. And it sounds exactly
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:32.320]   the same way it does when I'm using my Bose in ear headphones with a wired chord.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.760]   So I don't sound all bassy and boom, boom.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:39.440]   You sound exactly like Draleo. Everybody sounds exactly like Draleo.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:44.640]   Well, that sounds all right. No, no, and see, that's what I thought was so interesting.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:49.600]   I tested a bunch of different music before I went into the hip hop genre. And everything
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:55.200]   sounded great and well balanced and was full and rich. And I even said it reminded me of the first
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:52:01.840]   time I listened to a home pod in that it was just full and rich sounding. It wasn't off balance.
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:06.960]   But then I switched over and listened to some hip hop music. And it was like I was standing next
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:12.160]   to a car with the windows rolled down and the big little person in the back was just
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:19.200]   boom, boom, it must be that like there's a just a notch at 100 Hertz or something where they just
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:27.680]   boom. Yes. But so if you of course this I'm just kind of jumping in with my assumptions here. And I
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:33.280]   don't know for sure. But coming from never having owned a pair of beats headphones, I can say that
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:38.800]   if you're worried that you rock and roll or you're heavy metal or your opera music is going to sound
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:44.000]   bad because it's bass heavy. That's not the case with these headphones with the Powerbeats Pro.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.680]   It gets bass heavy when it's intended to be bass heavy music. So if you're listening to hip hop
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:55.120]   music, you want to feel that beat. You want it to be really bass heavy. It doesn't affect things
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:53:00.320]   from what I can tell when you're listening to other kinds of music. And I purposefully always test
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:06.400]   my headphones with music I'm really familiar with so that I can really pay attention to whether or
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:10.800]   not it's messing with the sound of my favorite songs or with songs that I know really really well.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:16.640]   And I didn't see it negatively affecting or over overdoing it in the bass on any of those songs.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:21.520]   It's only when I switched it over to hip hop music that has already bass heavy music in it
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:28.720]   that I started noticing it. And interestingly, a lot of the older hip hop bands from way back
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:34.560]   in the day like Biggie Smalls and Nas and stuff like that, it wasn't bass heavy on those. It was
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:39.280]   bass heavy on more current music like Lil Yachty or something like that. So I thought that was
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:45.360]   interesting too that even the older hip hop wasn't reverberating with that super heavy bass beat
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:51.520]   that I was hearing in some of the newer stuff. This is from Goldenears.net. But this is a review
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:59.440]   of earlier 2013 era beats headphones. But this is the comparison of a flat curve. That's the blue
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:04.400]   line and the beats curve, which is the green line. And as I suspected, it's around about
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:11.200]   between 100 and 200. Maybe the peak is at 150 hertz there that you get a boost. And then
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:15.200]   there's a little drop. Now, I don't know if the power beats are like this. I'd love to see somebody
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:21.760]   do this. There's a 5 dB down at 500 hertz. And the rest of it is almost identical. So it's,
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:27.440]   if you were going to say this is the classic beats curve, this is the beats by Dre, it would be,
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:32.160]   you know, this in the bass area. And you're right, it's such a narrow notch, it probably wouldn't
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:36.800]   affect most music. And only music that's mixed with those particular frequencies in mind.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:42.560]   That's a really great note, Laurie, because I do, every time I've tried beats headphones,
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:47.440]   it just muddles everything. And I've always thought that it's, yeah, and the idea that if
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:52.880]   it's indeed selective, that it only really brings the, brings the pain when you've got to track
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:56.480]   this design to bring the pain on the bass line. That's actually quite good.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:03.600]   Yeah, I listened to prehistoric hip hop like Grandmaster Flash and that was
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.160]   all in that cell.
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:04.640]   Well, Jay.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:11.600]   My reference is the biography of Mr. Chuck from Public Enemy. And that was really, really good.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:16.880]   And I did do a bunch of calls and I called Georgia when she was on her way to work this morning.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.360]   And she said, what's that whistling? And I go, what whistling? She goes, oh, that's the birds
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.720]   outside. So she could hear the birds while I was talking to her. She could hear me
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:27.200]   but I don't know if she should have been hearing the birds. I think that that's the kind of stuff
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:31.840]   that you could cancel out. So I don't know if, I don't know exactly how well the call
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:36.320]   cancellation is. I have to do some other calls, obviously with birds around to see if I can find
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:42.320]   a bass line for bird chirpiness on my headphones. It sounds like it would be fair to say that
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:49.680]   this is the, these are the AirPods for Beats fans. So if you know you're, if you like the Beats sound
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:55.360]   and you're a Beats fan and you want the features of the AirPods, this would be the sensible choice.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:59.520]   One added thing is that the AirPods just don't fit all the time. And so like for me,
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:04.720]   I like the left one is fine. The right one's a little loose. So I can't do like
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:09.280]   copa era or like acrobatics or anything. But with these, they're just, they're on my ear. So if I
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:13.120]   wanted to do anything super active, even if I liked AirPods, I'd go with these instead.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:16.880]   There are lots of other headphone choices, not AirPods but Bluetooth wireless.
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:20.080]   I love the convenience. Like that's the thing people are like, at least so expensive for what
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:24.240]   they sound like. But the price has never been about the sound. It's been about that H1 chip
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:28.560]   and those accelerometers and those other sensors in there. That's the miniaturized
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:33.360]   expensive technology. So once you get like, like Lori had it in her review, like no strings to hold
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:38.000]   me down. Once you go all electron about it, it's really hard to go back. And then you, but then
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.080]   you're like, ah, but it's falling out. So this, this, if you love that, they're both absolutely
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:46.480]   independent. You can wear one or both and it doesn't matter. Total freedom. You can get up,
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:51.280]   walk around, no strings at all. Plus they'll stay on your ears, even if you do backflips.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.400]   It's like the whole. >> And that's the hook you think that's because of the hook over the ear
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:59.680]   hook? >> Yeah, yeah. >> Well, it's also, yes, it's the hook, but it's also the way the bud itself
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:05.600]   presses into your ear. It goes deeper into your ear canal than AirPods, which for somebody like me,
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.960]   that's a good thing that AirPods don't go that deep in your ear because it's very painful.
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:15.840]   But this uses the silicon sort of super soft cushiony padding. So it can go deeper into your
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:21.200]   ear, which means it's anchored better into your ear too. So even if I had removed the hook entirely
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:27.680]   from these things, it would still stay in a lot better than AirPods would, though it would fall out
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:32.640]   with a lot of use, but it would certainly stay in better than AirPods because of the silicon tip
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:36.800]   that's in there, kind of deeper into your ear canal. >> I don't know why I seem to connect,
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:42.800]   collect these things. My preferred wired headphones would be the air, the edomotics. Yes, I do know
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:48.160]   why. But I use, these are the Jabra Elite and the Jabra Sport Elite, and they have very similar,
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:51.600]   they don't have the over the ear thing, but they have the very similar, and you fit these, by the
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:55.120]   way. Do the powerbeats give you a variety of tips or there's only one? >> Yes, they get you
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:58.800]   for different times. >> Okay, check in Nugget versus Junior Burger Leo. Check in Nugget versus Junior
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:04.080]   Burger Leo. >> Yeah, that's, oh yeah, you got a few though, yeah. That's a slider. That's what
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:07.280]   you want because you want to find a tip that fits your ear. Everybody's ear is a little bit
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:11.840]   different. The Jabra's I think come with six or seven different, what a few different. >> Which
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:16.720]   are you using, Laurie? Which tip do you settle on? >> I use the very smallest one, so they come with
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:21.520]   the default. >> In the middle, right? >> It's like mediums. >> Yeah. >> It comes with the
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:28.320]   medium to high mediums. So there's the medium to big, the medium to small, and the small,
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:33.600]   to put it that way. And I actually put them in my ears for three hours with the default ones,
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:39.760]   the medium to big. And it didn't hurt at all. And then I pulled them out of my ears, and I felt
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:44.800]   like I had just ripped the inside of my ear out. >> Oh, dear. >> Because I didn't realize it was
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.480]   putting all this pressure on my ear until I removed it. So I immediately switched over to
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:55.280]   the very smallest size. And that it's been, like I said, I had, so of the seven hours,
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:59.680]   three of them, it was with the larger size, and then it hurt when I pulled them out.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:02.400]   And for the rest of the four hours, it was with the smallest size ones.
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:06.560]   >> Yeah, my wife's ears are very small. No, nothing will fit. She can't wear the earpods.
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:10.480]   They just fall out because they're too big. She likes our sponsor, The Trek's Airs.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:14.000]   I do too, because they don't even go in the ear. And so they're the most
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:14.480]   comfy. >> Oh, yeah.
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.760]   >> I could wear those all day. >> There's rumors that Apple, I mean,
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.800]   it says, "Made the over the ear, and the rumors Apple are going to do the over the ears too."
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:24.160]   And that's a good solution for people who just can't or don't want anything in their ear.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:28.480]   >> Yeah. And of course, as a DJ, I wore it over the ear headphones for years.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:31.280]   >> Did you hold the one Cam Leal and the other one just fall off?
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:40.080]   >> Not that kind of DJ. A radio talk show host. But yeah, so I like the over the ear,
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:44.400]   because those are the most comfortable. You can wear those all day.
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:48.560]   >> I actually ended up having a problem with some over the ear headphones because they're
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:51.680]   always a little bit too big for me. And so they pressure on my jaw.
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:52.880]   >> Oh, yeah. >> And then that's the thing.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:56.480]   >> You got to get them sized so they neither press on your ear nor any other part of you.
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:02.320]   >> Right. Yeah. Head phones aren't usually made with tiny heads in mind.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:05.920]   >> They're very personal. Well, now we know because we look like you have a normal head on
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:11.360]   screen, but we've enlarged it. >> I'm using a screen stretch.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:19.600]   >> That's the truth is that. Did you guys test out these with non- iPhones and just like as a
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:24.960]   regular Bluetooth headset? >> Right now I'm using with a Mac. I haven't tried it with anything that's
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:29.440]   not an Apple product right now. Again, we just got these yesterday. So we're still working on all
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:34.480]   the other things to test them. Let me say this because Renee, maybe you already knew this, but
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:42.720]   the Powerbeats Pro and the AirPods 2 use the H1 chip, which has the voice activated Siri.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:50.240]   You do not have to be the person calling out to Siri to stop music or play music or fast.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:58.400]   So my significant other, while I've got these in my ears, he can tell Siri to stop playing music.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.880]   >> Oh, that's not good. >> Well, maybe that is good.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.400]   >> I just discovered that. >> Good for parents.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.280]   >> I mean, Laurie, I'm trying to talk to you.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.920]   >> Yeah, you can do that, but do you want that? Maybe I don't want to listen to my
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:14.720]   voice. >> Why do you think I'm wearing headphones, buster?
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:20.880]   >> I mean, they do mention specifically, Andy, because if you don't like the voice
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.880]   activated, or if you're using non-Siri, you can press and hold the Beats button,
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:28.560]   and that will trigger the assistant of your choice on Android. And also, it'll do the
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.320]   independent both sides have controls. All that stuff, they say, works great with Android.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:35.760]   So it's just the instant pairing and switching between devices that you lose out on.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:41.600]   >> Yeah. That's really cool. But I will say that my disconnect with headphones is that I can
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:50.800]   spend up to $100 before I start to wonder why I'm spending more than $100 on convenient headphones.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:58.000]   Like, I can tell the difference between these really, the stock Sony, like $100 studio headphones,
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.800]   and occasionally I'll be sent like a $400 pair to try out. And yes, I can definitely hear the
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:07.360]   difference. And yes, if I really did a lot of headphone listening, I might make that buy.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:12.960]   I have a hard time often trying to figure out, well, why would I spend $200 on a pair of earbuds?
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.160]   And do you have any thoughts, I know it's only been a day, but do you have any thoughts about
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:22.560]   what makes the price worth it? >> I think that the sound quality of these are incredible.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:28.480]   I've tasted a lot of different headphones. And when it comes to earbuds, not as many,
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:33.440]   but this is absolutely the best sound quality. I've heard from earbuds for in-ear headphones,
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:39.360]   not over the ear headphones. So they've clearly done a lot of work to really get a good full
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:43.280]   robust, thick sound. Here's an example. I was listening to the first song that I played as
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.480]   soon as I put these headphones on was- >> Sick, bro.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:51.440]   >> The first album. No, that would be so- >> Why would you listen to your own music first?
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.880]   You know what it's supposed to sound like? >> I don't know who that lead singer is,
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:59.040]   but her vocal dynamics is thrilling. I can't even pay attention to the sound quality.
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:04.800]   >> So I listened to Lincoln by the May I Be As Giants, and I have been listening to-
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.600]   >> You are a nerd. >> You are a nerd.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.160]   >> I've been a hundred times in my lifetime.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.840]   >> We're trying to get them because they have a new album. We're trying to get them on the
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:17.440]   triangulation. >> Let me come along with that one. That would be so cool.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.000]   >> You know what? >> The new album just came out two days ago.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.600]   >> Deal. If we get them, if we can get John and John, we have John, John and Laurie.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:31.520]   >> That would be so cool. >> The only thing I want to add is that I don't
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.080]   know the answer to this, but I have a feeling that Beats Now has-
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:39.360]   Apple has built this incredible acoustic lab in Cupertino, and I went in there with a bunch of
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:44.000]   audio analysts for the HomePod tour. And they're like, we've been in these things all over the
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.400]   world, and this is by far the biggest one of the youth we've ever been in. And if all the Beats
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:53.680]   engineers now have access to that technology, that in itself would be elevating in terms of what
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:00.240]   they could produce. >> And Renee, that's why I pointed out that it felt to me the same experience I had
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:04.560]   when I listened to music through a HomePod for the first time, which obviously I'm not trying to
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:11.520]   say that these are as sound quality as a HomePod, but it was immediately- I was taken aback by how
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:18.800]   clear and bright and robust the music was. So this idea of the sound lab that Beats has access to,
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:23.600]   so that they can really perfect the equalization of the balance of music, I believe that that
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:29.280]   is what's happening, because I'm very impressed with the sound quality of these things, more than
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:35.040]   I've ever been with any pair of headphones. >> My thing is the opposite, I'm the opposite of
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:38.320]   a Golden Years, and I said in my review, I'm a full Golden Years, because I really can't tell
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.160]   that much about sound. >> It also sounds good for me.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:45.680]   >> No, I used to listen to Mac Break Weekly on the speaker of my iPhone 3GS, you know, like,
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.920]   it was fine for me. >> You said it.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:53.120]   >> I know, but like, so for me, the whole value prop here is the convenience. Like, you have this
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:56.800]   little case, you pop it open, you put it in your ear, there's no wire, nothing pulling on you,
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:01.440]   nothing pulling on them, you go out, you walk, you run, you bicycle, you listen to stuff, you take
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:06.880]   it out, it stops, you put it in, it goes, you just say things and it happens, and that to me is
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:12.160]   well worth my money, because it feels like we're a long way away from it, but it feels like this
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:16.560]   is the first ear computer. Like, computers went from our desks to our laps, to our hands, to our
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:20.160]   pockets, to our wrists, and now they're starting to go in our ears. And when you start factoring in,
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:24.800]   like audio AR, and all the other stuff that's coming, and as the watch does more of the phone
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.120]   stuff, it feels like AirPods and now anything with an H1 chip will start doing more of what the
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:34.400]   watch did eventually, and to me that's super like, hella exciting. I love it so much.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.680]   >> That's cool. It's great.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:42.640]   >> Here's one last abstract question. Like, when Apple bought Beats, I thought that was really
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:49.520]   weird purchase because I don't, I didn't associate Beats headphones with the sort of quality and
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:56.000]   build quality and audio and really nitpicking us to detail that Apple associated with. And I
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.560]   started wondering if Apple does continue to make headphones. Will there be like a Beats line,
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:06.720]   which is sort of like the subway wearer, the sort of street wearer company? And then if they make
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:10.800]   a set of headphones, that's really, really good that everyone would like they would put the Apple
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:15.760]   logo on it. So I'm, it's, that was an interesting development for me that they made a great pair of
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:22.400]   headphones. >> Yeah, I think the difference is actually in the design comes way looks.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:30.160]   The AirPods are certainly better designed. The way they look, the way they fit, the way
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:37.040]   not the way they fit, but the way they feel the container they come in, the design is much better.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:45.120]   But the Beats line has their own separate design, which frankly isn't as high quality of a design,
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:48.720]   but is a much, much higher quality of an audio experience.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:55.200]   >> Great. Do they support, they support Bluetooth 5, do they support App Decks?
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:01.520]   >> I don't know. I don't know what they do on Android because Apple is using their own special
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:05.680]   software. >> Apple doesn't have App Decks. >> Okay, so I don't know what they mentioned.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:09.520]   >> Okay. >> But I think like the rumor is that Apple's going to make their own over the ear,
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.360]   like head cans, ProPods. I don't know what they're going to call AirPods.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:17.360]   >> AirPods. >> And that means the Beatlines will be the Beats line, but there'll be an Apple line as
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:20.880]   well. And I think the Apple line will always be the premium line or not the premium line.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.800]   It'll be like you get as many choices as you want as long as they're white, and then Beats will be
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.480]   like where they experiment with. >> Yeah.
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:30.880]   >> Like more colors, more styles, more designs. >> It doesn't feel like a natural thing that at
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.960]   some point that will put the Siri name on a pair of headphones to say not that it doesn't.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:39.520]   >> It wasn't so damaged. >> It might say with Siri. You see a lot of devices.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.600]   >> It might be a lot of devices. >> You see a lot of devices like with Echo.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:45.440]   >> No, but I think that they use HomeKit, which I think is a terrible name, and they should use
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:49.920]   Apple Home instead. But I think they don't use works with Siri because they would be an obvious
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:56.640]   joke right after that. And I think they really have years. And because Siri is still Assistant Zero,
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:00.000]   they can always put something in the onboarding procedure to reintroduce it to you.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.840]   But it's got to have like two years of rehabilitation before I'd use Siri in any branding.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:10.800]   I think you said just the way it is. >> So Mark Gurman in Bloomberg, along with Matthew Townsend,
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:18.640]   how the Apple Store lost its luster. We've talked a little bit about troubles at the Apple Store.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:27.680]   This blames Angela Arance and a shift. In interviews, and this is a quote from the article,
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:32.800]   interviews current and former Apple employees blame a combination of factors. They say the stores
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:40.080]   have become mostly an exercise in branding and no longer do a good job serving shoppers.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:45.200]   The quality of staff has slipped during an 18-year expansion that seen Apple or opened more than
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:51.200]   500 locations, higher 70,000 people. The genius bar has largely been replaced with staff who
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:58.080]   roamed the stores and are harder to track down. And maybe this was under Arance.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:04.560]   So first, do you accept the-- >> I don't know how accurate that is because
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:09.840]   there are definitely problems in the Apple stores. I think the branding isn't really
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:14.160]   what it was, is that Apple had this idea in their mind to change them from simple,
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:19.440]   not simple, but from retail locations to these educational community mecha's.
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:24.640]   And that may or may not be a good idea, but that it is an idea that fundamentally changes the
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:30.960]   balance of the store when you have creative pros now, not just technical pros. The geniuses
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.400]   didn't change. The geniuses are all still there. They're not behind a bar. They're at a table,
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.720]   but they didn't move. And the geniuses certainly aren't roaming around there. They're fixed in
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:43.200]   one place, but there are other people who are roaming around. They never had cash registers,
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:47.200]   so they don't have them now. So I think a lot of this is misplaced anger. I think
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:52.960]   the biggest thing though is the scaling. When the Apple store started, they had max and they had
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:58.640]   iPods to deal with. And that was it. And they had very few locations, and they had very few staff,
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:02.640]   and they could really focus on a lot of that stuff. And now they have an incredible range
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:07.360]   of products, multiple generations of each product. And they're in so many locations
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.840]   that they're having to do things like hub systems, which are terrible for a person, but are very
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:16.960]   good for moving vast amounts of things around. So not everything gets repaired in store. Some of
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:21.680]   it goes to the regional hub to get prepared, because that's cost effective, even if it's not
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:26.000]   time effective for the customer in there. And these are all absolutely problems. But
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.560]   I think it's hard to, the direction wasn't just Angela. That was a company direction.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:35.600]   And Ron Johnson never had to deal with the amount of products or the amount of stores that Angela
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:41.040]   had to. German writes, one of Angela Aaron's first moves was to turn the stores into town squares,
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:46.960]   where shoppers could hang out in industry parlance, spend time with the brand. Lines at the genius
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:51.840]   bar would have spoiled the effect. So stores started replacing the beloved customer service
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:58.160]   counters with genius groves, tables, and roaming geniuses. Check out counters also disappeared in
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:03.120]   favor of salespeople armed with mobile devices. The goal was to make Apple stores more like luxury
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:09.440]   showrooms, pushing off stage the unseemly business of checking out and fielding complaints. Meanwhile,
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.840]   Aaron's began moving sales and service onto the web, encouraging staff to tell customers
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:19.920]   get in line online. Customers were told to make an appointment on Apple's website and then pick
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:25.520]   up the product of the store. You could say it was just to try to streamline things to speed things up,
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:31.280]   but German's to scale them to scale them. But German's saying, well, it was also focused on
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:38.960]   making a brand impression over serving customers. She cared so much. There are a lot of people
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:42.160]   who like Angela, a lot of people who did not like Angela, but she cared incredibly about the
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.920]   customer experience, like to the extent that she obliterated the lineups, which were great
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:49.200]   marketing for Apple, because she thought they were terrible customers. It's not a good experience
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:54.800]   for customers. Yeah. And by the way, Apple's not the only place to do that. You go into an AT&T store
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:59.360]   these days or a Comcast store these days. It's exactly the same experience where you meet a
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:05.440]   greeter who then adds your name to a list so that there aren't lines you can browse around and be
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:08.960]   called on. I would like Disney lines. Like put lines in, but make them an event. Like when you're
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:13.200]   lining up for the Indiana Jones ride, you know, make it part of the experience. She also killed
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:17.520]   something that we really liked and I recommend it all the time, the one-on-one training sessions,
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:22.640]   replacing them with free group sessions. Those were 99 bucks a year with free group sessions,
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:27.360]   but I know a lot of people, especially seniors who really valued the one-on-one and really got
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.480]   something out of it and who do not find the group sessions at all useful.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:35.200]   My mom did the one-on-one. She really liked them. But again, that was that
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:39.360]   true, hard to scale as they introduced really popular products. The groups are really good.
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:43.760]   I've sat in on quite a few of them and they're like, you can get the WWDC prototyping. I know
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:48.000]   that appeals to a very small amount of people, but that prototyping course from WWDC is one of the
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.160]   most profound things. If you ever want to design a nap that you can sit in on and now you can sit
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:56.720]   on it at most major Apple stores. And that's kind of incredible. And they do have like photo walks.
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.320]   And there's a lot of really good courses there for people who do want to just go there. And
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.280]   even if you have an Android phone, just go on and take them for free.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:07.360]   During the Johnson era, Ron Johnson, of course, who left to go to Penny's sales associates,
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:12.160]   got three weeks to a month of training. Now they get about a week. If they're joining an existing
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:18.480]   store, geniuses who earn $22 an hour on average were trained at Apple's Cupertino in California
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:23.280]   headquarters. Now they're mostly trained in store. Andy, do you agree with Mark's contention that
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:27.200]   the expertise of the staff has gone down at Apple stores?
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:34.800]   I wouldn't say so, because usually the complaints or the problems that people bring in their
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:39.680]   devices with are usually fairly consistent. So it's very, very easy to train most, or if not all,
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:45.120]   of their staff to deal with 90% of the problems. And I have found at least that there is always
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:53.040]   sometimes they might escalate a problem to, let's get Janine. Janine knows all about sync problems.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.720]   And we'll have the people who have the more in depth knowledge. But I think the bigger problem is
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:06.000]   that it's, there are more, the worst of Apple store experiences has become lower. I don't necessarily
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.600]   think that there have been more bad Apple experiences, just that when you hear a horror story,
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:18.880]   it's bad. And that never used to really happen. I will say that I eat the german in the, I think
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:24.240]   in the post makes a point about how undifferentiated the store is that you don't know where necessarily
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:29.200]   where to go. It's not like it's not like an old fashioned store where there's like these plastic
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.560]   signs hanging from the ceiling that here's where the underpants are, here's where the,
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:37.360]   here's where the groceries are. I got to say that one of the subtle but brilliant things about
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:42.720]   how an Apple store is laid out is that the user interface is always human. There's,
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:46.560]   you don't walk in and then try to figure out where, oh, there's the, there's the sign saying
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:50.800]   where the iPhone cases are. I pick one up and now where's the sign that says where the checkout is.
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:54.800]   I go there, wait in line and get, then get processed through. You are met at the door by
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.520]   someone who asks you what you want and then they will tell you and show you exactly where to go.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:05.200]   And then you actually go to a human being who will stand up with a device focusing solely on
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:10.560]   you without a counter between you. That's, I do think that's a subtle amount of a brain hack
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:15.760]   that Apple is doing to underscore the humanity and the empathy of the entire brand.
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.280]   So I do think that the article points out some things that Apple still needs to work on,
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.080]   but I don't think it's anywhere near a crisis point.
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:27.520]   Historically, Apple stores have been incredibly profitable as recently as two years ago,
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:32.160]   $5,500 in sales per square foot, making it more profitable than Tiffany.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:38.240]   The most profitable retail experience anywhere of late. Lori, did they mention anything in the
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:43.120]   quarterly results about retail? It seems like they're not touting that like they used to.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:49.760]   Yeah, you know, that's true that they will oftentimes tell you about new stores that they've just opened
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:56.240]   up and how well the stores are doing. And I don't remember hearing anything about that called out
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:05.360]   specifically in the quarterly earnings. But to this particular article, I think Renee really put a
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:12.000]   pin in that really easy, which is that it's the scale. It's that it scaled up so much in the last
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.920]   few years that the experience has, it's just grown a lot and there's more to do.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:23.840]   Not just in how many stores they have or what they offer, but how many people go into that store.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:31.520]   And 15 years ago, you know, as Apple nerds would go into an Apple store and we knew what to expect.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:34.880]   We knew what we were supposed to be looking for and who we were supposed to be talking to
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:40.400]   and how we should go about getting that. But somebody who's brand new to the Apple ecosystem,
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:45.920]   maybe they only have an iPhone, maybe they only have an iPad if they walk into that experience.
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:51.600]   That's not a familiar experience. And even that first step through the front door where
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:56.320]   Andy, what you were saying is somebody greets you and tells you where to go or what to do next
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:01.120]   or they help you. If you walk into a store where that greeter is having a bad day,
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:06.400]   or if they're extra busy that day and they don't notice you, you are completely lost in that store
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:10.240]   and don't know what to do next. If you're new to this experience and I think that's fine.
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:14.640]   The store is very now a lot more based on if you have a great manager, it's the best
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:17.280]   store in the world. If you have a bad manager, it's a terrible experience.
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:23.520]   Another problem is that Apple faces is the simple fact that most mall stores are designed to be
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:28.160]   very, very deep as opposed to wide. And the problem with having a deep, deep store is that you can't
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:32.320]   really just stand and look around and see what you got, what you, where everything is. You really
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:37.840]   do have to walk and explore. And given how busy almost every Apple store is at any time where
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:43.280]   people are not at work, you're again, you're really going to have to hunt. It's almost like
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:48.240]   being at a flea market. Well, I have to say that the Grand Central Station store is really a
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:52.880]   template in a way. It is kind of like a big train station. It's like a flea market on when you walk
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:58.400]   into an Apple store. There aren't any signposts. It's not, there's no aisles. It's not easy to say,
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:04.000]   oh, I'm going here. I'm going here. That's by design. I don't know if it's a bad experience or not.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:10.400]   The new chief of Apple retail, Deid Row Brian, is still in charge of people. She was in charge of
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:16.400]   HR. We'll open her first store in three days at the Carnegie Library in Washington, D.C.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:23.360]   So we'll take a look at that. My most of my experience, I have three Apple stores near me,
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:28.080]   two mall stores, and then of course, the beautiful San Francisco Union Square store.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:31.440]   And they are, you're right, Andy, completely different experiences.
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:40.880]   I have to say that the Carnegie store is in D.C. really made me feel very, very happy and very,
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:46.640]   very pleased with what Apple is doing. This is really a beautiful historic building designed by
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:52.080]   McKim, Mead and White, which was if you were designing a palace, either a public or private
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:57.280]   palace in the late 1800s, early 20th century, this is the firm that you wanted to get.
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:04.320]   And although kind of like your by default, your first, oh God, a corporation has just bought
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:10.480]   up this old building and they're going to turn into a Starbucks, Apple spent a lot of money just
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:15.840]   on the preserving the facade of the place. And this is a place that was unrentable, really, for
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:21.040]   years and years and years and these places, they fall into disrepair because they need maintenance
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:26.800]   and they need love. And it wasn't turned into condos. It's still a public space in the sense that,
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:32.000]   yes, it's leased by Apple, it's an Apple store, but anybody can walk in at any time and sit down
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:38.080]   somewhere and use the Wi-Fi. So they're taking this building that would be in danger of being
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:43.600]   stripped of its original purpose and at least turning it into something that is stable, that's
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:47.040]   going to have another life for the next 10 years, and it's still going to be a place where people
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:52.400]   can walk in and enter as opposed to being turned into a really expensive restaurant that you can't
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:58.720]   even get reservations for. This is a beautiful building. I have some images here from... I mean,
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:02.400]   if you don't care about the retail experience and you just love architecture, some of the buildings
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:07.200]   that they've put up around the world are just breathtaking. Yeah, yeah. This looks very much like
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:11.600]   a regular Apple store, but you see the building that it's in the Carnegie Library, which is a classic,
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:16.480]   you know, kind of Washingtonian building. That should be a very nice place for you.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:23.200]   It's super impressive. The fact that they could build a design and design a store for downtown
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:29.920]   Chicago that would compete with a compete with Chicago architecture, but also be right on front
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:37.200]   with the one city that still has architecture critics on the newspaper staff, that showed how
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:42.720]   confident they were that they can bring it. Hey, is the fifth Avenue store reopened yet or is it
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:46.880]   still under construction? Does anybody know? I think it's still under construction and I
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:53.360]   expect to be a long revamp. I heard that they have bed bugs. There was a news item
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:59.040]   that there was like in the former FAO shorts that they're temporarily in next right next door
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:04.720]   that they found they're having a bed bug problem. Oh, dear. That's very bad news.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:12.320]   Visit us at our temporary location. Don't get your headphones here. Yeah, it's still not open.
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:22.240]   If you're in the DC area May 11th, 10 a.m. Apple Carnegie Library opens. And you mentioned,
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:29.440]   we were talking about the headphones. And what was it you mentioned? I can't remember, but it
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:36.640]   reminded me of the New York Times. Great piece on the on the Joe Co. Cruises. You know, we love
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:40.160]   John. No, this is not it, by the way. This is the creep. Let me show you this because this is the
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:45.040]   creepiest picture I've ever seen. Oh, this is Kim Kardashian West. This is last night at the
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:52.800]   Met Gala Kim Kardashian West Kendall Jenner Jared Leto's head and Jeff Bezos. Now before
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:57.280]   the chair, let's get excited. No, well, it was part of his car. I get excited. He's still alive.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:03.040]   It's just a prop. He has not received karmic rep distribution for 70% of his film.
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:08.320]   Extremely get that to her in a day. Same day. We have the head extremely disturbing, but that
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:14.080]   I was on my way to the Joe Co. Cruise article. Great article about the Jonathan Colton cruise.
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:20.880]   Have any of you ever gone on that? No, but this I've come close when friends are going and have
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:26.480]   asked, Hey, you want to join us? And I always walk like at the price and at the week that happens.
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:31.120]   But now after this, particularly after reading this article, I'm really kind of keen on going
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:38.160]   next year or the year after. My my my fear has been like, as a nerd, I have often spent a day
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:46.080]   at events that are entirely packed with nerds who are fans of one thing. And I enjoyed the day,
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:51.440]   but I was glad that I was not stuck on a ship for one week with. Well, you know this boat. This is
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:58.160]   this is the MS Osterdam, which I think we've had a couple of McMania cruises on. This one now,
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:03.680]   the Joe Co. Cruise is so successful. Jonathan Colton, who's of course everybody loves code monkey and
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:09.200]   Paul and Storm put it together every year. People like science fiction author, John Scalsy come
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:16.560]   aboard. They are so successful. They now buy the entire boat. 2002, 2000 nerds.
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:24.320]   Doing all sorts of cray cray stuff, including cosplay day, you get a button when you check in that's
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:30.000]   indicates whether you're an introvert or an extrovert. It's either says, yeah, or no.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:36.000]   By all means, come up and cut start and conversation with me versus, you know what,
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.320]   I kind of rather just sit and watch the column, friend shipping buttons. You get your choice of a
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:47.680]   big green, yay, or a big red nah. Can you get to can you get one of each just in case one? Yeah,
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:52.960]   I think you should for the day. Here they are. This is a Mermunk. I just tried to blood out the
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:59.200]   whole whole thing. It sounds like a lot, a lot of fun. And of course, there's a lot of video
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:05.200]   gaming and tabletop gaming going on. Great article. Good coverage.
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:10.720]   You know, I have a feeling now they're going to have to rent two boats for the Joe co-cruise.
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:17.360]   Let's take a little break more to come with our great panel. Renee Richie, Lori Gill from iMore.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:25.680]   Andy, not go from WGBH Boston. I showed today brought to you by ITProTV. Love these guys.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:32.160]   In fact, they pretty much began with us. It turned out Tim Broome and Don Pezzet were
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:37.840]   IT, traditional IT trainers, you know, classroom IT trainers to teach people the skills they needed
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:44.640]   to get the certifications they needed to get the job in IT they wanted. And they went to an NAB
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:51.040]   conference and saw a panel. I was on the panel with some others about streaming video and they
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:57.840]   said, "Hey, we could do that with IT training." And ITProTV was born. And we were, I think they were
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:03.280]   the first place they ever advertised. And now some years later, but are they amazing? They've
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:10.240]   got a beautiful facility with five studios. They're doing live shows Monday through Friday 9 to 5,
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:16.400]   thousands of hours of on-demand training, new training all the time. Whether you're an experienced
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:21.680]   IT professional and you just want to keep your chops up or learn new skills, or you're trying
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:26.960]   to get into the field, there's never been a better time than right now to take advantage of
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:31.920]   ITProTV's lowest prices ever. Standard membership, which is a video-only membership,
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:35.600]   you get all the videos, all the on-demand stuff, watch all the classes you want as much as you want,
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:42.640]   2850 a month. The premium membership, which includes all of that plus labs, so you can set
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:47.120]   up a Windows server and Windows clients from an HTML5 browser, which is pretty amazing,
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:52.240]   and practice exams. So you could take the tests before you take the test. That's $42 a month,
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.600]   but that's not the price you pay because they love Twit listeners and they're going to honor
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:04.160]   that special offer. We've had that for some time now. 30% off. And not just for the first month or
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:09.040]   year, but for the lifetime of your active account. That means the standard membership is now less
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:14.320]   than 20 bucks a month. Or if you buy a year, less than 200 bucks a year, the premium membership
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:22.160]   2950 a month or less than $300 for a year, less than a dollar a day for the best, most fun,
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:27.040]   most engaging training in every area of IT. And you can watch it any way you want. Of course,
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:31.040]   they have iOS and Android apps. We can watch it in your browser. You can Chromecast it to your
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:38.400]   TV. They have a Roku app that's great fire TV app, Apple TV app. New content is added every single day.
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:42.480]   So your training is always aligned with the latest search, the most current exams.
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:47.760]   I mean, and when I say current, they go from their their studios to the web to the on-demand
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:53.360]   section within a day within 24 hours. They are now CompTIA's official video training partner.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:58.720]   So they've got 12 CompTIA on-demand courses in and these are really the search a lot of people
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:04.320]   get into IT with a plus network plus security plus. So here's the deal. Visit the website.
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:08.240]   Look at this. Look at that. Look at that. That was a hell of a computer. They were building. Look at that.
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:12.640]   These guys are great. They're fun. They're engaging. There's just like us. There's a chat room going on.

[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:03.760]   2,000 nerds on a boat. It's either your worst nightmare or a dream come true, right?
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:11.440]   That's the name of my next song. 2,000 nerds on a boat. Man, I love it. Let's see here.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:16.880]   I don't know if this was to steal Google's thunder or not, but I thought we'd give you a
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:25.280]   chance to talk about all the new operating systems which just came out. Updates for MacOS TVOS.
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:32.160]   Watch OS. Anything to say about that, Renee? Were you busy downloading?
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:41.840]   Yeah, Apple does not really happy when Gurmin or Rambo spill their iOS
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:46.480]   seed beans. They'd much rather surprise people at the show. The timing for this was
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:51.600]   probably just that Gee went and then Mark decided he had to go. It all worked out this way.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:55.680]   Okay. Not happy times in Cupertino, but the way I look at it is if you like spoilers,
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:58.960]   if you feel anxious, if you want to take the edge off of what you think you're going to see,
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:03.200]   go read them. If you don't want to be spoiled, avoid them. If you do read them, then don't call
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:08.000]   the event boring later because reading the script to Star Wars means like they do. They read the
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.360]   script to Star Wars and say the movie didn't surprise them. That's not fair.
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:16.400]   Yeah. So that's right. So June 3rd, WWDC, we will, of course,
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:21.840]   yesterday was built and today with Google IO, we will cover the keynote on June 3rd.
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:27.760]   There will be new iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV stuff. There'll be lots of new
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:31.280]   features, particularly. Don't show this. That's spoiler alert.
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:36.560]   You can say it. You made me feel guilty now. I don't want to spoil it for anybody.
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:39.040]   No, you can. I covered the step is finger.
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:43.600]   Oh, like I cover this stuff and I had this whole conversation with Dalron Paul once and he said,
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:46.160]   like, you've got to help people understand this stuff. And if they don't want to read it,
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:51.280]   that's up to them, but it's your job to cover it. So I cover all this too. It's just, and the
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:56.080]   stuff here, a lot of it is super interesting because last year, Apple postponed a lot of stuff so
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:00.640]   that they could go in and do the performance enhancements and optimization. And this here,
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:04.240]   it looks like they're continuing it. And I was wondering, is this going to be a one year thing?
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:08.480]   Because it's super costly for Apple. They take the best and the brightest engineers,
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:13.120]   people who are legit famous in the community for inventing frameworks that we use every day,
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:16.720]   and they had them go and just make those work better on older devices instead of making the
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:20.880]   new neck thing. And they're doing a little bit of that this year too. So it's nice to see that
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:25.040]   Apple's not just saying, and it baffles Wall Street every time I'm on one of those shows. They
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:28.560]   always say, why is Apple trying to get us to keep their old phones longer? Isn't that bad for them?
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:32.560]   I don't understand. And the thing is Apple's moved now to install base. They want to be able
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:37.200]   to say there's so many devices out there and they're all working great and you can sell subscription
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:41.040]   install all of them. So they're going to be doing a lot of performance enhancement. They'll be
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:46.240]   basic things like dark mode, which Apple has been tormenting us with for years. It's like the Apple
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:50.720]   watch came out with dark mode and like, we're going to give you dark mode for the Apple TV.
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:55.360]   What? We're going to give you dark mode for the Mac. And now finally, we're getting dark mode for
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:31:00.080]   the iPhone along with a lot of other enhancements to a lot of core features.
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:05.760]   And what we were talking about earlier, which is just the, sorry, totally lost my track of
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:12.160]   out there, but just the ability to use a lot of these technologies between devices like the Apple
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:16.800]   watch is going to tie into bedtime because bedtime by itself on an iPhone, not that useful. And
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:20.640]   the Apple's going to be bringing a lot of apps from the iPhone, Marzipan, for example, all the
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:25.760]   iPhone stuff is going to be able to work on the Mac. And you never know, like for me, it's not so
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:28.960]   much what they're doing. That's how they execute it that really matters. So we'll have to wait
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:32.000]   till June 3rd for that. There's a lot of stuff in here, I think is hugely exciting.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:38.960]   I'm excited about watch OS six. Will that be? Do we know? I guess we don't know yet which versions
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:43.360]   of the Apple watch will be compatible? Will it? It won't go all the way back to zero?
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:47.520]   No, it doesn't. It doesn't now. But there's a fear that Apple is going to jet because they've kept,
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:52.800]   right now, basically anything with 64 bit works in terms of iPhone, that goes all the
[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:58.560]   way back to iPhone 5s with the a7 chip. And Apple has gotten rid of a nine, I think pretty much
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:03.440]   completely, but a eight is still out there. So it'll be interesting to see if they sunset a eight
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:06.080]   because then that's a lot of devices that suddenly go off the radar.
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:11.200]   Well, that's it. We're not going to spoil it for you. Just know that we will see a lot of new
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:16.160]   stuff. We've talked in broad brush strokes about iOS 13 and how it's going to make the iPad a
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:22.480]   little bit more work friendly. That could be very big. Mac OS 1015.
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:27.040]   Now they don't they won't push that out till the fall or will they?
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:32.400]   Will be the developer beta will be the day of WWDC and then the public beta like two weeks later
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:37.360]   and then they release like in September. But even like it sounds increasing like the like the
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:42.880]   the apps we got last year were like Marzy Pan not even alpha. It's like we've we've for reasons,
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:46.960]   we've got to make sure the news app is out because we have a news plus coming and we've got to make
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.720]   sure the voice memos app is out because it's sinking and we're just going to put them out.
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:54.320]   But it sounds like the Mars app and we're getting if you follow Steve Troughton Smith on Twitter,
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:59.600]   which you absolutely should do. He's Mars up and a flying everything. It is ridiculous. It's all
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:03.440]   the apps he's helping people do that's converting iOS apps to run on Mac.
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:07.600]   Yeah, so basically you like it running on the Mac and not just in a wrapper,
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:11.920]   which is what they do now, but almost like a first class citizen and they're getting many
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:17.120]   more bells and whistles and many more Mac like affordances and integrations and iOS,
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:20.880]   especially the iPad is going to get the ability to have multiple instances of the same app,
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:24.880]   which also plays into having those apps run on the Mac because it's not just a nice to have,
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:27.920]   it's sort of a must have on the Mac or I'll use the multi window workflow.
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:33.600]   So while Marzy Pan is intended to improve the Mac by making iOS apps work on it,
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:37.680]   it's going to have some effect in the opposite direction. It's going to change a little bit about
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:42.640]   how iOS works and what you can expect in iOS. Well, iOS is getting more mature so it can make
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:47.360]   it can make for better cross platform Mac apps. I want to be careful because people often think,
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:51.600]   oh, my favorite, my favorite Mac app is going to come to iOS and does not help you with that at all.
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:57.360]   It's like it's not going to be easier. So what? Yeah, but I do have to think that people designing
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:01.760]   iOS apps from now on will kind of keep this in mind. And the iOS apps are getting more
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:06.960]   capability so that they'll not more Mac. The other whole thing is like one of the big
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:11.920]   debates is like you don't want to just copy paste stuff from the Mac to iOS because some of that
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:15.760]   stuff may not have been the best solution, especially not in a multi touch world. So like
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:20.000]   drag and drop got rethought and now multi windowing. And there was some language and
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.080]   Mark's report like he was talking about being able to swipe through different versions of an app.
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:28.640]   And is that tabs? Is that is that frames? Like what does that actually mean? How is that
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:33.840]   implemented? And that's like the super interesting part is what the human interface team chooses
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:38.800]   to show us as as as manifestations of all of these ideas. Yeah.
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:46.720]   Yeah, if I hope that the overall game plan for Mars, a pan is to increase the value of the
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:53.440]   investment that a developer makes in learning how to develop apps for iOS and Macintosh by
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:58.560]   saying that no, you no longer have to learn UI kit and something else. If you learn how to
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:03.440]   build an app with this entire with this basic framework, you if you then decide that you have a new
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:08.080]   idea for an app that involves Macintosh, you don't have to climb this hurdle. We they want to make
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:11.840]   sure that if they want to make sure that they kind of erase the boundary between being an iOS
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:15.840]   developer and a Mac developer, that's good for the industry. That's good for developers and
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:22.640]   ultimately good for consumers. I just it's one of the other bad things about how they handled Mars
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:28.560]   a pan last year was again, releasing Mac versions of iOS apps that just really looked like I am
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:34.560]   running a virtual iPad in a Macintosh window. There's just nothing about those apps that made
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:41.520]   made it sound. So they exactly it was it really didn't feel like it was designed with a Macintosh
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:47.600]   in mind. So what we I'm trying to reserve judgment until we see those next generations of apps where
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:53.440]   someone says here is here is the we've finished the core functionality of this text editor or
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:58.640]   to do list or whatever. And now we are going to split the development into now we're going to make
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:01.840]   choices that are specifically for Mac and now we're going to make choices that are specifically
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:07.120]   for iOS. If it becomes a way for people to simply say, well, why why should we continue to develop
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:12.080]   on Mac OS when we can just add an extra week to our development schedule and cut and paste stuff
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:20.080]   into a new and build a version of iOS app for Mac. That's a bad thing. That's at WWDC. What I'm
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:26.960]   looking for is more signs that Apple is interested in the Mac and they're fascinated by the Mac and
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:31.680]   they want the Mac to live on for other five years. We mentioned that Tim Cook was at the Berkshire
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:38.240]   Hathaway meeting. It kind of makes sense. Warren Buffett is a big stock holder in Apple.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:41.920]   How much is it cost to get Tim Cook to show up at your party? Well, millions.
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:50.160]   Well, and that's the funny thing because it first it seemed like a promo. At the start of the
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:55.280]   shareholder meeting, Tim Cook may get a cameo appearance in a humorous short film in which Buffett
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:00.320]   visits a top secret lab at Apple to try to come up with ideas for an app, including a time machine
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:07.600]   where Buffett tells his childhood self by Apple stock. Good advice. Cook suggests in the video a
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:14.000]   newspaper tossing iPhone game because Buffett used to have a paper route. Still my pick in the
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.840]   weekly. Oh, just kidding. Is it your pay away? I won't say a word if it is. It's a real game.
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:28.000]   Warren Buffett's paper wizard is now free on the app store. You will you'll collect Warren
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:34.080]   Bucks as you travel around Cupertino delivering newspapers. Actually, you start in Cupertino.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:41.840]   You end up in Omaha. I think I started in Omaha because you did. Well, because I think that's
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:46.320]   because that's the easier level because it's not quite so built up. You get a lot of you get to drive
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:51.440]   a lot between right a lot between houses. It's when you get into Cupertino, they start you off in
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:57.040]   the suburbs where the houses only cost 1.5 million. And then you get closer to you end up in the
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:01.840]   high-rise district. Oh, I get it. So you start in Omaha. That's the beginner level. I get it.
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:06.800]   Looks like this isn't your first paper route says emoji, Tim.
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:12.720]   I see. I'm not sure that I was kind of surprised that there was so upbeat because I was getting
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:18.160]   but at the very, very last levels where you have to shoot into higher rises, like rapid fire,
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:24.480]   like a top level low levels, and I was getting like 42% delivered. And I'm not sure that my boss
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:30.880]   would say of the 100 people who subscribe to the paper, 58 of them did not receive their newspaper.
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:35.040]   And lots of other people got their windows broken. Good job.
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:41.200]   Actually sounds about right. At least according to my experience as a paper boy.
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:46.480]   Somebody who accidentally swallowed an air pod.
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:50.720]   Do we even have to talk about this? Okay, enough. Let's just point out that
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:57.040]   you continue to work even in the guy's stomach. It worked better externally than internally
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:02.640]   test subject. There it is. You can see it in the and the x-ray right there. That's an air pod.
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:11.440]   Jeez, please don't swallow your ear pod. I just I just question how accidental this
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:18.080]   swallowing was. That's all. I am just according to the Daily Mail, not the most reliable source.
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:22.640]   A guy named Ben Shoe fell asleep with a pair of wireless headphones in his ears,
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:29.440]   but woke up unable to find one of them. He used the iPhone tracking feature to find it in his room.
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:37.120]   But as he walked around, the beeping sound followed him. He realized the sound is coming from my stomach.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:43.360]   You did eventually eliminate it and it continued to work. In fact, the battery.
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:46.160]   How does he know it continued to work? He should have said it right out.
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:52.480]   They're not that expensive. The battery was 41%. It was incredible, said shoe.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:58.720]   My experience was magical. I hope Tim Cook uses that at WWDC.
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:03.600]   Oh, go to hell. Give us a magical. Oh my God.
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:10.320]   Someone that's got to be the most valuable marketing name to the phone.
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:17.360]   Never say, Hey, I've got a Macintosh that's eight years old and it can happen for only $40,000.
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:23.040]   Yes, yes, this a magical experience. Oh my God. Let's say we charge to have.
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:28.080]   Go ahead. I'm sorry. No, no, let's say your your indignation is registered, Andrew.
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:35.360]   There's a there's being a fan of Apple and then there's taking it to a level that's maybe unhealthy
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:41.920]   for both you and the cooks as fun. Just calm down. How long before we get little slips of paper
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:47.920]   inside of AirPods is they not to be taken internally? Oh, God. All it takes is one. Just one.
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:53.600]   Let's take a break. Your picks of the week coming up. But first a word from Captera. Actually,
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:59.440]   this is a great way to get a pick of your favorite business software. How many of you I know most.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:04.880]   You know, yesterday, Microsoft said, Hey, your good news in our brand new edge browser running
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:10.480]   on Chromium, you'll still be able to run Internet Explorer. For those of you with business software
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:16.160]   that requires IE, they even showed a web page. It really looked like it was straight out of 1995.
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:21.360]   It had the great table and all that. If you're in that position where you have business software
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:26.160]   that the guy who wrote it has graduated from elementary school and has disappeared,
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:33.600]   you need to go to capterra.com to find new modern fancy business software that will do more of
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:37.200]   what you needed to do. And you won't need to run Internet Explorer six to do it.
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:41.200]   If you're just starting out or your business is growing and it's time to change the software,
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:48.240]   you'd like to try new software. Captera is there to help a directory. More than 700 categories of
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:53.600]   business software from CMS to email marketing, the IT service, SEO workflow management, yoga
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:58.720]   studio management, veterinary dentist's office management. I go on and on and on.
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:04.400]   Thousands of programs. It makes it very easy to find what you want because once you get the
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:08.160]   category, once you get the program category, then you can drill down. You could say, well,
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:12.320]   I don't want to see ones with five star ratings. I only want to see them if they operate on my
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:16.960]   desk or they operate in the cloud. You can actually, I want to be able to book clients or,
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:22.880]   you know, all the things that you might want. And then once you filter them, you can even compare
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:27.760]   them side by side four at a time. You can see related categories, but here's the best part
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:36.880]   about Captera, in my opinion, 875,000 reviews by actual verified users. And there's 30,000
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:43.600]   fresh reviews every month. That's a thousand a day. So that makes a huge difference. When you're
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:47.280]   looking at a piece of software and somebody says, yeah, I use this and this is what I like,
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:53.040]   is what I don't like. Super valuable. That's Captera. Captera believes software can make the
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:56.720]   world a better place because it can help every organization become more efficient,
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:04.160]   a more effective vision version of itself. And here's the best part. I kind of buried the lead.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:11.360]   It's free, free, free. Like no, not freemium. It's free. Captera is the leading free online
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:17.440]   resource to help you find the best software for you solution for your business. C A P T E R R A

[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:28.560]   if you didn't go to Mac break, but this way you let them know you heard it on the show and that
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:33.280]   helps us. And we really do thank Captera for not only providing a great product free, all the
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:38.000]   business owners in the world, but but tell them the world about it on our show. Thank you, Captera.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:47.600]   Captera C A P T E double R A dot com slash Mac break. Captera is software selection. Simplified.
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:56.320]   Lori Gill. What should I buy this week? So my original pick was actually the
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:44:01.680]   Powerbeats Pro, but since we spent the first half of the show talking, that's okay. I have a backup.
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:09.280]   Okay. Okay. Um, this, I think that everybody should get a set. I should get wooed at whoosh.
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:17.040]   What is whoosh? It is a screen cleaner. Oh, so it's, you know, just wipes down your,
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:23.200]   your screen, cleans it off. So especially when it comes to the iPad iPhone screen,
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:29.280]   you can usually use just your standard micro micro cleaning cloth and you can pretty much get the,
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:33.600]   the fingerprints off. But when you have your iPad, I don't know if you've guys have tried just
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:40.800]   using a damp cloth. No, at least streaks. No, and it just looks awful. And I actually will just like,
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:46.400]   you know, like you breathe heavy on it and then wipe it down to try to like get some of the
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:53.040]   moisture from my mouth to try to, try to clean it off. It never works. Whoosh. I'm just a couple of
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:58.320]   wipes and it's, it's perfect like it's brand new and you don't use very much. You actually spray it
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:04.240]   on the cleaning cloth, not on your screen directly. So it's like you're using a damp cloth. It's just
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:10.480]   that the damp cloth has this, the stuff in it that actually works to clean the, the screen. And it's
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:17.920]   biodegradable and non, what's the word? It's, it's, you could eat it. You could drink it.
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:20.560]   Non-toxic. Non-toxic. Thank you.
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:29.360]   Wow. It's non-toxic. It's, it's not damaging to screens. You know, I know that Apple always says,
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:34.080]   don't use chemicals on screens, but this company has been around for quite a few years now,
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:40.960]   has successfully worked on all manner of screens without damaging them. So it's, it uses a very
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:46.640]   cool light with an anti microbial cloth with the poop emoji on it.
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:50.880]   Well, mine didn't actually come with. I know you didn't get their bonus item.
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:57.440]   I did not know. Thank you. So I'm going to, John, I'm ordering four of these right now for the studio.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:03.360]   I think we need whoosh. Are you ordering them? They really, look at that. It smells good too.
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:11.120]   They, yeah, and they really help clean the screens on, on an iPad for me. I don't even want to touch
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:15.840]   my iPad screen because it's big and beautiful and just one swipe and I've destroyed it.
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:21.840]   You kind of have to touch it. Yeah. And so this lets me every, every day or every couple of days,
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:25.280]   I'll just wipe it down and it looks brand new. Again, if I'm having to take pictures,
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:29.200]   which I have to take out pictures of my devices all the time for the I'm more,
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:34.960]   the, all the things that I write about on I'm more, I, I will quickly wipe it down and it gets
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:38.480]   rid of all of those fingerprints, a little bits of dust and stuff like that.
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:43.680]   It works on headphones. I haven't needed to use it on, on the Powerbeats Pro yet, but when I do,
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:48.320]   I can wipe it down with that. Just ordered a really great, that big squirt bottle. You see,
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:53.920]   I just ordered three of those. But it turns out Megan just came running in. I, we have whoosh.
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:47:00.320]   I'm going to try it right now because it's not just for iPads. I have a giant surface display here.
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:07.120]   Let me just do you have the clinic on you. Yeah, except it's spraying in every direction,
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:12.480]   but where I want it to go. Maybe there's a, let's see. Well, you, you first, you were supposed to
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:18.080]   spray it on the cloth, not the screen. Oh, there's the problem right there. I always spray it on the
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:24.080]   screen direct. I figure why intercede, why become an inter, it does, it is, we need to, I need to
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:32.640]   fix the squirt. It smells good. So in no streaks. Yeah, it just, it's so nice. Look at that.
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:37.440]   It's non alcoholic. I'm not sure the chemicals in it. It smells pretty good.
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:40.880]   It doesn't list it on here. I think Megan's been cleaning bicycle tires with it though.
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:47.280]   This cloth is not in good shape. She's doing her white walls outside. All right, whoosh.
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:53.760]   Thank you for the recommendation. Again, I only buy stuff that Laurie recommends.
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:59.200]   I have all the stuff. I can say all the things. Andy and I go pick of the week.
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:04.960]   My pick of the week is something I've been looking for for a long, long time. This is
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:14.160]   the light labs Q 22 flash. No, yeah, so a camera flash, but here now here's what makes it.
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:16.880]   So here's what makes it something I've been looking for for a long, long time. Number one,
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:22.240]   I don't like to try my my good flash is like really, really big. So I almost never take it with me.
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:27.520]   I kind of wanted to have like a travel, something that's pocketable and tiny. And this is absolutely
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:33.040]   both of those things. But also you can, you can find these tiny little flashes, but they don't do a
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:38.560]   whole lot. This one is amazing. So not only does it work on a flash, because I'm using it on my
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:44.560]   like micro four thirds camera, but a lot of like the pocket cameras like come for like five,
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:51.120]   six, $700 have a hot shoe, have a flash shoe on it. So it's not just for like big cameras, but so
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:57.280]   you press this button on the back and release it. And it becomes an off camera flash. So that you
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:01.360]   can sort of having like the light right in people's faces or right in the things faces,
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:06.320]   you can have it like off to the side. And not only that, but you can also with buttons that are on
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:11.360]   the back of this little sender unit, adjust like the intensity of the flash. So if you set it up
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:15.440]   like 10 feet away to get a picture or something, and then you realize this, it's a little bit too
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:22.960]   bright. That's okay. You can you can adjust it from here. Not only that, but it also has a
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:28.720]   bounceable head. So you can flick this up and bounce things off the ceiling. Not only that,
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:33.120]   but there is a little slot in the bottom here. So if you want to add like a color gel to it,
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:37.520]   and it comes with a pack of them, you just slide it in here. So you get, I put this in so like
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:43.680]   skin tones are a little bit more natural. Not only that, and it in addition to like all the
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:48.800]   controls that like are in the back here, so you can control it like yourself, it also has you see
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:54.880]   this this white strip down here. That is also an LED video like he said holding down the button.
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:59.440]   There we go. Oh, you can't see it because I've got my own lights on. But so that means that if
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:07.200]   you are recording video with the with this thing, it will it'll be like a battery supposed to be
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:11.440]   dead except using it all the time. If you're recording video, it'll be like an LED
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:16.320]   illuminator. Or if you're taking a picture with your phone, you can use this as sort of an off-camera
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:22.480]   illuminator. And then I mean, just all these things that are just such smart things, such as it also
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:28.240]   has a standard tripod screw like in the bottom. So if you want to stick it on like a gorilla pod
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:32.880]   or something like that, so that again, if you if you got it off camera, maybe you need to mount
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:40.560]   it someplace someplace neat, it will it will run off of two AA batteries. But if you put
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:46.960]   nikads in there, it not only does it run on nikads, but you can also charge the nikads directly
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:53.840]   through the flash. So if you have it has a standard like micro USB port on the side of that for charging.
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:59.360]   So you don't have to like bring a battery charger with you, it will just charge directly from there.
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:04.880]   And the little sender unit that screws into the hot shoe, it has its own lithium ion battery,
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:10.320]   so it doesn't drain your own camera. But another smart thing, you can charge you can recharge it
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:15.440]   not only from your phone charger, but you can also plug it into this and recharge it from the
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:21.360]   AA batteries off of this. So it's and it's all this for like 70 bucks. And you can also add more
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:25.280]   flashes to it. So if you want to have two flashes, three flashes controlled remotely,
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:30.160]   you can just add more flashes or buy another buy little shoe that will attach to the bottom of
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:38.240]   a standard flash only for like 60, 70 bucks for just the basic kit. And like I said, it's just
[01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:44.720]   it's not just that it's a pocketable flash that I can bear to put in my laptop bag and carry around
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:50.960]   with me. It's that every opportunity they had to make it cooler or make it more useful or to avoid
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:55.600]   something stupid that gets in the way of what you want to do. They avoided it. I mean, even just
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:01.280]   the fact that they made all of the size of this square. So you can just basically just put this
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:06.400]   on a shelf or put this like on a railing, it will stop. I know that a rounded edge would have been
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:11.440]   cooler and more industrial design. But it would have stopped you from doing something interesting
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:17.440]   with the thing. So I'm really, I bought it the last week. I'm using it all the time. I'm really,
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:23.600]   really, really happy with it. And like I said, for 70 bucks, it's it's everything that I would
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:29.040]   have wanted in a device exactly like this. Very nice. Very nice. Thank you, Andrew.
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:35.920]   Renee Richie, pick of the week time. So let me tell you a short story about a developer named
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:41.440]   David Smith, who previously, anytime Apple would announce a new framework, he would instantly at
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:47.440]   WWDC anywhere, have five or six apps ready to go. He was just one of the most prolific developers I
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:53.120]   ever knew probably because of the very fine coffee that he enjoyed. He slowed down recently. I mean,
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:58.080]   he does sleep, you know, sleep plus plus and oh, oh, yeah, that's a great app. Yeah, a ton of really
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:02.160]   great apps. He's put out his new app recently. I forget if it was last week, but it was it was
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:10.000]   there about and it's got the magnificent title of Cal Zones. It's Cal, it's calendar zones calendar
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.880]   in time zones, but he made it sound pizza delicious, which is just an example of his brilliance.
[01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:20.240]   Anyway, this if you've ever had, I know everyone here can relate, if you've ever had to set up a
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:26.560]   podcast with people in many different international time zones or a meeting or anything, a phone
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:31.120]   call, whatever it was, you know how hard it. Oh, you're in Melbourne. When is that? Well, where
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:35.360]   time is it? Where you are right now? Oh, so if it's five o'clock tomorrow, free and inevitably,
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:39.840]   people show up on the wrong day sometimes. You open the wrong time. It's just all shades
[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:44.640]   of confusing. So this app, like most good apps has a very specific purpose. And that's just to let
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:50.640]   you know what a time is in multiple time zones and let you act on that by creating meetings,
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:56.960]   suggestions, tracking, doing all sorts of very useful things based on knowing what a time is
[01:53:56.960 --> 01:54:01.360]   in multiple time zones because it's David Smith that has a really good, really simple
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:06.880]   iPhone app, but it also has a really brilliant Apple Watch app that'll show you time zones and
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:13.920]   like monstrous complication support. So you can go in and set up all sorts of like working day,
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:19.920]   time and time zone time and all these different things and really just adjust your watch face
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:25.920]   or watch faces, if you choose to have multiple in a way that makes a lot of glanceable sense to you.
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:30.960]   So it's five bucks. And I still love that David Smith is charging real prices for real apps.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:38.960]   So you can support him and his magnificent work. And it just it just solves that problem of never
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:44.640]   needing to worry about what time Russell thinks it is or Mark thinks it is in Melbourne and what
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:50.720]   time the guest from Italy is coming on and all of those things just go completely away. And it
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:56.480]   lets you concentrate on making a good quality meeting or call or podcast and not worrying about
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:59.040]   three of you being there at eight different times. This is a good one.
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:04.880]   I just have for podcasters. Yes. I once I once the the material podcast for Google stuff,
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:11.760]   the in addition to me on the East Coast, the other hosts were Russell Russell in Australia.
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:20.800]   And yes, me and again in Arizona that either that doesn't observe everything up. Yeah. Yeah. And
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:27.280]   what is my life become? I'm not one of God's beloved. Clearly. I'm spending five months right
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:31.280]   now. That's a great show up on the wrong day. I mean, who's just like it would just happen.
[01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:36.400]   Yeah. No, I was all the time. Yeah. Cal zones. It also has a great name. Yes. On the app store
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:42.400]   right now. Just a quick mention. It's not exactly a pick. But thanks to nine to five toys,
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:47.120]   I know this today through May 10th. So you got to jump on this one. You only have three days.
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:54.560]   Apple's giving a 10% additional bonus when you add funds to your Apple ID. So up to $200. So
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:01.040]   if you if you use Apple pay to buy stuff, you could buy two $200 and funds and save 20 bucks
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:07.200]   off of that. That's pretty good deal. 10% off US only, I'm sorry to say, but just a little tip
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:12.960]   on your iPhone or iPad settings, click on your account name, then the iTunes and app store tab.
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:20.000]   Choose your Apple ID and then add funds to Apple ID. And you'll get a little bonus
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:27.200]   if you do it now through May 10th. Friends, we have come to the end of this Mac break weekly.
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:32.240]   Thank you so much, Andy and not go host of the material podcast. If you want to walk on the wild
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:40.960]   side, that's on the on relay.fm. You can also hear him on WGBH Boston and each week here. Thank you,
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:47.280]   Andy. Thanks. Lori Gail, managing editor at imore.com lead singer for sick burn.
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:51.920]   Apple Holic on the Twitter pink hair wearer.
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:57.200]   Loving. Yeah, right. Loving. Thank you so much for being here, Lori.
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:01.520]   Thank you. Thanks for having me. And of course, from imore.com, Renee's
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:05.840]   chomping at the bit to go out and get a detective Pikachu photo bomb. So we're going to let him
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:11.120]   let him go out and do that. He's also the host of the vector podcast at imore.com/vector.
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:16.000]   Thank you, Renee. So much Leo. Hey, Renee, I noticed something in the background.
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:22.480]   Is there is there something? Wait, oh my God, is that a Starbucks coffee cup?
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:25.600]   I left a Starbucks coffee cup.
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:32.000]   Now we got him so embarrassed. We shoot the whole show in the in the in the timeline of
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.480]   Renee Richie, that should be a Tim's Tim Hortons cup. Oh, man. How did they miss that?
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:41.840]   Made a mistake. It was supposed to be tea. We're talking of course about episode four season
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:47.040]   eight game of thrones. If you watch very carefully, you'll see the Daenerys is drinking a latte
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:52.560]   in the middle of the show. Well, we don't know if she drinks it. It was sitting there on the
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:57.200]   on the table. Thanks everybody for joining us. We do Mac break weekly. Normally, we're an
[01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:01.760]   hour delayed thanks to Google I/O, but normally we're about 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time,
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:08.560]   1800 UTC. I could tell that thanks to Cal Zones on my watch. You can use Cal Zones to figure out
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:14.560]   when you should watch us. The stream is at twit.tv/live. If you're watching or listening to the live stream,
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:20.640]   please go in the chat room. That's where everybody else is who's watching or listening live at irc.twit.tv.
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:26.240]   We also welcome you. We had a great studio audience today from Mason, Wisconsin and Philadelphia,
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:30.080]   New Philadelphia, Ohio. What happened to old Philadelphia, Ohio?
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:39.440]   We've moved Philadelphia to Ohio. If you want to be in the studio, we love having studio audiences.
[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:44.480]   We studio is open most days of the week, but do email tickets at twit.tv to let us know you're
[01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:51.440]   coming. Most people watch the easy way on demand at your convenience. We make audio and video versions
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:59:00.480]   of this show available at twit.tv/mbw. There is the long lost Alex Lindsey. We still don't know
[01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:05.520]   what happened to him, but someday he shall return. I hope. What we've got to do is just paste Laurie's
[01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:13.200]   head on there. That's what we need to do. I think he's working on Marvel. He's working on something
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:21.120]   that would force him to recuse himself during the show. That's all I know. You be the judge.
[01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:29.280]   Okay. Okay. Fine. We're suing each other. I'm sorry. We have to. We tried to hide. Yeah. Alex
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:36.960]   Lindsey has been redacted due to grand jury activity, but no, I'm just kidding. But someday he shall
[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:39.920]   return. But you know what? We've got a great replacement with Laurie Kiel with "The World to
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:46.160]   Have her." You can download every episode going back to the original Mac break at twit.tv, but you
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:51.760]   can also subscribe in your favorite podcast or from Hence Forward, you will get every episode the
[01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:57.440]   minute it's available. I think that's a pretty good idea. Thanks for watching. Now get back to work
[01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:07.440]   because break time is over.
[02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:10.020]   (upbeat music)
