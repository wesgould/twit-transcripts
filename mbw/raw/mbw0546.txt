[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.900]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the Valentine's Day edition. Hello, your gorgeous thing you...
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:35.900]   Joining us right now, it's Renee Ritchie from Beautiful Morial, where he's wearing a red, plaid, flannel shirt.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.900]   The very romantic display of Canadian lust.
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.900]   Love up, Leo. This is how we do it up north. We have to stay warm.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.900]   You said, "Oh, gosh, well, I better get something red on. I didn't realize it was going to be a lumberjack shirt."
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.900]   Okay.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.900]   It's my go to... I thought I had a red sweatshirt, but turns out all my red is flannel. And I think that's oddly appropriate.
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.900]   I love it. Hello, Renee. Also, easeremindwar.com.
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:12.900]   Also here from the Chicago Suntimes, Andy Ennaco, who is protesting by dressing entirely in black with a black Pits Pixar baseball cap.
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.900]   No, no, this is... Well, it's green. And there's some red here.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.900]   The Hayward Fire Department pullover.
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.900]   Love, talk to wave.
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.900]   Yes.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.900]   Yes.
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.900]   Andy's endorsements are very confusing.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.900]   Well, basically, I'll wear almost everything that's given to me for free and it's warm on a day like this.
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.900]   Is it... Oh, yeah. You guys had a lot of snow, didn't you?
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:43.900]   Yeah, it's been snowed for like three, four days straight. It was so bad that like after three days of like not leaving the house for one reason or another on day three of actual active snow.
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:51.900]   It's like, "You know what? I'm going to go for a four-mile walk in the snow because I need to be in the big room at least once a week or else."
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.900]   I feel so that detrimental to my sense of a lawn.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.900]   Yes.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.900]   Well, there's this weird thing where it's snowed and then melted and then snowed and then melted.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.900]   We have a layer cake of ice right now.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.900]   Oh, I hate what it says.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.900]   And you think it's snow when you step down and then you're on your own.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.900]   Oh.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.900]   Because it was really nice.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.900]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:16.900]   See, people who... people don't live in snowy climbs don't understand that, "Oh, isn't it? Wouldn't it be great to take a nice walk through the woods and fresh snowfall? That's great for the first four and a half steps."
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:26.900]   When you realize that you're... with every step, you have to lift up your foot above like a... above like 14 inches and then place it on a surface that's not going to simply give.
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.900]   It's going to support your weight for two and a half seconds and then send you plummeting down.
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.900]   It sticks.
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.900]   Grandpa and sales are skyrocketing though.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.900]   Yes.
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.900]   No one else is skyrocketing.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.900]   Apple's market cap.
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.900]   Woo-hoo.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.900]   We're going to get to a trillion by hook or by crook, aren't we?
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.900]   Just approved.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.900]   I mean, it's so doomed, Leo.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.900]   I mean, it's so...
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.900]   Apple's doomed.
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.900]   You're the money back to the shareholders.
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:48.900]   Apple's doomed.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.900]   Let's look at the five-year graph.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.900]   One-year graph looks pretty good, huh?
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.900]   This is a Genshow's.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.900]   There's an enormous disconnect between what happens and how the market reacts.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.900]   I don't think anybody can explain when it goes up and down anymore.
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:02.900]   Yeah.
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.900]   Yeah.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.900]   Well, they had a great quarter.
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.900]   They're going up like crazy today.
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.900]   It must be on all of those iPhone rumors, right?
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.900]   iPhone rumors, AR rumors.
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.900]   Maybe the side that Tim Cook button just shirt on.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.900]   I'm guessing it's not planted in the apps that's pushing the stock through the roof here.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.900]   Oh, people are so angry.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.900]   It's definitely carpool karaoke.
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:33.900]   Apple's market cap now, $707.57 billion.
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.900]   That's an all-time high.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.900]   The stock, as we talk, $134.84.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.900]   It's up a buck and a half today alone.
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.900]   What does that do to investor confidence?
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.900]   I mean, is there a point in which investors think, "Okay.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.300]   It can't possibly go much higher than this.
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.300]   I'm going to bail."
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.340]   Whether it's true or not, then they start thinking, "Well, maybe other people are thinking that,
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.340]   and so I should definitely sell while it's high."
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.340]   What happens right?
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.340]   You see that.
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.580]   You see this stutter step where when it breaks through a ceiling like that where a number
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.140]   of people profit take, right?
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.100]   But then it comes right back up again.
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.860]   The stock market is whole.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.900]   I don't understand it all.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.060]   And so you don't listen to me from stock tips, but the stock market as a whole has been up
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.900]   quite a bit in the last few days and today as well.
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.900]   So the Trump bump, they call it, is huge.
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.900]   It's huge.
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.900]   Huge.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.900]   Huge.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.500]   And some of that, so some of Apple's growth is just a general exuberance in the stock market.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.300]   It's just the patient of getting all that money repatriated.
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.660]   Yeah, and you don't want it could be.
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.300]   I think that could be very big.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.180]   I would guess, given Apple's history here, that some of that, if not all of that money,
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.380]   would go to stock buybacks, right?
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.380]   Yeah.
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.220]   Every time they get more money, every time they see an opportunity, they want to buy
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.100]   some of their stuff back.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:06.660]   It's also kind of a good indication of why maybe they've been not being measured in
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.420]   their response to Trump because that's another thing.
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:16.260]   The fact that he seems to have a functional relationship with the Oval Office gives people,
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.340]   gives investors confidence that whatever happens in the next three or four years or eight years
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.500]   of this administration, it's not going to benefit to cut big companies like Apple, which.
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.780]   Sorry, that was just another auto play video.
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.780]   I love that.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.740]   I love them.
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.580]   I was wondering, I was wondering who's cutting into say, or nine months when he gets in peach
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.580]   or put in jail.
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.580]   I thought, wow, that's daring.
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.340]   No, I would never say that.
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.500]   This is from Fortune, market intelligence, Lucinda Shen.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.680]   Apple's shares are looking tempting again, but iPhone maker's stock may still be the
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.740]   market's forbidden fruit.
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.660]   Because remember, last year sales went down, but then the quarter was really good.
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.140]   Quarterly results were really good, as one would expect in the fourth quarter.
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.700]   Surely, the stock market is not so short-sighted as to say, oh, well, they had a great holiday
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.300]   quarter, we should just buy, buy, buy.
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.300]   Right?
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.300]   But are two is down.
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.300]   Short, short, short.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.300]   I guess.
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.300]   I guess.
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.300]   I guess.
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.300]   I guess.
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:23.980]   Also, I mean, this is a great conversation for the financial pages.
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.700]   Of course, it doesn't affect us.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.700]   It doesn't affect us.
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.700]   It doesn't affect users.
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:35.100]   Well, only in the sense that the more profitable Apple is, the more power they have to control
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.100]   their own destinies.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.860]   The more the greater their ability to make a plan that goes five or six or seven years
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.860]   ahead.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.420]   Like if they just if they really decided that, for instance, they're going the wrong
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.940]   way on the, I'm not saying they are, but if they decide, gee, we're going the wrong
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.780]   way on the iPhone, we really need square devices that are two inches on a side.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:58.060]   They can kind of afford to make a change that's going to affect sales for the next two years.
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.500]   But means that they're going to be in a better shape three or four years from now.
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:07.500]   But the only thing that kind of gets me, that gets my eyebrows, my eyebrow raised is one
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.340]   of the genuinely, it's, it's, it looks like, do you know that Apple is now, they have a
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:18.140]   value market cap that's greater than Microsoft and Google and general foods and 3M and that
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.420]   you know, the company that makes that like springy doggy toy, that company too.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.420]   Okay.
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.980]   It's, it makes you happy.
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.420]   Yeah, but it's Germain for other reasons.
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.060]   I mean, for instance, having a strong stock helps get better employees.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.860]   It, as you said, it gives them cash to invest to do R&D.
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.940]   You know, I mean, it means there's a healthy company.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.460]   So because I don't, I agree with you, we use our promise.
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.140]   You give people RS use because you think the stock is going to go up, but it's already
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.140]   up.
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.140]   I don't know what that's.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.140]   Right.
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.140]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.580]   If you, if you joined Apple today, your strike price would be today's strike price, which
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.140]   would be very high.
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.540]   It's still pretty amazing that the stock has just, it's just been, and they had a 7-1 split.
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.540]   What was that two years ago?
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.340]   I mean, this is, wow, goes fast.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.340]   Yeah.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.340]   All right.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.940]   Not that the, I agree with you 100% financial.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.100]   We're not interested in, in fact, I'm not even interested in this.
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.260]   Maybe this is me talking in, in how a product sells so much.
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.700]   You know, a lot of times people say, well, they obviously Apple watches a great product
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.420]   because it's, it's had its record quarter to me.
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.380]   You know, that's like saying, well, the best meat in the world comes from McDonald's
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.180]   because they sell so much of it.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.140]   It doesn't, it's not, how well something sells is an indicator of the quality of the product,
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.140]   either.
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.140]   You know, I have to make it, I always, it's, I should make an independent judgment.
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.540]   You would be in my Apple and my McDonald's deal.
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:41.500]   It's, it is valuable in that it does show that whatever you might say positively or
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.180]   negatively, they're definitely making things that people want to buy.
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.980]   And that's, that goes beyond simply being a successful business.
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:53.660]   That means that realizing, for instance, in the case of the Apple Watch, that style really
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:58.060]   is a critical component of selling a device like this, where you can make arguments about
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.060]   its functionality.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.060]   You can make arguments about its relevance.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:06.420]   But when you get to it, get down to it, Apple was maybe the only company that realized that
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.580]   all we have, the one, one of the most important things about a watch is that it'd be a cool
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:16.100]   watch that people spend hundreds and thousands of dollars sometimes on watches that they think
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.100]   is really, really cool that they want to wear as a piece of jewelry.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.540]   So if you start off by making something that seems like it was built really, really well,
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:31.420]   is a cool thing, has some, even some high-end exotic materials about it and tells the time
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.820]   within, let's say, 10 or 20 minutes per month, you can have a winning product.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:40.780]   And if it does, if it ties in with your, if it ties in with your podcasting app and your
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:46.340]   stock price app and your home security home automation app, okay, that's a fine bonus,
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.780]   but build a cool watch and they will come.
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.820]   And it's a combination of metrics too.
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.260]   Like I agree with you, raw market sales on its own.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.220]   It's not an indicator unless they're sustained over time.
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.180]   But when you factor in things like, and I hate to use the term customer sat, which Apple
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.940]   products traditionally have a high level of, but Apple Watch is also enjoying a really
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.780]   high level of, you start to get multiple metrics and you think that, you know, maybe once
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.620]   in a while there is a disconnect between how we cover these products and how a lot of people
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.700]   who just buy them and enjoy them and use them sometimes in far more simple ways or more
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.220]   focused ways and we do enjoy them.
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.220]   Yeah.
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:21.060]   Well, and I just, we were talking before the show, I just bought the new Android Wear
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.060]   Watch.
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.380]   The, I got the big LG Watch Sport.
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.340]   Talk about huge.
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.900]   But this is a perfect example of a watch that, you know, LG and Google, Google helped them
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.020]   design this, are trying to put every feature that's in the Apple Watch into it and then
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:40.180]   some, it's got a GPS, but it also has a SIM card and LTE in it.
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.900]   And the thing is, it's unwarrable.
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.140]   The antennas are in the straps, right?
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.140]   Yeah.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.420]   So the straps about halfway down on your wrist don't bend.
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.220]   This is, these are, these are the antennas.
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.020]   It's thick, it's heavy.
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.460]   Even I, I'm a big guy.
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.020]   It doesn't look bad on me, but I don't want to wear it because it's just uncomfortable.
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.340]   I saw it on Jason Howlett.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.220]   It looked big even on him and I was jokingly saying it was a smart kettlebell.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.220]   Yeah.
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.620]   It's like a kettlebell.
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.620]   And look at that.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.300]   You know, this is the default watch face is just ugly.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:15.860]   It's, it's an example of piling everything into the interface without much care to, you
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.420]   know, how it looks.
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:23.300]   And in defense, realize that this was meant to show off a lot of what Android Wear 2 does
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:28.460]   and that it's different when, it's different when you make a device like this than when
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:29.460]   Apple makes a device.
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.740]   If Apple makes an Apple Watch, that's all you get.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.020]   That's all it will be this year.
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.020]   You're getting nothing else.
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.020]   Nothing else is available.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.700]   This is one Android Wear.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.700]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.820]   And the other manufacturers have been waiting for Android Wear 2.
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.540]   Android Wear 2 was delayed for about six months.
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.780]   So they've been sort of holding off to release their new hardware.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.300]   So you'll see, you'll see slimmer models.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.300]   You'll see more delicate models.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.500]   And one of the things I kind of like about Android Wear is that you, it's the default
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.900]   watch face is just the one that you can change it.
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.900]   Of course.
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:58.900]   It's just the one you get when you power up.
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.300]   I've been wearing a kitty, I've been wearing a kitty cat watch.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.300]   I know I like yours.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:07.380]   When you wake up, the kitty cat goes up from an app and blinks instead of clicks a tail.
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.380]   Exactly.
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.820]   Battery life on this is not as good as the Apple Watch.
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.620]   I mean, it really underscores.
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.740]   And by the way, I'm not a huge fan of the Apple Watch.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:19.740]   I'm wearing it.
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.740]   I like my Nelio.
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:21.740]   It's a matching.
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.540]   I know you've finally got the addition.
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.340]   And I put it with the coffee band.
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.540]   So now I have a coffee foam.
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.860]   Well, one of the nice, I didn't like the idea of a white watch, but I have to say that
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:33.500]   is one of the good things about white watches you can have a broader variety of bands.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.380]   And I get your workout notifications.
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.220]   And I respond like pizza because that's funny to me now.
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.220]   Donuts and stuff.
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.220]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.220]   Donuts.
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.220]   Yes, stop sending donuts.
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.220]   Can you please?
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.220]   But that's part of the fun.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.220]   I mean, I said, I started to call to I'll post it on Instagram that she was doing.
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:53.660]   It was just like a ridiculously intense workout because she's part of the Canadian team for
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.140]   roller derby now.
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.140]   And I got the notification.
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.460]   I sent a packet piece of pizza and I just got incredible side eyes as a response.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.060]   But it was a funny, very human.
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.060]   No, that's a great.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:07.700]   And by the way, the real point of the interaction is I saw what you did.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.700]   Good job.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.340]   Whether you send donuts, pizza or whatever, it's a communication.
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.980]   I have to say that is probably the single for me anyway.
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.460]   And this is one of the things about the Apple Watch.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:20.060]   It has a feature for everybody, but for me, the best feature of the Apple Watch because
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:25.180]   it doesn't, it's not so different from the LG Watch sport that, you know, in functionality,
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.380]   except that sharing thing really is a strong encouragement.
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.700]   I want to fill those rings.
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.140]   Those rings, that was actually quite smart.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.020]   It's the fitness and the authentication.
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:39.440]   Like anytime my Mac logs in or I use Apple Pay or I use a boarding pass, it just, it
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.440]   feels magical to me.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.540]   And that I think is a kind of moment that I've been waiting for.
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.540]   Those are by the way, you know, the added Android Pay.
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:48.740]   This is the first watch to my knowledge that has NFC and supports Android Pay.
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.380]   Everyone wants to do without it after you try it.
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.380]   That's a feature 2.0.
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.980]   It actually doesn't work quite as well as I think that it does.
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:55.980]   And the Apple Watch.
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.180]   You've played with it obviously.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.180]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.180]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:05.540]   So it's nice to, especially in an emerging new type of computing like this, it's really
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.900]   good to see a whole bunch of people taking a whole bunch of different swings at this.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.980]   The interesting thing to play with about this one is the fact that it is a completely
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.980]   GSM based watch so that you can leave the house without a phone.
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.980]   Right.
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:20.980]   And I like that.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:28.420]   Because you will get it in AT&T, at least, will let you sort of mirror your phone sims
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.580]   so you don't have to buy a separate account for it.
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.700]   So you will still get tech notifications.
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.260]   You can still get things like WhatsApp.
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.500]   You still can get online messaging.
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.500]   And you still can get navigation and data.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.500]   You can put it.
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.020]   It's got enough storage so you can put enough music on it that you can use it with your
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.020]   experience.
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.660]   Well, and this is something that the Apple Watch doesn't do.
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.460]   It streams because you have LTE connectivity.
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:54.300]   And that is a nice feature that you can walk out the door, no music on your watch, no phone
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.300]   in your pocket, and stream from Google Play music.
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.940]   It's interesting.
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:03.140]   It is way too big though for a regular person to daily wear unless they are committed to
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.140]   this concept.
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:08.700]   But it's interesting to see that as a concept of here is a mobile device that's not designed
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.020]   to be a 21st century computer.
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.020]   It is designed to keep, I'm leaving the house, I'm leaving the office for a reason because
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.340]   I don't want to be bothered.
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.260]   But I do want to still be in touch if something important happens.
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.140]   So no, you can't just zip me this Microsoft Word document.
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:27.260]   I'll do some edits and then click on my approvals to send it back to you.
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:32.980]   But if you tell me that, yeah, turns out that our vice president and operations has
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:37.180]   just taken $8.1 million out of the company checking account and it's in Aruba right now,
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.020]   you can't say, okay, I'm going a long launch canceled.
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.340]   I'm coming back to the office.
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.940]   So it's an interesting concept.
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.500]   We'll see if the other companies can build on it or, and particularly if they can build
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.860]   it smaller with better batteries, battery anytime you have any type of device like this, the
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.740]   battery is an absolute killer.
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.580]   If you did you find it anymore battery life?
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.420]   Yeah, for what you're expecting to do because with a phone, you don't, it doesn't have to
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:05.220]   even have to last all day, even though many phones like the iPhone certainly do because
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:10.620]   you get to the office or you get to get home and you plug it in and it's on the nightstand
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.060]   and you're still using it.
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.580]   You can't really take it off and top it up while you're working.
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:22.460]   So it's hard to get it to if I put it on at 9 a.m. at around four or five, I would have
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.900]   to start budgeting how I'm using this thing.
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.860]   We're asked with my Apple watch and my Android Wear watch.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:33.380]   I can count on a full day if I'm coming back home at the end of the day on a travel day,
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:38.740]   I can even, I can even leave and make it to my 11 p.m. like Redeye flight if I'm traveling,
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:43.460]   if I'm flying home, but if both watches are certainly not going to be ready for me for
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:47.620]   my getting my ride from the airport back to my house in the morning.
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.260]   But yeah, that's not enough.
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.740]   So it is just a first swing.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.380]   This isn't like this is the only watch that's going to be available.
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:58.340]   There are a lot of really cool things in Android Wear that as I love the fact that there
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:02.700]   are things in Apple watch that I wish would transfer over to Android Wear, there are
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.860]   things in Android where I wish would transfer over to Apple watch.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:11.180]   And I think in two years time, once people, once the system starts feeding, it's feeding
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.980]   on itself a little bit better, we're really going to have some great hardware and software.
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.220]   And the thing with Apple is that they did a lot of the experimenting internally, like
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.820]   they made all sorts of shapes and sizes and they had, as far as I know, a version that
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.700]   had LTE on it, but it's not just battery powered thermals.
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.700]   And when you look at the first generation Apple watch, that ran the S1 at the thermal
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:29.700]   limits.
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.900]   It just could not get any hotter and still be a shipping product.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:36.140]   And the ones that had cellular radios in them got super hella hot, especially when you're
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.140]   wearing them on your wrist.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:41.860]   And they decided that with the existing chip sets and existing power profiles and thermals,
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.180]   it would not be a great product to ship.
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:47.820]   So they're waiting until that sort of technology becomes more practical to meet the battery
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.060]   requirements that they have for them.
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.460]   But I think, as Andy said, as we see all the companies experiment with them internally
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:56.260]   and externally, we'll get to a point, maybe not soon where we have sort of that Tony Stark
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.620]   ideal where you have your watch and you press a button and your holographic display comes
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:03.860]   up or your augmented reality and you type away and goes back down and that's your everything
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:04.860]   device.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:05.860]   I mean, I'm looking forward to that.
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:11.940]   So we talk a little bit about other devices because it helps out Apple and everybody to
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:16.820]   see here are devices actually in the field being used by real people.
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:21.500]   And so that's where every company that's smart is going to get a lot of information
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:26.100]   from there's so many times where you can do so much internal testing and you can do so
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.660]   put so much thought into this and come up to so many rational conclusions, including,
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.940]   wow, but the thing is there is no pocket that is big enough to hold this phone.
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:41.180]   It is so big and ungainly, but then somebody gets crazy and says, okay, we will put a postcard
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.820]   sized phone out there and I'll be damned.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:48.940]   People people didn't see people haven't seen your research and you can't go door to door
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.540]   say, but I have research that says you don't want to buy this.
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:57.420]   So like I said, you have to it's really technology really is like putting on a play.
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.460]   You can spend all kinds of times writing it.
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.340]   You can put all kinds of times cat all kind of time casting it.
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.460]   You can be in rehearsals for four or five months, but you don't know what you have until you
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.140]   put in front of a paying audience.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.740]   Any Q buys one and four sees you make a small tablet.
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:12.740]   Yeah.
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:16.060]   You can just strap on an iPad mini.
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:20.540]   At least if you're going to make me feel stupid and please give me full functionality,
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.940]   give me full LTE streaming Netflix.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:23.940]   Yes.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.460]   Let's take a break.
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.460]   Come back.
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.700]   We're going to talk about all the it's some reason.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:33.580]   Why is this nonstop iPhone Runers this week?
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.220]   Is it because they're manufacturing it now or anything?
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:42.580]   Yeah, I mean, there are supply side leaks, I think, start wrapping up on this time.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.580]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:49.300]   Well, I'll get to your opinions on whether I hate covering rumors, especially nine, well,
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.860]   seven months out because we're probably not going to see the new iPhone until September.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.420]   You're just making it more outlandish.
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.420]   We'll just make it.
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.660]   Yeah, you can make up stuff at this point, including your clear phone.
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:00.660]   Yeah.
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.660]   And we'll get to that.
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.660]   So that's a killer tech.
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.660]   Yeah.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.500]   Well, we'll get to that, but we're also seeing them actually manufacturing phones that they're
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.700]   only thinking of making because they have to test them now.
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:11.700]   Exactly.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.700]   Exactly.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.060]   So take it all with a grain of salt, but we'll have it for you just because I know you're
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.740]   interested in a moment.
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.860]   Our show today brought to you by zip recruiter.
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:19.860]   Are you hiring?
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.620]   If you're in that position, you know, you have an important job.
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.620]   The person you hired to fill that opening in your company or the new position you've
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.740]   created in your company can make or break your company.
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.540]   It could be a great employee can change your company, transform it, take it to the moon,
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.460]   a bad employee can go on the other way.
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.940]   All right.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.420]   So let's hire the right person.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.620]   I know it's kind of a pain the worst time, you know, because you're already down somebody
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.500]   and now you got to go out and find somebody new.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.780]   I know I'm a business owner.
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.780]   I know how it is.
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:55.700]   It's no fun, but when we found zipper recruiter, it got a lot more fun and it got easier to
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:00.700]   find the perfect person because let's assume the right person is out there.
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:01.700]   How do you get to them?
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.140]   You know, what job board do you use?
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.460]   How do you reach them?
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.020]   How do you find that needle in a haystack?
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.580]   Well, zip recruiter really makes this a lot easier.

[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.740]   current resumes they already have in their database.
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.500]   And then more will come in and they all come into the zipper recruiter interface.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.420]   They do not come to your phone and mailbox.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.900]   No, they go to this easy to use interface.
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:49.260]   It automatically formats the resume so they're easy to read, you know, this kind of this
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.420]   uniform thing.

[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:44.700]   So, here we go.
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.700]   Rumor Central.
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:50.540]   Of all, this is not a rumor, but it does affect the rumors about the iPhone 8.
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:56.260]   Apple, apparently, some sharp-eyed person noticed on page four of the website at the
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:01.980]   Wireless Power Consortium that Apple was suddenly a member, not last week, but this
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:02.980]   week.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.660]   Now, that's the Qi charging standard.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.740]   A lot of phones use Qi, Qi, a lot of Qi pads out there.
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:10.740]   There's another one.
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.460]   There's the Power Pad, I think, or something like that.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.180]   But this runs counter to what we...
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.380]   People have been speculating, which frankly, I didn't credit much, though Apple was going
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.380]   to do some sort of charging at distance.
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.380]   Or you could just...
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.260]   I hate to be that guy, Leo, but Apple did inductive charging on the Apple Watch two
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:28.260]   years ago.
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.180]   So, even if there was no future charging, wireless charging...
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.180]   They're doing it already.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.180]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.180]   I mean, this is just...
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.940]   This has both nothing and everything to do with another iPhone.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.700]   It could just be the watch.
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:43.740]   By the way, they never said the watch is Qi, but I think it's like kind of Qi.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.340]   It's quasi-Qi compatible.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.140]   If you have a Qi charger and you can put the right sort of magnet with it, it will start
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:50.140]   to charge.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.820]   And I have charged Qi stuff with my Apple puck.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.820]   Yes.
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.820]   So I guess it's Qi-ish.
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:55.820]   Yes.
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.820]   I mean, it uses the same standard, but it's...
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:58.820]   I mean, you don't look Qi-ish.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:03.620]   We had fun with that because we had a bunch of Android Wear watches with Trinity Caldwell
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.460]   and Derek Kessler in a room and we were going through all the different adapters trying
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.940]   to see what would charge what.
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.700]   And you could charge any of them off the Apple one, but if you didn't have a magnet, the
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.740]   Apple Watch would not charge any of the Qi charge.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:13.740]   Ah, the magnet's critical.
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:14.740]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:21.540]   I don't know if that makes it non-conformant, but I think I like a magnet on a Qi charger
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:25.540]   because it sucks whatever it is, the phone or whatever into position.
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.540]   That's the big problem with Qi.
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:31.980]   And one of the reasons I think people are speculating Apple might do wireless at distance
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.260]   is because it's the accuracy.
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.260]   We talked about this last week is hard to get that right.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.140]   Yes, I feel a killer statement when he goes back to like, "I feel a killer is long said
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.940]   that he doesn't think that wireless charging was a mature technology."
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.540]   And then when they asked him, "Why Apple Watch?"
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.540]   He said, "Well, because we just think that it's more convenient for you to come down,
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.100]   put down your watch, not flush with cables."
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.620]   And that's easily extended to, "We think it's more convenient for you not to flush with
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:52.620]   cables or pads."
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.580]   If you put it within whatever it is, three, six, eight, ten inches.
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:56.580]   It has to be pretty close.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.580]   It has to be pretty close.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:58.580]   I'm not worried about it.
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.580]   Yeah.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.580]   So I don't know if you credit this.
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:06.540]   There's a study by a company called IHS Technology.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:11.220]   They did a consumer survey that showed that 90% of consumers want wireless charging on
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.220]   the next phone.
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.220]   Does that sound credible?
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.220]   No.
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:18.580]   I mean, it's so funny because Daniel Bader, who writes for Android Central, did an article
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:22.060]   about where has all the wireless charging gone in Android?
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.060]   It was so popular.
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.540]   Palm pre came out and Palm pre, I think, really jump-started the inductive charging.
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.940]   And then Samsung made a very Palm pre-like Galaxy S.
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.500]   Google doesn't do it now.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.500]   Yeah.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.500]   Yeah.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.980]   They stopped doing it and aside from Samsung, not a lot of people are pushing it.
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.940]   And it really, I mean, it hasn't changed much.
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.460]   And I think Qualcomm's high-speed charging sort of took the edge off of it because you
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:43.780]   can charge so fast off a cable now that it was really more of a convenience than you
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:44.780]   would have.
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.820]   I would like to see that in the iPhone 8.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.460]   They're wary of the battery implications still.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.340]   It stresses the battery, doesn't it?
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.340]   Yeah.
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:57.020]   So they do, like, if you put an iPad charger, it'll charge faster, but I think they're still
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.380]   conservative when it comes to how hard they hit the battery.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:05.580]   In general, you throw more amperage at the device, it will charge faster.
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.340]   More wattage, really.
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.300]   And since the USB, the Volter stuck at five--
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.780]   If you say Shazam, right, it will charge instant--
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:13.780]   Shazam!
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:19.180]   All right, well, that's-- so I take your point.
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.460]   It doesn't really mean anything that Apple joined the cheek consortium.
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.300]   No, usually the Apple has a love-hate relationship with these standards bodies because as much
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:30.020]   as they get compatibility from joining them, I think they often feel that they're restrictive
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:34.140]   and slow-moving and doesn't let them adapt and change and test and try and experiment,
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:38.540]   which is what we've seen them do and other everything from the World Wide Web Consortium
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.660]   to the USB when it came to making lightning and things like that.
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.260]   So I think they'll do what they want to do.
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.380]   And then when it suits their motivations or purposes, they'll also join the associations
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.940]   or standards committees.
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:52.700]   This one is more than a rumor, I think, and not at all surprising.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:29:01.580]   Apple has inked a second contract with Samsung to buy OLED panels.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.020]   The first contract was 60, I think, 60 million.
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.900]   And now they've got a second one for 100 million.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:12.220]   So we're talking something like 160 million OLED panels from Samsung that they've locked
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.220]   in.
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.980]   Samsung has not confirmed this for privacy reasons.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:20.780]   I am so not looking forward to all the burn-in-gate stories next year, Leo.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:21.780]   Why?
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.780]   Is OLED more prone to burn-in?
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:23.780]   Sure.
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:24.780]   I mean, OLED has burn-in issues.
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.420]   People complain about it on Android phones, on Apple watches, on television.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.420]   Really?
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:29.420]   I don't know that.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.420]   But no, it won't be a-- it's not a thing, but it will be a thing, I think, as an example.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.420]   I think it's out of the mix.
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:36.700]   I really like OLED screens, and I even bought an OLED TV.
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.540]   They become very, very good technology.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.860]   Yeah, I think that that is-- it's time, probably.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:42.860]   Quantum dot, too.
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.860]   That was a big question for me.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.860]   Would they just skip OLED and go to quantum dot?
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.380]   That looks like quantum dot is not where it needs to be yet for that to happen.
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:53.580]   Quantum dot is LCD, but a better LCD, despite the name.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.620]   None of these stuff are perfect technologies.
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.660]   All of them have their advantages and their disadvantages.
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.260]   Some have better power consumption, some have better saturation, some have better color
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.260]   reproduction.
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:05.580]   And it's just you always want to sort of pick the one that has-- that you can cover up the
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:09.460]   drawbacks the most and amplify the advantages the most for your product.
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:14.300]   Samsung, which puts OLEDs in all of its phones, is apparently, according to at least one rumor,
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.820]   building a dedicated facility for buying-- for building displays just for Apple.
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:25.540]   Because if you have to build 160 million, you're going to have to build a factory.
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:26.540]   I'm sorry, Andy.
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:27.540]   Andy's low.
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.540]   Maybe that's--
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.540]   Yeah.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.540]   Is it my Andrew?
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:31.540]   Yours.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.540]   I don't know.
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:33.540]   You sound good now.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:34.540]   I think it was ours.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:35.540]   Which means it was ours.
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:39.340]   No, I was just saying that the limiting factor on display technology is yield, particularly
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.220]   when you talk about a device like a phone, and particularly, particularly when you talk
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.020]   about a device like the iPhone.
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.380]   They have wonderful, wonderful display technologies.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:51.420]   We see at CES, for instance, Samsung and other companies, but mostly Samsung is really,
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.420]   really hot.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.100]   And look what we can do with flexible displays.
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.820]   And as a matter of fact, there's a rumor that they're going to be showing off behind
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:03.780]   the scenes and not with any sort of announcement, a actual folding-- basically, a flip phone
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.660]   that flips out into a full-size screen module.
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.180]   And it's not something that they're actually pitching.
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:14.940]   It's something that they're showing off to business people to say, would you buy 13.8
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:18.620]   million of these screens if we actually made this a real thing?
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.980]   It really is about how many can we manufacture?
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.620]   What's the reject rate going to be?
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:29.580]   And as Renee says, is it going to be a problem when people suddenly get a new style of screen
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.820]   on an existing phone that behaves differently than the other ones?
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.740]   Are they going to be sending phones back that are perfectly good, even because they don't
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:41.140]   understand that in the first three days of turning these things on, you are not going
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:45.460]   to be used to the colors or the angularity of the screen?
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:50.660]   All right, now we get into the weird rumor side.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:57.780]   The Mac Otakara, a Japanese Mac fan magazine, the rumor that Apple won't even use a lightning
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.180]   adapter, that everything will be wireless.
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.180]   Incredible?
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.180]   It's hard.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.540]   Well, even on an Apple watch, you have many lightning.
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:08.820]   It's just they pay over it so that people don't futs with it.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.820]   The Apple TV has a USB-C.
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.620]   I mean, I think we're still at the point where you absolutely need some way to heart.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:15.860]   It's like the Matrix, Leo.
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.700]   It's fun and games, but you need a hard line at some point.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.980]   But the two cases you mentioned, those are diagnostic purposes only.
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.660]   They're not user accessible.
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:28.300]   It could be conceivable that they'd build something that was not user accessible in
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.300]   the iPhone.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:33.500]   Yeah, but if you follow the logic flow on that, it's not efficient.
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.140]   Wireless charging is still not efficient.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:36.620]   It's super convenient, but it's not efficient.
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.020]   If you're going to have to put in a port for diagnostics anyway, and you've got this incredible
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:45.380]   accessory market for everything from tie-in cameras to audio devices, it seems far-fetched
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.220]   to me that they'll be willing to throw all that away at this point.
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:50.500]   Now, the question is, what does Apple gain by that?
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:55.900]   We had the big song advance, the goat and weasel show about why they deleted the headphone
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:56.900]   jack.
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.580]   There were some credible things to say about why it's in their benefit.
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.820]   Why is it in their benefit to delete all ports from it?
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.500]   They don't get anything from it.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:09.140]   As Renee said, it's not just of the convenience, or inconvenient, convincing users.
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.580]   It makes it really difficult when someone comes in with a broken phone.
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:16.740]   How do you get into the copper to ask the phone what's wrong, honey?
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:17.740]   Go tell mommy.
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.740]   It's okay.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:23.460]   When you have a completely wireless solution, you're limited as to what you can do, even
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:28.340]   if you do have full bore access as the developer of the device.
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.220]   How about this one from Digitives?
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.140]   This is the room around up.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.780]   Apple reportedly planning an iris scanner in the iPhone 8.
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.780]   That's not that wouldn't be the first time we saw an iris scanner in the Note 5.
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:40.860]   I was Note 7.
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:47.380]   I mean, it's a cool thing to put.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.980]   If you're competing against 18 different manufacturers that are making the exact same
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:55.340]   thing as you make, if you're making the iPhone, you don't have to bother with iris scanning.
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:56.660]   No one's complaining about iris scanning.
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.140]   No one's complaining about it.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.820]   Fingerprints fine.
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:04.580]   I had iris scanning both on a Windows phone, a Lumia phone, which was really unusable.
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.980]   I would say, okay, okay, okay, up now.
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:07.980]   Down, down, down.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.980]   Right.
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:09.980]   Right, right, right.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:15.020]   The Samsung Note 7 was much better, but it's still not anywhere as fast or easy as a fingerprint.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.020]   Far-throated.
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.020]   Are you retaining water?
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.500]   Yeah, you're going to go like this.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:25.980]   Now I should point out Microsoft Windows Hello, which is an authentication platform, but it
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.500]   has face recognition that is really great.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.300]   It's fast, it's effective, it can wear glasses or not.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.780]   I mean, it's really good.
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.780]   And that might not be it.
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.780]   We've seen that in some Samsung phones before too, but not very much.
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.740]   Yeah, and I was going to make the exact same point.
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.140]   It's also situational.
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:47.620]   The idea of having Windows Hello means that you sit down at your computer and as you're
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:50.380]   reaching for your coffee, it authenticates you.
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:56.940]   Whereas with a phone, fingerprint recognition is now so ingrained into us that as we're taking
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.620]   it out of our pockets, we are putting our finger on the place that authenticates us.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:05.540]   And by the time it's up at our faces, it's not a solution to a problem that anybody is
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.260]   complaining about.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:12.820]   If anything, the only thing I can think about and this is just having a conversation conjecture
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.340]   is that it's winter.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.060]   I'm wearing gloves all the time.
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:19.900]   I have to take off my glove to wake up my phone.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:24.100]   And this is where I'm switching back to a pin-based authentication because I can at
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:29.020]   least keep my inner glove liner that has that little sensor, that little copper pad on it.
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:34.020]   I can at least keep some of my skin covered up if I'm just authenticating my phone.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:39.500]   But again, you have to look at what problem does this solve for anybody, manufacturer
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.580]   or user.
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:45.540]   And more importantly, how does this help Apple or anybody sell more phones?
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:49.180]   And that's just, again, it's a fun thing to speculate about, but no.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.180]   Yeah.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:54.180]   And my big dream for this stuff, also one thing is biometrics are username and not password
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.900]   and their convenience and not security.
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.980]   So they don't make your device safer.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.100]   They just give you alternate ways of getting into it.
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:04.860]   So my big dream is still ambient authentication where I no longer have to do a lot of actions,
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.500]   but it catches a glimpse of my face.
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.500]   It registers a bit of my fingerprint no matter where I'm touching it on the phone.
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.700]   It knows my gate.
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.220]   It knows my pulse or whatever.
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.220]   And it just knows that it's me.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.300]   I don't have to worry so much about deliberate authentication.
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.180]   That is definitely the next...
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.740]   I don't think that's even a long way off.
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.780]   Google says they're already doing that because you as you walk around.
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.060]   In fact, that's an...
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:28.460]   You kind of nailed it, Nandy, when you said, "Well, face recognition makes sense at a
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:32.300]   computer," but for a phone, you want something entirely different.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.300]   I think you're right.
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:37.100]   I think Apple could even implement this year.
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:44.780]   Your phone really knows it's you from so many of these incidental tips that it really
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.020]   could just not work unless it's you.
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:55.980]   Yeah, we talked a while ago about how just the system of the Glass Keyboard on iOS, it's
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.780]   not just as simple as if the user touches inside this rectangle.
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:00.940]   That's the letter I.
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.300]   It has to figure out, "Okay, it's not really on the eye.
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:09.900]   It could be the eye or the O, but given where he landed this keystroke and the previous two
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:14.980]   letters, I'm betting that he actually wanted to get a U instead of an I."
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:17.060]   And so that's why you get the U instead of the I.
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:21.340]   There are researchers that are working on stuff like that where, "Okay, not only is
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:25.860]   it recognizing a fingerprint, but how squarely is this person putting that...
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:27.380]   finger on the pad?"
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:30.940]   And it's this different from the way this person normally activates the phone.
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.300]   Is this a time when this user normally activates a phone?
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:35.300]   Is this a place?
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.300]   Is it at a certain angle?
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.740]   There are all kinds of metrics that are being added to this.
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:44.380]   Just an experimental way to say, "Is it possible to authenticate somebody just by context and
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:49.340]   make it accurate enough to at least put it into play as an alternative?"
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.700]   So far no, but it's really, really interesting to...
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:55.700]   I was talking to one researcher that says about a year ago who was telling me about
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:38:00.260]   he thought that he'd get about 60% of it just by the angle at which you're holding the phone
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:01.940]   when you try to unlock it.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:07.220]   So he says that he could make it so that it would at least, if you make a mistake, it
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:12.020]   will give you the benefit of the doubt in the interest of getting you to your data quicker,
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.580]   but it wouldn't be something he would trust for an actual security check.
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.540]   Well, that's one factor, but what if you had 20 different factors and you combined all
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.540]   of them?
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.820]   Right, that's what he's talking about.
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:26.740]   But by saying just by saying that, "Well, look, he almost never holds it like this.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.540]   He almost never holds it like that."
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:34.540]   So I'm going to be prejudiced against accepting a pin that maybe is not quite correct.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:39.260]   I'm sorry, meaning that combining that with the actual keypad control, did he get it
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.780]   close enough that I think that this combined with other factors I'm willing to trust that
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.540]   that was a three intended to tap instead of a four?
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.780]   Yes, I'm willing to accept that as a three.
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:52.500]   So put the year after the right, we could get to a state where given that all the radios
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:56.820]   are on, given that all the sensors are on, it could figure out that he is lifting up
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:01.700]   his phone in a context and in a way that is consistent with 99% of the way times that
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:05.300]   he or she normally lifts up his or her phone to use this thing.
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:09.420]   Yeah, and you combine that with the fact that his gate was identifiable.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.980]   He's in a location that we know.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.140]   I see his face.
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.940]   I hear his voice.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:20.500]   I mean, I think you add, if you add all of those factors, I think you can have almost
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.500]   certain identification.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.140]   I mean, really, really strong identification.
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:28.580]   Some of the features that Renee really likes, where if he authenticates his watch properly
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:33.980]   in the morning and keeps it on his wrist, the rest of the iOS and macOS infrastructure
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.780]   will trust that it's still yours.
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:40.660]   So you can also apply that to unlocking a phone where the last time that this person
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:46.500]   unlocked the phone, he type in an a key pin and also for another transaction, he actually
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.020]   uses fingerprint.
[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:52.460]   And from the sensor readings that we have taken in the 11 minutes since he did that,
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:56.060]   it is not consistent with him leaving this alone or passing to somebody else.
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:57.340]   He's still within his control.
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.460]   And therefore, I'm just going to let the phone wake up on its own.
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.460]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:02.460]   I love multi-factor.
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.740]   Like I love the fingerprint and the Bluetooth trusted object.
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:05.740]   I bet.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:10.380]   I bet we're months, years, a year or two at most away from that.
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:15.260]   Google had a patent and a gate recognition patent in 2010.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:20.940]   Just getting acceptable error ratios, I think, to make it a consumer product is the last
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:21.940]   hurdle.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:22.940]   Yeah.
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.860]   I think Google's even said it's working on this.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:28.940]   So it's really almost a raise between Apple and Android at this point.
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:32.700]   It's ironic because we were talking about that in Android Wear 2.0.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:37.780]   It has, because it has Apple Pay capability and the LG Sport does, or I'm sorry, Android
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.020]   Pay capability.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.940]   It has to do something like the Apple Watch does to make sure that somebody didn't borrow
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.420]   your watch and use it.
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.580]   It's pin based or password based.
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:53.900]   It really shows you how much more elegant and how well thought out Apple's watches compared
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:58.340]   to what, even with the example of the Apple Watch, Android ended up doing.
[00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.340]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.180]   Some of the stuff is non-trivial to implement.
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.180]   I guess so.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.940]   I guess they couldn't do it.
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:05.940]   Any other rumors?
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:11.100]   Let's see, there was that rumor that there's so, do we, I don't know, we don't know anything.
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:12.580]   Do we think there'll be three phones?
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.020]   Based on past behavior.
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:17.300]   Do we think there'll be one that's over a thousand dollars?
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.260]   The current one's over a thousand dollars.
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.460]   Yeah, it starts at 750.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:23.460]   Base unit.
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:31.420]   If they did sort of a, if they introduce the iPhone edition, let's say, and know they're
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.020]   not going to make it out of solid gold.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.540]   Ceramically make me happy.
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.540]   Exactly.
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:39.780]   If they decided that we can make this an exclusive thing, we can internally say that we're not
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:43.940]   going to make more than 50,000 of these, not announce this as a limited edition, but simply
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:48.460]   say that we're internally say that we're going to, we feel as though we can do 60,000
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:53.140]   of these based on that amount of money, we would have to charge X dollars or I'm sorry,
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.140]   60,000.
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:58.180]   Let's call it half a million just to make it non ridiculous.
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.140]   But yeah, I could see them doing it.
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:03.380]   I don't know if they would do it as, hey, it's the 10th anniversary.
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:07.140]   I don't think they've had enough bad, they've had enough bad, bad history with, hey, this
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:11.140]   is the X anniversary edition of our hardware.
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:15.900]   But yeah, they could say that we are making something that is an exciting jewel, like jewelry,
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.660]   like piece of a piece of hardware.
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:22.500]   Wasn't that 25 anniversary, I'm a very limited edition or not?
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.340]   I feel like it was.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:27.780]   I think it was the 20th.
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:31.780]   It was supposedly limited, but they, they, they didn't sell any.
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.100]   So they didn't have to worry about it.
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.100]   They, they had plenty.
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.100]   Don't worry.
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:40.860]   I mean, like it was like the, like the appointments for the, for the gold, gold apple watch, like
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:43.540]   we're going to be taking appointments eight months in advance.
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.260]   You have a 15 minute window.
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.220]   Then by day three, yeah, you know, here we go.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.220]   Yeah.
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.220]   Here you go.
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.660]   For me, it's like apples a secretive company, but they're also a very logical company and
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:56.420]   they tend to do things that are, and they don't tend to do a lot of crazy items.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.820]   They don't do a lot of really wild stuff.
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:02.420]   So if you look at what their lineup is like now with the iPhone SE, iPhone 6S, 6S, plus
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:06.540]   7 plus and you shift that forward a year, they have to have an entry level model.
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.060]   They have to have a model that's just one step behind for people who don't want to pay
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.540]   full price for things.
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:14.180]   And then they did with iPad Pro and they announced the 20 inch, sorry, the 13 inch
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:15.580]   iPad Pro.
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:18.900]   That was considerably more expensive than the iPads of the time.
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:22.620]   And that in the, sorry, the iPhone 7 plus was $20 more expensive.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.460]   And they found there is some elasticity in the market.
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:28.660]   So if they want to go with an iPhone Pro and position it as, this is like the new top of
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:29.660]   the end.
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.900]   So they have to have to have to have a little bit of a price.
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:36.540]   And then they have to have a little bit of a price for them.
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:39.180]   And then they have to have a little bit of a price for them.
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:42.620]   And then they have to have a little bit of a price for them.
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.740]   And then they have to have a little bit of a price for them.
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.380]   And then they have to have a little bit of a price for them.
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:50.300]   And then they have to have a little bit of a price for them.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.980]   And then they have to have a little bit of a price for them.
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:56.500]   And then they have to have a little bit of a price for them.
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:00.660]   Yeah, well, so I think Apple is the only company that could really pull this off.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:04.820]   There have been a lot of phone makers going back to the Nokia days who would say, well,
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:08.980]   we've got lots of really, really rich people using our phones and they want to make sure
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:14.500]   that they, that bank people see that they're not using the basic free with contract phone.
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:18.620]   Ours has a special jeweled case and it's an Onyx inlay.
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:25.260]   And this is this $5,000 device that has concierge service and comes in a personalized rose word
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:26.940]   presentation box.
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:32.220]   And yeah, you could get some press with it, but it's like the $5,000 cheeseburger that
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.700]   you can buy it by in New York, eatery.
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.900]   It's there to get promote, get PR.
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:42.020]   Apple could actually sell, I think, $1,000 or $1,500 phone.
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:47.060]   If they make it really nice, if it's not just, we took the, not, not just, we took the same
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:52.500]   mold that we normally pour cheap metal into and we've poured an expensive metal into it.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:58.100]   That's not as good as saying that that's, how do we know you didn't just buy one of the,
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:02.540]   one of the cases that comes out three months later that you can buy on eBay from a Chinese
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:06.260]   manufacturer for $18 to make it look like the expensive phone.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:10.220]   But if they, they, and the other thing is that, remember that people are kind of been,
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:14.940]   we've been beaten down into expecting that we might not be able to buy the device, exact
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.740]   device and the exact configuration we want, when we walk into the store, they can make
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.140]   it a limited edition without really announcing it.
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:24.780]   They could simply say that they could simply announce it as something that we're making
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:29.580]   it in lesser quantities, but there's no cap on the, on the, on the, on the run and just
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:33.500]   expect that people are going to have to chase after store, after store to buy their special
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:39.620]   edition red ceramic iPhone 12.
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:45.100]   I love this headline from nine to five Mac target calls Apple Pay Awesome says it's working
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.140]   on bringing support to its stores.
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:49.140]   Nope.
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:54.140]   It all started with a tweet from a target customer support saying Apple Pay is awesome.
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:57.580]   We're, this is a response to a question on Twitter.
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.580]   We're working on getting this technology into our stores.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.220]   We'll catch up with the 21st century soon.
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.460]   And okay.
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:07.060]   And then everybody said, wow, target, which has been kind of notable in its refusal to
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.500]   do Apple Pay.
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:14.100]   Uh, when, when this story broke nine to five, got an email from targets clarifying that
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.300]   the Twitter support account was incorrect.
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:19.220]   And it is not currently exploring it and greeting Apple Pay in its stores.
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:23.900]   We have no plans or work underway currently to make Apple Pay available in our stores.
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:26.660]   We got, we offered for online purchases.
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:31.020]   And while we're exploring mobile wallet opportunities for our stores, we have no updates to share.
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:33.620]   Why is target against Apple Pay?
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.900]   Originally they were, they signed an alternative.
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:36.900]   I completely re-read that.
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:37.900]   Oh, they were part of the Walmart deal.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:38.900]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:42.180]   And the rumor was that as soon as that they, they had an out on that clause, they'd be
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.700]   adopting Apple Pay, but then that, that just didn't materialize.
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.260]   Because currency died.
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:49.700]   It's, it's dead.
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:50.700]   There was no solution.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.140]   I died a deathly death.
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:54.100]   I died a deathly death.
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:59.540]   Uh, talking part of it, the part of it though is, uh, believe it or not, just training, how
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:03.140]   much is, how much is it going to cost to retrain all of our employees or change our
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:04.540]   training materials to include?
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:06.380]   Here's what happens when someone wants to pay with their phone.
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:09.020]   Do they not do touch to pay at all now?
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:11.660]   Um, I have been in a target in a while.
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:12.660]   I can't remember.
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:15.620]   I've been in three or four months and that's, that's another part of their problem.
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:19.340]   The things that I would typically buy at a target are either available at the store that
[00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:22.820]   I walk to that's only a mile and a half away from my house or something that's more convenient
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:24.700]   for me to buy on Amazon because I'm willing to wait.
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:28.180]   I'll, I'll, you know, I'm willing to wait two days for paper towels.
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.340]   That's perfectly fine by me.
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:34.940]   Um, and it also comes back to will this cause us to get, will this, will this cause more
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:39.540]   people to shop a target and or will it cause, will it save us more money and loss prevention
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:43.900]   through fraud than it will to simply to retrain people and to make sure that all of our hardware
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.660]   is consistent across the line.
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:46.660]   It's funny.
[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:48.980]   I wasn't targeting me a month ago and I didn't even notice.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.500]   That's how little I really care about this.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:55.860]   Weird thing is that like Twitter X and our chair, I'm saying target does not do NFC at
[00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:56.860]   all in any form.
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:00.180]   You see, that's the weird thing because target failed in, in Canada, but it was here briefly
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:04.100]   and it just did, I used Apple pay there because they use it everywhere.
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.620]   Any store you go to has to have to pay.
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:09.060]   So any store here takes Apple pay and I'm assuming Android pay as well.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.980]   It all comes, it comes with the package.
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:13.580]   No, again, no one wonders which store is going to be using Apple pay.
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:18.580]   Well, the sad thing is we got chips now and it stores that don't do touch to pay.
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:22.820]   It's a pain to use a chip card as you push it in and you leave it in and it's a much slower
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.060]   process than the old swipe process.
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.060]   Yeah, we got used to it.
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:28.620]   I mean, that's all we had for about five or seven or even 10 years.
[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:29.860]   So we just all get used to using it.
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:32.540]   And that's why it was a revelation when we got to have to pay.
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:35.340]   And now increasingly websites are giving me Apple pay.
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:38.460]   The story I'm going to talk about later, I used Apple pay for that and I used Apple
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:40.340]   pay to buy some software this morning.
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:42.860]   And I have the scanner on my phone or my computer.
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:46.220]   I just tap my finger and it's done and it's so convenient.
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:52.180]   Speaking of the 21st century, let's go back to the last century when macro malware used
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:53.380]   to be a problem on the Mac.
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:54.380]   It's back.
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.940]   Oh, yay, yay.
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:04.180]   So Mac malware has been discovered in Microsoft Word documents with auto running Mac rows.
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:09.340]   Does Word not give you this dialogue that I'm showing right here, this document contains
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:10.340]   macros?
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:12.620]   Do you want to run them?
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:16.820]   Doesn't it warn you or does this actually automatically run?
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:22.100]   I guess if you enable macros, the automatic macro starts to run a Python script, which
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:26.540]   checks to see if little snitch is running because it doesn't want to get caught.
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:31.220]   So another reason to use little snitch, then it downloads a second stage payload because
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:35.140]   little snitch would say, hey, somebody's trying to do an outbound transaction, it downloads
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:39.980]   a second stage payload from a specific URL decrypts a payload, executes its content and
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:43.460]   of course what was in the payload will malware.
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:48.220]   The Python code itself is sourced from the open source empire project.
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:50.340]   The code is used almost verbatim.
[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:53.700]   Fortunately, the payload file now is inaccessible.
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:59.780]   So that the site that was offering that has been shut down.
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:07.940]   So it's not, in other words, particularly sophisticated malware, but this used to be
[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:08.940]   effect.
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:12.540]   This was, you know, the first Mac malware I ever got, I think was a word macro.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:15.420]   Melissa was a word macro.
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:18.140]   1999.
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:22.940]   So we can, we can virus like it's 1999 speaking of which Prince is back.
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:24.460]   Everybody streams and prints.
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:31.660]   Man, Apple music got him, but so does Spotify and a lot of other streaming services.
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:36.380]   It turns out that it's the, oh, look at this is good.
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:38.500]   That is a, that pop up.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:43.260]   I see what you did there with cats looking at you is saying, here you are at venture beat
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:44.460]   running an ad blocker.
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.340]   How dare you?
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:47.340]   You don't have to unblock.
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:48.620]   Just click, click away from it.
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:49.860]   No, you have to do that.
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.620]   Yeah, just goes away.
[00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:52.620]   That's the least intrusive.
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:54.220]   I don't blame him.
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:56.340]   We run ad blockers just so you understand.
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:01.740]   So you don't see a whole bunch of ads while we're trying to show you sites.
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:04.340]   Although Carson, you got to get a better ad blocker on there.
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:06.740]   Adblock plus really?
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:07.740]   Come on.
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:08.740]   We got to see kitties.
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:11.900]   Well, I know I'm completely sidetracked.
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.820]   What was I talking about?
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:14.820]   Prince purple one.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:15.820]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:20.460]   So he, you know, he famously pulled his music from streaming services because he felt it
[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:24.840]   didn't get, you know, he didn't get paid appropriately, didn't honor his music, but
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.420]   his estate has different plans.
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:33.260]   So they've restored it to Google Play Apple Music Spotify and other services.
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.460]   Yeah, that's a good move.
[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:39.660]   A lot of, you see a lot of things happen when the original creator be it a writer, be it
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.300]   a cartoonist, be it a, be it a musician.
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:46.940]   When they die, their intensity over certain issues is no longer that louder argument at
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:50.860]   the table, it's not just, and we're not just talking about making money off of the person's
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:51.860]   catalog.
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:56.420]   We're talking about the surviving relatives, surviving families, surviving business
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:57.860]   or socials and friends.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:00.900]   They're like, how do we keep this person's name alive?
[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:05.060]   And people might be, might have complaints about Snoopy being on the Metropolitan Life
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:09.940]   blimp, but it kept, it kept that character in people's minds and reminding them that
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:11.140]   this thing exists.
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:17.980]   There's a complaints when, I think it was Julian, might have been Julian Lennon, when
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:23.940]   Yoko Bono and the estate approved the use of John Lennon quote or John Lennon movie or
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:24.940]   something.
[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:26.700]   And I think it was a, was it a Volkswagen ad?
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.380]   And there was some backlash about how, oh, you know, he wouldn't have, he would never
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:33.900]   have proved it this and said, well, look, you know, if we have an ad running in 20 different
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:38.740]   countries for two weeks, that is something that may, that might be the first time anybody
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:42.340]   has heard of our, of our father and checks into their music.
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:48.740]   And so if it's, I spent the weekend deciding to listen to all the David Bowie albums that
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:54.420]   I somehow missed, you know, every, the last half of his career, he was doing such a collective,
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:56.900]   eclectic work and sometimes I would miss one or two.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:00.580]   And because his music is on streaming, I got caught up on like eight different albums
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:05.660]   that I would certainly not have spent the $90 or $100 to buy these albums, just to sample
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:06.660]   them.
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:09.020]   And I think that's a lot of people who have heard all about Prince and they've heard the
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:12.900]   two hits, who have never heard even the Purple Rain soundtrack from start to finish.
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:18.860]   And now they can actually look into his discography and then become fans and then carry his, carry
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.900]   that fandom to an X generation.
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.140]   So it's not just about the money.
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:24.740]   It really is about we want his music to stay alive.
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:29.740]   We want people to understand him, not as somebody who had a sexually suggestive guitar, but
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:33.940]   someone who was one of the most, one of the most incredible musicians and performers of
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:34.940]   any generation.
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:40.860]   And I'm staying on Bruno Mars doing the Prince tribute on the Grammy Awards with the guitar.
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:42.860]   How do you feel about that?
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:50.180]   Boy, it's like, it's like singing a Janis Joplin song that she absolutely owns.
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:53.860]   It's like, yeah, I love Bruno Mars.
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:57.940]   If anybody could do Prince, it's Bruno Mars, but maybe he shouldn't have done like, shouldn't
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:02.300]   have done a Prince tribute band, but just, just son and son.
[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:07.980]   And by the way, Morris Day in the time, still got it, still got it.
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:08.980]   That was awesome.
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:13.100]   I had to take back 3% of the bad things I've said about Apple Music lately because I loaded
[00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:14.780]   it up as soon as it was available.
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:17.620]   And I went to the Prince playlist and it started with the Batman song.
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:18.620]   Oh, wow.
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:19.620]   That is.
[00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:21.620]   Yeah, the front load.
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:22.620]   Yeah, you want Prince.
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:23.620]   We know you like Batman.
[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:24.620]   We'll give you that one first.
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:27.540]   They might have made and known that because I don't think I've ever even heard the Prince
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:28.540]   Batman song.
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:29.540]   Oh, man.
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:30.540]   The soundtrack.
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:31.540]   This is, this is what I was talking about.
[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:33.940]   I was, of course, a fan of the fan of the movie.
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:35.260]   I bought the soundtrack.
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:39.660]   I wanted to, I wanted the Danny Elfman music, but I got this Prince song and reminded me,
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:42.980]   oh, that's that guy who had that music that I'd heard of before.
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:47.900]   And that actually got me buying Prince albums instead of just the singles.
[00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:48.900]   Yeah.
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.940]   Somebody said the Prince tribute band should be called Prance.
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:52.940]   Okay.
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.340]   That's, that's good.
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:57.060]   Nice one, Jay in our chat room.
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.860]   Let's take a break.
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.060]   Raspberry, Raspberry.
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:01.060]   Raspberry.
[00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:07.180]   Uh, Apple sponsored the B-Sides Security Conference, by the way.
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:08.180]   Nice Apple.
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:09.180]   Thank you.
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:10.180]   Good job.
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:16.980]   That's a great security conference and other supporting sponsors, Google and Dropbox, but
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:19.260]   not one of the two leading sponsors.
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:20.260]   Okay.
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:21.260]   Fine.
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:23.900]   Hacker one and Fitbit with leading sponsors.
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:28.460]   Our show today brought to you by Jamf.
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:34.220]   It's the hard to say name that really can help you and your Apple network.
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:39.620]   Big time JAMF, the gold standard for managing Apple devices in the workplace.
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:42.340]   10,000 customers around the globe.
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:47.820]   7 million max iPads and iPhones managed by Jamf.
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:51.740]   Jamf helps IT provide the user friendly experience employees expect from their Apple
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:52.740]   devices.
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:56.860]   That's why they brought them into the workplace while empowering them to be their most productive
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:57.860]   self.
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:58.860]   You know what?
[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:01.140]   I think it's time IT gets some love, baby.
[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:03.340]   Unvalentines Day, some love.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:07.140]   You may remember Jamf pro formerly Casper suite, right?
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.380]   Now it's called Jamf Pro.
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:13.540]   It's the tool you need to deploy devices without even touching them.
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.540]   Automate device status and updates.
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:22.580]   Keep inventory data on hardware and software and ensure device security.
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:25.940]   Jamf Pro offers, I really like this idea for the business.
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:28.500]   The customizable enterprise app store.
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:31.460]   So your users can take care of themselves.
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:35.860]   They can install the apps and update the software from that store that they need to
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:37.620]   do their job.
[00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:39.820]   World class support and training.
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:44.180]   Jamf is the best solution for managing Apple.
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:49.780]   You know, a couple of years ago, we talked a lot about IBM decided to give employees a
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:50.780]   choice.
[00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:51.780]   PCs are max.
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:58.820]   One of the items that IBM was loaded with Max and IBM said, whoa, we got to do something.
[00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:03.460]   They went to Jamf Pro that helped them deploy fast.
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:08.740]   And over a year now, they have more than 90,000 max at IBM.
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:11.820]   It's the largest Mac deployment in the world.
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:12.820]   And they do it all.
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:13.820]   And this is Jamf Pro.
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:15.940]   You got to give props to Jamf Pro.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:20.660]   They do it all with five IT admins, five.
[00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:23.620]   That's the power of Jamf Pro.
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:25.660]   Now there actually a number of solutions.
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:28.820]   So there's Jamf now that used to be called Bushl.
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:29.820]   It's all called Jamf now.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:31.700]   So they got Jamf now Jamf Pro.
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:35.700]   Jamf now is fast, accessible, very affordable cloud-based management.
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:39.220]   If you're a small business, you don't know, we'll have to go with a Pro solution.
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:41.380]   You don't even need IT, frankly, with Jamf now.
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:43.220]   Anyone can support users in the workplace.
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:44.220]   You probably could do it.
[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:47.900]   If you're watching the show, you certainly have enough Mac knowledge to do this.
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:52.500]   And it's everything you need in a small business and no extra stuff and no training, no documentation
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:53.500]   required.
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:57.740]   You can use Jamf now to remotely configure device settings, mass distribute apps, enforce
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:01.060]   security measures like passcodes and lost mode.
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:05.660]   You know, if you've got people in your enterprise with iPhones, you bought and they're not turning
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:08.700]   on, find my iPhone.
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:09.700]   That's annoying.
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:12.020]   I think I bossed, I lost my iPhone.
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:14.300]   Well, do you have find my iPhone?
[00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:15.700]   No, I didn't ever turn it on.
[00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:19.660]   Well with Jamf now, you could turn it on, set up, manage, and protect your Apple devices
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:20.660]   in minutes.
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:24.780]   Whether you got 10 devices or 10,000, Jamf helps you empower your end users to be more productive
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:26.140]   all while making your life easier.
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:29.940]   I'm going to use it at home for my kids because that's really nice.
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:31.340]   My kids lost my phone.
[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:32.660]   No, you didn't lose your phone.
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:34.060]   Turn on, find my iPhone.
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:38.060]   Go to Jamf.com/Macbreak to find out how Jamf makes life easier for IT users.
[00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:42.740]   In fact, you can try, you can get a trial, a free trial of Jamf Pro.
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:47.860]   But if you use Jamf now, you can use it for the first three devices, enough for my kids,
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:52.140]   free forever, free forever.
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:54.340]   So this is a great family solution, right?
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:56.180]   Jamf now.
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:01.980]   And then once you get how great it is, bring it to your work, Jamf.com/Macbreak.
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:03.980]   Jamf.com/Macbreak.
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:09.580]   Love having kind of the legendary Jamf team be part of our show.
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:10.580]   That's nice.
[00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:14.300]   One of the greats in the Apple business.
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.220]   Let's see.
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:20.100]   Let's talk about the planet of the apps.
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.500]   We've been hearing about this.
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:23.060]   This is a show.
[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:25.500]   You could guess it's a reality-based show.
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:27.020]   Shark Tank for apps.
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:30.020]   Shark Tape, sort of Shark Tanky.
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:38.660]   It was created by Will I Am and brought to the networks.
[00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:44.380]   And somebody said, "Hey, you really ought to take this to Eddie and see if Eddie's interest.
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:45.980]   Maybe Apple would want to do this."
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:49.300]   And they did.
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:53.540]   The weird thing is you present your app to Jessica Alba.
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:55.780]   Yes, Jessica Alba.
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:57.500]   She's an entrepreneur.
[00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.140]   She's got a really big business with her.
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.140]   What is it?
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.140]   Honest?
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.140]   Will I Am?
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.620]   I don't know how Gwyneth Paltrow fits it in the mix.
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:08.140]   She has a company, Gloop, or Gloop, I forget what it's called.
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:09.140]   Gloop.
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:10.140]   That's her company.
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:11.140]   That's right.
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.140]   Anyway, okay, good.
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:13.140]   I feel really bad.
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:16.900]   I think it was building blackberries in the bottom of the water loop.
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:18.900]   I feel terrible for Gary Vaynerchuk.
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:21.020]   Look at this picture again.
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.780]   This is the planet of the apps.
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:25.740]   And they mentioned Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, Will I Am.
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:27.060]   But there's a fourth judge.
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.940]   They even cut him off in the picture.
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:30.860]   That's Gary V.
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:31.860]   Cut off.
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:33.540]   Wait, I'll mention Gary V.
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:34.540]   Who's Gary?
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:35.540]   Nobody under Gary V.
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:36.540]   Gary.
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:37.540]   I'm so sorry.
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:39.540]   At least Gary got to sit next to Gwyneth Paltrow.
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:42.420]   I bet she smells great.
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:44.340]   She probably smells like apples.
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:47.340]   As Iron Man Armor, I wouldn't mess with her.
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.940]   That's right.
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:52.060]   Pepper pots and the invisible woman on the same panel.
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:53.260]   What's Will I Am doing there?
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:54.260]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:55.260]   What superpower does he have?
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.420]   Yeah, what's Will I Am superpower?
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:59.500]   His superpower is gold boots, baby.
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:05.620]   His superpower is the ability to take a DeLorean and make it even uglier.
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:06.620]   I love it.
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:09.620]   The idea is that the idea is that the idea seems to be wearing...are those air pods?
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:11.100]   No, they've got wires.
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.620]   Are they apple earbuds?
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:13.620]   No.
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:14.620]   Are they beat?
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:15.620]   Beat X?
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:16.620]   Are they beats?
[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:17.620]   Maybe they're beat X.
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.940]   Yeah, I'm sure that somebody at Apple would prevent him from wearing a competitor's.
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:21.940]   Eddie ran up.
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:22.940]   No.
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:23.940]   Dappin'.
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:27.140]   Apparently instead of an elevator pitch...oh this sounds terrible.
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:29.620]   Developers and entrepreneurs make an escalator pitch.
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:30.860]   Literally.
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.980]   They're on an escalator.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:37.140]   The reaction to this show from people in our community must be what the reaction to Cook's
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:38.380]   had to like Hell's Kitchen.
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:40.980]   Success is a long term.
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:44.020]   This is an ad for BMW.
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:47.500]   Is they going to show me...because there's a trailer for the show, right?
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:48.500]   YouTube.com/Apple.
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:49.500]   Of course.
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:50.500]   Of course.
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.660]   And I am a YouTube red subscriber.
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:53.900]   I shouldn't have to watch ads.
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:54.900]   Here we go.
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:57.460]   This is work to earn millions of dollars.
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:58.460]   Oh, this is Rico.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.460]   No, no.
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:02.700]   Let me go to youtube.com/apple.
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:03.700]   That's why there was an ad on it.
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:04.700]   This is recodes.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:07.420]   They recoded the trailer.
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:09.500]   What is this?
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:13.300]   YouTube.com/apple does not work.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.820]   I get a pitch for Apple TV.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:17.380]   Oh no.
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:18.740]   Signing on your app.
[01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:21.180]   Thank you Planet.
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:27.140]   What if you were able to find exactly the new story you wanted at its original source?
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:30.140]   Well, my startup has an idea.
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.140]   Here we go.
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:32.140]   The apps.
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:33.140]   Let me unmute.
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.300]   The episode.
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:36.780]   App developers work to earn millions of dollars.
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:37.780]   Millions.
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:38.780]   Venture capital investment.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:39.780]   Because it's not a reality show.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:44.500]   If you don't have a tradition at the world's most culturally and influential entrepreneurs,
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.060]   will I am?
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:47.900]   Developers are the rock stars of right now.
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:48.900]   Jessica Alba.
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:51.940]   I have that gut and that intuition and so far.
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:52.940]   She's never quite.
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:53.940]   It's been right.
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.940]   Gary Vaynerchuk.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.740]   You've actually completely sold me on the tech advantage.
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.060]   And Gwyneth Paltrow.
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:02.580]   As consumers of news, we have a real trust issue.
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:07.940]   The developers have just 60 seconds on the escalator to get one of our advisors interested
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:08.940]   in their ideas.
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:09.940]   I can't say that.
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:10.940]   Are you excited?
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:11.940]   I'm so excited.
[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:13.780]   Everything we've done all comes down to this.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:16.180]   I wish I could snapchat generation.
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:18.100]   We're going to revolutionize social media.
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:19.100]   Please explain that.
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:20.100]   Some will be denied.
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:25.020]   I see the push and I can design it, but who's going to build the business?
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:28.500]   Those selected by an advisor partner with the best in the business.
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:32.860]   Olivia knows through AI best day in time to buy groceries.
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:34.020]   I need this.
[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.260]   This is a branding game.
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:37.660]   I'm the branding person for you.
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:38.660]   Really?
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:39.660]   Yes.
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.140]   Last time I know my brand is no over the earth.
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:42.780]   I'm going to go with Will.
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:44.940]   Because I got goat shoes on.
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:48.140]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:49.140]   No, look.
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:50.140]   There were prizes.
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.980]   There's a lot of work to do.
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:53.220]   This isn't the pitch anymore.
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:54.700]   This is real life.
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:59.500]   Tech luminaries from companies like Yelp, Musically and Uber.
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:04.300]   Make pivots that kind of makes sense to that user base you have right now.
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:09.700]   It all leads to a final pitch with one of the hottest venture capital firms on the planet.
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:10.940]   Light speed venture partners.
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:11.940]   Are you nervous?
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:13.860]   There's $10 million at stake.
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:14.860]   What's your burn rate right now?
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:16.500]   Oh, you're planning to acquire customers.
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.500]   It's just not big enough.
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:18.500]   This is good.
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:19.500]   This is good.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:20.500]   I truly believe in this.
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.500]   There's a big opportunity here.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.500]   Oh my god.
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.500]   I'm crying.
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:28.980]   Successful apps earn featured placement on the app store, making their apps available
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.180]   to millions of people.
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:35.300]   This is the biggest opportunity in my life.
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:36.780]   Planet of the apps.
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:41.100]   Watch the journey unfold on Apple Music.
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.900]   So you're, by the way, only on Apple.
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:46.660]   You can only get it from Apple Music, interestingly on iTunes.
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:49.060]   Here's the problem I see with that.
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:52.500]   The audience that would be interested in apps like our audience doesn't want that
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:53.900]   presentation.
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.740]   The audience is interested in reality TV.
[01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:57.700]   Once the bachelor, they don't want this.
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.700]   I think it's two different audiences.
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:01.940]   Yeah, I think the first one, absolutely.
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:05.540]   The second one, I think, will have to wait and see.
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:08.380]   I would, that would be my gut, but I've been proven wrong with those kinds of guesses
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:09.380]   so many times.
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:11.140]   I'm pretty sure our audience won't like it.
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.180]   I'm sure our audience won't like it.
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:14.180]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:17.520]   I don't know if the mainstream beats, or the mainstream Apple Music audience will take
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.680]   to it or not.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.680]   You're talking about the other one.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.460]   The carpool karaoke is being.
[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:22.460]   No, both.
[01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:27.620]   I think when you look at TV, and the person who made this show, I forget his name Silverman,
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:28.780]   he's made tons of these shows.
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:31.860]   He's brought a lot of the ones from England over, and he's produced a lot of them.
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:35.140]   They went through his credentials last night on Rico, and it's like 10 or 20 of the most
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.700]   famous reality shows ever.
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:39.420]   He's doing a version of that for apps.
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:43.740]   Like they did for cooking and dancing and tattooing and all these sorts of things.
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:45.460]   Seems like there's an endless appetite for that stuff.
[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:48.260]   I'm absolutely sure that many people in our industry will not want to give this the time
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:49.260]   of day.
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:54.820]   You just don't know how many people will find it interesting in the larger reality TV audience.
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:59.940]   Yeah, also people haven't been trained to go to Apple Music for a TV show.
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:01.500]   How many people are going to read?
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:04.620]   They have to be really motivated to watch this and stick with it.
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:07.940]   Carpool karaoke, at least it's music connected.
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:11.540]   Also, there's nothing I saw in that trailer that made me think they were doing anything
[01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:17.380]   special that was any different from the one where the Food Network show where you're pitching
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:19.180]   food products.
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:25.780]   Also, Shark Tank is the successful model for the show and it stinks.
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:27.740]   It's like the way that it's totally...
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:28.740]   But it's successful.
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:29.740]   I mean...
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.660]   I don't like any reality shows.
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:37.100]   Yeah, but that's kind of my point is that the people who are interested in this are probably
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:38.700]   not the same audience.
[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:41.940]   And people who like reality shows, this is too...
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.420]   If they don't care about apps...
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:48.260]   Unless they have an app, I'll start idea.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:53.180]   I mean, I guess the one argument you could make is that everybody's interested in making
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:57.420]   $22 billion from Facebook on their app.
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:03.340]   So because such big money's been thrown around, $22 billion for WhatsApp, a billion for Instagram,
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:05.260]   so much big money was being thrown around.
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:09.620]   I don't see it being thrown around now, but maybe there's some interest like I could make
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:10.620]   it rich.
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:11.620]   I know a lot.
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:12.620]   I do people.
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:13.620]   Okay, maybe I'm wrong because I...
[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:17.180]   Now that I think of it, people are always calling me on the radio show or coming up to
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:19.540]   me saying, "I've got an idea for an app.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.460]   I know it's going to be the best thing ever."
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:22.700]   We'll do a compelling show.
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:23.700]   That's the question.
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:24.700]   Like, will people actually...
[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:25.700]   Will this version of...
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:26.700]   Maybe an app show could be successful.
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:28.900]   I don't know if this will be a successful option.
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:29.900]   Right.
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:30.900]   Yeah.
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:35.020]   I wonder if it wouldn't have been better to start off by producing just an hour-long
[01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:38.180]   self-contained documentary sort of thing.
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:41.580]   Like indie game the movie, this really great documentary that came out two or three years
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:45.780]   ago that followed three different developers who are creating independent games.
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:49.820]   I think they were going to be launching on Xbox Live and Steam.
[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:53.660]   And you see three different stories about exactly how hard it is to put these things
[01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:59.180]   together and also how to market them and how to make a living off of these things.
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:02.660]   And that was a self-contained story that people would tune into because it's sort of
[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:06.980]   interesting and new, but you wind up sitting there for a full 90 minutes and gross trying
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:09.660]   to figure out who's going to win, who's going to lose.
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:13.620]   And then maybe off of that, you create a show that kind of bounces off that.
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:20.180]   I just don't see, I don't understand why they picked this topic as their first real show.
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.180]   I mean, there have been geek documentaries.
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:23.820]   I mean, there have been lots of them.
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:26.140]   I'm thinking of zero days.
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:30.420]   There was that one on 3D printing, what was it called, print the legend.
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:34.300]   But I don't think they're big mainstream productions.
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.740]   The geeks who watch them, or the show you're mentioning, are fascinating.
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:39.580]   I mean, these are fascinating things.
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:40.580]   They're proper documentaries.
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:41.580]   They're not.
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:48.260]   When you come in, if when you're pitching for capitalization, you don't go into this beautiful
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:49.260]   lit set.
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:50.260]   Right.
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:51.260]   I'm an escalator.
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:55.500]   You're not told to stand and sit on the X where the scene for the trap doors is because
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.220]   each of them has a special light pad.
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.620]   And you get five minutes.
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:00.860]   I think a couple of your shows.
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:04.940]   Repetis was ready to show his 3D printer to the world.
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:07.420]   Then something terrible happened.
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:11.260]   Someone from Google Ventures was talking about how his shark tank has absolutely ruined his
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:12.260]   job.
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:13.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:14.260]   Because everything says what VCs do.
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:15.260]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:18.060]   It's like people basically come in to give like a 30 second advertisement to sell them
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:23.340]   the $5 copy of their product as opposed to, no, no, no, we don't care about your product.
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:24.780]   We care about your books.
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:25.780]   Right.
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:26.780]   Yeah.
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:29.900]   My thinking is, or at least people are going to go to Apple Music.
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:31.660]   And one of the problems Apple Music solves is boredom.
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:34.340]   Like, you just want to hear something, listen something, see something.
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:37.220]   And Apple's going to have a new movies and TV show section.
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:38.420]   It doesn't look like this will be alone.
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:41.820]   It'll be carpool karaoke and other things and they're probably really high profile music
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:44.300]   videos to get people into this section.
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:47.940]   And then they might see will I am and they might see Jessica Albo or Gunith Paltrow.
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:51.340]   That's probably why they went with stars rather than like existing venture capitalist
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:54.740]   types because no one would recognize them and it wouldn't compel people to click into
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:55.740]   it.
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:58.700]   And then once they do, then the show has to either carry them or lose them on their own
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:09:59.700]   weight.
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:03.340]   But I think Apple, they're making a big deal yesterday about Apple Music having 20 million
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:05.460]   subscribers over 100 countries.
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:07.220]   And that's a built in audience.
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:09.740]   So they can convert that audience to not as a separate question.
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:13.340]   But I think this is part of what you have to do to make Apple Music as successful as
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:14.340]   the same thing as Netflix.
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:17.060]   You have to get a lot of interesting content that makes people want to keep subscribing
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:18.340]   month after month.
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:23.100]   And music alone against Spotify and other companies isn't significantly differentiated.
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:26.140]   But this kind of content has a chance of doing that.
[01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:28.940]   Here's the carpool karaoke trailer.
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.860]   This one I'm a little more interested in.
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:34.900]   It's James Cardin invented this, but he and he's producing it, right?
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:36.300]   But I don't think he's in it.
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:37.300]   He's in some of them.
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:38.300]   He's in a couple of.
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:42.300]   This, this, this is carpool karaoke.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:48.660]   It's getting like 350,000 views an hour.
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:55.020]   It's all been building to this carpool karaoke without James Corden.
[01:10:55.020 --> 01:11:00.860]   Okay, so Alicia Keys and John Legend, John's doing the driving.
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:06.140]   I don't know who the well, Michael Strain on the left.
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:09.940]   I don't know who that is.
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:13.220]   Okay, just exhausted my popular music knowledge.
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:15.380]   Wait a minute, that's Seth McFarland.
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:17.740]   I cannot sing.
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.740]   Metallica.
[01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:22.980]   It's not that hard.
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:30.300]   Oh, no, see, I'd watch that.
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:35.300]   I love the Will Smith.
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:37.820]   I would watch Will Smith too.
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:40.220]   Parents just don't understand.
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:41.220]   Yes.
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:46.660]   Oh, white women think I'm for real sometimes.
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:53.460]   When he wears that hat, he looks a lot like for him.
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:54.860]   We need a bigger car.
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:55.860]   Oh, no, no.
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:56.860]   Oh, Shaq, don't drive.
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:57.860]   Oh, man.
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:03.220]   We're not gonna die.
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:07.020]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:08.020]   Ziggy with it.
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:09.020]   This looks like fun.
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.020]   You know what?
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.020]   This looks like a great show.
[01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:12.020]   I love that.
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:14.180]   I love what James Corden is, but it really is.
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:19.020]   It takes people out of their elements and it makes them open to having real conversations.
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:21.620]   Garth Brooks and Chelsea handling this.
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.820]   Carpool karaoke.
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:26.420]   Cuckuckuckuckuckuckuck.
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:27.420]   That looks like fun.
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:28.420]   That's a lot of the...
[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:29.420]   Oh, carp.
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:30.420]   I like the cucketer.
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:31.420]   I like the cucketer.
[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:32.420]   I like the cucketer.
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:33.420]   I hate it.
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:37.420]   I believe I can touch the sky.
[01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:41.340]   I think about it every night and day.
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:42.860]   See, Corden really makes it.
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.660]   Corden's so good.
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:46.180]   That's a lot of the...
[01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:47.180]   So there you go.
[01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:48.180]   There's the interface.
[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:52.380]   If you want to see it, because they put it in the promo.
[01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:56.740]   So I guess you're gonna have a TV and movie section, browse.
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:13:00.860]   And then when you're browsing in Apple Music, there'll be new music, creative playlists,
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:02.620]   and TV and movies.
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:03.620]   Look at that.
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:08.300]   And then you go into TV and movies and right now there's only two of them.
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:13.580]   But maybe there are more.
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:14.980]   You know what are the movies?
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:16.780]   Oh, you know, they could have...
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:17.780]   They could have...
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:18.780]   You know what?
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:19.780]   Bring back behind the music.
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:22.700]   I would watch that.
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:24.020]   There's stuff they could do.
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:25.020]   Great.
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:30.380]   They could put woodstock and the last waltz, great, great concert movies.
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:35.020]   There's stuff they could do that would tie with music very nicely.
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:40.820]   I think the interesting thing about Carpool Karaoke is it's a song as well as the video
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:41.820]   of them.
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:42.820]   Yeah.
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:44.340]   I mean, that is a great opportunity.
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:48.460]   A sports ESPN has done amazing work in their 30 for 30 series.
[01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:49.460]   Yes.
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:54.620]   But it is a legitimate documentary series that talks about the history of sports and none
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:57.500]   of these movies would be out of place on PBS.
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:03.820]   In terms of the amount of seriousness that they bring, serious concepts, sometimes to
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:10.420]   the funnier sort of sports history, Apple could do the same thing by documenting music.
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:11.420]   If they just funded...
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:16.300]   We're going to do a 12 part series on the history of hip hop that makes sure that tells
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:20.860]   it from the perspective, not from a marketing phenomenon of here's where it started and
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:23.460]   here are the people who are still telling the story.
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.380]   That could be a valuable thing to be added.
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:26.380]   They need to...
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:30.780]   Once they get their first, just like Netflix and Hulu, the first time that they get nominated
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:36.440]   for an Emmy and they beat "real programming" that's the time when things start to really
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:41.260]   kick into high gear because that's when the greatest writers, the greatest directors,
[01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:43.460]   the greatest actors decide that we want...
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:45.340]   Give me an Apple deal.
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:47.340]   I don't want a CBS deal anymore.
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:48.340]   I want an Apple deal.
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:52.020]   By the way, the guy I'm now being informed by the guy sitting with Michael Strahan, sitting
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:15:00.220]   next to Michael Strahan, NFL legend Michael Strahan was NASCAR legend number 21, Jeff Gordon.
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:01.620]   I should have recognized him.
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:04.180]   Without the helmet and the fire suit, I just didn't know.
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:05.180]   Could have been the Stig.
[01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:06.180]   We don't know.
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:07.180]   Could have been the Stig.
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:08.900]   No, of course it was Jeff Gordon.
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:10.500]   He's a good looking fella.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.900]   Good looking fella.
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:19.900]   Apple has hired Amazon's Fire TV head to run Apple TV.
[01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:24.140]   It sounds to me like Apple TV is going to be a lot like Roku and Fire TV, which it already
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:25.140]   is.
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:26.940]   It doesn't sound like a change for Apple TV.
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:30.500]   I think the bigger story here is Apple's continual reorganization.
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:33.820]   Shortly after Phil Schiller took over the App Store, Greg Jaws, we actually took over
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.740]   much broader responsibilities for product marketing.
[01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:41.980]   Now you have Pete Diestit, who's leaving Jaws' organization and going to EDQ's organization
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:44.020]   to help out with contact negotiations.
[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:48.380]   You have Tim, I'm going to mispronounce his last name, Fronal.
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:52.300]   I don't know how to say it, but he's coming in to work on the marketing.
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:55.500]   You have these senior vice presidents at Apple who are phenomenal people, but whose portfolios
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:58.340]   have just grown and grown and grown and grown and grown and grown as new products and new
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:00.340]   services get launched.
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:03.180]   You need really good vice presidents to help out the senior vice presidents.
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:07.620]   I think we're seeing that now because EDQ has been responsible for not just everything
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:11.540]   iTunes, but everything Apple Music, all the contract negotiations, the servers.
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:15.100]   It's a stunning portfolio, the same thing with Phil Schiller.
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:18.540]   As you move all these people into different positions, I think that helps them.
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:21.300]   I was joking and saying, they have so much on their plates, they haven't seen their plates
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:24.260]   in a decade, but I think this helps take some of that off of them.
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:29.060]   Speaking of EDQ interview with The Verge, he says, "This is interesting.
[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:34.580]   Apple is not against the idea of making more original TV, but emphasized it would have
[01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:39.180]   to be some sort of interactive element for it to make sense."
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:44.500]   Already, even though he's not out yet.
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:48.100]   Already saying, "Well, we might make more, but we want to make it more interactive."
[01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:51.980]   He says, "You can see a TV environment where content makers are creating a more interactive
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:54.820]   TV app."
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:59.340]   This reminds me so much of the kinds of conversations we had in the '90s, where viewers watched the
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:04.380]   program on their Apple TV iPad or phone using the remote or simply touch screen to interact
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:05.380]   with the show.
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:06.380]   Good Lord, Eddie.
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:10.060]   Haven't we come a little farther than that?
[01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:13.060]   It's not what Jimmy Iovine told The New York Times yesterday.
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:17.500]   He said Apple's working to bring more scripted dramas to its platform.
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.740]   They explained a lot of that on stage yesterday, and it was interesting because they used the
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:24.300]   model of MTV where I started off with music videos, but it got further afield.
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:27.740]   There's going to be just a more television-like experience in the Apple Music app, but you'll
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:30.220]   also be able to get the Planet of the Apps app.
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:32.860]   It will have the show, but I forget how they explained it.
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:39.380]   You'll be able to tap your way almost like DVD extras into a digression, I guess, and
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:44.180]   keep going through that as much as interesting and then back back out into the show again.
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:49.220]   Interactive TV is one of the oldest ideas in the convergence sphere.
[01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:50.220]   Was a flop.
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:53.100]   It's been a flop time and time again.
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:55.620]   I think that Eddie, you're going to have to come up with something a little bit better
[01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:57.580]   than that if you want to make it here.
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:58.580]   That is not.
[01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:00.660]   That makes no sense at all, interactive.
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:02.780]   You know what?
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:06.820]   The most people want to do is watch Twitter when they're watching the Grammys.
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.620]   That was fun, right?
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:09.620]   That's about it.
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:15.140]   I don't want to sit here with my TV remote or watching and doing things.
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:21.540]   There has to be an element that is intrinsically of interactivity.
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:29.220]   You can't just simply say that I'm so engrossed in this new reality TV show that I even want
[01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:31.860]   the second screen in my lap to continue.
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:35.380]   My joy is so great it cannot be contained by just one screen.
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:37.620]   I don't think that any show has really done that.
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:40.980]   Either you're so engrossed in it that you just want to follow the characters and see
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:44.220]   what's going on or you're so bored that you need to.
[01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:48.820]   You need something of your own choosing to fill up the 20% of your brain that would just
[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:50.420]   rather change the channel.
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:51.820]   I don't get it.
[01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:57.140]   You know, somebody's pointing out, Leo, you have a chat room and you have 500 or 1000
[01:18:57.140 --> 01:19:00.500]   people in the chat room while you're doing your shows.
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:03.620]   That's kind of like interactive TV, but that works to me.
[01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:06.260]   You're not clicking on my head.
[01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:08.260]   We're having a conversation.
[01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:15.100]   It's a conversation with 10,000 people and three microphones and we just happen to have
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:18.260]   the microphones in front of us, but we're also looking at what other people are saying.
[01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:21.140]   I think that's what, to me, that's kind of a good interaction.
[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:27.540]   That means it's a larger conversation as opposed to, you know, dopey pop-up video trivia questions
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:28.700]   that you click while you're watching.
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:30.980]   I don't think it's more like DVD extras.
[01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:32.540]   We're interested in one of the apps being presented.
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:34.300]   You could click through to it.
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:40.180]   This loss, biggest loss when physical media went away, DVD extras.
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:42.860]   I love directors, commentaries and stuff.
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:47.180]   And the Apple TV, you know, when you buy an Apple TV and they have extras, it's kind of,
[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:48.180]   it's like very scant.
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:49.180]   Some of the things.
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:50.180]   You know what?
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:51.180]   You know why?
[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:54.940]   I think I know why because I've talked to people who say, "We hate doing DVD extras.
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:56.460]   I finished the movie years ago.
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:58.940]   I do not want to record a commentary track."
[01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:01.580]   Like it's impossible to get people to do those.
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:02.580]   It's impossible.
[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:03.580]   It takes whatever.
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:11.740]   So Apple, without this pressure, the movie companies, when Sony was making its DVD, was
[01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:15.420]   able to pressure people into doing this, with absent that, it's going to be very hard to
[01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:16.420]   get extras, which is too bad.
[01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:20.740]   Also, apparently, there's a lot of like, brokering where Target will get this exclusive
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:23.980]   extra and Walmart will get that expensive extra and iTunes will get this.
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:25.660]   You don't get all of them anymore.
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:27.300]   We talked about it before.
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:34.180]   The remastered Godfather 1, 2, and 3 blue rays with Francis Ford Coppola's commentary
[01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:37.060]   on Godfather 1.
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:39.940]   Frankly, not having that is a loss.
[01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:44.420]   That's a huge loss to movie cinephiles, movie lovers.
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:45.420]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:48.220]   That's a great loss particularly with Laserdisc.
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:52.540]   Where they're because Laserdisc was such a high, it's not for rental, it's for really
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:54.100]   for cinema files.
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:58.500]   And so there was enough, because they're going to be charging $200 for the deluxe edition
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:04.820]   of The Abyss, there was money to actually, we're going to reshoot that last scene that
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:08.340]   we didn't have enough money to actually do these special effects properly for that one.
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:11.180]   We're going to restore it to the original premiere cut.
[01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:16.780]   And also, we're going to fund interviews with all the principles at a distance from
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:23.820]   the production where they can say the words, "John James Cameron, without twitching."
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:25.940]   And they can talk about it in context.
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:29.380]   And so they leave behind this wonderful historical document.
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:34.220]   I think part of the necessity though is that you have to pay these people for their participation.
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:37.540]   Rather, they don't pay these people.
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:40.620]   That's why they're like, "Well, you're going to be adding a bonus to this that's going
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:42.460]   to make this sell more.
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:44.860]   Why are you promising to send me a copy of it?"
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:47.340]   And then of course, you don't even follow through and send me the free copy.
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:53.180]   Gosh, getting Seth MacFarlane to comment on a movie after he makes it.
[01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:54.180]   It really adds.
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:22:01.860]   I don't know why I thought of him.
[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:02.860]   Apple's adds.
[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:04.820]   We talked about the portrait mode.
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:06.980]   They've got one now to close your rings.
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:09.740]   They have a petrit mode now.
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:10.740]   Petrit.
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:12.180]   Portrait mode for pets.
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:13.180]   Oh.
[01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:14.180]   Really?
[01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:15.180]   Now I thought it was supposed to have a human.
[01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:16.620]   It works with pets.
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:17.860]   It does facial recognition.
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:21.100]   They will only officially say that it is optimized for humans, although people have found
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:22.860]   that it works very well with pets.
[01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:25.100]   And I've extended that to coffee cups and things too.
[01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:27.260]   So you can do it with other...
[01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:32.100]   That's the difference between a photo of your dog and one of your best friends.
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.100]   Ahh.
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:34.100]   That was me.
[01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:35.100]   Soulmate.
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:36.100]   Wow, that's interesting.
[01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:37.100]   They're really selling this.
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:38.100]   On iPhones?
[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:40.460]   It is a huge differentiator on the iPhone 7.
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:41.460]   It blew up.
[01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:42.540]   I mean, pet photographs with portrait mode.
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:44.660]   If you look at Instagram or something, it became huge.
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:45.660]   Yeah.
[01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:46.660]   They're smart.
[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:47.660]   Here's some...
[01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:51.060]   Well, as long as we're turning the ads, I like playing the ads.
[01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:52.060]   There's...
[01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:54.100]   You know, it's carnival time.
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:23:01.740]   Here's their carnival ad from Brazil.
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:04.300]   And these are all portrait mode as well, aren't they?
[01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:05.300]   Yeah.
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:06.300]   Yep.
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:08.820]   That's fun.
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:11.940]   Now is this for Brazil or is this going to be shown in the US?
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:15.140]   I haven't seen it yet.
[01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:16.140]   It's fun.
[01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:17.540]   What a fun ad.
[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:22.580]   So it's all music, so people listening are only hearing great music, but it's a bunch
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:28.020]   of people in costume for carnival in Apple portrait mode, but they're doing them very
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:29.020]   fast.
[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.020]   So it's almost like a moving picture.
[01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:32.020]   Like stop motion.
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:33.020]   It's really...
[01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:39.780]   And it's really great and very colorful and they could show this in the US, absolutely.
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:40.780]   Even though it's...
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:45.220]   I think they're showing that a candy bamboozle no matter how weird the costumes are.
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:46.220]   Ahh.
[01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:47.220]   That's a good point.
[01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:50.380]   And it's like the pet ad to say, well, you know, portrait works in a variety of ways.
[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:51.380]   I think...
[01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:52.380]   These are just legs.
[01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:53.380]   Oh, it's just a...
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:54.380]   So sad I didn't think of doing this.
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:55.380]   I love portrait mode.
[01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:59.820]   Not just for the pictures it takes, but just the idea that we're going to launch this
[01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:01.980]   feature in a way that will...
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:05.460]   It will work, but will make it smarter and better as time goes on.
[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:06.460]   Yeah.
[01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:08.940]   So that we will make sure that it will understand non-human faces.
[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:13.180]   And soon we will figure out how to make sure that if you just have arbitrary object in the
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:16.660]   foreground, it can still resolve that from the background.
[01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:22.220]   And I remember when Phil Schiller was talking about it in September, it wasn't out yet.
[01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:25.340]   And he said, you know, it wasn't even something that they had planned to make.
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:28.180]   Some engineers came to him and said, hey, you know, we could do this thing.
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:29.180]   Should we work on it?
[01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:30.580]   And he said, yeah.
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:31.580]   And then when they...
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:33.060]   You know, it's kind of in beta.
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:34.540]   It's gotten better, I guess.
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:35.540]   Has it gotten better?
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.540]   Have they actually...
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:38.020]   It does all the time.
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:42.500]   It's one of those features where Apple takes in a bunch of data and constantly works on improving
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:43.500]   it.
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:44.500]   It's one of my favorite things about Apple.
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:47.220]   Like they do have features pushed down from marketing that they think is important for
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:48.220]   the phones to have.
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:51.220]   But a lot of the biggest features we've gotten over the last few years have been one engineer
[01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:55.500]   or a couple of engineers thinking up an idea, pitching it, having it approved, and then making
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:56.500]   it a reality.
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:59.660]   And that's led to so many of the things we take for granted now.
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:03.660]   And I think that's one of the things that Apple does really well is nurturing those individual
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:04.660]   ideas.
[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:09.060]   And very likely, one of those ideas is getting nurtured big time because Tim Cook keeps saying
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:10.420]   it augmented reality.
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:17.300]   And now he gave an interview to the UK newspaper, The Independent, which is of course behind
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:23.180]   a paywall, I think, in which he says that AR is more than just something we're really
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:25.500]   interested in, but a fundamental technology.
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:29.540]   I regard it, says Cook, as a big idea, like the smart phone.
[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:30.660]   The smart phone's for everyone.
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:35.300]   We don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic or country or vertical
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:36.300]   market.
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:37.300]   It's for everyone.
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:39.100]   I think AR is that big.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.100]   It's huge.
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:47.140]   I get excited because of the things that could be done to improve a lot of lives and be entertaining.
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:52.140]   He goes on to say that he feels views AR like the silicon used in iPhones chips.
[01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:58.780]   It's not a technology per se, but a core, not a product, but a core technology, which
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:02.740]   implies it will appear in a variety of ways in Apple products.
[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:03.740]   Yep.
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:05.940]   And I couldn't agree with him more.
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.580]   He said he was on Good Morning America.
[01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:10.980]   He said it had a more potential and virtual reality because you remain present in the
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:12.980]   real world exactly.
[01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:17.620]   So clearly, Tim Cook is getting people ready.
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:19.820]   This is definitely something.
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:22.940]   Do you think this year?
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:27.380]   It's just odd that Tim Cook, Apple is famously so secretive about things, but I think there's
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:30.300]   just so much momentum behind AR and AR that he's...
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:31.980]   Why is he going public with this?
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:34.260]   This is a clearly calculated plan.
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:37.100]   This isn't like, oh, by the way, let me mention AR.
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:38.620]   This is something they've thought about.
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:39.620]   Why?
[01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:44.420]   I think it's because it allows them to reassure people that we are definitely...
[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:48.620]   This is definitely on our radar and we are working on something without having to commit
[01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:53.340]   to anything, without having to show off a flaky beta, without letting people see that,
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:58.420]   oh, well, actually, the person we have right now requires a Robocop-style backpack that
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:02.620]   leads to tethers, to a golf cart full of electronics to make it work.
[01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:07.540]   It allows people to...
[01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:08.540]   It kind of makes people...
[01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:09.540]   Sorry, I shouldn't say people.
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:15.180]   It might make people like me nervous when there is such excitement about a certain technology
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:20.300]   that this looks like it's becoming a real thing and not just a demo, but Apple is not,
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:22.500]   of course, does not comment on unannounced products.
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.180]   They never show off prototypes.
[01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:28.100]   There is never rumor about them showing off something to people behind the scenes at a
[01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:34.500]   trade show.
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:39.180]   Here's a story from our friend Steve Kovac in Business Insider.
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:45.900]   Apple has suspended, he says, he's heard this from a number of sources.
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:48.340]   It's new 5K monitor from LG.
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:50.620]   They're not going to sell it at the store.
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:57.660]   According to Steve, Apple stores are showing it, but will not sell it to you.
[01:27:57.660 --> 01:28:00.660]   Our source, he says, as Apple Store employees are instructed this weekend, they continue
[01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:05.700]   to display the LG monitors on the show floor, but not sell them if a customer wants one.
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:10.100]   Instead, customers will be told to order the display from the Apple online store.
[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:11.580]   That sounds like...
[01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:15.580]   We had mentioned last week that they're going to put shielding in these 5K monitors.
[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:17.220]   Yeah, they don't want old stock to get...
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:23.980]   It's the old stock in the store, but if you were to buy one now online, you would get...
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:25.340]   It says three to four week shipping.
[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:28.580]   So my guess is that's what they need to get you.
[01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:30.500]   What are you going to do about yours?
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:31.500]   You don't have a problem?
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.500]   I don't know.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:37.260]   I mean, where I keep mine normally, I have no problem because it's way across the room,
[01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:38.580]   so I have absolutely no issue.
[01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:42.700]   But just the idea of having to either dig into this myself or take it to LG just fills
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:43.900]   me with dread.
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:46.980]   I buy from Apple, so I don't have to deal with those kinds of things.
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:50.660]   This isn't another piece in my not happy that Apple didn't make their own display pile,
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:52.580]   which is getting considerably larger.
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:53.580]   Yeah.
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:54.580]   Yeah.
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:56.900]   That's a hard thing because people are like, "Apple should make their own display," and
[01:28:56.900 --> 01:29:01.580]   then you say, "Well, that you want your iMac this year," and then they start to go, "Ah."
[01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:07.840]   All right, let's take a break and get your picks coming up next as we continue Mac break
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:08.840]   weekly.
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:11.220]   So my chat room said, "Should be Apple break weekly.
[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:13.660]   Do we have any Mac news at all?"
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:14.660]   No.
[01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:15.660]   That is...
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:17.660]   We should have like a countdown.
[01:29:17.660 --> 01:29:21.860]   We should have like a digital clock where we can even write it in the back saying, "Number
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:25.180]   of days since meaningful Macintosh news."
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:30.540]   And just to have a sort of a pointed reminder that Apple is not showing a whole lot of love
[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:31.540]   for Macintosh.
[01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:32.540]   Right.
[01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:35.900]   And I don't like the name Apple break weekly.
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:39.140]   We called it Mac break weekly, "How long has it been?
[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:43.060]   Ten years ago when we started it, it was a video."
[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:48.220]   It was Mac break originally, video from Alex Lindsay, and then Alex was doing the video.
[01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:51.580]   I said, "Why don't we do a podcast we call Mac break weekly?"
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:55.100]   Because Mac break would come out, you know, kind of odd schedule.
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:57.860]   Sometimes it'd be a long delay, sometimes it'd be a bunch of them.
[01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:03.100]   And he said, "Yeah, let's do an audio podcast Mac break weekly since become a video podcast."
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:05.100]   But it never was only Macintosh.
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:11.300]   Can we point out that like John Syracuse, nobody makes puts him on point by saying that
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:14.900]   I think this isn't absolutely a deliberate tech podcast at this point.
[01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:18.740]   But no, he gets to still call the external tech podcast.
[01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:20.180]   It's just a name, kids.
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:21.180]   It works.
[01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:24.180]   We don't have to remake the t-shirts.
[01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:26.540]   Yeah, we don't want to remake this exactly.
[01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:33.460]   When we started doing this show, January, which was by the way, January 27th, 2006, there
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:38.260]   was no iPhone, there was no Apple Watch, there was no Apple TV.
[01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:41.020]   It was about Mac's because that's all Apple did.
[01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:44.780]   Oh, I guess they had an iPod.
[01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:47.660]   You know, I mean, there wasn't a whole lot to talk about.
[01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:50.100]   It wasn't days where the iPod news every week.
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:51.100]   Yeah.
[01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:52.860]   What are you going to say about the iPod?
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:56.140]   So I'm just glad Apple has more to talk about, frankly.
[01:30:56.140 --> 01:31:00.940]   A show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quick In Loans.
[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:05.860]   If you are in the market for a new house, I want to tell you about how you're going to
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:06.960]   get your next mortgage.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:07.960]   You're going to get it fast.
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:12.960]   You're going to get it easy.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.960]   You're going to get it completely online.
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:20.240]   You're going to get it from Quick In Loans and Rocket Mortgage.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:23.960]   It was designed for the geeks, all of us.
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:27.960]   I mean, if you're one of those people who really likes going to a bank or a mortgage
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:34.960]   lender, hat in hand with a box of paperwork, faxing stuff, if you really like that, okay.
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:37.920]   Actually, I think you could still do that in Quick In Loans if you really wanted to.
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.680]   Even you could do it at the computer.
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:42.040]   Just do everything you need right there.
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:48.320]   Instantly, even submit pay stubs and bank statements, just boom, like that.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:52.080]   If you want, play with the rate and length of your loan in real time.
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:55.440]   Then say good, let's go for that and get approved in minutes.
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:56.440]   Wouldn't you like that?
[01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:57.440]   Wouldn't that be better?
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:58.440]   Sure.
[01:31:58.440 --> 01:31:59.440]   A lot better than the last time I bought a house.
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:02.520]   If you're refying, same thing.
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:05.440]   Quick In Loans is the best mortgage lender in the country.
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:09.860]   If you just look at all those JD Power Customer Satisfaction Awards, they've received year
[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:14.160]   after year after year, you'll know people love them.
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:15.200]   Why don't you try it?
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:17.120]   QuickinLones.com/MacBreak.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.160]   Skip the bank, skip the waiting.
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:21.880]   Go completely online with Rocket Mortgage.
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:25.320]   QuickinLones.com/MacBreak.
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:30.320]   Equal housing, lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org.
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:34.600]   Remember, 30, quickinLones.com/MacBreak.
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:38.760]   We thank them so much for their support of MacBreak Weekly.
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:41.200]   Andy Enoco, you got a pick of the week for us?
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:43.520]   I got a simple pick of the week.
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:51.160]   I went to the Apple Campus for the first time since they remodeled the Apple Company store
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:53.320]   there, the on-campus store.
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.880]   They took out most of the really fun merchandise.
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:57.120]   You can no longer get bags.
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:59.880]   You can no longer get mugs.
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:04.680]   It's basically, if you don't want to buy an iPad, it's either T-shirts and a good selection
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:11.720]   of T-shirts, a hardback notepad or the Apple logo pen.
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:16.920]   Of course, I just wanted to have respect in the eyes of Renee again.
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:22.840]   I finally own a rose gold Apple device.
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:26.160]   Now I'm pointing stuff for a couple of reasons.
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:29.720]   Number one, if you do go to the Apple Company store, this is probably, in my opinion, it's
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:32.240]   the coolest thing they've got.
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:40.040]   They also have, to my shock and delight, Apple T-shirts with the original six-color logo.
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:45.920]   But unfortunately, they're for people with physiques.
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:51.560]   It's like that sort of thin engineered material designed to...
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:55.720]   Well, they're T-shirts, but they're designed to be worn close to the body.
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:59.480]   They don't look good with like salsa stains on them.
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:01.640]   So I gave that a pass.
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:04.360]   But this is, I think, the coolest thing that coolest thing have.
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:09.360]   And it's partly my pick of the week, but also because this isn't like a Johnny Ive, like
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.160]   Apple designed pen.
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:13.000]   These pens are really, really nice.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.520]   And they're made by a company called Retro 1951.
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:18.360]   It's the Retro 1951 tornado.
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:21.920]   And these are, I'm saying, these are really lovely pens.
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:22.920]   They are full metal.
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:24.440]   They have a really good heft to them.
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:25.960]   They're roller balls.
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:30.720]   You deploy them by twisting this knurled grip at the other end of it.
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:32.760]   They write really, really nicely.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:37.040]   Unlike the Apple pencil, they actually have an integrated clip.
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:39.760]   So you can actually carry them around with you.
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:40.760]   And they're 20 bucks.
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:45.280]   I mean, so it's enough that you can certainly afford to have one.
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:50.000]   But they're also nice enough that this is kind of really nice little gift to give people.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.920]   Because there are times where I would like to give someone a...
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:57.840]   I know that someone would like to have a nice pen, but you don't want to give them the $800
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:02.080]   ring or what they're so intimidating and they're fussy to use.
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:07.440]   This is just a really nice refillable ballpoint, roller ball pen that has a bit of style to
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:08.440]   it.
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:13.880]   If you buy it off the site and not the Apple versions at the Apple store, they come in
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:16.200]   all of the Apple hardware colors.
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:21.960]   So you can get them in space gray, you can get them in silver and rose gold.
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:26.720]   If you get the actual retro 1951, the classic lacquers are available in about a dozen different
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:27.720]   colors.
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:29.200]   You can buy them on Amazon for about 20 bucks.
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:31.560]   They're blowing the dark skeletons.
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:33.000]   They're nicely packaged.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.880]   So that looks like you're giving or getting a nice gift.
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:38.880]   So I recommend it highly.
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:43.040]   I've actually bought this because I wanted to get some souvenir from the Apple store since
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:45.920]   I hadn't been there in like a year and a half, two years.
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:48.240]   But now it's actually like my daily driver pen.
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:51.400]   I've actually bought off of Amazon like a second one.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:55.040]   So I keep my rose gold and pristine condition.
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:36:00.560]   So if I want to sell it on Gazelle two years from now, I can get at least $28 back on it.
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:01.560]   This is I like this.
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:04.200]   I've never seen these and I'm a big pen fan.
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:06.040]   They also have a Harley Davidson line.
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.360]   This is their bamboo pen.
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.360]   These are nice.
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:13.520]   They also they also make one that's a stylus on one end and a pen on the other.
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.680]   So you can still call it a technical.
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:22.160]   It's retro51.com, the tornado.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:26.800]   They have fountain pens as well as roller balls.
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:29.400]   Mr. Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:34.400]   So my pick of the week, it was just announced earlier today and it's called Project Phoenix.
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:39.520]   It does not refer to the legendary X-Men child of light and darkness, but into a project
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:44.600]   where the icon factory, the legendary icon factory wants to bring Twitterific updated
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:45.760]   and back to the Mac.
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:46.760]   They want to rebirth it.
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:47.760]   They want to.
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:48.760]   Oh, I love Twitterific.
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:51.280]   It's probably it was the first Twitter client.
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:55.280]   I mean, the icon factory has contributed so much to Twitter culture, including the bird,
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:57.840]   half the language that's used around it.
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:01.080]   And they've been doing the iPhone client for a long time, but the Mac client has sort
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:04.760]   of languished a little bit because it just wasn't, they didn't have the ability to do
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:06.800]   everything at once.
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.320]   And it's an uncertain market.
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:10.120]   You never know what's going to happen with Twitter and developers.
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:14.120]   So they're taking a different approach instead of essentially making it as an internal spec
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.240]   and hoping that it sells.
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:17.240]   They're crowd-funding it.
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:21.880]   So you can go to Kickstarter and you can pledge towards Twitterific.
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:24.200]   So $15 will get you the app.
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:27.040]   $30 will get you the app and some goodies.
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:28.040]   And you can go all the way up.
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:33.240]   There's like a, there are pledges like $1,000 that gets you a hand painted and signed Ollie,
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:35.520]   which is the name of their little bird mascot.
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:39.320]   And I believe if you pledge more than that, you actually get to have shots with Craig Hackenberry
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:41.320]   at the Hackenberry at WWDC.
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:42.440]   Don't quote me on that.
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:44.720]   But it's just, it's a wonderful Twitter client.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:46.840]   It is, it's story, it's lineage.
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:48.040]   It's, it is iconic.
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.440]   I forgive the, the part on the name.
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:52.480]   And it's great to have these alternatives, apps out there.
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:55.920]   And I think if they can do this through a crowd-funding approach where they don't have
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:59.920]   to, you know, bet the company every time they want to do an app update, more power to them.
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:03.160]   So I backed the Bejesus out of it earlier today.
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:07.120]   And if anybody knows and loves Twitterific the way I do, I think it's probably an insta,
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:08.920]   an insta back in for you.
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:14.480]   What are they doing about the fact, you know, the limitation of the API?
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:16.120]   So they have a list here.
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:18.960]   They have a list of the features that you'll get in the first version and they have two
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.320]   sort of stretch goal sets of features.
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:24.080]   And then they explain that there's some things they just can't do because of the API.
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:27.080]   So it's all sort of laid out for you there in the bullet points.
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:30.840]   I guess they're grandfathered into the number of users though.
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:31.840]   The tokens.
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:35.280]   They have a pretty substantial number of tokens since they were one of the very first.
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:36.280]   Yeah.
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:41.240]   I've been talking about this on the show and I finally got my June oven.
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:45.080]   This is the oven that works with an iPhone app.
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:49.480]   And it's, first of all, I'm just going to say right up front, it's ridiculously expensive.
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:50.480]   Don't buy it.
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:51.480]   $1,500.
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:39:02.640]   However, if you should inherit $1,500 from a long lost aunt that, you should know to
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:06.080]   all current and prospective advertisers that this is not an ad.
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:07.240]   This is not an ad.
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.240]   No, we don't ever do that.
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:12.280]   You will happily read the ad copy that you provide as we go.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:14.240]   But I got to say, and I wasn't going to buy it.
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:18.720]   In fact, I put the $100 deposit down and then I got a note saying, okay, we, you know,
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:20.880]   kick over the rest and we will send it to you.
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:21.880]   And I, and I didn't.
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:25.280]   And then Stacey Higginbotham on this week in Google said, oh, you really should get it.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:28.400]   And then they said they have a $100, a day return policy.
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:29.400]   I thought, all right.
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:31.160]   And I saved all the packing material.
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:32.760]   I was very careful.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:33.760]   You know what?
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:37.080]   Both Lisa and I fall in love with this thing.
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:41.240]   You can, you know, mostly we've cooking, cooking, cooking salmon and chicken and you know,
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:45.040]   kind of things you would normally cook in an oven, but it does do toast.
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:46.040]   It does.
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:49.560]   And if the iPhone app will notify you when it's almost done, when it's done, it tells
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:52.880]   you all actually I should show you the app because it's hysterical.
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:58.000]   Even here I can connect to the oven remotely and I can see like it's connecting to my
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000]   oven.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.520]   You can see the history of things I've cooked and you can even watch a video of the things
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:08.120]   you cooked at any time you can look in your oven and see because it's got a camera in
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:11.480]   the oven at any time you can.
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:12.920]   I know it's stupid.
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:13.920]   Anytime.
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:17.480]   I'm just thinking about the history feature where you're watching yourself like you're
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:19.560]   reheating like three day old casseroles.
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:22.040]   Like, let's go back to that time where I baked that ginger.
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:24.280]   Those were the good old days.
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:26.440]   Look, look at my salmon steaks.
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:27.440]   They're cooking.
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:29.080]   They're cooking in the June.
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:32.880]   And so you can please tell me that you can Instagram straight from that.
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:33.880]   You can.
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:34.880]   You can.
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:37.960]   You can share your meal.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:43.000]   And you can see it cooking while it's cooking, but this is also a time lapse after the fact.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.500]   And you even see like a graph.
[01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:47.400]   This is the temperature of the oven and the oven's smart.
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:51.600]   In fact, it gets firmware updates and gets smarter all the time.
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:57.840]   So it does because it's it has broiler, it's got carbon fiber elements, broiler convection
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:00.280]   ovens got two fans in it.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:03.320]   It's got a temperature probe so it knows what the temperature of the salmon you see a steady
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:09.240]   growth there to the and then it tells you it's done until, you know, not based on time,
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:13.640]   but on the internal temperature of the based on done this alone.
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:16.600]   It, by the way, it's great way to toast.
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:17.840]   Here's some bread being toasted.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.840]   I've got a video of it.
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:25.360]   So one of my favorite interactivity designers, Chris Clark, Clarko worked on this.
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:26.360]   He was at Fitbit.
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:27.360]   Oh, really?
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:31.800]   And he did a lot of interactivity design for this and it's nice to see it out on the market.
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:35.460]   This the it's ironically, you know, it's got a five inch screen on the oven, which is like
[01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:37.280]   a smartphone.
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:40.480]   And it actually is running Android because.
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:44.680]   And this is another hazard on day two of my oven ownership.
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:50.360]   I went to go cook some salmon and the oven was in a boot loop.
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:55.160]   It was a tweeting was a tweet June and then it would crash and then June and it would
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:56.160]   crash.
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.800]   So I contacted them on the website.
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.840]   They have a little chat and there was somebody there.
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:00.840]   Thank goodness.
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:04.240]   Because my my my Sam Lisa said you better turn on the real oven.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:05.920]   I said, no, this is going to work.
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:08.240]   And she told me how to reboot and reset it.
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:12.080]   So you prep plug it in and hold down the big button on the front and it and I see the
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:20.400]   Android boot manager and I and clear the cash, clear the data and I re reset it and it works
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.740]   fine now and I haven't had any problems since then.
[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:23.740]   But that was a little weird.
[01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:27.560]   That's one of the things that can kind of happen when you have a computerized oven.
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:28.560]   It's on the internet.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:31.680]   It's on it's on my Wi-Fi.
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:32.680]   And it does a great job.
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:35.640]   And the thing is it's kind of set it and you just for instance, you put the salmon stakes
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:39.080]   in there or that and it recognizes it says, is that salmon?
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:40.080]   Yeah, it's salmon.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.080]   Okay.
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:46.000]   So you get a little firmer or, you know, a little more rare and you tell it and then
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000]   you walk away.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000]   It tails the whole thing.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.800]   It broils it for a little bit to get it crispy.
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:51.040]   Does the whole thing you can bake in it.
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:53.760]   You can brown things.
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:54.760]   Don't buy it.
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.760]   It's too expensive.
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:43:00.640]   But if Aunt Jane dies and gives you 1500 bucks, it is actually the best toaster.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:04.080]   You heat up your lobster, Thermador that Alfred made for you while you are fighting.
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.880]   Batman needs this oven for sure.
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:09.680]   I will say that it's like the end of the financial year and the cup and you've got like
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:11.400]   $3,000 left in the budget.
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.200]   If you don't spend it, you're going to have your butter.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.200]   There you go.
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:15.200]   Hell of an upgrade for the break.
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:18.560]   I will endorse though, getting an oven like that.
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:23.360]   Over the past year, I switched exclusively to using my little countertop oven for all
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:25.560]   of my baking, like all my pies, all my cakes.
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:30.240]   I still do cookies in the main oven, but I find that those small ovens that come to
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:32.320]   heat a lot quicker, they're a lot more even.
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:33.320]   Yeah, it's more efficient.
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:34.320]   Certainly.
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:41.120]   I did actually did like half of my run of ginger cakes on my desktop oven.
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:44.960]   Maybe I should buy a second one, put it like right here next to the computer so that I
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:47.480]   can keep, I would have to keep checking a phone app.
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:49.440]   I could just keep checking on my cat's phone.
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:52.800]   How do they make it a coffee roaster is my only question?
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:56.520]   The people came here came from Netflix, right?
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:57.520]   And Fitbit?
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:43:58.520]   I mean, it's the pedigree is good.
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:00.160]   There's a lot of great ideas in it.
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:01.160]   I shouldn't be laughing.
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:02.960]   Well, the price is a little...
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:03.960]   It'll come down.
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:04.960]   It'll come down.
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:08.920]   I've got to admit that having an actual camera that can actually, you can peek at what you're
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:14.880]   doing without opening the door and losing convection because I can't, I'm usually doing
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:16.640]   baking so I can't see through the front.
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:20.240]   I have to look at the top to see if the cake has started to pull away from the sides of
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.520]   the panel, wherever.
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:22.520]   You can bake pizza.
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:23.840]   Here, 12 inch pizza will fit.
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:25.080]   It's a pretty big oven.
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:26.080]   Watch this.
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:28.080]   This is the one that's going to get Andy.
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:30.800]   You can make breakfast in your June oven.
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:32.240]   Watch this video.
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:33.240]   This is...
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:35.240]   You start by, let's see, making...
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:36.240]   I don't know.
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:38.480]   Oh, I don't understand how video works.
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:41.680]   You make the bacon first, okay, in your June oven.
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:42.680]   Okay.
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:44.080]   So you got a little bacon.
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:45.720]   It's got a little pan.
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:47.160]   You put that in there.
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:48.160]   You tell it.
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:49.160]   See, it knew it was bacon.
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:50.160]   Did you see that?
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:51.160]   It knows it's bacon.
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.160]   You say crispy.
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:56.560]   Then you keep it on because you're going to put an egg.
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:58.400]   I would never do this, by the way.
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:00.320]   An egg on the pan.
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:01.840]   And it's going to fry it.
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:02.840]   And you put...
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:03.840]   Why not?
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:04.840]   You know what?
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:07.200]   Let's make an egg McMuffin.
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:08.360]   You put a muffin on there.
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:10.040]   Put it back in the oven.
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:11.640]   And then you watch it on TV.
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:12.640]   And...
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:15.480]   Let's make it the hardest way to make the easiest...
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:16.480]   Obviously, I know.
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:17.480]   I know.
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:18.480]   I know.
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:19.480]   I know.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:20.480]   Don't ever do this at home.
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:21.480]   But this is...
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:23.480]   They have a whole Facebook page, which all sorts of crazy stuff like this.
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:24.480]   And there you go.
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:25.480]   It's...
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:30.280]   I love that image recognition feature, which says, "Oh, I see you're making bacon."
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:31.280]   That is kind of cool.
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:32.280]   Go.
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:35.320]   And then recipes, I guess, get updated.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:36.320]   So...
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:37.320]   Over...
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:40.440]   Because it's always on the internet.
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:41.440]   So it's always checking.
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:44.640]   After a thousand eggs, I know that takes an extra second in one degree of variation.
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:45.640]   Right.
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:47.200]   So the more people that own this, the better my oven will work.
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:48.200]   Yes.
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:49.200]   I don't know.
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:50.200]   You know what?
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:51.200]   I told Lisa that, "Look, we're going to send it back.
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:52.600]   I'm saving all the packaging.
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:54.520]   Let's just try it and see."
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:55.800]   And now she won't let me send it back.
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:57.920]   She says, "No, this is actually really cool."
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:45:58.920]   So there you go.
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:01.240]   You get filling your fitness rings, fill your oven rings.
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:02.240]   Yes.
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:05.440]   There should be some sort of sharing thing.
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:06.440]   Yes, Budcake.
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:09.800]   Well, it's funny because the recognition...
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:13.400]   Almost no matter what I put in, I put a piece of toast that says, "That's either toast
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:14.400]   or strudel."
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:15.600]   I put in salmon steak.
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:17.440]   It's either salmon or strudel.
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:19.720]   Almost everything, it's something or strudel.
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:20.720]   And I don't...
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:21.720]   Is there a big...
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:23.480]   Are there a lot of people baking strudel or...
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:25.400]   Maybe it wants to make strudel.
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:27.080]   It wants to make strudel.
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:29.160]   My oven is asking for strudel.
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:30.660]   I got a pencil.
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:31.660]   I got a pencil.
[01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:34.120]   For one, a pencil.
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:36.680]   Ladies and gentlemen, that's enough of that.
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:41.720]   Thank you so much for being here with me, Renee Ritchie, from imore.com.
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:48.000]   Follow Renee there on the Twitter, R-E-N-E-R-I-T-C-H-I-E.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.680]   And I see you want to say something about your new podcast.
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:51.680]   Do I?
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:53.440]   Let's quickly think.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.600]   We had Jason Sennell on this week.
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:55.600]   Oh, nice.
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:59.280]   Yeah, well, how Apple got to the Apple TV that they shipped and what they could do with
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:00.280]   it in 2017.
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:01.280]   Perfect.
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.280]   Perfect, perfect, perfect.
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:04.480]   Apple Talk, it's wonderful.
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:05.960]   You can find it at imore.com.
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:08.320]   Look in the podcast section.
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.600]   Andy Inaco does a few shows as well.
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:14.720]   My God, the man is prolific, not only does he write for the Chicago Sun times, but he
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:20.120]   does shows on relay.fm and here as well every week.
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:25.440]   Great thing about the Internet is that it turns out that they can't make you shut up.
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:28.920]   But there's no, they have no power to stop you.
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:29.920]   I am powerless.
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:32.600]   So no, no, they try.
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:33.600]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:34.600]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:35.600]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:40.520]   We do Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern, 1900 UTC.

[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:47.880]   We're on YouTube Live or on Ustream.
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:50.360]   Oh, the site can't be reached.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:51.360]   YouTube is down.
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:52.360]   YouTube is down.
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:53.360]   Oh, no.
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:54.360]   Oh, no.
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:55.360]   You click too fast.
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:58.920]   If you want to be in the studio, we had some not a couple of nice guys in the studio today.
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:47:59.920]   We would love to have you.
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:01.440]   Just email tickets at twit.tv.
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:04.080]   So we make some room for you.
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:08.040]   You know, shuttle some gear out of the way and give you somewhere to sit.
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:13.720]   You can also get everything we do after the fact on demand by just going to twit.tv,
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:18.920]   in this case, twit.tv/mbw or subscribing in your favorite podcatcher.
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:21.800]   Don't ever want to miss an episode.
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:22.800]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:28.720]   And we'll see you next time, but now back to work because break time is over.
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:31.280]   Happy Valentine's Day.
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:32.280]   Happy Valentine's Day.
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:33.280]   Love up.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:34.280]   Love up.
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:36.960]   Even if you don't have a partner today, we love you.
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:47.040]   [music]
