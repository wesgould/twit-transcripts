[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.680]   Can it be?
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.040]   Yes, it is.
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.400]   Less than a week since the big fight between Apple and the Department of Justice, Andy
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.400]   and Renee are here.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.040]   We're really going to break this down.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.720]   Now, there's been time to think about it.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.600]   I think we've all come to some conclusions, some of which may surprise you.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.480]   We'll also talk about loud noises coming from that Apple plant in Sunnyvale.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.480]   What could that mean?
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.000]   And Tim Cook's interview with Adam Laskinski at Fortune.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.440]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.680]   NetCasts you love.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.320]   From people you trust.

[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.480]   core group is with us today.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.520]   Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   Love having you on the show.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.120]   I want a total line from Raiders of the Lost Ark.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.760]   So, let's talk about it.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.600]   Wonder, I wonder, is there any news or any riches here from imore.com?
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.760]   I had to ask these guys because I'm ready Leo.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.760]   Ready, what do you got?
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.760]   There it is.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.760]   Got my protest.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.760]   Is that the hashtag?
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.760]   Stand with Apple?
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.760]   And I used Glitter.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.280]   I used Thord Sparkles before and Megan yelled at me.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.960]   You actually made a sign that says #StandWithApple.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.400]   I tried to and then George took it away from me and made a proper sign.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.720]   So, they're doing rallies today at 5.30 Eastern at local Apple stores.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   So, I'm ready.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.880]   You know that at least here in the United States, almost 60% of Americans agree with
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.760]   the FBI.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.520]   We haven't told a story properly yet, Leo.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.520]   That's all that means.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.720]   So, we haven't explained it to them.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.880]   In a way, we have an advantage that we didn't.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.600]   This happened the day after we did Mac Break Weekly last week.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.400]   And I find that hard to believe because I feel like I've talked it to death because
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.200]   we'd spent a lot of time on Twig talking about it and then again on this week in tech.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.000]   But it is after all an Apple story.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.600]   So, we're going to talk about a Mac Break Weekly.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.960]   And in a way, we have the benefit of a week later because this story has changed.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.840]   Andy, you said you had written one story and then you didn't file it because it changed
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.840]   so fast.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.880]   Yeah, as more data came in as the nature of the request, the reasons why the mechanism
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.680]   by which they were making that request, Apple's response to it and how they were choosing
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.600]   to respond to it.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.200]   And this was definitely one of those situations in which it's the more you hear the more of
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.240]   Apple story you hear, the more this story changes.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:04.560]   Also, the more you talk about how this request has been made, that also changes things.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.640]   I don't think it's a question of black and white, white hat versus black hat.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.000]   But it's definitely an argument that has been a long time coming.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.200]   And boy, this is Frazier versus Ali.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.840]   In this case, Frazier has the manpower of the United States federal government behind
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.840]   it.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.080]   Ali is the most powerful company.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.440]   Apple has slightly better budgeted than the FBI.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.600]   So it's the Department of Justice working on behalf of the FBI, it's branch.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.640]   But let's talk about really what now, I think one thing that probably the polls don't take
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.040]   into account is what's really going on here.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.680]   And in fact, it may be that Americans understand it better than technophiles because it's not
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.720]   the story is not about encryption per se.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:02.200]   The story is about the FBI asking Apple to make changes to one iPhone's firmware in such
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.480]   a way that that iPhone can be brute forced because everybody knows you can't crack the
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.920]   encryption in iOS 8 and iOS 9.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.480]   It's not it's strong encryption that is not crackable.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.640]   But there is kind of a weakness, which is if you can guess the passcode that was a
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.480]   week, passcode.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.800]   The passcode is weak.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.440]   Apple has put some protections in places.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.200]   We all know it's a five second delay between passcode entries.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.040]   And in some cases, if you turn this on after 10 tries, phone gets erased if the FBI doesn't
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.480]   know whether that's the case.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.640]   So what they would like Apple to do, what the court order says Apple must do, and we
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.560]   should hear Apple's response in the next three days is three things.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:52.120]   One, modify the firmware of the phone so that the five second delay is gone and it eliminates
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.000]   any chance of a ratio after 10 failed attempts because the FBI might have to go through all
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.040]   10,000 codes to unlock it.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.200]   And finally, three, they want a way to do this without using some internal interns fingers
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.000]   and want to do it through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.040]   The key on this is again, not that Apple would have to put it back door and it's encryption
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.040]   that is not what they're asking.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:23.360]   However, the question is, and this is probably the argument Apple's going to make, is it
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.920]   too much to ask Apple to create new firmware?
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:32.600]   And by the way, sign it with Apple's magic key because firmware will not run a knife unless
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.400]   it's signed by the Apple key, which is kept, I'm sure, under locked and locked in guard
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.480]   at Apple headquarters.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.160]   So they'll have to write new firmware, I don't know how challenging that is, but I suspect
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.960]   someone, they'll have to sign it and then they'll have to put it on that phone.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.440]   They have to connect it.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.760]   How do they put it on the phone, Renee?
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.040]   They connect it via iTunes?
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.360]   Could they do it over Wi-Fi?
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.200]   Well, they have something called Purple Restore at Apple, which is the way that they put
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.560]   betas and other...
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.840]   It comes from the project's heard, which was the data for the iPhone.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.840]   That's unknown.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.520]   I mean, a traditional restoration of firmware does replace the firmware on the device, but
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.360]   given that Apple owns the entire thing, it's conceivable that they would have ways of
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.520]   doing that.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.440]   So Apple says, "Yeah, we can do it, but it's something we think is too dangerous to do
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.480]   because the only way to guarantee that this new firmware isn't abused and doesn't fall
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.440]   into the wrong hands is to never create it."
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.000]   I would say, if you say, "Well, look, it's the FBI.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.040]   Apple keeps its key safe enough.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:39.520]   I imagine the FBI could be trusted to keep this firmware safe enough."
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.720]   And by the way, the firmware can be tied to the unique device identifier, right?
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.840]   Yeah, I believe their response was more precedent-setting, that if the FBI can ask this once, they can
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.400]   ask this every time, and then the Chinese government can ask this, and then governments
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.880]   that are at war with their citizens could ask this.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.400]   The size of the market in China and many other countries is increasingly big and might
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.840]   have overpassed the US.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.680]   This is entirely a battle over precedent, not really about this one iPhone.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.080]   Well, and then we should also point out that Apple is not saying no.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.680]   In fact, Apple hasn't responded yet.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.160]   They have a few days to respond.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.320]   But it's not that they're saying no.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.160]   They're asking the court not to make them do it.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:21.920]   They're asking the court to say, and the court order said if Apple could show it sufficiently
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.480]   burdensome.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.480]   Which is that old law, right?
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.280]   It's a 200-year-old writ that they're using to affect that, yeah, the all-rits act, which
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.520]   has to pass, I believe, three prongs of reasonability.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.800]   And that in itself is interesting because I was talking to some people who are familiar
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.760]   with this law and work.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.680]   I can't name them.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.040]   But people who are justly very familiar with this, and they all kind of referred to it
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.880]   as the, sure, why not?
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.080]   Let's give that a try act in that it's very, very broad.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.440]   It really was written when they were trying to lay out the entire judicial system about
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.960]   who gets to make the law as Congress or the judiciary.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:08.360]   And it was sort of a necessary backdoor that said, well, what happens if Congress has not
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.240]   passed a law for or against anything?
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.040]   There's absolutely no guidance.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.400]   Can the court simply say until Congress says otherwise, we're saying you can do this or
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.400]   you can't do this?
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.400]   And that's the excuse.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:25.720]   It authorizes federal courts to issue all writs, which would be court orders necessary
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:31.320]   or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.040]   and principles of law.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.520]   It really, as vague as that sounds, it's exactly as you say, Andy, it's saying, well, the courts,
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.880]   if it's not, if it's not, it's best spelled out in the law, the courts can issue court
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.200]   order for something that they want to have happen.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.960]   So this is why there's a lot of, there's a lot of wiggle room in this, in this whole
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.960]   case.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.920]   There have been other precedents where they have said, well, because, for instance, there's
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:03.920]   a difference between compelling, let's say that I've got my phone here and I'm involved
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.200]   in some sort of a legal action.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.680]   This phone is protected via a password and via fingerprint.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:16.280]   And the court can't, if I want, if I don't want to give them the password, I can basically
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.640]   claim that I don't have to give you that password because this, this has evidence that that
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.920]   might incriminate me.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:28.320]   And so the information that I have, I have the ability to decide not to give you.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.880]   However, with a different application, they have decided that, well, you don't have your
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.600]   fingerprints are just your fingerprints.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.440]   You don't have the ability to decide not to have them.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.840]   So we can, or rather, it's easier for the court to order you to provide your fingerprint,
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.560]   because again, you do not have the ability to decide not to have this fingerprint on
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.560]   your finger.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.080]   So this is why the law is historically funny.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.240]   It also becomes a problem because what, if, let's say that this all goes through as the
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:04.280]   FBI wants, they also have to have, they, what do they have the ability to decide to define
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.360]   for themselves what consists of Apple conforming to this court order.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:13.400]   So let's say that Apple does this does give them this ability to bypass the passcode on
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.600]   this one device, but they can't find the information that they wanted.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.320]   Do they then have the ability to say, well, pursuant to given that, given that we made
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.280]   this request because there might be information that can save American citizens lives on this
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.920]   phone, we're now going to ask you to please disassemble this part of memory.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.560]   That's in a secure, that's in a secure part that we can't read.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.800]   There need to be a lot of specifics about this hashed out before we really know exactly
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.000]   how big and broad this is.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:48.080]   So why, I mean, given that it would be, I think the argument that it's going to leak out that
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.000]   Apple's using, I don't think that's a strong argument.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.920]   I mean, it's a principled one.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:59.760]   I mean, there are a lot of things about Apple's actions that are 100% that, I'm sorry, to
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:05.480]   an outside observer, because again, we haven't heard of these sort of open and in depth conversations
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.360]   with Apple about this yet.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.800]   There are a lot of things that are really altruistic, that they could make their lives
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.440]   easier by simply complying with this.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.400]   But then there's a lot of this where this is just really good.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.840]   It is definitely in their best interest to not create this tool.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.600]   What is not appreciated by, I think, the 60% of the people who think that Apple should
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.680]   comply with this is that this is not one, this is not a small thing.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.320]   It's not as though they have to go to a lot file cabin inside Cupertino, pull out a passcode
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.800]   and hand to the FBI.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.200]   If that were within their capability, Apple has already come worked with the FBI on this
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.160]   case to a really intense level.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:44.040]   I think the line in that public letter that the public employee email that Tim Cook posted
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.440]   was very, very carefully chosen that we hate terrorists.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.640]   We don't want terrorists.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.080]   We're helping the FBI.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.360]   We've helped them step by step by step.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.040]   The thing is we don't want to write a new version or a hack to our own operating system.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.320]   What they don't understand is that there's going to be a huge, it's a huge amount of work
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.320]   to do this.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.520]   So they're basically asking Apple to create a brand new product that's pretty much, that's
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.160]   pretty much what they're asking to do.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:12.760]   Not only that, but if they, again, this is where day three of my working on this turned
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:18.280]   it day four and day five, because now we're into a whole new kettle of fish.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:28.280]   If Apple is now creating a brand new piece of software for allowing access to this phone,
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:36.840]   it's possible that this data, this procedure is going to have to be documented and tested
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:42.120]   and proven outside of Apple so that it can be proven that no, the FBI didn't just put
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.120]   information on this phone.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.720]   Let's say that the FBI gets a list of contacts of whether this imaginary person is guilty
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:55.640]   or innocent, a person that these people had been in contact with four times just before
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.000]   the tragedy.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.440]   And now that they're now they're going to charge this person with a crime because if they lent
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:06.240]   this person a hundred bucks for bus fare because their transmission was shot or whatever,
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.000]   that the defense attorney for that that defendant is going to have the ability to say, okay,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   well, how do we know that they got this data fair and square?
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.680]   How do they know this data was even on the phone in the first place?
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.800]   And so basically Apple is going to be, Apple could be hypothetically required to have built
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.480]   this tool in such a way that it has been observed every step of the way documented every step
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.640]   of the way so that it can challenge every step.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.760]   This is Jonathan Zadarski's and by the way, if you haven't read his blog post, this is
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.840]   his point in his blog post, he's a forensics expert besides being an Apple security expert.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.720]   Literally wrote the book on iPhone forensics.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.640]   And that's his point is that now Apple's suddenly a forensics company.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.640]   And that may be burdensome.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.520]   Which is worse because the forensics companies allowed the test things and the rules for
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.120]   allowed the test things are very different from a company that makes a forensic tool that
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.360]   is used by law enforcement.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.200]   And that's where all the disclosure and declaration and peer review and everything comes in.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.200]   And I think we could agree.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.240]   And another Apple shouldn't be in the forensics business.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.960]   That's not good for its business.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:09.280]   And the only way around this, or excuse me, the way it's been explained to me that one
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:14.000]   way around this would be for the FBI to have someone, for lack of a better word, embedded
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.880]   at Apple that they can be a witness and they can testify about the process.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:24.120]   But now we have a very, getting very close to God winning this conversation.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.120]   But now we have a situation where do you really want to have a political representative
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:33.120]   of the government embedded inside various companies to observe what's going on?
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.840]   That's another one of those.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.520]   There are a lot of things that we don't like about this in principle.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.920]   And that would be another one though that is hypothetical.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.600]   But we're trying to, it's all cause to the point of it's just really, really difficult
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:49.960]   for Apple to do this and not create immense trouble for them way down the road.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:55.240]   Which is why, although I think that, I don't think the FBI is doing something wrong by
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.800]   making this demand, I also don't think that Apple is doing something wrong by saying we
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.840]   refuse to do this until it is proven that we are required to do that.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.600]   And that's exactly what the court system is there for.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.960]   I'm sure this is going to go as high up as it can possibly go before Apple complies or
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.400]   the FBI gives up.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.760]   But I think that's completely appropriate, as you say.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:25.000]   And I think that what Tim Cook said was not Apple's response to the court.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.320]   What Tim Cook did when he published his open letter on Apple.com is raise these issues
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.120]   and say there should be a public discussion of this.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.920]   But Apple has not yet responded to the court.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.080]   And so we don't know what Apple's going to say to the court.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.880]   What we expect, they'll say something like this, is the tests you mentioned, the three
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:49.640]   factor test for applicable application of the All Ritz Act, the party ordered cannot
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.120]   be too far removed from the case.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.120]   In this case, I don't think you can argue that Apple's removed from the case.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.360]   It's an Apple iPhone.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.240]   The government, and this is, I think the one that's going to end up being the key one,
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.040]   the government's request cannot impose an undue burden on that party.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.720]   And the party's assistance is necessary.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.160]   I think one in three are satisfied.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.920]   But this is the only way, in other words, Apple can argue.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:15.120]   I'm no attorney, is that it's an undue burden on Apple.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:22.080]   Not that it would be this larger discussion about security and so forth.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.280]   I mean, that's not really how they can defend.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.120]   Maybe they can go to the court and say that's part of the burden is, well, now you're going
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:33.480]   to make, you're going to impinge on security for everybody.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.440]   But let me ask you guys this question.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:43.160]   If Apple is complies or is forced to comply, does it really, it's not like it's a golden
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.800]   back door to encryption.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.720]   It's not that.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.040]   How does this hurt us and hurt our security?
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.960]   There's a couple of things that are really interesting about this.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.400]   And following the case day to day and watching how it's changed has been very informative
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.400]   on it.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.400]   And originally, why would Apple put out this statement?
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.360]   And it was because it looked like this was going to be not a quiet backroom dealing, which
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.960]   Apple has been involved in many times.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.660]   And Apple asked for absolutely, absolutely in this case, but that this was going to be
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:14.000]   put in front of the public and that it was strategically chosen because it has a lot
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.600]   of button issues like terrorism to put Apple in as and as worse a light as possible, the
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.880]   least sympathy that could be made for Apple as possible.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.080]   And this is something law enforcement.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.240]   It's been going on for over a year for several years actually, but over a year just in the
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.440]   papers alone.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.520]   And that's this push by some in law enforcement and some in government to actively remove
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.480]   or reduce encryption or to introduce back doors.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.040]   Although this is not a specific backdoor to introduce the ideas of back doors in general.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.840]   This is a huge war that's being fought within law enforcement within the government.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.720]   Not everyone in the government agrees or is on the same page, but it is a huge debate.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.840]   And this case seemed almost cherry picked.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:53.360]   And it looked like the famous quote in an emotional versus a rational argument, the emotional
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.720]   argument wins.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.760]   And when you see the way the FBI has been talking about this, including the FBI director,
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.440]   it really does make people think that Apple is on the wrong side of this.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.160]   They're not standing up that they're basically with terrorists and against freedom.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.800]   And I think Apple's response to this and making it public has been part of that, part of sort
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.400]   of fighting back on the PR front and saying that we absolutely believe in freedom.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.080]   And these are the reasons why we think this is a bad idea, including foreign powers doing
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.080]   the exact same thing as the FBI.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.960]   And I think that is a couple of the big concerns here are they, this will allow effectively
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.640]   the government to force Apple to write software, to write what is to either lessen their security
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:37.600]   or to write software specifically designed to retrieve data, a forensic tool to retrieve
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.600]   data from iPhones.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:42.680]   And it's unclear whether the government can or should be allowed to force companies to
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.120]   write that kind of software or to do that sort of thing to customer data.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.760]   But also it opens the door to like the FBI was very careful to say this is a one off,
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.720]   but it's now been revealed that they have, you know, that the various legal departments
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.520]   have 20 plus more phones.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.520]   And there are millions of more phones that if this works, Apple has been presented by
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.280]   the FBI with 20 more phones, most of them not terrorist cases, by the way.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.280]   Yes.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.400]   And again, terrorists is a super emotional issue.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.000]   And then it's been the New York Times had a great article saying China was thinking of
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.280]   doing this last year.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.960]   And it was only America's hesitancy to impose similar laws that held them back to the
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.920]   medical school through in the US.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.920]   China is right behind.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:22.560]   And if China orders Apple to give a similar tool, whether it's for using against criminals
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.880]   or dissidents, because every country has its own measure of what criminal activity is.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.520]   Apple, how could Apple say no to China?
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.440]   They said no to the United States or Russia or to a government who is literally at war
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.720]   with their citizens.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.280]   It's a very slippery slope.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.960]   It's an internationally very slippery slope.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.440]   And it's something I think, you know, we talk about this all the time, but I think it's
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.280]   something that lay people when presented the way the FBI presented it would think that
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.400]   Apple was not on the right side of it.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.440]   And that's well, there are two sides to that, of course.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:21:00.040]   One of them is that it's sort of an evergreen legislative bill to force phone makers and
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.640]   hardware makers to make sure they're backdoors and everything.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:07.760]   That's been true basically for the past 10, at least the past 10 or 15 years since I've
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.160]   been paying a lot of attention to that sort of stuff.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:16.240]   And of course, in the light of all this, you're seeing some really silly legislation that
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:21.400]   might force Apple to create new backdoors to every phone sold in California or 20 years
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.480]   or $2,500 fine per infraction.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:31.160]   But there's also a difficulty where if there is, if there were an easy way for the American
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.360]   government to get through encryption that'd been placed on a device by an American company,
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.440]   that makes it super hard for that American company then to sell that same hardware internationally
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.080]   to other governments because they're going to know that you're basically giving access
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:48.800]   to that there is a tool that the government, American government has to access all of their
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   communications.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:56.000]   The other thing is the fact that the Rene is right.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.720]   A lot of the problems with Apple's defense in the public eye is that a lot of these ideas
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.160]   are important but they're abstract.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.960]   One of them is that if this exists now, all these other governments and all these other
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.840]   agencies have leverage against Apple when they're making this argument.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.800]   They could say that, well, we're not asking to do something you've never done before.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.560]   You've been through this, you probably have the code.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.400]   Maybe you can reuse this code or better yet they can argue before a judge that what we're
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.800]   asking Apple, what we're demanding Apple to do isn't unusual.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.800]   Look, they've done it before.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.800]   So it's not as a word.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.800]   It's less of a burden now.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.480]   And also there's the problem of, you know, there are a lot of every single company, Apple
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.440]   included, they've got included.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.760]   There's somebody who's not being paid enough or that they don't believe they're being paid
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.520]   enough or they don't think they're being rewarded or acknowledged enough.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:44.280]   And those are the people that would be more than happy to, if not hand hand over, a Bernoulli
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.480]   cartridge full of code.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.080]   They're willing to at least say, well, here's what I saw and here's what they did.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.080]   And they were talking about this method that they use to get past the, to get past encryption
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.800]   or get past the past code.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:01.120]   That's the sort of, I mean, why if you can, if you can possibly avoid giving out a piece
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.680]   of information that can be useful or devastating to users, why wouldn't you do that?
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.680]   All right.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.680]   Here's a question.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.000]   Here's a, here's a question.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.920]   So again, once again, I'll just restate this.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:15.120]   You're not asking Apple to do a backdoor into an application.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.480]   There's a lot of, there's a lot of scare, scare terminology being used on, on what they're
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:25.080]   saying is Apple, we want you to modify the firmware so we can brute force this device.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.800]   Yeah, it's a big brute forcing easier now.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.800]   Here's the question.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:33.080]   If I'm Apple, of course, I'm going to try to not do this, but I'm also going to immediately
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:38.360]   go into the lab and say, well, what can we do to prevent brute force attacks that we
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.760]   can't go around?
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:46.560]   Apple's been super consistent over several years about this in which they've been, I
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:51.240]   think that I don't know what's going on internally, but I think that there was, it's all the
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:56.440]   signs that at some point collectively they realize that their best defense against requests
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.560]   like this is to simply not even have the ability.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:05.120]   And that's why they did strong encryptions by default, starting with iOS 8, in fact,
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.960]   not only by default, but by, by you can't.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.680]   And iOS 9 has the six digit passcode by default, which is this longer.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.200]   And you have the option for a password, which is effectively complete protection against
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.200]   this.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.200]   Right.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.320]   So yes, that's a good point.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:25.680]   So in fact, they have engineered some some technologies to prevent brute forcing.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.480]   So that would be another response, at least going forward.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.520]   It doesn't help you with older phones.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.520]   Do we know?
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.520]   We don't know.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.520]   This is a 5c, but we don't know.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.760]   It is updated, apparently.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.160]   We don't know if he's they had a six digit or a four digit code.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.720]   I mean, there'd be no point.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.720]   Yeah, well, it's not.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.360]   Yeah, as long as they have one of those two, I mean, it's just once they have a tool,
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.760]   six, you could brute force, I guess, just takes longer.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:53.760]   And I think we all understand that this is not this is this is the FBI looking for a
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.920]   suitable case to set a precedent as opposed to a vital piece of information or evidence
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.920]   that they need.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.360]   Well, and in a letter it said to you like Tim Cook said that engineers were sent there
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.320]   that they were they tried to try to help as much as they could with the backup.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.680]   The password was reset once it was in federal custody, which meant that the usual method
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.600]   which is to pair it with a known network and let the backup happen and then help the
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.880]   FBI get the backup file.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.960]   All of this stuff was gone through.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:21.240]   They spent a lot of time and a lot of company money, frankly, cooperating already.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.360]   Yeah, but there's there.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.160]   That's why there's so many it gets really interesting.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.080]   There's no end of interesting rat holes to go down.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.800]   Actually, there are no rat holes because it's all interesting.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.440]   One part of it is that this did not belong this phone did not belong to the suspected
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.440]   terrorist.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:42.360]   They're a lawyer, which means that they don't have to ask anything of the user of that phone.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.400]   If your company has given you a phone to do your work on, that's their phone.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.480]   That data you put on that is their data.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.880]   They have right to access it.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:54.160]   And the reason why they changed the password was because they changed the account is that
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.760]   they felt as though there was a there was a chance that somebody could remotely wipe the
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:03.520]   phone if it was still under that control and maybe not a smart thing for them to do.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.400]   But that's why they did it.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.680]   And then that's one of the reasons why I think Apple was so thorough in their assistance
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:17.200]   of the FBI because they are protecting the data of the person who owns that phone because
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.440]   again, it didn't belong to the person who was using it, it belonged to the company that
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.440]   actually purchased it.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.280]   Well, and that's why this is a perfect case for the FBI because it eliminates a lot of
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.280]   issues.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:30.800]   Well, this is why I'm hesitant to say that they chose this because this was a good test
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.800]   case.
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.400]   And they could have picked a softer target than the most success, not only the most successful
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.400]   company in the world.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:42.880]   Someone has known to have a bank checkbook that has a $230 billion balance on it.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:49.600]   And also a company that is really good at playing the media really well, but also Apple
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.960]   set up the confrontation by doing encryption.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.320]   I mean, Android phones are not encrypted by default.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.320]   The only ones that are the Google Nexus phones.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:01.640]   Yeah, if I would have done this, this is what I this was the result I wanted.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.160]   This is a sort of case I would have led with in a sort of way that I would have.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.600]   You wouldn't want this public discussion, but on the other hand, you're winning.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.480]   So I think I think that law enforcement also wants this to be a public discussion.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.760]   And here's what I get at.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:19.560]   I mean, there's there's I've been talking to law enforcement at the national level on
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:24.960]   various issues like this for at least 10 or 15 years, like I said, and different people's
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:30.800]   different situations, different real life situations and and and hypothetical ones.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:37.240]   And the real professionals in that line of work have always presented to me a very, very
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.480]   compelling and consistent view.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:45.040]   And I think I've mentioned on the show before that their job is to keep people safe and
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:52.040]   there and the breaks on their behavior is what's legal, what is not legal.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.400]   And if there is a tool that's available to them that can help them solve something or
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.920]   get information that could help them break up something that's kind of bad that could
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.920]   happen.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.560]   And they don't use that because they don't know if it's legal or not.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.880]   That's that's not just, well, gosh, we made more trouble for ourselves than we needed
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.880]   to.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.880]   It is we're not doing our job.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:16.720]   If we didn't, if we if if we don't simply, if we think that we could solve a problem
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:23.400]   by putting a security camera on top of a public utility poll, pointing it at somebody who
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.320]   is on parole because they know he's going to screw up sooner or later.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.640]   And well, what do you know, at some point he did do something that was against the law.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.280]   They got the footage of it and they were able to take him back in.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.000]   It's not up to them to ask whether that is ethical or not ethical.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.560]   It's only up to them to ask is that legal or illegal?
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.920]   And if we the people feel as though that shouldn't be legal, there we can give them
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.400]   that guidance by saying, no, you have to pass a law saying that this isn't right.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.680]   So this is why when I when we talk about a precedent for this, they are going to try
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:56.280]   to do this until the public or lawmakers, sometimes they're very separate groups of
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.480]   people tell them that, no, you can't do this.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.560]   So it's so I don't think that they picked this fight because they thought that this was
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.040]   a good way to fight this out.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:08.280]   When I when I see cases like this, that's I think about those people that I talk to.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.600]   And rather than thinking about a bunch of bullies who are saying we can do this, we can
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.480]   do whatever you want and you can't stop us, we're going to fight this as far as we can
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.480]   go.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.160]   It's, you know what, we really, really think that this is an important thing for us to
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.400]   be able to do.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.480]   And we're not going to find out whether we can can whether we can continue to use this
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.960]   tool or not until it is proven in a court of law.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.920]   And so that's why we need to we we're looking for guidance.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.920]   We would like to be able to keep on doing this.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.640]   And so this is why we're going to try to do this.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.640]   They're not jerks.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.640]   They're not cows.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.880]   They're just saying that this is a good this is a tool that we find to be useful and we
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.080]   like to be able to use it.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.200]   I think that's absolutely true.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.160]   But there is an old saying that directors are political animals and assistant directors
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.120]   are the ones who are really part of the organization.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.400]   And I think that there is a huge level of politics involved at the director level at
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:51.360]   some of these organizations and that the views of people within it may be very different.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.520]   But at the same time we're living in a point in history where as additional breaks on
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.360]   these sorts of things have not been forthcoming.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.480]   I mean we we're supposed to live in a society where there are checks and balances.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.640]   But everything from military to law enforcement have been pushing the balance of what you
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.920]   know 20 years ago 10 years ago when we would have found absolutely appalling and not not
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.440]   to quote you know Denny Crane on this.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.000]   But we said that was okay.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.520]   I mean a lot of stuff that's happened would be horrifying if we were presented to it in
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.440]   a civil or historical context.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.280]   And we've been totally accepted about it.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.080]   And one of the things that happened to me immediately when I started covering the story
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.000]   is people saying well what if it was your kid?
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.240]   What if that phone had information about your child or your friend on it?
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.240]   Then you wouldn't be saying all those things.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.240]   And that's absolutely true.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.240]   I would be devastated.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.240]   I would be destroyed.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.960]   I would be screaming on the top of a mountain.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.400]   And that's why we don't let victims run investigations.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.680]   And that's you know that's why we don't use that argument to support torture and all sorts
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.120]   of other barbarism although sometimes we do.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.760]   But all these things I think are true but I think where we're failing is we're not providing
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:49.960]   that civil oversight.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:55.120]   If we look back over this Snowden disclosures and we look back at some of the activities
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.340]   recently, never mind wiretaps from yours previously, we are failing as a society to
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.960]   provide this sort of oversight that these law enforcement organizations need.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.280]   And absent that we're going to keep seeing stuff like that.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.280]   And if Apple has to be the one that fights it which is kind of weird to me.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.200]   I don't know why politicians aren't up on the front of this fighting this force.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.680]   Because that's technically their job.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.720]   Then you know more power to Apple for doing it because somebody needs to.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.360]   This is going to be one of the finding arguments of our time.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:22.920]   Yeah, I mean for me it's really comes down to the basic principle.
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:27.280]   I don't even think that the terrorism aspect is a guiding thing.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:33.840]   I think that we still need to define what are the limits to our privacy as citizens.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.680]   And that's something that's been very much an open issue.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:41.120]   We've always had any time that we wanted to keep a secret from our government.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:47.040]   The only way we had to keep that secret was to have absolutely no record of any kind.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:52.080]   Because if you can write something down on a piece of paper you can put it in a safe lock
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.760]   the safe, lock that safe in another safe, sink it in concrete, then toss that concrete
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.440]   off the side of a barge.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:03.040]   But there's the FBI would know that well we can get, we can send divers down, we can
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.800]   haul it up, we can break through the concrete, we can solve through the safe, we can get
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.800]   at that paper.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.200]   And if that paper is in some sort of a code that Andy Naco came up with or found online,
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.760]   we have that code already that's no problem.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:17.000]   What's unprecedented is that now we have the ability as citizens to come up with.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.760]   To create a secret that the government can't get access to.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:24.920]   So now we're asking that this should be a referendum on does a private citizen have
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:29.960]   the right to know something that the government does not know and taken to an extreme and
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.520]   I'm going to acknowledge this is taking to an extreme.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:37.720]   I'm not saying this is the real situation, but to me the way that I feel about the importance
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:42.000]   of privacy to say that we don't have the right to have a level of encryption, let's
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.100]   say, or the right to have a secret that the government can't have is a lot like saying
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.760]   I don't have the right to burn that piece of paper that has to be something that should
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.040]   be able to to be accessed later on by an outside party.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:33:01.480]   And this is why it's these kinds of issues are kind of hard to argue because I found
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:06.360]   myself last week as I was thinking about this, thinking about my attitude towards gun control.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:10.120]   And I don't I'm not particularly against the second amendment.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.200]   I just to just to put the put things on the table here.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:19.180]   I think that if you are I think that if you are reasonable and responsible, then you want
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.780]   to have a firearm, you should be okay to do that.
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.780]   But you also should be if you're also I feel as though if you're reasonable and responsible,
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:29.100]   then you have no problem with the government putting a limitation on what you can get or
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.540]   even if you can get it.
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:35.220]   However, imagine a different podcast of someone who feels as strongly about the second amendment
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.100]   as I feel about privacy.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:41.540]   They would be making the same, I hope, cogent and clear arguments that I know that the
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:44.320]   guns can be used for awful and unlawful purposes.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:49.980]   But there is a basic principle that we have the right to have a firearm and the government
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.060]   does not have the right to tell us we can't.
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.700]   And that's that's that's a rational point that's worth fighting for according to this
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:56.700]   person's point of view.
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.940]   I would disagree with them, but I would say that I think you've done something you're
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.620]   making at least a point that makes some that I understand why you feel that way.
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:08.100]   And now we have the need to explain why as Americans we should stand for this.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:11.300]   I mean, last I'm running out of breath, of course, so I'm going to wind up.
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.860]   But the last thing I wanted to just mention is that we are unique as Americans in this
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:22.300]   sense that in the UK, they're just for the first amendment, the UK is used to the idea
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.980]   that the government can say in other your pronations, we have that the government can
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.180]   say no, this can't be published or you know you were wrong to even say this, even though
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:31.980]   it wasn't a libelous or slanderous, slanderous.
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:39.060]   The UK investigatory powers bill has immense amount of control over citizens privacy and
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:43.220]   what people can and can't say and people can and can't do.
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:47.220]   Whereas we would never ever ever go for something like that.
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:52.580]   The Chinese even had a problem when they were trying to pass laws to control encryption
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.700]   and to control privacy.
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:58.620]   Even that this is this is China where they they own all the pipes in and out communicating
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:34:59.620]   in and out.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:00.620]   We are different.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:05.900]   We are used to basically I'm saying I'm saying this as an observation, not as a good or bad
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.220]   thing intrinsically.
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:12.860]   We are born as part of our national culture to think that just because the government
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:18.260]   tells us that something is in our best interests, we are going to be healthily skeptical about
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.980]   that even if what they're telling us is actually in our best interest.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.220]   So that's why it's really important that we think about this and we don't simply let
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:29.980]   the president slide that there is no circumstance under which the government cannot pressure
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:34.420]   a company or pressure an individual to give up something that is secret no matter what
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:35.580]   the responses.
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:39.100]   There's other huge difference with this too and that is usually a warrant was applied
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.820]   for a specific things.
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.180]   Warns are usually not that general.
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:46.060]   They usually very specific but smartphones are a new kind of thing.
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.380]   They consist of many more parts.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.820]   For example, the government might be interested in my communications but if they get my phone
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.100]   they also get my health records, my financial information, my location as it's been tracked
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.260]   over time.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:59.620]   The amount of information it's sort of like in the old days it was in your head and no
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.340]   one would sort of want the government to have telepathy and be able to bury through your
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.660]   head and find out everything about you.
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:08.260]   That would probably immediately put up alarm bells but this is the closest thing we've
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:12.140]   actually had to telepathy because it keeps a running record of everything in your life.
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:16.820]   No one specific instance, everyone you've talked to, every place that you've gone, every
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:21.340]   step that you've taken, every blood pressure, almost everything about you, every payment
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:26.020]   you've made and that is an incredible amount of information that in most cases is far beyond
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.540]   the scope of any warrant but would be available immediately to anybody that access.
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:37.660]   Well, I need to point out that we're not lawyers but in general that only information
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:44.860]   discovered specified in the warrant would be able to be used in court.
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:45.860]   So immediately.
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:52.020]   Yes, if you get in somebody's house you can see stuff that may incriminate them in other
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:56.220]   cases but that warrant is very specific about what you're looking for and you may not use
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.220]   that other material.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:02.900]   In fact there was a Supreme Court case, Anthony Scalia wrote a very interesting majority
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:08.580]   decision on this case in which police officers who were, had a warrant to go look for a gun
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:14.100]   because somebody who shot a hole in the wall then thought to look at the serial numbers
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.540]   on the back of the stereo equipment and found out it was stolen.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:19.780]   They arrested the guys for stealing stereo equipment and then went all the way to the Supreme
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.140]   Court and Supreme Court ruled they may not use, they could not use that evidence, they
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.060]   could not use those serial numbers because that wasn't what the warrant was for.
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:33.740]   So it isn't the case, in my opinion, of course, that may not be the case but because I'm
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:36.700]   not a lawyer but it isn't the case I don't believe that you can just say, well I got
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.220]   everything on the phone, let's see what else is there.
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.580]   You know, you're protected.
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:43.740]   House theory, you're protected against that.
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.580]   But this they take for permanent data control so that's the only difference.
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.180]   They understand they have access to everything but in theory they're not allowed to use it.
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:58.260]   Yeah, but that's the, that's, that raises for me an even larger problem when law enforcement
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:02.700]   tries to determine that they don't need a warrant to get certain pieces of information.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:08.140]   Well that's 10 registers and a lot of metadata and so forth and yeah, well they can say,
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:11.500]   well, just, I don't actually want to point out, there's a different, that's a different
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.500]   argument.
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.380]   Now you're arguing against what is the law the land based on?
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:18.820]   I don't know, I'm sorry.
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:24.260]   I hope that was really clear that when I talked about how I, I opposed the basic principle
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:30.500]   that there is no piece of data that the government can't force a company to give up, if again,
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:35.020]   apart from, you know, if they're being investigated for wire fraud, okay, yes, they have to give
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:39.540]   that stuff up but, or this, and there's no piece of information that a consumer can't
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:43.620]   have that can have that the government shouldn't be able to decrypt.
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:48.340]   I'm saying that it's oftentimes you start off with agreeing with something as a citizen
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.740]   because it really is a really good idea.
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:58.060]   Same thing with the, same thing with the drunk drunk, excuse me, anti drunk driving roadblocks.
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:03.380]   The problem is that that's a good idea, particularly on New Year's Eve when there's a lot of drunk
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:07.820]   driving fatalities, especially when then when if you, the law enforcement has numbers saying
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:10.260]   that here is the number of accidents that we're able to, the people were able to take
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:13.220]   off the road because we had these driving stops.
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:18.740]   But then there are, it gets the step number two, I'm sorry, I got off track.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:26.920]   A better case is the Ricoh Act where the idea was let's cut off these organized crime
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:32.340]   Biden to simply be able to seize assets that are involved in drug transactions.
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:36.100]   Like if you bought, if you bought yourself a $10 million house and we know that you got
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.060]   it through drug money, we can take the house.
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:43.300]   And if you bought yourself at $8,000 solid gold cowboy hat, we can take that hat and then
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.340]   use that, take that money away from you.
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.540]   And that was a very, very good idea.
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:52.860]   But now it's, you see that years later, it's being used as stopping people for not being
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.060]   a white dude when they're driving.
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:59.540]   And then they've got $800 in cash on them and simply saying that we have reason to believe
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:03.460]   that you would not be driving this car in this neighborhood with $800 in cash unless you
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.420]   were doing it for a drug transaction.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.540]   So we're going to seize this $800 in cash.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:11.140]   And then literally buy ourselves a margarita maker for the station house and you will not
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.300]   be able to get it back.
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.700]   There's going to be like a three or there's going to be at least a three or four year
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.780]   process that will cost you many thousands of dollars to get it back.
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:22.260]   And this all started because we started with this principle that we should be able to seize
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:28.780]   private assets and not have a speedy way of demonstrating why this was being seized and
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.220]   why it shouldn't be returned.
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:35.780]   This is why when you talk about fighting for a principle, oftentimes you are talking about
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.180]   deeply abstract things that are hard to make a convincing argument about.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.180]   But the argument.
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.180]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:44.260]   So your point is that it's a slippery that there are slippery slopes.
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:49.420]   But I think a lot of the argument against this from the tech community is just in general
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.660]   a mistrust of government.
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.580]   And that's a perfectly legitimate argument to have.
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:59.820]   But that's not really what this blind faith in Apple is bad blind flamethrower government
[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:00.820]   blindness.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:02.260]   I'm not even I'm not even saying that.
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.980]   Just saying that that's not the discussion here.
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:12.020]   The discussion here is why is how Apple would resist a court order, not whether Apple should
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.780]   not honor a court order.
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:19.660]   Or I mean, I don't I think it really muddies the waters to say, well, it's the government.
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:22.060]   So just screw it.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.820]   I think you have to really focus on the facts of the case.
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:29.980]   And then if you want to have a discussion in a separate time about whether the government
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.860]   sucks, that's another matter.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:35.500]   But it's not germane here is my opinion.
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.700]   I think the slippery slope argument is germane.
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:43.420]   If what you're saying is, well, we got to be careful because this is a slippery slope.
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.420]   Well, the idea is presidents, which the law is based on.
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:46.420]   Right.
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:47.420]   That's a relevance.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:52.180]   But I don't think it's a this is a this is a this is about arguing whether it's a good
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:54.260]   law or a bad law at this point.
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.940]   I think well, you can.
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:01.060]   But that's not helpful because it's not it's not what's going to happen here.
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:07.060]   I'm trying to find the most the most clear way of phrasing it because sometimes it's
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:10.660]   possible to choose the wrong words and create the wrong impression.
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:17.460]   The whole what what what I've come to understand is that the appeal this sort of appeals process
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:21.580]   is not about basically saying that you can't make me do something I don't want to do.
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:27.500]   A lot of this stuff when it gets sort of sent to hire and hire courts is based I've come
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.620]   to understand it's based on the idea of I don't think you're right.
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:34.700]   You're the government and you're you've made a really nice argument on a thick stack of
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.220]   paper on why you think this law should be applied here.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.300]   I don't think you're right.
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:43.380]   I think that is not but it is not the branch of the government that decides that which
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.780]   is called the courts.
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.180]   Right.
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.980]   That's the government as well.
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:55.340]   So it's appropriate for the courts to decide this unless you want to argue against that.
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.380]   But I believe that that is not the argument we should be having at this point.
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.660]   It's not whether it's appropriate for the courts to decide this.
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:03.900]   That's why you fight it in court.
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:10.300]   What I was about to say was that it is completely appropriate for Apple to resist this.
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:11.300]   Yes.
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.460]   For the means they're using to do this.
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:13.460]   Exactly.
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:18.980]   And basically insist that this is an important enough and a vague enough request that we need
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:23.340]   the if necessary the highest court in the land to tell us that this has to happen.
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.340]   Yes.
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:28.100]   That's that's that's the only point that I'm making.
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.100]   Yeah.
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:30.100]   No, I completely agree with you.
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.140]   Bill Gates and actually he's disputing this.
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.140]   I don't know which is true or not.
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:35.140]   Excusing.
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:39.420]   In the financial times Bill Gates says that it's very simple.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.060]   Apple should in fact do this.
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:45.060]   This is a specific case where the government is asking for access to information.
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:49.220]   They're not asking for some general thing they're asking for a particular case.
[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.980]   I love his analogy.
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:54.380]   He says no different than whether anybody should ever have been able to tell the phone
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.380]   company to get information.
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:56.860]   Should anybody be able to get a bank register?
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:00.480]   Let's say the the bank had tied a ribbon around the disk drive and said don't make us
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:06.100]   cut this ribbon because once we do you're going to keep make us do it many times.
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:09.860]   Now I think the argument Apple's going to make is not that arguments.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:12.020]   It's an undue burden to cut the ribbon.
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.020]   Although there are.
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.020]   We are making the art.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:18.660]   They're not asking for Apple to cut the ribbon.
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.420]   Apple I believe would probably be a cutter.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.260]   They're asking for a ribbon cutter which is what Apple does.
[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:26.980]   If Apple does this do does the FBI get something they can use over and over again.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:27.980]   I don't believe so.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.300]   The precedent to get them to keep doing this sort of.
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.300]   But that's the point.
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.300]   That's tool.
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.300]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.300]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.740]   The bank says don't if I cut this ribbon that's going to set a precedent.
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:40.780]   That's Apple by the way will not be able to argue that in court.
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:44.220]   The only argument that they can pursue in court is that it's an undue burden.
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.420]   Creating this tool is an undue burden on them for X and Y reasons.
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:48.420]   Yeah.
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:49.420]   Absolutely.
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.020]   We can argue about precedent but that's not your main in this in this case.
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.260]   I mean it's not going to be.
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:56.820]   But just the analogy and Zadarski again on his I might be pronouncing his last name wrong.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:01.300]   Zadarski on his blog makes the very clear because again forensic tools expert that they're
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:04.820]   not asking them to cut the ribbon that there's been cases of ribbon cutting before and companies
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:05.980]   have complied.
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.980]   Why Apple is not complying in this case is that they are asking for a ribbon cutter that
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:14.740]   yet that's what I'm really curious about and that's that's the technical question which
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:19.100]   is if Apple does this for this one phone is this in some way usable again.
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.100]   I understand.
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.860]   Everyone's asking about the technology.
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:22.860]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:25.020]   So from a technology point of view everyone Christina Warren I think had a really good
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.420]   article on this but everyone from Zadarski to Will's traffic you know the people who know
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:33.820]   iOS from people who Joe Brooke and people whose topic was right IOS have said repeatedly
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:37.020]   that this sort of thing is a is a ribbon cutter not not cutting the ribbon.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.540]   That's that's a that's important.
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.820]   That's a big deal because we don't want to know ribbon cutter.
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:47.180]   Yeah and another big deal would be if Apple even if they were to be deliberately say okay
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:53.020]   well we managed to we were forced to do this and so we broke we broke this phone for this
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:58.220]   this 5c for this for this one case we are now going to make sure a new feature of 9.3 which
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:02.860]   we're going to withhold for the next six weeks is to create a brand new system that we don't
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:04.780]   know how to break yet.
[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:09.220]   So that if this if there is a future request for a future phone for future OS we can say
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:13.300]   that well that was with the 5c it will not work with the thing with our new version of
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:17.980]   the OS well and Apple has been doing this up until IOS 8 they didn't like it they didn't
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:23.140]   want to do it but that's and that's why they created IOS 8's full disk encryption but they
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:25.580]   have been doing this all along haven't they.
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:28.580]   And they're still doing it with like cloud backups which don't have the same level of
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:30.860]   encryption is on device hardware.
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:36.340]   And at that and Apple as far as we know there's no example and I'm using an opinion piece
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:43.380]   by former LAPD Chief Police Bill William Bratton he says there's no evidence that the
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:48.340]   fact that Apple did this before gave law enforcement any tool to continue to do it.
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:51.280]   Because they did it directly so that was cutting the ribbon Apple complete Apple has
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.100]   cut the ribbon repeatedly although there's there's language they're arguing that they
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:58.700]   haven't unlocked 70 phones that they did something different so there is some vaguely about what
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:02.260]   exactly is being defined there but again that would be cutting the ribbon and their objection
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:07.740]   is to being is to making a ribbon cutter.
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:11.740]   I am still on the fence to be honest with you I think it's pretty apparent I think on
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:16.660]   the one hand I understand the arguments of why this is a bad precedent but I'm not completely
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:23.220]   convinced that this is a ribbon cutter and and I do believe that if Apple could do this
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:28.980]   in a one on one time only case they should absolutely help law enforcement in this one
[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.980]   time only case.
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:37.340]   If it were a question of Apple giving law enforcement a tool that they could use forever
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:41.820]   to get into people's iPhones I mean that would be a very different matter.
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:46.060]   Well that's where the line is blurry because this tool there is no specific way to make
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.620]   this tool one I think it and code the I mean a number into it but then it was just a matter
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:53.060]   of what we have another phone can you do it for this I am a yeah fine way I have 20
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:56.940]   more phones we have 100 more phones and then if they change the security well you've already
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:59.500]   done it for this so now you got to make a version that works with your new security
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:01.340]   protocols.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:05.220]   There is no way to constrain this to one phone at least technologically at least.
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:10.500]   Yeah I mean we are talking about I think that one thing we've been maybe unclear with to
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:14.540]   this point is that we're talking we're basically having conversation about two different topics
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:19.060]   one of which is the specific case and another one is an equally important discussion about
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:22.420]   the principles of privacy in a digital age.
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:27.620]   And one of those difficulties is indeed once it becomes easy for law enforcement to get
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:33.100]   access to a device then you stop the I think the we've seen in previous technologies is
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:37.020]   that it stops being something where gosh you know how much paperwork we're going to
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.980]   have to do to get access to this evidence we got to make sure that if we're making this
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:45.300]   request this is the most important piece of evidence we can collect on this case and that
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:49.500]   this case is so important that we do have to go to these sort of things when it becomes
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:54.660]   as easy as somebody signs off something internally then clicks a button to generate an automated
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:49:00.260]   electronic request that's when you start going from 12 requests a year to 12 requests a day
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:05.380]   and phishing expeditions this is the same sort of idea where you would never have you
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:10.220]   a law enforcement whenever park a police car by the side of a highway and have a guy riding
[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:13.580]   down every single license plate number of every single car that passes by that would
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:17.620]   be way too difficult you but if you can have a box that costs a couple of a couple of
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:21.700]   tens of thousands of dollars that will simply collect all that automatically.
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:23.140]   Okay, that's useful.
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:28.220]   We can we can do that whether it's a question of violation of liberties again that's a question
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:32.620]   for the course of the side but they will do things that are easy if they are easy once
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:37.420]   you make them sort of have to work for personal information that's when they you don't get
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:41.740]   people saying gosh we need some movement on this case or it would be I think that there's
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:46.460]   something about in this avenue we need to take a look at but I don't know what yet that's
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:50.140]   when you start to these middle of the road cases start to go away.
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:54.540]   It's not just privacy security too I mean they the two are often intermingled but they're
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:59.460]   not exactly the same and you can have one or the other or you can have both and once
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:04.580]   it gets to a point where it is a it is a simple firmware replace even if there's a lot of
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:08.900]   safeguards on it that effectively weakens the security of iOS and that again is why apples
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:14.700]   had this leaves it open to hackers to to malware to foreign intelligence companies everything
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:18.580]   I every time I read one of these FBI statements I just replaced FBI with Chinese intelligence
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:22.340]   and I asked myself does that sound like a good idea and if it's not a good idea for
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.900]   Chinese intelligence is probably not a good idea for the FBI because it's it's not just
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:27.980]   America it's the world unfortunately.
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.980]   I don't know.
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:34.380]   That's the case of a sand of a Baton Rouge Louisiana woman Brittany Mills 29 years old was
[00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:36.620]   eight months pregnant when she was murdered.
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:40.100]   People says it cannot comply with a search warrant and open her iPhone even though the
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:46.300]   police believe the identity of the killer is actually contained in her device.
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:49.740]   He says Ms. Mills was an Apple customer so were some of the people who died with iPhones
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:54.220]   in their pockets in the San Bernardino and Paris attacks how is not solving a murder
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:59.300]   or not finding the message that might stop the next terrorist attacked protecting anyone.
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:01.100]   I think that's a that's an interesting question.
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:02.100]   Yeah.
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:09.700]   I'm not sure where Google stands on on all of this.
[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:16.580]   They've send our Pachai tweeted support for Apple as has Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook.
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:20.020]   But I don't know if they've been presented with this situation or not see some of this
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:23.140]   happens all the time in secrecy.
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:26.420]   In fact this would have happened in secrecy had the FBI exceeded the Apple's request to
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.620]   seal the case.
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:35.300]   Yeah and of course Android is a lot more understood than Apple hardware is than Apple's operating
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:36.300]   systems are.
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:41.220]   And then also that points out another difference between these two kinds of cases where there's
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:44.940]   also a question to be asked where let's say that we collectively decide that this is
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:46.300]   a good thing.
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:50.900]   Should Apple be now required that part of their business is unlocking every phone that law
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:55.220]   enforcement ever presents to them that again it's not going to be a short list because
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:52:00.940]   again these aren't people who want to surveil on private citizens just just for fun.
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:02.660]   It literally is because of cases like that.
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:06.260]   They feel as though if this data is on the phone if we can make sure we know who did it
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:09.020]   we actually know who did it we just need to prove it.
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:13.180]   How do we not use this tool if this is presented to us.
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:18.380]   And so I see I can see a world in which there's an entire department of Apple they got they
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:23.220]   got to pull more people off the Apple music project just to satisfy these requests almost.
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:26.740]   And nationally yeah I mean Apple can afford it.
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:33.020]   Well I mean at a certain scale it's like an Apple makes a lot of money making these
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:40.020]   phones this may be a reasonable tax on the money that it's able to make on these phones
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:45.380]   that it should spend a small fraction of that to support law enforcement.
[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:47.220]   I don't think that's unreasonable.
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:51.740]   It's not but again it's one of those things that as soon as you make like for this to
[00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:54.380]   scale it will have to go beyond Apple.
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.660]   We just had another data leak from the Canadian government.
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.940]   It is almost impossible to keep these things secret.
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:02.460]   And once you make a phone that's easy for people to access it's going to be accessed
[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:07.380]   by everybody and that again it becomes not a privacy issue but a security issue and are
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:10.740]   people even going to want fixing this for Apple is fine.
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:15.020]   Other people are going to just use encrypted communication systems that's fine but you're
[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:18.580]   weakening the security of people who do their banking and keep their health information
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:22.980]   and keep all sorts maybe very personal pictures on their phone.
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:27.100]   It's essentially undermining the security of everyone who does everything on those devices.
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:29.760]   And yeah in a perfect world there'd be a way to have something that does only ever be
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.220]   accessed by law enforcement only ever under the pure application of law.
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:40.700]   But as we've seen repeatedly any time security is opened people rush right in and this is
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:44.340]   one of those things where sometimes there's a price to pay for a certain amount of liberty
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:49.020]   and this feels to me like one of those times where if we want to be secure then we have
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:52.940]   to do a different kind of law enforcement or a different kind of analysis or go to other
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:55.060]   sources than what's on a hardware device.
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:59.020]   We're going to table this because I think we had a good conversation and we have to take
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:00.220]   a break.
[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:04.980]   Just a program note Steve Gibson is in the chatroom he has said he is going to talk
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:08.700]   a little bit about this on security now right after the show and he says he believes it
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:13.340]   is not a ribbon cutter it is a one shot deal and he'll tell us why.
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:18.900]   So that's something that's unclear and it might very well change how you feel about
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:19.900]   this case.
[00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:24.380]   If this could be done one time only without giving anybody a tool to do this on any other
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:29.220]   phone again then how would you then what would you say and that's part of the reason
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:36.380]   I don't credit polls because we've discussed this now on Twitter for many many hours and
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:41.100]   I'm still not sure because some of the facts are not known.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:45.580]   And also we also all have to admit that there's immense stuff that even the three of us have
[00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:49.260]   no idea about what works and what doesn't work inside the iPhone.
[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:52.580]   None of us are lawyers and even if we're lawyers we don't work in law enforcement.
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:55.420]   So that's why it's so hard to say anything.
[00:54:55.420 --> 00:55:01.540]   The only thing that I can speak about with absolutely 100% authenticity and confidence
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:04.020]   is how do I feel about broad principles.
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:07.300]   But because when you get down to is this legal or is this right or should they ask
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:12.340]   it's like I don't know I will take I thank you for paying me for saying I don't know
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:13.940]   but I got to say I got to know.
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:18.340]   Well and we came out of this discussion on Twitter with this conclusion which I think
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:25.540]   we can all agree on which is it is a false assumption to say that breaking security in
[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:31.300]   any way makes you more secure that it is for the safety and the NSA feels this by the
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:36.100]   way in fact the former head of the NSA just said this it is in the nation in the national
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:45.460]   interest that encryption end to end encryption be available and secure that protects us as
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:47.820]   much as it hurts us and more than it hurts us.
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:52.660]   And so that's a really important discussion but I think the point the takeaway for a lot
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:56.900]   of us and I hope that American people can kind of get their head around this is that
[00:55:56.900 --> 00:56:05.140]   true security requires strong unbroken unbacked door end to end encryption period full stop.
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.780]   We all agree I think right.
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:07.780]   Yeah.
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:08.780]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:10.380]   So there you go.
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:11.380]   Let's take a break.
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:18.340]   It's a great it's a great thing to talk about deep philosophical case lots of implications
[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:24.700]   and I just I hope that we can trust our courts because if we can't we're in deep trouble
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:28.980]   and of course the courts are always right nobody's always nothing's not the best.
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:37.180]   But we live in a law a land of laws and as you do in Canada and that is one of the true
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:45.020]   lasting strengths of our countries is we are a nation of laws and even if we disagree
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:54.060]   with the 2000 election results let's say we can transition to a new president and we
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:58.460]   will all agree to adhere to what the Supreme Court says period no matter how much we disagree
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:00.340]   with that when K. Bretton.
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:06.700]   Yeah or when when Nixon was impeached many countries were amazed that we could lose a
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:13.020]   national leader and so smoothly transition to his vice president without any ripples
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:16.500]   and that is one of the strengths of this country we are a nation of laws and if anybody's ever
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:22.860]   lived or been to a nation where the laws undermined or corrupt they know how important that is.
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:26.860]   I'll just say we're super lucky in that we're just so there's such a system of checks
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:27.860]   and balances here.
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:32.900]   I like a lot of people to think about okay what if Trump gets elected.
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:33.900]   What if that happens.
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:34.900]   That the guest room ready Andy.
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:35.900]   Exactly.
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:36.900]   I got a tape.
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:41.780]   No but I thought the same thing and I came the same conclusion I think you have which
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:50.220]   is it'll be okay because if there's an idiot in the White House that has no business and
[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:55.580]   no experience being there all the judiciary and the legislative to handle it.
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:58.980]   I'll just say they're not going to step up and say you know we need to do what's good
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:00.700]   for this case the country.
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:01.900]   And then we'll do that though.
[00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.740]   They're going to say hey power vacuum awesome.
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:12.060]   No the founding fathers foresaw an amazingly enough foresaw situation in which one or two
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:16.620]   of the branches of government was corrupt or stupid or inept and it has happened many
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:21.540]   times in this nation and we have survived and there are many many people including many
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:26.180]   of my relatives who think that we've been through the eight years of stupidity and corruption
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:30.580]   and in fact there are many people in the chat room who believe that and we have survived.
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:36.340]   And then we survive because we as a nation agree to follow the law.
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:37.580]   We love our country.
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:38.940]   We don't love the people.
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:41.660]   We like the people who lead our country but we love our country.
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:47.260]   We can make fun of NASCAR events that has like waving flags and flyovers.
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:52.940]   It's like as much as we might like Obama's much as we might have liked Reagan.
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:56.300]   It was not these people that we followed and when they got replaced we still have the
[00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:57.740]   thing we really loved which is America.
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:00.180]   It need to be that's happy but that's the case.
[00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:02.060]   It's not it's not sappy actually.
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:06.260]   It's an important point and it's one of the reasons Apple I know will do what the courts
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:09.620]   end up saying even they'll fight it to the Supreme Court with the Supreme Court rules
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:10.620]   against it.
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:14.460]   Obviously we'll do it because this is nation of laws.
[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:16.140]   We are speaking of laws.
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:18.140]   We're brought to you today by LegalZoom.
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:20.500]   This is a nation of laws not necessarily of lawyers.
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:21.500]   Sometimes.
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:22.500]   What a pro.
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.500]   Well, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:30.580]   Sometimes you don't need a lawyer to get the law on your side.
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:33.980]   In fact, this is a great time to get your life organized with LegalZoom.
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.060]   Do you have a family?
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:38.660]   Do you have assets or property?
[00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:42.820]   If that's the case you better have an estate plan and I know that says oh a state plan.
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:43.820]   I don't have an estate.
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:45.580]   I do.
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:48.900]   And if you die in test state, the court gets to decide what to do.
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:52.300]   It's time to indicate your interests with LegalZoom.
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:54.140]   It's actually very simple.
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:56.500]   LegalZoom is a state plan bundle.
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:57.860]   It eliminates the guesswork.
[00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.500]   They walk you through it step by step.
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:03.460]   You don't have to figure out on your own whether a will or a living trust works best
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:04.460]   for you.
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.820]   In fact, if you want advice, you can even get an independent attorney available in most
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:08.820]   states.
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:13.500]   Now LegalZoom is not a law firm but they do have they have negotiated pre-negroshated
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.780]   rates with attorneys in most states.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:20.060]   So even if you feel like I can ask some questions, they can set that up for you.
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.660]   They'll walk you through their options.
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:25.300]   The recommended estate plan that offers the best solution to fit your needs.
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:29.500]   And because they're not a law firm, you know how much it's going to cost right up front.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:34.300]   You can count on efficiency and value everything on your terms, on your schedule.
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:35.540]   You'll know what it's going to cost.
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.780]   You're not paying an hourly rate.
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:42.340]   That's how LegalZoom has become the leader in helping small business owners like me,
[01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:50.100]   set up our LLCs, our S-corps, our corporations, our trademarks and patents, and families set
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:53.300]   up their wills and living trusts.
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:54.700]   You get legal help.
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:55.700]   You get what you need.
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:56.700]   You walk away feeling great.
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:01:00.540]   And you know you want to do this and you probably put off by the potential cost and
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:01.540]   complexity.
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:02.780]   It's not expensive.
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:03.780]   It's not complex.
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:04.780]   It's legal.

[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:25.460]   Take a deep breath, everybody.
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:29.780]   Shall I survive this?
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:30.780]   Yeah.
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:31.780]   Let's see.
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:32.780]   What do you want to talk about?
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:37.420]   Do you want to talk about the Channel 5 in San Francisco report that there were loud clangings
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:40.860]   in bangings coming in the middle of the night?
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:46.020]   So my understanding is that Apple has had offices in Sunnyvale for a long time and that
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.460]   the lawyers have been based there for a long time.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.180]   So my guess is midnight barbecue.
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:52.100]   That's just not my head.
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.580]   My friend, I actually caught this.
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.940]   I was watching the local news, which I really do.
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:01.820]   And I watched because my friend Mike Sugarman, good friend, I've known him for years, was
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:02.820]   the reporter.
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:03.820]   Listen.
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:08.820]   I don't know either.
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:11.940]   We don't know what's going on inside these buildings in Sunnyvale.
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:15.700]   But what we found out today is the city doesn't either.
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:19.820]   Speculation is that Apple is building its driverless car and testing it in here.
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:20.820]   That's wild.
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.420]   They don't want anybody to know what's going on.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:25.540]   They've got fences like this one all over the place.
[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:27.980]   Now building the driverless car, that's no big deal.
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:28.980]   That's legal.
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:31.340]   It's nothing against Sunnyvale codes.
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:35.420]   But what would be a problem is the noise that's keeping neighbors up all night.
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:40.180]   And we find out the city didn't know about that either.
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:43.820]   Last night we told you about weird noises and secret doings in the Sunnyvale building.
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:44.820]   The secret doings.
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:47.860]   Three in the morning they have deliveries.
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:48.860]   It's very dark over there.
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:50.100]   So they're very secretive.
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.460]   We don't know what's going on.
[01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:53.460]   But almost every night there's noise.
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:54.460]   There's a dog barking.
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:56.260]   Maybe Apple is annoyed by your dog.
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:03:01.300]   So years ago gave a clue saying that Apple had been granted a permit for an auto-vacuum
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.300]   testing.
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.300]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.300]   That happened years ago.
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:06.900]   Nobody picked up on this car from the computer giant.
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.740]   Might be being built there.
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:11.700]   What's going on in that factory that everybody's talking to us?
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.540]   You'd have to ask Apple that.
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:17.740]   Sunnyvale said if you saw a lot of that mentioned in the blog, the city admits it has no idea
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:19.940]   what in fact is going on here.
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:20.940]   Security cameras.
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:22.940]   Look at his pounding on the door.
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:23.940]   Whoa.
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:26.180]   Apple got a phone call on the door.
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:32.020]   He's on the door at one of the several buildings on this blog on St. Gabriel Road where the noise
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.020]   was coming from.
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:34.700]   Nobody's hearing the cats up at night.
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:37.340]   You're like sheets of metal slamming.
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:39.020]   You'll hear like clanking.
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:41.820]   You'll hear almost a grinding sound.
[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:44.820]   You're deploying the night rider.
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:47.900]   This was always such a nice quiet neighborhood.
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:48.900]   That's the thing.
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:49.900]   It's interesting.
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:50.900]   It's not an industrial area really.
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:52.140]   It's an 8-bit.
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:55.060]   It didn't know that either until our story last night.
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:04:01.420]   We saw your coverage about that story and looked into city complaints and we actually
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:02.940]   couldn't find anything.
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:07.460]   She's asking neighbors to let the city know so they can send inspectors and police officers
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.100]   out even in the middle of the night.
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:15.700]   But as for if Apple is building its long rumored but never confirmed driverless car,
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:19.500]   the city of Sunnyvale is in the dark as well as everybody else.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:20.500]   That's funny.
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.500]   Thank you, Mike.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.300]   Chinese inspectors trying to get in there.
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.700]   What do you think they're doing?
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:28.580]   It could just be some body work.
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.700]   Maybe they're getting in filled doing karaoke.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:36.460]   But they get those pictures for dub dub.
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:40.660]   I just suddenly got this wonderful idea that we should just basically hire some sort of
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:47.020]   a shop in LA to build the stupidest, most ridiculous looking car imaginable and then
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:51.140]   like late at night, like we just basically crash it outside there and then try to prevent
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:54.660]   everybody from taking pictures of the crash.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.340]   And just say, no, that doesn't bond anybody's shop.
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:58.340]   You didn't see this.
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:01.980]   It'll be all over the entire world that we've got pictures of the first Apple car.
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:06.060]   Tim, Tim Cook gave a fortune interview.
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:08.820]   Among many of the things they talked about, Apple car was one of them.
[01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:11.660]   He says, Apple's only exploring cars.
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:14.100]   They're not yet committed.
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.340]   We don't have to spend large amounts to explore.
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:19.500]   So I can't talk about this certain area you're talking about.
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:22.500]   But when we start spending large amounts of money, we're committed at that point.
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:26.420]   But we explore things with teams of people and that's part of being curious.
[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:30.820]   Once we start spending gobs of money, like when we start spending on tooling and things
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:34.540]   like that, well, then we're committed.
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.260]   How many ounces are in a gob?
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:40.100]   By the way, it's Adam Laskinski in the interview.
[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:43.380]   If you're going to pick one guy, a guy to interview Tim Cook, that's a good guy.
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:45.780]   Adam really knows his stuff.
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:52.260]   So he was at Apple headquarters a couple of days before Valentine's Day.
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:54.580]   He also asked him about this.
[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:58.500]   By the way, Tim says, I'm good at blocking out the noise, but I don't think he's talking
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:02.020]   about the noise coming from Sunfield.
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:05.020]   He's talking about the critics.
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:09.460]   Tim actually says, I don't listen to critics.
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:10.820]   I were doing the right things.
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.340]   Are we remembering our North Star?
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:15.420]   Are we focusing on making the best products that really help people enrich their lives
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:16.420]   in some way?
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:21.540]   By the way, we talked a lot about whether Tim was a good replacement for Steve Jobs and
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:25.780]   whether he was worthy and whether Steve would be happy without Tim's running the company.
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:32.980]   Can I just point out now that Tim Cook with his letter, open letter to the people of the
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:38.980]   United States by this Department of Justice thing, with his principled stands in many ways,
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:46.860]   he has shown himself to be a great leader at Apple and a man of moral vision.
[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:49.780]   I'm very impressed by Tim Cook.
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:50.780]   You're great.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:52.900]   Because he's incredibly sincere when he speaks about this.
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.980]   Even more so than Jobs was.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:07:01.580]   Jobs, well, I don't want to say anything about Steve, but I feel like Tim is looking at the
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:02.820]   North Star.
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:06.020]   He has a very strong moral compass.
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:08.180]   And I'm very impressed by the guy.
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:10.420]   I think Apple's in very good hands.
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:14.580]   And man, he has rapidly risen to be a premier CEO.
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:21.500]   Yeah, I mean, I can't say that I knew Jobs well, or at all.
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:25.140]   I can't say that I've met Tim more than once and it was inconsequential.
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:31.500]   But I can't say that it, he definitely has proven himself to be the right sort of successor
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:32.820]   to Steve Jobs.
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:37.660]   If they had someone who was very, very good at putting, keeping their nose on the on the
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:44.780]   status book and talking a lot with stiff motions when they are presented with a camera, I don't
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:46.540]   think that people would have enjoyed that transition.
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.020]   It wouldn't have been appropriate for Apple.
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:51.700]   But you have someone that you feel, I think that that it seems as though one of the most
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:56.380]   important things that Apple needed for the transition is to still have Apple led by someone
[01:07:56.380 --> 01:08:00.340]   where you feel as though this is how somebody thinks this person has a perspective and a
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:01.700]   point of view.
[01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:05.740]   And that point of view is Apple's, but it will be expressed through all of their products.
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:10.420]   But you know that this is not the sort of person who would make a triangular phone just because
[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:13.220]   he thought triangles were cool that week.
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.220]   Yeah.
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:15.220]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:18.660]   And it is definitely his Apple at this point.
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:21.300]   And all to the good, by the way.
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:23.980]   There's a great, I just put it in the Google Doc, but there's a great video from Steve
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:28.140]   Jobs from All Things Digital from 2010 where he sort of sort of stakes the ground for Apple
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:30.740]   and privacy and why it's going to be increasingly important.
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:35.340]   And it sort of shows that this is a value that's been core to the company, if not forever,
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:36.900]   than certainly for a long time.
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:37.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:43.660]   I have to say though, you've got to think that Tim Cook, because he's gay in a world in
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:47.940]   which it's still illegal in many areas to be gay, it's certainly discriminated against
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:53.340]   and probably led much of his life in fear of that probably is more in touch with the
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:57.140]   importance of privacy than maybe Steve Jobs would have been.
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:59.620]   Although Steve didn't want to have his license plate seen.
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.060]   It's that paving that brick.
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:04.260]   You know, like he asked very clearly when he did that letter where he came out, the op-ed
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:09.420]   piece that he wants to put down his bricks on that road the way that Kennedy did.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:11.700]   And this is him sort of living up to that.
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:12.700]   It's amazing.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:15.820]   I wouldn't speculate, but yeah, I mean, it's speculation.
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:16.820]   I'll grant you that.
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:20.660]   What is a huge risk for any like there are a lot of ways to put your head down.
[01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:23.140]   And a lot of tech companies are doing that right now, put their heads down and try not
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:25.420]   to get any attention or collateral damage from that.
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:29.060]   And he's putting Apple, regardless of what you believe and who you think is right or
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:33.460]   wrong, he has put Apple right in the front lines of this.
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:34.460]   Go ahead.
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:37.340]   Did you want to say something to Andy?
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.340]   No.
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:39.340]   Okay.
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:40.340]   I like that look.
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:41.340]   I'll leave that.
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:46.100]   I have a thought, but it's I don't know if I can express it accurately.
[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:50.820]   So it's okay for me not to say anything.
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:55.580]   He did Adam did ask Tim whether we've reached peak iPhone.
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:58.140]   That's been kind of like the phrase.
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:03.420]   It's been bandied about of late that maybe the iPhone is, you know, and Apple themselves.
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:04.420]   Gave the guy.
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:05.420]   Can't I said?
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.460]   Can't I said peak phone, a peak smartphone today?
[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:09.140]   So I mean, it's a general question.
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:12.340]   I think it's true really that we have reached peak phone.
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:14.660]   He says no.
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:19.580]   Tim says there's a lot more gas in that tank.
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:26.420]   Let me see if I can find that quote for any vendor they can jockey for share, but it'll
[01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:29.020]   get like there's eventually a point where everybody will have a phone.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:32.420]   Maybe everyone will have two phones and unless Mars opens up as a market, it'll be about
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:35.420]   getting the biggest share of that existing pie.
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:39.260]   Not only that, but Apple's in such a great position where when you're talking about high
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:41.860]   margin luxury phones, that's pretty.
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:47.020]   Obviously Samsung has Samsung has a lot of interest in the S6 and the S7, but that's the
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:48.020]   phone.
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:52.340]   If you're going to make 40%, 30% margin on a phone, that's the one that everybody wants.
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:56.980]   So it doesn't, their market share, I wouldn't say that it doesn't make it doesn't matter,
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:59.860]   but it's almost like you really want to see how much how much money is being spent on
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:03.300]   phones and how much money, how much of that is Apple capturing.
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.300]   Right.
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:07.540]   And you don't often get bundles on a day of launch the way you see with some other luxury
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:10.580]   phones where yeah, we are, there are 700 bucks, but we'll give you this headset and
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:14.660]   this watch and this discount and this other phone.
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:16.140]   But they're keeping a lot of that money.
[01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:17.140]   Yeah.
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:19.900]   That's interesting because it does go to show you that if there, that there are people
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:24.980]   who can be, who are not, you know, I just, I can't get over the precision of that chamfer
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.340]   angle on the new iPhone.
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:30.660]   It's like, I want to have this quality.
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:34.660]   I don't care that you, you engineers spent two and a half years on the index of refraction
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:38.100]   on the specific kind of glass that was made exactly for your phone.
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:39.860]   This other guy is going to give me free headphones.
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:41.380]   So I'm taking the free headphone.
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:42.540]   All the ports are aligned.
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:46.420]   It's just, it's the harmony in my life.
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:51.540]   He also said the new headquarters, they, he hopes to start moving in about a year.
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:52.540]   I know how he feels.
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:55.460]   I am kind of in the same boat.
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:57.500]   He says, think of it as early 2017.
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:58.500]   There's lots of excitement about it.
[01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:01.020]   It gets a lot of people back together again, which I think is really important.
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:04.180]   In other words, many employees who are now spread throughout many buildings will be back
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:05.380]   in one building.
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:07.940]   Um, it'd be nice to get everybody back.
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:10.740]   He says, here's a great question, Adam.
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.380]   Have you made a decision on the naming of the campus?
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:15.980]   Have you settled in the way that you'll pay homage to Steve Jobs?
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:17.940]   We're talking about it, says Tim.
[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:20.380]   We will definitely honor him in the right kind of way.
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:22.380]   We're working with Lorraine and the family.
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:23.380]   Yeah.
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:24.380]   Nice.
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.620]   I have a name like Apple Campus is just Apple Campus.
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:27.980]   There's no real name for it.
[01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:31.020]   So people just kept calling this campus too, but it is an interesting question.
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.940]   You call it the Steve Jobs campus?
[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:34.300]   I think you do, right?
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:36.300]   I don't know.
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:37.740]   Or does Apple just call it campus too?
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:38.740]   I mean, it's interesting.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:39.740]   Yeah.
[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:43.700]   I mean, they made infinite loop famous, even though it was just a little pun that at the
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:45.740]   time, eight people are going to understand.
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:49.420]   But what actually made me start to think, now that this thing is taking greater shape
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:54.060]   is Apple seems like the exactly the sort of company that would buy or commission some
[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:56.660]   wonderful art to go inside there.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:59.780]   And I'm sort of wondering, are they going to commission some?
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:03.540]   They are going to have, remember, their own sort of like private park in there.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:04.820]   That's beautifully landscaped.
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:08.180]   That's really beautifully cultivated.
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:12.540]   You walk through Boston's public garden and you see it was built at a time where public
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:16.340]   art and public statuary was just exploding.
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:19.060]   And you wonder if Apple is thinking, there are going to be people who are going to be
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:25.820]   walking through this pathway and through this green space for the next 20, 30, 40, 50 years.
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:28.300]   What do we want them to see in 40 years time?
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:32.380]   And then commissioning a piece of art to stand there and be everywhere.
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:34.660]   You think about them, are they going to have murals?
[01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:35.820]   Are they going to have murals in there?
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:39.980]   Are they actually just going to go into a collecting phase?
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:41.340]   Art holds its value pretty well.
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:44.180]   So they could just simply say, we really love this artist.
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:51.140]   And so we are basically putting some, using our Irish checkbook, we decided to buy these
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:55.820]   three works and basically have this, this, where everybody, all of our workers, when
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:59.980]   they're going to personnel and back through this one main at main atrium are going to
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:02.900]   get to see one of these beautiful works of art.
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:05.380]   Apple pencil may not be used for navigation.
[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:10.660]   iOS 9.3 and fourth betas came out for that for TV, OS watch, OS and OS 10.
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:11.660]   They've been, it's been nice.
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:12.660]   They've been all in sync.
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:15.660]   There's a few iterations.
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:20.980]   But some people are a little upset because in fact I've seen that there's been Twitter.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:28.100]   I think there's a hashtag because you can't use the Apple pencil for navigation according
[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:29.900]   to Mac rumors.
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.980]   It appears to be intentional.
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:32.980]   You agree Renee?
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:33.980]   It's so interesting.
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:37.820]   As Fennerti did a really long piece on this yesterday, which he sort of delved into
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:38.820]   the issue.
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:42.780]   What's happened is the pencil layer is actually a completely separate layer from multi-touch
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:45.500]   and multi-touch is what we traditionally used to navigate.
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:48.780]   Apple believed that expected behavior was, I do the same thing with the pencil, I get
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:49.780]   the same result.
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:54.740]   They went through and duplicated all the navigational behavior using the pencil input mechanism.
[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.660]   Those things don't have to be linked, but the early thinking was that we're just going
[01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:58.660]   to assume they are.
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:01.340]   Let's give us the behavior that we assume.
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:05.420]   It seems to be that people are saying, "Well, if you do link these and you get a whole bunch
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:08.780]   of other behaviors, for example, you can draw with one hand while you're moving to
[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:11.020]   doing things around with the other hand."
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:15.220]   It behaves more like a traditional pencil where what you're doing with the pencil doesn't
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:16.220]   really affect the paper.
[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:20.100]   Those are two discrete objects that you can manipulate independently.
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:23.940]   There's a few people on Twitter who seem to like this idea, but most people are very
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:27.740]   much against it because it's very hard to take a feature away from somebody.
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:30.100]   You almost never want to do that.
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.860]   You've let people navigate with this.
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:35.860]   Some people like CGP Grey, who has RSI, or other people who've just been used to doing
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:39.380]   it this way now for six months, suddenly they can't do it anymore.
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:40.820]   That's not a good situation.
[01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:42.980]   It's not a good user experience.
[01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:46.980]   Obviously, someone inside Apple seems to think this is a really important step, and maybe
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:49.420]   there is some future feature that depends on it.
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:53.060]   Apple's really not good about communicating that kind of stuff.
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:55.980]   John Gruber had an interesting suggestion, which is to make it a toggle, which everyone
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:58.580]   is loath to do when you add more settings.
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:02.100]   It feels like one of those things where that's really the best answer because for some people,
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:04.580]   the best experience is always going to be, "I want to play a game.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:07.540]   I can't reach this edge of the screen.
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:10.500]   I just want to be able to," and to be clear, we're not talking about buttons.
[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:14.300]   We're talking about things like scrolling, swiping, and doing multi-touch gestures with
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:15.300]   the pencil.
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:17.820]   I want to be able to do those things with this implement.
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:21.020]   You'll have a few other people who say, "Really, I want to be able," when I learn to draw you
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:23.900]   a race with one hand, you draw with the other, and that's a really natural thing, and people
[01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:25.380]   are going to want to do that.
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:29.620]   It seems like if this is a deliberate choice, that it would be better like with the multi-touch
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:34.220]   swipe gestures they introduced back in iOS 5 or iOS 4, that they make this something that
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:35.220]   we get to choose ourselves.
[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:36.220]   Yeah.
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:42.020]   I just don't like it when companies make a dogmatic decision simply saying that, "Well,
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:46.420]   the reason why we're not going to put this in the iPad Pro is because we can't also make
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:48.700]   it available for the iPad Mini."
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:53.420]   Unless our dogma says that we have to have a consistent experience throughout all platforms
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:54.420]   saying, "No, you don't.
[01:16:54.420 --> 01:17:01.780]   You have to make the best experience you can for various implementations of the word "best"
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:02.780]   experience.
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:07.700]   If you notice that people are using the pencil in a certain way, and it's not an undue burden
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:11.500]   upon you to put in that option, you should put in that option.
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:15.740]   That's the one thing that always makes me not splints like, "Unless you're going to
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:19.740]   tell me that there's a real reason why you decided to delete this feature, I just don't
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:24.540]   want to know that you deleted it because you have a rule of only six buttons, never more
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.740]   than six buttons."
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:29.100]   That would have been button number seven.
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:32.340]   Yeah, people who care about this really care about it.
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:33.340]   Yeah, I care about it.
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:37.220]   I think I'm able to use it for, I think it's a mistake, but we'll see.
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:40.500]   On the broader issue, there's so much work for them to do in enhancing the experience
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:41.500]   of the iPad Pro.
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:42.500]   I love mine.
[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.860]   I'm never outside of the house without it.
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:47.460]   I'm going to be going to Yosemite for an entire week.
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:50.740]   I'm going to be shooting hundreds of photos a day, and I'm still convinced that I'm not
[01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:52.860]   going to need to bring my MacBook with me.
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:58.940]   But nonetheless, it is at times painfully clear that, "You need to let me navigate through
[01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:04.620]   these when you present me with the list and I can actually highlight things with the arrow
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:05.620]   keys.
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:10.620]   You need to let me tap the enter button instead of having to physically tap on that with my
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:11.620]   finger."
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:12.620]   That should be fixed.
[01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:13.620]   That's just stupid.
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:18.500]   I mean, that's a bad amount of time thing was that one.
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:19.500]   Yeah, I know.
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:26.020]   It seems like a sort of thing where as a developer, it would annoy me to know and that I would
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:28.740]   have this device in front of me.
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:32.940]   It's like when you're walking, you're in a restaurant and you see one picture on the
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:34.540]   wall of all those photographs.
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:35.700]   It's a little bit out there.
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:40.420]   It's like, I've excused myself to go to the bathroom and run over there and fix it because
[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:42.740]   it just kills me that that is not right.
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:43.740]   There we go.
[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:45.780]   But that's what I'm talking about.
[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:50.060]   I hope that they are internally acknowledging that the iPad Pro is a brand new thing.
[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:51.420]   It's a separate thing.
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:52.660]   It's not even an iPad.
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:55.420]   It's not even a MacBook, but it is its own unique beast.
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:58.860]   And as such, it's only unique opportunities for greatness.
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:04.940]   Actually, I should credit Mike Hurley and his overcast podcast on Relay FM.
[01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:09.940]   He was the one who said, " Sources in the know confirm that removing the functionality
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:12.340]   of the Apple Pencil is a decision inside of Apple.
[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:13.340]   It's not a bug.
[01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:15.060]   They have overlooked for three betas.
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:16.060]   It's intentional.
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:17.060]   It's a decision."
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:19.060]   Same way putting it there.
[01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:20.260]   But something's in three betas.
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:23.660]   That's kind of like a signal.
[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:25.260]   Have you been playing with new betas?
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:27.620]   Have you seen anything else you want to report?
[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:28.620]   Renee?
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:30.700]   Well, the stuff is still on the Apple TV.
[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:33.940]   It's the stuff I'm excited about the most, which is the Siri dictation.
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:37.700]   Just being able to do that is so much easier than using that keyboard.
[01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:39.980]   Can I dictate a password?
[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:46.060]   Yeah, depending on the ability of Siri to parse what you're saying, lowercase A, tell
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:47.060]   D.
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:49.940]   It depends on the complications of your password.
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:50.940]   But yeah, theoretically.
[01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:54.860]   There's some nice stuff like live photos that you pull out a specific frame now.
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:58.460]   Sorry, let's you choose whether you want to save it as a moving picture or just pull
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.380]   out the static image.
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:01.780]   There's a bunch of really cool stuff in there.
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:03.500]   Andy, you say you like the pro.
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.140]   Did you see the Huawei Mate?
[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:06.140]   Yeah.
[01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:07.140]   And that's it.
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:08.860]   Mobile World Congress yesterday.
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:12.580]   Yeah, this is an iPad size Windows 10 device.
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:14.260]   It's all based on the Atom processor.
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:18.500]   So it doesn't have the speed of an i5 or an i3 or an i7.
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:22.300]   But it is roughly the same price as an iPad Pro.
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:23.660]   It runs full desktop software.
[01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:26.820]   It has a really nice mated keyboard with it.
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:32.740]   And it really, my eye would have been wondering if this had been available at the exact same
[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:33.980]   time as the iPad Pro.
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:37.660]   I'm still, I'm still convinced that the iPad Pro was absolutely the right choice for me.
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:43.140]   But if I were not already invested in the iPad, I'd be like, yay, Windows 10.
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:45.260]   The only negative is it's Windows.
[01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:47.420]   What's the thing that reminded me?
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:49.940]   We didn't talk about this because it happened after last week too, but they put out that
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:52.580]   profile of Johnny Suruji.
[01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:56.260]   And they were sort of talking about the creation of the iPad and how it really was supposed
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:57.900]   to be out earlier and using a8.
[01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:01.140]   But then the things like the pencil and stuff weren't finished yet and they decided to put
[01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:06.780]   it on a9x and Apple had a sort of sprint to get the a9x out six months before they had
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:10.740]   originally planned to sort of everything that went into the decisions to make that process
[01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:13.700]   or end that tablet and the set of conditions and get it out on time.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:15.660]   I thought it was just beyond fascinating.
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:21.300]   The real threat that the Huawei MateBook presents is not to Apple, of course, but to
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:28.500]   Microsoft and their Surface Pro because it's very much like a Surface Pro, but very thin.
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:32.020]   It's kind of like iPad form factor for a Windows PC.
[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:34.460]   I mean, it's not a tablet, it's a PC.
[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:35.460]   I'm not so sure.
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:40.140]   I mean, the Surface isn't a proof of concept.
[01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:44.340]   It's not a Nexus device where they're trying to encourage other hardware developers to
[01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.340]   go along these lines.
[01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:48.820]   It is a for real product, but nonetheless, the whole point of everything that Microsoft
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:55.380]   does is to keep Windows relevant and to keep Windows looking essential and that they are,
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:59.860]   believe me, they are very aware that they've totally lost the game when it comes to phones.
[01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:04.180]   But they, and a lot of their thinking right now is to make sure that we don't get into
[01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:08.660]   a world in which everybody wants, if someone is spending less than $800 on the computer,
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:12.100]   they're definitely going to be buying an iPad or an Android tablet.
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:13.940]   Why would you buy a Windows tablet?
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:18.780]   So that's one of the reasons why Windows 10 has become taken in the direction it has.
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:22.820]   And that's why they're really eager to work with Intel to make sure that their desktop
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:28.460]   operating system will work well on a mobility enhanced processor like the Core Series.
[01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:31.540]   It's super interesting too that for a long time we talked about how it wouldn't be great
[01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:35.220]   if Intel would just start fabbing Apple processors because you'd get sort of the best of both
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:36.220]   worlds.
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:40.060]   And now we're seeing a time where Huawei can put this on had, where Apple can do the A9
[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:41.340]   or Samsung can fab something.
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:42.980]   And they're almost all great.
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:44.900]   The fabs almost have all identical processes.
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:46.180]   They're all doing great work.
[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:50.180]   And we have actual legitimate choice across all the Qualcomm is doing interesting stuff
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:52.060]   and videos getting into this.
[01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:55.980]   It's way more diverse ecosystem than we ever had on the wind tell days.
[01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:57.980]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:01.420]   And if you could be in that position where if you wanted to still use your iMac and still
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:06.060]   be a Mac person, but just be a little bit invested in Windows because you need something
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:10.980]   that for heaven's sake still you can still be able to access a file system on a tablet
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:14.980]   that's still kind of a pain point with using my iPad Pro for stuff.
[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:20.580]   It's not insane for you to have a Windows tablet and have a Mac notebook and a Mac desktop.
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:26.620]   And that's why I just what a brilliant time it is to be to be a consumer these days because
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:30.340]   you can find so many different devices that will work with pretty much whatever your workflow
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:31.340]   is going to be.
[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:35.700]   And of course, while always benefiting a lot from Apple and the iPad Pro, I mean there's
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:40.500]   a lot of iPad in this fact, the keyboard, the way the keyboard works very much like
[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:43.020]   the arguably the camera is in a better position.
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:44.020]   Yeah.
[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.020]   Yeah.
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:46.020]   Yeah.
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:47.020]   I'd say that.
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:49.900]   Let's say that let's say they stole that from from Samsung.
[01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:52.300]   Where's the camera on the you mean the back camera on the side?
[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:54.300]   Oh, the front camera on the iPad is just portrait.
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:55.300]   Yeah.
[01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:56.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:57.300]   Yeah.
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:58.300]   Yeah.
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:23:59.300]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:00.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:01.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:02.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:04.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:05.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:06.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:07.300]   The original iPad keyboard was portrait too.
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:08.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:09.300]   Stick the whole thing.
[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:10.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:12.300]   And I think it's a very good thing.
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:13.300]   I think it's a very good thing.
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:14.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.300]   I think it's a very good thing.
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:16.300]   It's a very good thing.
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.300]   It's a very good thing.
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:18.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:19.300]   It's a very good thing.
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:20.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:21.300]   I think it's a very good thing.
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:22.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:23.300]   It's a very good thing.
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:24.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:25.300]   I think it's a very good thing.
[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:26.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:27.300]   But I think it's a very good thing.
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:28.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:29.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:30.300]   I think it's a very good thing.
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:31.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:32.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:33.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:34.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:35.300]   I think it's a very good thing.
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:36.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:37.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:38.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:40.300]   You can be spending a thousand bucks pretty easy out of the game.
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:43.020]   It seems like the sweet spot for this kind of device though and everything is falling
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:44.340]   in similar lines with that.
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:49.140]   They're doing the same thing as Apple's doing with the rechargeable battery in the pen too,
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:50.140]   which is kind of interesting.
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:53.060]   Although they don't have a stick out.
[01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:54.060]   It's so funny.
[01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:57.340]   I mean, Apple gets so much flack for that design decision but when you talk to anybody
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:01.700]   about it, it's like you're sitting at the coffee shop and your pen runs out and you don't
[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:02.700]   have a cable.
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:05.300]   You just plug it in and 15 seconds later, you're back at work.
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.300]   Yeah.
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:07.300]   The decision there is super clear.
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:10.820]   Like it may look odd but like when you're in the coffee shop, I've done that a bunch
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:12.940]   of times and I'm super happy that it's that way.
[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:13.940]   Yeah.
[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:14.940]   This one has a laser pointer too.
[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:18.860]   Oh yeah, the pen has a laser pointer built into it and you can use it to advance your
[01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:20.420]   PowerPoint slides.
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:25.780]   I'm often here to play doubles advocate as well because I'm just as enthusiastic about
[01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:29.740]   stuff as Renee is and when Renee speaks for us, he'll say the stuff that I like about
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:35.580]   something which only leaves me to just point out that yeah, but you know, on my styluses
[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:39.100]   for other devices, the battery lasts more than a couple of weeks.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.100]   So I don't have to do that.
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:41.100]   It's true.
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:42.500]   The pencil does not last very long.
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:43.500]   Yeah.
[01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:50.380]   And also I really, I have to like almost, you know how like the key on a gas station bathroom
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:54.740]   has to be attached to like a tire rim to make sure that no one walks off of it.
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:59.180]   I've kind of got the same thing going on with the rechargeable recharger coupler for my
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:04.340]   pencil because I know that if I'm, if I want to get like that full deep fast charge on it,
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:05.900]   you need to put that in the end.
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:09.300]   And it's just so it's like a ticktack and I will, it's the easiest thing in the world
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:10.300]   for me to lose.
[01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:12.220]   I just haven't dedicated cable for that now.
[01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:13.220]   It doesn't leave that one cable.
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:15.740]   And I hope I don't buy another pencil.
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:16.740]   Yeah.
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:18.340]   I have day and night pencils, Andy.
[01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:21.540]   Get one for the for the boat for the RV for the car.
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:23.940]   If Alex was here, you'd say you could shrink wrap it onto there.
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:27.540]   I cut actually, we had a case on iOS today yesterday.
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:28.540]   Yeah.
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:29.940]   Megan has a leather case that has a loop on it.
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:31.440]   It's really quite nice.
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.340]   Who makes who makes that case, Megan?
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:35.340]   She's not there.
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:37.340]   Talking to nobody.
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:39.660]   Error 53 is fixed.
[01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:41.260]   Apple said, yeah, we blew it.
[01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:42.260]   It was a mistake.
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:44.540]   We didn't want it to be a brick your phone.
[01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:45.540]   That's kind of a.
[01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:48.460]   That's kind of my, my guess as well.
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:49.980]   That does not seem like a bluish.
[01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:54.140]   In fact, the good news is if you had a brick phone, you just connected up to iTunes and
[01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:58.340]   the new 9.2.1 patch will revive it.
[01:26:58.340 --> 01:26:59.340]   Yeah.
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:00.340]   That's the important thing.
[01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:01.900]   It's not presented to you and it's not flagged as new.
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:03.700]   You have to specifically go and get it.
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:06.100]   You will lose fingerprint functionality until you.
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:08.820]   Well, you won't lose it, but you won't get it back.
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:09.820]   Okay.
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:11.380]   You never had it.
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:12.380]   It's true.
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:14.260]   There's very little fingerprint functionality on a brick.
[01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:15.260]   Yeah.
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:16.260]   Absolutely.
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:19.580]   So yeah, it turns out that this was an error meant for a factory so that if the components
[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:22.940]   didn't properly pair, they would get this error and they would fix it.
[01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:26.060]   And it wasn't meant to be shown to consumers, but stuff happens.
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:27.060]   Right.
[01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:28.980]   That makes a lot of sense.
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:34.860]   We are now only three weeks away from another Apple event at which we expect an iPad Air
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:36.260]   3 and iPhone.
[01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:38.740]   What are they going to call it?
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:39.740]   The 5S-E.
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:40.740]   5S-E.
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:41.740]   Anything more that we know about that?
[01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:42.740]   Are we any more gamers?
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:43.740]   Watch bands too.
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:44.740]   Yeah.
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:45.740]   Some more watch bands.
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:48.460]   But will they have an octagonal watch?
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:49.460]   I don't know.
[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:51.300]   I'm shaking my magic.
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:53.060]   8-Ball science point to know.
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:56.420]   I'm kind of actually liking this.
[01:27:56.420 --> 01:28:01.060]   It does notifications, which is kind of like a pebble in that respect.
[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:03.020]   I can play my audio book.
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:05.500]   They have a lot of really smart people that fit it.
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:08.980]   They make a great product and they've got a good presence in the market.
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:10.860]   And you're talking about point of view here.
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:14.460]   This is a watch that's built specifically to be a fitness device and all the apps and
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:15.460]   all the notifications.
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:19.380]   Those are nice, but the engineers are focusing on making it a great fitness device.
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:21.460]   And I can choose the exercise I'm going to do.
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:25.460]   There's no Apple Watch equivalent of the iPod shuffle or the iPod Nano and Fitbit makes
[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:29.780]   a variety of devices at a variety of price points for you to get into the market with.
[01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:30.780]   Right.
[01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:36.660]   Quick view on brightness auto, heart rate auto.
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:37.660]   Let's see.
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:41.980]   ABC TV, Apple TV 4 ads Disney channel, Disney XD.
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:44.060]   Watch ABC, the universal search.
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:47.500]   And of course you mentioned Siri.
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.500]   Yep.
[01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:51.100]   Police rescue a teenage girl.
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:55.380]   Mother locates not only the phone, but the girl using Find My iPhone.
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:57.740]   It's still very ending.
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:58.740]   And then dual cameras.
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:03.460]   We talked a little bit about the fact that the rumor is that the new iPhone 7 in the
[01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:06.740]   fall will have two camera sensors on the back.
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:10.580]   LG announced the G5 at Mobile World Congress.
[01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:13.580]   That has two sensors, but I don't think you're going to do the same thing.
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:16.140]   I don't think Apple's going to do the same thing LG's doing.
[01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:20.980]   One of the sensors is a normal sensor and then the other sensor is an ultra wide angle,
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:21.980]   135 millimeter.
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:23.540]   And it looks great though.
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:24.540]   It's a neat idea.
[01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:25.540]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:26.540]   Yeah.
[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:31.700]   I had a Kodak made a camera just like that where it was there was a zoom and then if
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:35.260]   you went past a certain point of the zoom would switch to a totally separate lens and
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:41.380]   sensor and you do not know how much you appreciate having just a little bit extra wide view
[01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:43.980]   until you realize that I don't have to step back.
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:45.820]   I don't have to lean back over this railing.
[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:49.100]   I could just simply take a picture and get everybody in the shop.
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:52.420]   And our business for interviews, you want two people in an interview and how much difference
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:56.540]   that's why you could if it's if you need to get closer, you can always zoom.
[01:29:56.540 --> 01:30:00.580]   You can always crop the photo closer, but you can't put the left half of that face back
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:02.100]   into the frame.
[01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:06.180]   If you love the album, I like it when you sleep for you are so beautiful yet so unaware
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:09.500]   of it.
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:10.500]   Long title.
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.340]   Apparently do you?
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:14.420]   I do.
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:17.340]   That's from the 1975, which is a very well named band.
[01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:22.400]   I don't know their music, but they're going to be performing on Beats one live at the
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.180]   perfect time for a concert.
[01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:26.620]   9am Pacific.
[01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:32.460]   So I'll be obviously and I'm so unaware of it during the country.
[01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:33.460]   Well, why Leo?
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:34.460]   Breaking.
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:35.460]   Well, why?
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:37.360]   Yeah, 9am is just Pacific time.
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:38.360]   So that's interesting.
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:42.220]   This will be the first I think it's the first live concert on Beats one.
[01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:43.220]   Is that right?
[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:45.220]   They're ramping up.
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:46.220]   Yeah.
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:50.900]   It behooves them to get as much original content onto Apple music as possible because that's
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:52.840]   how you convert people to subscribers.
[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:53.840]   Well, and that's the point.
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:56.320]   Beats one is still available to people who don't subscribe.
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:01.360]   You don't have to be an Apple music user to be an Apple music lover.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:02.360]   Nice.
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:06.760]   You should look back at 1970s DJ voice.
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:07.760]   Yeah, baby.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:10.760]   I like it when you sleep because you're so funny.
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:11.760]   Oh my.
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:12.760]   Oh my.
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:13.760]   Time to move on to phase three.
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:14.760]   If you're not already.
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:15.760]   Hope you don't.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:20.520]   And I call that the Wednesday afternoon format.
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.660]   It's 533 on a Wednesday afternoon.
[01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:23.900]   Beautiful afternoon out there.
[01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:29.740]   I hope you're having a good time and now, ladies and gentlemen, can't heat and going
[01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:30.740]   down country.
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:34.860]   Our show today brought to you by texture, the mobile app.
[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:40.640]   It gives you all the world's best magazines right there in your tablet or your phone.
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:41.900]   And it's like cool.
[01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:45.900]   It's kind of like Netflix for magazines.
[01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:49.780]   Enter.com/MacbreakToTryItFree.
[01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:52.060]   Everybody binge watches movies and Netflix.
[01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:54.760]   Well, now you can binge read magazines on texture.
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.300]   I love it.
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:32:00.380]   And by the way, what's great because you have all these magazines on here is you can, of
[01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:05.300]   course, read a magazine to cover to cover, but you also can cover subject cover to cover.
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:11.300]   And the texture editors have made that possible by having curated topics that will dip into
[01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:21.660]   a variety of magazines from forms, people, Newsweek, Wired, popular science.
[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:22.820]   I mean, there aren't how many?
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:26.060]   I don't know how many lots of magazines in here.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:29.740]   Who wants to buy a magazine just because you want to read that cover story on Vanity
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:30.740]   Fair?
[01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:31.740]   I don't want to buy the magazine.
[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:33.820]   I don't want anyone to subscribe to it.
[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:34.820]   Macworld's in there.
[01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:35.820]   So is the National Geographic.
[01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:37.860]   So is BC Magazine.
[01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:39.500]   Popular photography.
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.700]   BC World.
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:42.700]   Sound and Vision.
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:43.700]   That's a great stereo magazine.
[01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:44.700]   Love that.
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:47.500]   I like just drooling over the stuff at Sound and Vision.
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:50.180]   You don't have to subscribe to Sound and Vision.
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:55.620]   You can subscribe to one site, texture.com/Macbreak, and get them all.
[01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:59.220]   Even dip into the gossip a little bit.
[01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:00.220]   You know, you want to break.
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:01.620]   You got a little time.
[01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:06.900]   Find out what's going on with Gwen and Blake and People Magazine, Us Weekly, Entertainment
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:07.900]   Weekly.
[01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:08.900]   Esquire.
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:11.860]   There's another magazine where I almost always, there's one article every month I want to
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:12.860]   read.
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:13.860]   But how are you going to get it?
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:17.260]   Look, there's an article about the new host of The Daily Show Trevor Noah.
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:18.260]   I love him.
[01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:21.060]   I'd love to know more about him and his big bat.
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:22.060]   And now you can.
[01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:24.100]   So you're still African.
[01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:25.100]   That's right.
[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:26.100]   Another South African.
[01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:27.100]   I got to learn that accent.
[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:28.460]   You can give me lessons.
[01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:33.020]   Texture.com/MacBreakTryItFree right now.

[01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:45.660]   you can't get in print like videos.
[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:46.660]   Love it.
[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:47.660]   Love it.
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:50.260]   Never lack for something great to read today.
[01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:54.740]   Oh, there's Jenny and some guy.
[01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:58.820]   Texture.com/MacBreakTryItFree.
[01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:02.420]   We thank him so much for their support of MacBreak Weekly.
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:05.780]   Andy has gotten up to a retrieve, I think, his pick of the week.
[01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:07.100]   What do you got there for us?
[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:10.060]   I was actually using it this morning.
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:14.980]   This is keep listening because you're going to be bored.
[01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:16.500]   This is a Bluetooth speaker.
[01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:17.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:19.620]   Never saw that before.
[01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:20.620]   Exactly.
[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:22.260]   This has two neat features.
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:23.900]   The reason why I bought it.
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:26.140]   Number one, that of course it is waterproof.
[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:30.260]   It is the whatever the IPX rating is for splash proof.
[01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:37.060]   So it solves problem number one for me, which is that I had my master bathroom.
[01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:43.500]   Like a big wireless speakers that I have to plug them in so I can listen to music and
[01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:46.260]   podcasts while I shower and perform my morning ablutions.
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:50.060]   This one I can actually, I don't have to blast it to get over the sound of the shower
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:54.860]   because I can actually keep like dangle this over the shower head or in the shampoo rack.
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:56.900]   Oh, but Andy, that's going to get wet.
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:59.780]   Well, you were even sitting off because of splash proof.
[01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:01.340]   Oh, nice.
[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:06.580]   But there's another reason, but there are a bunch of splash proof and shower quality Bluetooth
[01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:07.580]   speakers.
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:10.540]   I got it because you notice, you see, it's round.
[01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:11.540]   Yeah.
[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:14.980]   And also it is roughly like, would you call that bottle shaped?
[01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:15.980]   Yeah.
[01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:18.820]   And so if you have, if you just bought a new bike.
[01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:19.820]   Oh, dear.
[01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:26.180]   And you're not, and you don't feel as though it is in any way safe to even have one earphone
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:27.180]   in.
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:30.700]   You can actually put this in the bottle and any of your bottle racks and you have this
[01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:31.700]   beautiful speaker.
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:32.700]   Oh, that's terrible.
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:33.700]   And I'm listening.
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:34.700]   And it's beautiful.
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:37.700]   It's it's it's also surprisingly loud.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:42.060]   I didn't really really realize that until I was writing home after like a day at a coffee
[01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:46.460]   shop and it's like seven thirty eight o'clock at night and it's on like sort of a sort of
[01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:50.180]   a quiet street, like about two miles from my house.
[01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:54.380]   And it's like I'm it's like John Houdgman is a political candidate.
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:58.260]   And I'm just like, I'm like, I'm like the announcement, the campaign van because you
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:03.780]   just hear John Houdgman's voice reverberating off of every house and every street sign,
[01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:06.340]   which I didn't think it was that loud until it's okay.
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:07.340]   Let's pull over.
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:09.340]   Let's throw your neighbors did.
[01:36:09.340 --> 01:36:14.180]   I feel as though I feel as though they think I'm advertising something, but it does work
[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:15.180]   great.
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:19.420]   I mean, I don't I I'm not the sort of person who when I like you take walks or exercise
[01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:23.820]   thing, my mind is not occupied by always no wonder from in the fresh air and I'm being
[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:24.820]   healthy.
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:28.660]   It's like I want to spend this half hour to me to distract me quick.
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:30.180]   Please, please let me do something.
[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:35.180]   So it's not that expensive either.
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:38.180]   I got this for like $35 $40 on Amazon.
[01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:39.180]   It's made by Al Petronix.
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:40.180]   I'm sorry.
[01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:43.180]   I didn't put it into the show notes, but I'll have it for you.
[01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:44.180]   Certainly.
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:47.180]   Al P A T R O N I X and it's like 35 bucks on Amazon.
[01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:50.780]   You also got you know, has this beautiful like hanging loop and you get a sack you can
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:53.100]   put it into and pairs pretty easily.
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:54.340]   So I'm very happy with it.
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:55.340]   Very nice.
[01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:57.380]   But a nice indeed.
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:58.380]   Thank you, Andrew.
[01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:00.980]   Renee Richie, what do you got for us?
[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:01.980]   I have to.
[01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:03.580]   The first one is a little bit self serving.
[01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:07.900]   So we decided I wanted a t-shirt for stand stand with Apple and I couldn't find one.
[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:08.980]   We decided to make one.
[01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:11.260]   All the proceeds go to the EFF.
[01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:14.140]   So I put the link in the show notes and it's up on on I'm more now.
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:15.340]   So if you go there.
[01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:19.660]   Yeah, we only doing it for a few days because it seemed more topical than long term.
[01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:21.140]   So you can go there.
[01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:22.140]   You can order one.
[01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:25.500]   There's a bunch of different colors as men's and women's and there's hoodies.
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:29.700]   You put it as low a cost as T spring would allow but any profit that that might come
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:30.940]   in will go to the EFF.
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:33.220]   So it's not about making any money on this.
[01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:36.180]   It's just about giving people who want to, you know, make a statement the ability to
[01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:38.380]   make that statement if they choose.
[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:42.380]   We chose non infringing emoji for people who asked why we didn't use the Apple emoji.
[01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:43.380]   Yeah.
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:45.420]   Are the Apple emoji like copyrighted?
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:46.900]   I don't want to find out.
[01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:49.300]   I don't want to be a test case.
[01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:52.860]   So we just we just we've just found out that Apple does have lots of lawyers and they're
[01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:55.460]   wanting to fight people a lot better pocket.
[01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:59.300]   The latest shirts if you go to the infinite loop Apple store, their latest shirts are using
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:02.220]   the Apple emoji and we didn't want to make it look like it came from Apple or anything
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:03.220]   like that.
[01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:04.660]   I wanted to be as upfront about it as possible.
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:06.740]   So that's actually probably the best reason.
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:07.740]   Yeah.
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:08.740]   Yeah.
[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:09.740]   So it's only available.
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:11.740]   So if you're listening to this later, I apologize and we'll do something in the future
[01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:14.820]   that's different than this, but it's available I think for the next two or three days.
[01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:15.820]   Oh dear.
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:16.820]   So rush.
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:18.780]   It's already funded.
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:20.100]   So you have nothing to worry about.
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:21.500]   Just go there and grab it.
[01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:24.940]   For people who are listening later and for people who are interested in general, I had
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:28.420]   this experience recently and we talked about it before Leo's.
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:29.500]   Every year I do a security audit.
[01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:31.340]   I go through the watch list in one password.
[01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:32.340]   I reset everything.
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:36.300]   I change things and I got a lot more into two factor authentication.
[01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:39.420]   I've been hesitant about that because I always did it right away.
[01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:43.420]   So I could document it for the readers and it was often not a good experience.
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:47.900]   Like I got locked out of Dropbox for a long time because I just never got the second factor
[01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:50.180]   text no matter how often I try it.
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:53.740]   I didn't have a lot of it enabled, but I went through and systematically started enabling
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:54.740]   it.
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:55.740]   But then I got a second problem.
[01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:58.740]   I started traveling so much going to Winnipeg or going to San Francisco.
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:03.020]   I would be up in the air and all of a sudden, you know, Canada got Wi-Fi on their planes.
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:07.380]   Who knew and I could start doing all these things, but the browser would detect a state
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:11.620]   change and demand that I reauthenticate and I'm on an airplane where I can't get text
[01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:12.660]   messages.
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:13.660]   So I couldn't get into Google.
[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:14.660]   I couldn't get into Twitter.
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:16.900]   I couldn't get into a lot of things.
[01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:21.700]   Sometimes I was using devices I had just picked up at the place that I'd been to.
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:24.700]   So I didn't really set up everything as well as I should.
[01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:26.380]   So I started using Authy.
[01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:27.380]   And Authy is really cool.
[01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:32.340]   It's one of those things where it provides, it's basically time things.
[01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:36.140]   So it's always providing you with a code that's the code that the app expects.
[01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:40.700]   So for example, if I want to log into, I use it for the VPN that I connect to for work
[01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:45.380]   a lot, almost all the time because that requires a second factor.
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:46.380]   I use it for Slack.
[01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:48.740]   I use it for a bunch of other applications.
[01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:51.180]   And the nice thing is I don't have to wait for a text message.
[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:55.900]   The number appears right on my phone or even better on my Apple Watch.
[01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:57.460]   And then I can just put it right in.
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:40:01.180]   And because the Apple Watch is kind of a second screen for the iPhone for me, when
[01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:04.820]   I'm using it on iPhone, I don't have to flip back and forth and try and remember the number.
[01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:08.980]   I just showed it on my Apple Watch, type it in on my iPhone and I'm ready to go.
[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:13.980]   And it's so far been way better than getting a text message, which has proven still kind
[01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:16.780]   of unreliable even in 2016.
[01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:19.900]   So I just have a ton of stuff stored in there now.
[01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:23.500]   You can ask Siri to launch it for you, but Siri doesn't seem to actually understand the
[01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:24.500]   word "offee."
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:28.620]   So you have to use the old all caps A-U-T-H thing to get it to launch.
[01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:32.580]   But it's just about as simple and as fast as I'd want it to be.
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:35.420]   And I know some password managers, including the one I use, build this in.
[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:38.940]   But I like the idea of an app that I use it so often, I just double click the crown on
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:41.700]   my watch and I'm there and I'm getting it and I'm putting it in.
[01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:46.580]   And I'm being asked for it so often now for so many apps that it's made what could be
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:51.620]   cumbersome in that continual war between security and convenience almost tenable.
[01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:53.060]   I almost don't think about it anymore.
[01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:55.220]   And that's me as a huge security win.
[01:40:55.220 --> 01:40:56.220]   Very nice.
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:58.700]   Yeah, I've been using Authy for a long time.
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:00.260]   Really great one-step solution for everything.
[01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:04.700]   It's funny, all three of us have independently moved to Authy instead of Google Authenticator.
[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:07.020]   And anything you do with authenticator, you can use it with Authy.
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:08.820]   I love it that I don't have to enter in.
[01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:13.220]   You don't know, I was doing something, saving the QR codes in my last pass.
[01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:16.980]   Because that way, and I could set up a new device, I could point it at the QR code.
[01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:18.820]   But Authy just solves that whole thing.
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:19.820]   It's really-
[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:23.100]   And it will let you think, if you choose to, it will let you think across devices.
[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:25.820]   So I was always worried that if I lost that device, that was it for me.
[01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:29.220]   But I have it on enough devices now that I'm fairly confident I'll always have one of them
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:30.220]   available.
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:31.220]   Yeah.
[01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:32.220]   Yeah.
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:34.820]   I use it as a Google plug-in, Chrome plug-in.
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:36.620]   So that means it's everything.
[01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:38.620]   So as soon as I set up Chrome, I got Authy.
[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:39.620]   So great.
[01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:40.620]   Yeah.
[01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:44.540]   There's a time where I had to wait, I actually had to wait like an hour and a half to set
[01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:47.020]   up a new phone or something.
[01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:53.020]   Because the last thing that I'd authorized for the Google Pass word was my Nexus 5, which
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:54.020]   was-
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:55.020]   Right.
[01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:56.900]   I hadn't used in two weeks and that was completely flat and dead.
[01:41:56.900 --> 01:42:01.620]   And it was the old style of Android so that I had to wait a long time for getting up to
[01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:02.620]   actually log in.
[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:03.620]   Right.
[01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:05.920]   And as you mentioned, you can-
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:09.740]   It's Apple Watch compatible, but I love it that I could pull.
[01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:13.820]   I turned the Authy notifications onto my iPhone because then I can just pull down my
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:16.220]   notifications and I've got my Authys.
[01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:19.940]   My Authys are all there, baby.
[01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:20.940]   Very nice.
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:21.940]   Yeah.
[01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:25.460]   My pick is something that I discovered independently and I hope you guys don't hate
[01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:28.420]   it because I haven't really asked around.
[01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:30.420]   But I like the idea.
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:32.720]   One of our viewers- and I mentioned it yesterday on iOS today.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:35.820]   One of our viewers emailed us, Frank Petronos, and he said, "My wife is a little bit of a
[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:40.560]   wife and I want some way to back up all our photos from our phones so that we can-
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:42.800]   you know, we back them up and we have access to them."
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:46.600]   And I mentioned Google, of course, Google Photos.
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:52.280]   And if you're at all Mac or all Apple rather than you certainly can use iCloud PhotoDrive.
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:56.440]   But this is something that's a little different and maybe could be used in conjunction with
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:57.880]   Photos or iCloud.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:01.480]   It's called Live from Seagate, L-Y-V-E.
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:03.960]   And I'm sure they see this just as a way to sell more hard drives.
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:08.520]   In fact, if you use a Seagate Disc Attached Storage Drive, I just bought a 4TB drive for
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:13.360]   110 bucks and you run the live software, it will see it and say, "Well, you'd like me
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:15.080]   to use this to back up your photos."
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:19.200]   But I bought this little thing that Live makes- that's a standalone drive.
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:21.560]   Let me see if I can find the drive here.
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:23.200]   It's about the size of an iPhone.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:25.920]   It has an iPhone size screen on it.
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:27.280]   Now they say 300 bucks.
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:29.400]   I'm not sure I'd recommend this at 300 bucks.
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:34.800]   But right now on Amazon, it's $150 for two terabytes of storage.
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:36.520]   That's pretty good price.
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:37.880]   Plus the screen.
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:40.320]   You could put it on Wi-Fi or ethernet.
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:44.800]   And then if you have the live software on your iPhone, your iPad, your Mac, your Windows,
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:48.120]   your Android, which I do, it'll automatically back it up.
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:49.120]   You can even set it up.
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:53.000]   I'm just setting it up here on this Mac to automatically back up photos.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.240]   And these are backing up originals, by the way, not reduced sized photos from photos
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:01.920]   and photo booths, but you can also have watch folders so that if there's a folder like
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:05.680]   your Lightroom folder, you always upload images too.
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:08.360]   It'll sync those as well.
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:15.720]   Within a couple of days, I had all 30,000 of my photos on my Live Drive in the house.
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:19.800]   And when I come in the house, or when actually it does it over the internet too, so when
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:21.760]   I take new photos, they're always backed up there.
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:25.920]   It has an HDMI port in the back so you can connect it to a big screen TV if you want
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:28.080]   to have a slideshow.
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:29.080]   You know, I really like this.
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:33.200]   And at 150 bucks and the software is free, I think this is a good solution if you want
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:37.280]   your own backup in addition to any cloud solution.
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:40.560]   The only negative is doesn't do raw files yet, although the Seagate folks say they're
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:41.640]   working on that.
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:45.480]   But it does do JPEGs and other standard file formats.
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:47.840]   You're familiar with this, Andy?
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:55.360]   Haven't heard of it, but you cannot have too many automatic backups of your photos.
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:00.240]   I pay for unlimited storage on Google.
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:06.160]   Even though my pictures folders and libraries are automatically backed up to my network
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:11.360]   server, and they're all kinds of other backup systems built in because it's not just having
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:12.360]   one solution.
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:17.760]   It's what if five years from now you want to get a hold of a picture and maybe you lost
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:21.440]   a certain hard drive or you stopped using a certain backup service, you'll realize,
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:22.440]   "Oh, that's right.
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:25.880]   I'm having everything automatically backed up to Google or automatically backed up to
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:26.880]   iCloud."
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:27.880]   "Oh, that's right.
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:29.160]   I had that cool device on it."
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:32.680]   And even if you stop using it, if you put it in your closet, you'll plug it back in
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:34.560]   again and now you'll get all your pictures back.
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:37.680]   And the other thing is that your pictures are now available in all the devices with
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:38.680]   the live software.
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:43.600]   So I can see 30,000 pictures on my iPhone, on my iPad.
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:47.080]   Of course, it doesn't download them all, but you can download any individual picture.
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:48.960]   That's kind of nice too.
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:54.960]   And it has an SD card slot in the hardware so you can take your camera, just plug it in
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:56.400]   and get it backed up immediately.
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:57.880]   It has a USB slot.
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:01.400]   You can connect a hard drive to it and back it that up.
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:02.920]   Pretty sweet.
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:07.520]   I think for 150 bucks, I don't know about 300, but for 150 bucks, that's a pretty good thing.
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:09.000]   And remember, that screen is small.
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000]   It's an iPhone-sized screen.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000]   It's not cute.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.560]   It's a good little, you know what?
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:17.000]   You could put it somewhere like on your desk and it becomes a photo frame and a clock.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.040]   And because Wi-Fi, you don't have to have it either now, although I have it either
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.040]   and I connect it.
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:22.040]   Yeah.
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:26.000]   Sometimes you sense that one of the most important decisions in our design was what's
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:31.160]   the most amount of money that we can price this at and still have a good product that
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:32.160]   people will like.
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:33.160]   Right.
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:34.160]   Because you're right.
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:35.160]   It's like the...
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:37.160]   I can't remember.
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:41.720]   What was that actual upholstered nightstand on the computer?
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:43.120]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:46.960]   I want to say, windy or bushy or something like that.
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:52.160]   It was really cool and it was really interesting, but it was way too expensive for just someone
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:55.160]   to buy a cool and interesting thing.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:57.800]   But 150 bucks, it sounds like this is about how...
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:00.000]   This gets my attention and gets my interest.
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.400]   Well, and you can even save money because as I said, if you don't care about the screen,
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:05.560]   you can buy a four terabyte Seagate DAS.
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:07.760]   It has to be a DAS drive.
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:09.560]   I bought it for 110 bucks.
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:10.560]   Connect that to your Mac.
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.360]   Of course, your Mac has to be on for it to back up.
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:14.600]   But now that will work with live.
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:15.800]   That becomes a live drive.
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:17.560]   In exactly the same way.
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:18.560]   So you get to choose.
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:22.440]   In fact, you could have one at home and one at work if you really want to go crazy.
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:23.440]   Chumbie!
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:24.440]   Chumbie!
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:25.440]   That's it.
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.440]   Thank you, Virgil.
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:27.440]   Chumbie!
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:33.600]   I still have the bag that it came in because my Sufi device, the ANOVA, fits in that perfectly
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:34.920]   in its accessories.
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:37.960]   I don't know where the actual device is, though.
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:38.960]   Chumbie!
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:43.240]   All right, that does it for this edition of Mac Break Weekly, a good show today.
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:46.240]   Once again, I don't know how we do it day, week in, week out, but that's one of the
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:50.160]   best things about having Andy Inako and Renee Richie on the team.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:52.000]   You know it's going to be a great conversation.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.360]   Andy, of course, writes for the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:48:00.600]   Look for his piece on the Stand With Apple case in any minute now.
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:07.200]   I think we're smart to defer because it's evolved a lot since Wednesday.
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:13.200]   Again, I have so much respect for people in Renee's position where the value of the
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:17.200]   value that they provide is to make sure that when you hear about something, you go to
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:19.360]   Imor and they'll have something about it.
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:22.960]   I'm just pleased that I get to be more editorial in what I do.
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:31.160]   I'm happy with the stuff that I drafted yesterday than the thing that was ready to go last week.
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:33.160]   Renee Richie, Imor.com.
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:36.920]   Of course, there's another great place to go, whether it's a story like this and you
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:41.920]   want to get a t-shirt or you want to find out what's the deal with the pencil no longer
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:44.120]   supporting UI controls.
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:47.920]   You get serenity's column and it's really Imor is really a must have.
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:50.760]   We added Lori Gill and Daniel Bader this week.
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:51.760]   Oh, nice.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:52.760]   Last week, sorry.
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:56.520]   Yeah, Lori Gill, awesome app and how-to writer and Daniel Bader used to be editor-in-chief
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:57.720]   of Global Serum.
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:48:59.040]   So really good team.
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:00.200]   Guys are growing fast.
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:05.360]   And by the way, your partner site has done a great job at Mobile World Congress.
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:07.200]   Oh, they're awesome.
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:08.200]   What is it?
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:09.200]   Android.
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:10.200]   Central.
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.200]   Central, that's it.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:12.200]   Android.
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:13.200]   And not a partner site anymore.
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:15.520]   I'm sort of responsible for a lot of the stuff on all of them now.
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:17.440]   Oh, I can't pick from the kitchen more.
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:20.480]   You didn't take this opportunity for a junket to Barcelona?
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:23.440]   No, actually Derek Kessler, our managing editor.
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:24.440]   He went.
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:25.440]   He got the Jamal.
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:28.640]   The Jamal and Barrica.
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:29.640]   The Hamon.
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:34.760]   I've gone to Mobile World Congress just for the ham.
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:36.720]   Yeah, just go for the ham.
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:37.720]   Stay for the ham.
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:39.320]   You've never been to Barcelona.
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:40.600]   You have no height.
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:41.600]   It's like Coca Cola.
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:43.880]   What Coca Cola is over here.
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:44.880]   That's what every it's like.
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:45.880]   You can.
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:47.080]   There's a gas station and there's ham.
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:51.640]   Not just like pre I'm saying there's a hawk right there in the cash register and a guy
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:53.640]   with a knife who like peel you.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:57.120]   Barcelona, when men and men and pigs are afraid.
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:58.960]   Pigs are please.
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:03.320]   If a pigs nose is going to die, any lease is going to be come on.
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:08.120]   At least don't at least it's not going to wind up in like a Taco Bell burrito or a hot
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:09.120]   dog.
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:11.120]   He's going to be treated with greatest respect.
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:14.840]   You could be carnitas or how many bérico be how long I'm going to go.
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:15.920]   I am so hungry right now.
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:16.920]   I love it.
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:21.760]   By the way, I ordered immediately ordered a galaxy S seven that the edge that thing is
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:23.120]   going to be a stun.
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:24.120]   Oh, G to Leo.
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:25.120]   Are you waiting?
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:26.120]   I'll get the LG.
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:27.120]   I don't know if it when it's available.
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:28.120]   Is it available for it now?
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:29.120]   I don't think so yet.
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:34.800]   No, but I'll be getting the G seven I think before and like less than two weeks regular
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:36.440]   edge of course edge.
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:37.440]   Nice.
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.440]   It's a 6 edge and I really liked it.
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:42.160]   It didn't have enough battery life and it didn't have enough RAM.
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:43.320]   It was a little hesitant.
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:44.320]   There's some hesitation.
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:46.320]   Yeah, this one they've solved that the SD cards.
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:51.240]   I think it's going to be a very it's going to be a tough tough competitor to the iPhone.
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:55.880]   Isn't it exciting that every time we look at a new phone, we're looking at a brand new
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:59.480]   like like it's a it's a camera with phone features on it.
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:00.480]   Oh man.
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:01.880]   F one point seven.
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:03.880]   Yeah, the leap and quality.
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:04.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:08.880]   I bought a Nexus specifically because I want to get updates directly from Google and I don't
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:11.200]   want to have the extra Samsung cruft.
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:13.200]   But that camera man.
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:19.480]   Anyway, I'm glad that companies aren't hesitant to go down in pixels of it means mega things
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:21.240]   and it means enhancements and everything else.
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:22.240]   Yeah.
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:23.960]   It's 12 instead of 16.
[01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:26.320]   I think taking a leaf for Apple's book.
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:29.720]   They're also doing something Apple kind of pioneered actually had maybe cannon pioneered
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:34.200]   at the idea of using the pixels themselves for phase detection focus.
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:38.800]   But unlike Apple, they're going to use every one of those 12 megapixels for phase detection
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:39.800]   focusing.
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:42.320]   We'll see that it looks pretty impressive in the demo, but those demos are fake.
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:46.200]   So, you know, I have to have to try some fast focusing.
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:48.080]   I'm confident you guys will put it to the test.
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:50.000]   I think the low light's going to be good.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.400]   I'm yeah.
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:53.200]   And I really like the S6 camera, right?
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:54.760]   Andy, wasn't that a great camera?
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:55.760]   Yeah.
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:58.760]   Samsung keeps raising the bar every single time.
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:02.480]   Well, if it's that's I think that's one of the reasons why Apple did not have the option
[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:07.960]   of not doing a 12 megapixel camera because leaving last year's phone was kind of kicking
[01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:08.960]   the iPhones.
[01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:14.480]   But it was delivering pictures that were as good quality, but also with higher resolution.
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:19.880]   And so I just I want these people to just hate each other's guts so badly.
[01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:22.360]   I want them to be more to be offended.
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:26.560]   I want there to be this meeting inside of Apple, not embarrassing.
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:27.560]   Screw those guys.
[01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:29.760]   If they think they have a better God.
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:30.760]   Dang it.
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:34.720]   What I'm calling my husband right now and saying this.
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:37.080]   We're not we're pulling an all nighter.
[01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:38.080]   Exactly.
[01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:42.600]   You're going to be raising the kids for the next six months because I will be.
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:43.600]   Damn.
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:48.040]   If we let Sam talk about better camera than we have, by the way, as you probably saw,
[01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:53.880]   if you turned in early, I got the new octagonal watch from Fitbit, the Fitbit Blaze and by
[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:54.880]   just got it.
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:53:00.000]   So I won't have a review for you until next week, but I will talk about it next week on
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000]   the show.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.560]   It looks pretty sweet.
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:04.080]   I'm already liking it a little bit.
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:05.080]   We'll see.
[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:09.360]   The heart rate monitor can be as accurate as the Apple watch.
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:13.440]   I might be going all all outside of Apple.
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:16.440]   I'm so glad that we were you're in front of a microphone.
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:20.480]   You unbox this because your attitude about this watch over the past two and a half hours
[01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:24.600]   watching it change from, Oh, gee, I can see that's actually, you know, I kind of like
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:25.600]   it.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:26.600]   Yeah, I don't mind.
[01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:28.200]   I don't mind the octagonal.
[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:30.200]   It doesn't look bad on my wrist.
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:32.240]   I mean, I'm not a risk totally.
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:33.800]   It's totally, you know, good for this.
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:34.800]   I'm a big boy.
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:40.000]   Just not for not for days, perhaps, but for the lead is, but you know, it's great.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.120]   It's already getting notifications from the iPhone.
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:45.160]   It's already it's it's does, you know, it's like a pebble.
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:47.640]   It does a lot of the same kind of pebble things.
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:49.480]   All right, everybody.
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:50.480]   That's it.
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:53.200]   Go back to work because break time is over.
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:54:03.200]   [MUSIC]
