[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.280]   Hi, everyone.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.320]   Welcome to Macbreak Weekly.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.120]   This is Alex, and I am sitting in for Leo, who is down at Google I/O.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.120]   I think he's on his way up here.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.000]   We might even see him by the end of the show,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.880]   but he wasn't here at 11, and I was.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.520]   So I just wrangled my way in and thought I'd bring some friends in
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.760]   and have some fun.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.760]   Of course, we have the illustrious Andy Naco coming in from--
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.680]   what is that behind you?
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.200]   Oh, this is just that really cool, constantly, an orary app.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.400]   It's called-- what was it called?
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.160]   That I recommended a couple of weeks ago.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.120]   It's called observatory.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.840]   And it's just like my favorite.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.560]   I need to-- I don't--
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.120]   I want to keep my iPad dock someplace,
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.240]   but I want it to look really, really cool while it's doing it.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.640]   It was a pick of the week, a couple months ago,
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.440]   where it's a clock which shows faces of the moon,
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.680]   places where you intend to time, in places where you intend
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.720]   to be in a few days time.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.360]   That's where the asteroid is going to hit us in four weeks time.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.280]   So don't sweat those five-week deadlines.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.840]   It really is.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.480]   And instead of spending 10 or $12,000 to have this hanging on your wall,
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.880]   it's just a really cheap two or three-buck app.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.520]   So it's like--
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.040]   I love it.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.080]   The wonder of the iPad.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.760]   And they wonder why the iPad is so successful,
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.920]   because you can put stuff like that on the wall.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.560]   It is everything.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.160]   Exactly.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.800]   Coming in from Rodondo Beach.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.560]   Her most of the--
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.160]   It is Ron Brinkman.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.080]   Yeah, he says this thing where he intentionally
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.320]   misleaves people as to where I live, which I should probably
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.560]   embrace, because that way people won't show up at my front door.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.320]   And Ron Brinkman is a frequent host on Mac--
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.000]   I'm sorry, on this week of photography.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.520]   Now, we have him on fairly often.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.920]   And he has worked for many of the companies
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.760]   that we're discussing today, which is all-- but doesn't currently
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.000]   work for them, which makes him a perfect reservoir of rumor
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   and innuendo.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.440]   So the welcome Ron.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.640]   Happy to tell stories out of school.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.760]   Also here in the studio, Fredrick Johnson.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.520]   Hey, Fredrick.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.720]   Hello.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.160]   I'm finally back in the studio.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.960]   It's been a while.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.960]   I'm excited to be sitting in this chair again.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.440]   I know.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.040]   I can't tell you.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.560]   I got to--
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.080]   It's kind of fun.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.760]   It's goosebumps.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.120]   And so it's good to have you back, Fredrick.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.400]   Thank you.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.020]   So I'm from this week in the photo, and of course,
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.840]   Fredrickvan.com.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.760]   Yes.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.360]   And then also we have Keith Lang, who
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.920]   is visiting from down under.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.360]   So what brings you here, Keith?
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.840]   Just some sketchy business?
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.080]   Some sketchy business, of course.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.400]   If you don't know who Keith Lang is,
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.080]   Keith Lang is the developer for Sketch, which
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.040]   is an awesome application.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.520]   UI, UX, one of the co-founders.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.720]   I'm not a code cutter myself.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.640]   You're not the code of yourself.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.720]   You're just the complainer.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.720]   Yes, professionally.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.840]   Professional complainer.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.960]   That's what I call myself.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.720]   I used to say I was a designer or whatever.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.920]   But as a designer, your job is basically just to go.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.840]   That doesn't work.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.320]   This isn't work-eated.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.200]   So anyways, you're the professional complainer.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680]   And I'm just--
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.040]   I'm happy to be here.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.800]   It's this place is epic.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.000]   Well, it's good to have that.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.480]   Keith sent me an email saying, hey, I'm in town.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.120]   I'm like, come up with me on Magbrink.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.360]   So that's how he ended up here.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.240]   So we've got a lot of news to cover.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.120]   Now, one of the things I want to thank everyone for,
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.400]   we did a little bit of an experiment
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.720]   that I think we're going to do more often on some of the shows.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.920]   I don't know about Magbrink.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.720]   That'll be up to Leo.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.520]   But one of the things that we did is I
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.400]   twittered out that I was hosting or tweeted out
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.640]   that I was hosting.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.240]   And then I got two or three pages of suggestions
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.480]   about what we should talk about and everything else.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.320]   And so then I compiled those and figured out
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.000]   which ones and which ones were the most popular
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.600]   and everything else.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.120]   And then I put them on my blog at borderstack.com
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.200]   and then told everybody, just go up there and give me feedback.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.280]   So what we have is kind of a crowd-sourced collection
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.480]   of data here, which I think actually turned out pretty well.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.240]   So anyway, and the guys--
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.680]   and of course, everyone here has read the notes very, very
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.800]   in depth.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.640]   So they have all that set up.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.640]   So anyway, so here we go.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.760]   Microsoft, of course, buys Skype.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.640]   Frederick, does this make any sense?
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.600]   You're really going to ask me this?
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.280]   What, so ever?
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.960]   We were talking about this on the drive-up.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.120]   I think it makes sense.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.720]   It makes sense because it didn't make sense to me.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.440]   But of course, who am I?
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.880]   It makes me sense to me that eBay owned Skype.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.120]   But more from a perspective of a user.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.440]   Because we use Skype for this week in photo.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.000]   We use Skype to talk every now and then.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.760]   We use a lot.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.360]   I mean, it's--
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.680]   So there's not that going to use it.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.680]   It's not like buying some random application.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.840]   What I'm worried about is Microsoft has a history--
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.080]   like many companies in the Valley--
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.200]   has a history of buying things and then killing them
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.160]   or not doing good things.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.560]   What I'm mostly worried about is Microsoft buys this thing.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.960]   And suddenly, the Mac version languishes even more
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.640]   than it is languishing now.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.080]   I mean, that's the big thing.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.560]   That's what I'm mostly concerned about
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.080]   is how does this affect Mac users away?
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.120]   The last version was already bad enough.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.480]   It felt like they were getting rid of us.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.040]   I'm not even using the last version.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.600]   We have to for some of the shows.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.840]   Andy, how do you think this is going to affect Mac users?
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.280]   I'm not really sure.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.640]   There's some of the best Mac developers in the industry
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.360]   who work for the Mac business unit--
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.840]   I'd rather use to be the Mac business unit at Microsoft.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.800]   They make one of the best suites of products
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.560]   are available for Mac OS.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.680]   But then I actually had to really remind myself
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.040]   that Windows Messenger was available for Android and iOS,
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.640]   which remind myself that, oh, actually, they
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.120]   have written iOS apps before.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.240]   So I'm kind of curious to see how much they're
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.520]   going to be able to staff up.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.440]   Also, the press release for Microsoft
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.000]   only mentions that the CEO of Skype
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.040]   is going to be moving over to Microsoft.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.600]   That doesn't mean that they're not moving over.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.320]   They're engineers.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.560]   They're other personnel from Skype.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.440]   But also, this was an opportunity
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.360]   that if that were something that were part of the deal that
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.840]   was negotiated from day one, that, oh, by the way,
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.000]   and by the way, all of our Skype employees
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.360]   will become part of the Microsoft dental plan,
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.760]   that's something you would have liked to have seen inside
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.560]   that press release.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.840]   So we don't know yet whether or not
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.760]   they simply want to integrate Skype services
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.560]   into Microsoft products like Google Bing, Xbox.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.440]   It's a natural fit for Skype.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.960]   Or if they simply want to continue
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.640]   to do business as usual with Skype as its own dominant product,
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.640]   and also make sure that it integrates really, really
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.760]   well with all of Microsoft's consumer products as well.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.880]   So the coin's really in the air, I think.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.000]   Well, I mean, it does seem like the Xbox
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.480]   would be the natural one of having this kind of desktop
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.480]   or inexpensive solution.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.360]   Ron, do you see Xbox becoming a big Skype deployment?
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.360]   I would kind of hope so.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.160]   I mean, in some ways, they haven't really
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.240]   capitalized on the success of the Xbox
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.760]   and the way that they could have, I think, in some ways.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.160]   Because it is sort of this ubiquitous platform that
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.440]   doesn't quite have the stink of Microsoft on it
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.520]   the way the OS does.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.160]   And it's sort of a little more agnostic.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.560]   And I think if it's--
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.320]   Skype's going to be successful, it
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.680]   needs to go kind of cross-platform.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.280]   I thought-- actually, Andy wrote an article this morning
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.920]   that I thought was really interesting,
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.680]   and that he points out.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.160]   In some ways, they've bought a social network in a lot of ways
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.160]   that Skype is a connection list in the same way
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.840]   that Facebook is, where you've got a list of all the people
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.760]   you tend to talk to.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.600]   And there's probably a lot that could be leveraged there,
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.120]   too, in particular, if you look at it in conjunction
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.040]   with the Xbox and the people you tend to play your games with.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.040]   Keith said--
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.000]   What is--
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.560]   I was just going to say this could be just--
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.320]   you see a lot of people talking about integration
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.120]   with Xbox, but I think that integration with Bing
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.840]   is going to be one of the sleeper functions
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.680]   of acquiring Skype.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.040]   And is-- because Bing-- I mean, I actually
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.160]   have switched over to using Bing a lot more than I used to.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.720]   I mean, it's something that I'm finding more and more
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.640]   of the features to be a little easier to work with.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.480]   But there are times when I can't get it to find what
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.040]   I'm trying to find.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.480]   I'm going back to Google.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.760]   I've had enough of this.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:08.080]   Keith, what would Microsoft have to do to really make this work?
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.080]   Well, I mean--
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.080]   I do have to do it.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.080]   --pull you closer to that mic.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.880]   That mic has what we call lots of off-axis rejection.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.000]   So you want to get ready.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.160]   Right up there.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.080]   Yeah, I got a little bit of inside information on this.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.960]   I believe that about $7 billion is being allocated to fix Andy's
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.640]   Skype problems.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:31.400]   I would take half of it in cash and just deal with the problems.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.240]   I could-- for $40 billion, I'm willing to accept a couple
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.520]   of dropouts and a camera that doesn't work when I first
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.440]   started up.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.440]   And a tin can.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.040]   No, I like the kind of--
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.800]   the thinking that there is a whole social network there
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.440]   that you don't, I guess, think of as a social network.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.720]   But here's the question is, is that have we got to a point
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.640]   now where we--
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.120]   how much does that social network really
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.920]   love the network that they're in?
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.320]   I think that there was a point where I was like,
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.280]   I don't really understand why all these people use Skype.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.680]   I just use iChat.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.760]   And then I was a point where I stopped using iChat
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.080]   and all I used was Skype.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.440]   And then I was like, oh, Skype's kind of cool.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.960]   But then there was this being beaten by things not working
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.600]   and then beaten by the last update, which
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.560]   was the most heinous thing ever done to worldwide communication
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.720]   as far as I'm concerned.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.960]   That you know, you all--
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.040]   I mean, those things just--
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.040]   It just makes it so angry.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.640]   Not only is it a horrible interface,
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.120]   but they charge me for it.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.960]   So now I could pay $8.95 or whatever for something
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.400]   that was worse than what I had before.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.480]   So go ahead, Andy.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.520]   I'm still on 2 point, whatever.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.200]   Because this is the one machine.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.880]   This is the one machine in which I absolutely
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.560]   have to have Skype running.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.800]   It becomes mission critical.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.600]   So this is the one computer where it's always on 2.2.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.200]   But the biggest advantage of Skype has always been that it's
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.400]   sort of like the Bell system during the '40s, '50s, '60s,
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.200]   and '70s.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.960]   Yes, the service can be a little bit crappy.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.440]   Yes, the phones are unambitious.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.080]   It still makes you do this sort of thing.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.600]   And other people can listen in.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.200]   But the fact that everybody has the same services
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.240]   and it's all a feature, something occurred to me this afternoon,
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.560]   was that if the only thing that Skype can keep a hold of
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.960]   is the fact that it's the one that your parents know how to use.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.440]   I don't have to teach somebody how to use any of these other systems
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.240]   because, yes, it did take a while to get them over the curve
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.720]   of learning Skype, but now they know how to do Skype.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.160]   I'm not sure if I can teach my parents how to use Skype.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:27.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.560]   Sorry.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.000]   I like that like, like, FaceTime was complicated enough.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.640]   Once we got FaceTime, you know, solved, you know,
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.840]   just kind of like going up.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.720]   And that was mostly just getting the iPhones connected to the wife.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.400]   When parents are well motivated, they'll change for the times.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.160]   Do you think they'll turn off?
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.360]   Well, Alex, honey, I know how you're on the computer all the time,
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.120]   so I set up the Skype and you still never Skype me.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.240]   Alex, I want you to have your own life, Alex.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.280]   I'm not sorry that you leave me alone.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.800]   And you never tell me anything.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.920]   And you don't want to know what's going on in my life
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.040]   and how horrible my shoulder's been feeling for the past three weeks.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.480]   But if you-- I'll be here by the computer, Alex.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.520]   I have the Skype.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.600]   And if you ever do, know that I'll be here by the computer waiting
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.040]   for your call so you can call me anytime you know what I'm--
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.760]   So the key is-- what you're saying is the key is a siege mentality.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.200]   It's just get them-- the only way to talk to you is via--
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.360]   Ooh, what about this?
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.360]   For a Mac user?
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.200]   If you want to ever talk to your mother again,
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.840]   you will approve this merger.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.360]   Well, Alex, for Mac users, you know, Apple's building
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.600]   is gigantic data center, right?
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.760]   So that's going in place.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:31.560]   We've got FaceTime.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.800]   We've got these iOS devices that are coming out in waves and waves and waves.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.560]   What's to say that Apple can't use this opportunity and all this kerfluffle?
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.040]   Is that a word?
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:40.920]   Yeah, it can't--
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.680]   To create this ultimate-- you know, take iChat to the next level.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.000]   And we find that it has to have interoperability.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.320]   I mean, that's the one thing that it would have to have is--
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:51.800]   They could do that.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.120]   You can't do-- you can't make it something that you can use everywhere.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.240]   FaceTime is awesome, but as long as all your friends use a Mac--
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:58.240]   Right.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.920]   --on an iPhone and everything else.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.920]   And that's the--
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.000]   What are we going to say?
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.120]   So we see the Android version of FaceTime.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.560]   Then I can believe that until then.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.600]   FaceTime will always be just Apple's private party.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.100]   Yeah.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.600]   And if you could get to a point of just telling everyone again, just like before,
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.120]   you just say you have to use a Mac or you can't talk to me.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.280]   But I just-- even I am not ready to do that.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.840]   So Ron, do you think there's any way-- oh, we lost Ron.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.760]   Hold on.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.200]   Let's go back.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:26.680]   Hold on.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.960]   I was wondering-- I thought-- I was only thinking,
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.320]   Ron has gotten very quiet.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.520]   Ron's waving, hello.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.520]   Hello.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.600]   I don't know.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.960]   I would-- I'm going to say on the Skype side--
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.080]   on the Skype side, I'm going to continue--
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.480]   Well, I just want to say that the Skype just dropped out.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.080]   The whole thing dropped?
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.920]   Yeah, I'm going to continue using Skype.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.520]   And I'm going to continue watching.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.840]   But I'm using-- Alex, you're running iChat and Skype simultaneously, though, right?
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.080]   Aren't you?
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.720]   I mostly use Skype.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.640]   But iChat's not even running.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.600]   I don't use iChat at all.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.440]   I mean, I use FaceTime between phones.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.240]   So if I'm using-- I use FaceTime one time.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.280]   And that was with you.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.320]   I use it with my kids.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.560]   So I use it with my older kids, Aaron Pittsburgh.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.200]   I use it pretty often.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.080]   I'm not always at a Wi-Fi thing, so I can't use it.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.840]   You know, I'm at home a lot.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.760]   I have an office at the house, and then I have this.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.560]   And they have a very fast-- they have a fiber connection,
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.240]   and I have a fast connection.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.240]   And so it's actually really high quality.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.680]   When you have the setups.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.200]   So anyway, it'll be interesting to see
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.560]   whether Microsoft can make this work.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:36.920]   One of the other questions is that Microsoft already has more subscribers
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.160]   with Messenger.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.440]   You know, their Messenger line, I've actually-- technically,
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.680]   has 50% more subscribers.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.800]   Yeah, but how many are you using it?
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.400]   You know, the-- what is it called again?
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:46.800]   What was that?
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   What was that?
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.320]   Protocol.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.320]   Well, no.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.600]   So as Mac users, we say no one's using it.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.680]   But the stats are that more people are actually using Messenger
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.680]   than Skype.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.240]   Like, they actually launch it or it's installed on their machines.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.000]   Yeah, concurrent users, so on, so forth.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.160]   I mean, it's interesting.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.040]   Ron, do you think that-- what does Skype have that Messenger doesn't?
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.920]   Other than everyone that's actually using--
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.680]   Yeah, I think it's the user base and the usability thing.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.000]   I just don't hear about people getting onto Messenger in the same way.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.480]   And granted, like you said, we're all Mac users, so I could be way off base here.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.880]   But it just doesn't seem like it's the same level of usage.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.440]   And use for the same sort of thing.
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.120]   I mean, Skype is the name.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.840]   Even people I know that are--
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.480]   Windows users, Skype is still the communication, the phone tool for them.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.800]   Yeah, you don't hear a lot of people say Messenger me.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.000]   Yeah, that's not usually the way we kind of approach it.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.800]   Also--
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.360]   And can Messenger call a regular phone line?
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.280]   I don't even know if we can do it.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.040]   Definitely cannot.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.200]   So that's definitely--
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.720]   That's a huge difference, because really, that's a lot of my Skype calling is--
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.720]   Skype call.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.880]   I have a lot of trouble with Skype out.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.360]   I just feel like there's an extra delay there that makes everybody confused.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.760]   If it is free or cheap, there's that.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.040]   Well, you could use Google Voice for that, though.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:01.560]   Yes, well--
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.200]   Free and cheap.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:07.200]   I've used-- the main time I've done Skype out is when I'm in Africa and I'm trying to
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.720]   set up some hotel room.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.880]   And when you call, when the person doesn't understand how it's working, it's good.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.920]   So also in the news, Apple is now the number one brand.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.240]   Andy, what does that mean?
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:19.740]   Wow.
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.480]   And it doesn't matter.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.240]   I don't think it really matters to the average consumer.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.640]   It just means all it indicates is that it's not just a nerd brand anymore.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:34.240]   It's not just a niche for people who have a certain expectations out of their technology
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.360]   and their phones.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.640]   It's realized that in this ranking, if they're not being compared to Microsoft and Google
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.680]   and Dell, they're being compared to Coca-Cola and McDonald's and Marlboro.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.120]   When you're kicking the butt of a cigarette company worldwide, that tells you something
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.120]   that you have compelling products and you're telling your story in an effective way.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.160]   So that really shows you the sort of things that other companies are up against when they
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.560]   try to build something that competes with Apple.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.320]   The first hurdle they have to get up against is realizing that Apple has probably defined
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.920]   this space for the entire world.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.680]   And now they have to figure out why would anybody use anything other than an Apple for
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:09.680]   this sort of product.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:16.000]   So Apple's brand now worth $153 billion, according to this.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.440]   People call me a number two at $110 billion.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:26.840]   Fredrik, does this impact anything that Apple does or just simply a measurement of the temperature?
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.520]   Yes, and yes, from my perspective.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:35.120]   I think for me as a Mac user, I look at it as I've been using the Macs since '80s or
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.120]   whatever.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:42.760]   And back then, it was kind of like, oh, you're one of the crazy ones using the Mac.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.760]   These are the misfits.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:49.000]   But now everyone's a misfit, apparently, if they're the largest company in the world.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.160]   Well, not the largest company in the world.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.800]   Well, the most valuable brand.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.360]   Most valuable brand.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.360]   Most valuable brand.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.360]   I guess what I'm saying--
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.800]   What I'm saying is separate from people is this is not-- doesn't mean they're making
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.800]   the most money because they're on.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:07.440]   Yeah, but I guess what I'm saying is that I'm happy as a stockholder, as an Apple fan,
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.040]   whatever I'm happy that they're enjoying all the successes.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:16.000]   And from an intrinsic level, it's kind of like being part of the Rebel Alliance.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.880]   And I feel like they're transforming into the Death Star a little bit here.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.880]   And you can't really go back.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.680]   You have to succeed and succeed means growth.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.600]   I want my X-Wing fighter.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.720]   I don't want to type fighter.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.920]   I'm not buying it.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.920]   You're not buying what?
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.920]   Oh, crew imagine.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.920]   Here we go.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.920]   Most valuable brand thing.
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.840]   I mean, first of all, they don't really give a whole lot of details.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.440]   I was looking at the article on what they used to measure this sort of thing.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.280]   I understand that it's a soft science.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:50.560]   But I think a lot of these organizations have an incentive to do things like put Apple at
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.680]   the top because they know it will get press probably more so than some of these other
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.680]   brands.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.880]   I'm looking at this list and I don't see, for instance, Facebook on the list as a brand.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.360]   Yet, when I was in the middle of nowhere in Venezuela, I could walk into a cyber cafe
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.880]   and there's not a Mac to be found anywhere within a thousand miles where I'm at.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.560]   But everybody's on Facebook.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:17.560]   So I'm curious sort of what the waiting is for this in terms of domestic versus international.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.560]   Isn't this the article?
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.720]   There's no doubt that Apple is a strong brand, but I'm just sort of skeptical that you could
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.640]   really call it the leading brand.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.920]   Keith, what do you think it takes to build a brand like that?
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.920]   I think it takes--
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.920]   I'm going to pull you close to that, Mike, again.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:37.760]   That's Square and has a glowing icon for--
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:44.480]   So everyone who purchases your product walks around with a giant glowing logo of yours.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.480]   It does help, doesn't it?
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.480]   It does help, I think.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.920]   It adds value to have that giant glowing logo.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.480]   For a long time, it looks like down.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.760]   You know, the old black ones.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:57.040]   The old black-- the MacBook, the power box, the little logo was upside down.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.960]   At some point in time, someone realized, oh, most of the time people are looking at it,
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.960]   it's open.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.960]   So you know what brand was missing from that list, though?
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.960]   What?
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.960]   The Shake Weight.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.960]   Shake Weight was not on that list.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.960]   Come on, Alex.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.960]   You know about the Shake Weight.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.960]   I've seen the Shake Weight.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.960]   It took me a second for me to--
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.960]   I'm really excited.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.600]   It tried to be a little worse, yeah, Fred.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.600]   You had to recalibrate to--
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.600]   Yeah, I'm not kidding.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:24.080]   --to-- I'm going to move back to the conversation that we had before.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.400]   So anyway, so-- but it is-- I mean, obviously having it out there, I think also one of the
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:33.480]   things is making-- you know, the level of quality that you know that something is going
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.480]   to be the way it is.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.880]   And I think that kind of-- our next story kind of points towards that, but we'll just
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.440]   hold on one second before we get to that.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.040]   I want to thank one of our sponsors.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:51.720]   So we-- let me-- so anyway, so I want to thank one of our sponsors, Go to Meeting.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:58.160]   Go to Meeting, of course, is-- you know, this is the way to save a little bucks on your
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.160]   flights.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.160]   I fly a lot.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.800]   And while some people would say it's great to travel, it's not that great to travel all
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.800]   the time.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.560]   So, you know, a lot of times you want to meet with people, you want to cover all this information,
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.320]   you want to have that back and forth.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.840]   And Go to Meeting is really just an awesome way to do it.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.880]   We use this every week, almost every day, someone's using it in our office.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.280]   And so it is just a killer process.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.480]   So here's what you can do, of course.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.400]   You can-- you know, it's an easy way to collaborate.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.040]   You don't need them to know anything about it.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.200]   Barely-- it's easier to use than Skype.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.800]   Because you say, "I want to have this person," and you put their email in, and you go,
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.800]   "Boom!"
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.600]   And then they get a little email just to tap on this.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.440]   And when they tap on it, it just pops open and starts to run.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.440]   And now they have your screen.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.440]   They can hear you talk.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.440]   They can go back and forth.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.880]   You can look at what they're doing.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.240]   And all of that stuff becomes just a lot easier to work with.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:49.480]   And it's just-- Go to Meeting is such a great tool to, you know, really save, you know,
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.480]   streamlining your communication.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.880]   So, you know, there's just stuff you can't cover just over the phone.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.120]   And being able to see it all makes a huge difference.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.160]   It really changes the level of productivity.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.880]   You can schedule in advance or on the fly.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.200]   So you can say, "I want to do a meeting way off in the distance and set it up."
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.880]   When we set up ours, you get the-- I get these little emails that remind me, in case
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.360]   I didn't get it into my ICOW, which is great.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.320]   And of course, you can collaborate on files and documents.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.600]   And so it's just-- you can do it on Mac or PC, or both, which we do all the time.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.240]   And it's just really a great way to do it.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.600]   So whether you're doing product reviews or sales presentations, training sessions, all
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.040]   of these things are just a great way to use Go to Meeting.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.640]   It is-- I mean, you were just talking about it.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.640]   Fred was like, "I need to--"
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.640]   "I need to get some people together."
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.640]   And I was like, "I already have a subscription to it."
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.640]   I know, yeah.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.640]   So we're going to definitely--
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.000]   And so it's just a great way to solve all this stuff.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.160]   And if you want to try it, go to go to Meeting.com and use the offer code MAC BREAK for a discount.

[00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.080]   I think you'll find that if you're doing this kind of stuff and you're trying to avoid--
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:05.040]   I mean, a lot of us are all trying to find ways to get more for less because things are
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.040]   tight.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:10.640]   We're trying to find more productivity, boosting operations.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.880]   And this is definitely something that once you start going down this path, you use it
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.880]   all the time.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.880]   It's the future.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.880]   The cloud future.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.440]   I think it's magical in terms of like just-- and yes, I use the word magical.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.440]   But I use it.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:27.640]   I use it in terms of just distance learning and doing that sort of thing because like
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.840]   we were talking about before on this week in photo, we're going to start doing some
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.800]   webcasts or not webcasts, but some webinars and that sort of thing.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.320]   And it just makes it so much easier.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.240]   As we do meetups, you can only get 120 people or so in the room.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:46.240]   But if we do this, we can expose people to our message in the world.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.240]   All of the world.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.000]   And the thing is that as all of these technologies get better, which we're experimenting with
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.120]   lots of these technologies, the big thing is that we're now able to include more people
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.320]   and we're also able to charge less because we've got more people contributing.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:03.160]   And so it just means that information is becoming a lot more accessible.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.720]   So in a way, definitely check it out.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:10.640]   Go to meeting.com and use Macbreak to get 30 days for free.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:17.880]   So as we've talked about, keeping your brand and your quality up is very important.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.800]   And we got a little bit of the inside information from Apple.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.840]   So evidently, Steve, I know that we're all surprised.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:34.000]   It turns out that Steve is a little edgy in internal meetings.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   It turns out, Ron, the thing that I was at, both Ron and Frederick at one point in time
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.680]   worked for the mothership.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.000]   And Ron, did you ever hear any stories about Steve being slightly edgy?
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Oh, never.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.440]   Wait, let me roll my eyes a little bit more.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.640]   Because he was always just like, oh, everything's just fine.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.640]   It's all to be fair.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.520]   I was in with Steve.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.520]   He was perfectly fine.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.080]   And I think that's probably because I was not at the level where--
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.320]   No, where he thought you met.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:13.920]   When you're at the level of the janitor, excuses are fine.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.160]   But when you get to a more senior level, it just doesn't matter about excuses.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.920]   It's your deal, and you've got to fix it.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.160]   So since I was probably closer to the level of janitor than the senior executive level,
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.920]   I didn't yell that personally.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.720]   But yes, I mean, I heard tons of stories.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.600]   The indoctrination or introductory lecture you get from your management when you come
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.600]   there is if you're getting on the airport and on the elevator, and Steve is approaching
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.600]   the elevator, get off.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.240]   Because the last thing you want to be is in the elevator with him.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.240]   Because nothing good can be--
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.240]   Were you in the elevator with him?
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.160]   I've been in the elevator with him several times, and he's always very nice.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.040]   I think those rumors--
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.040]   That's because he likes you.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.000]   Those rumors are greatly exaggerated.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   And maybe the people--
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   There's somebody in the elevator.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.920]   Maybe the person deserved to be fired.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:04.360]   Maybe it was the path of least resistance.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:10.280]   How can possibly be impressed by employees who said, oh my god, I don't want the CEO
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.360]   to know my face or my name.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.360]   Exactly.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.200]   I can't handle 30 seconds of digging in a closed space, but somebody who could fire
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   a few.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.040]   The story was, though, that if you get on an elevator with Steve, he's likely to ask
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.440]   you, so what do you do here?
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:27.040]   And you just have to absolutely make sure you have a very good answer to that question.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.040]   Right.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.040]   Very best, sir.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.040]   Every day.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:38.040]   But, you know, I mean, yes, obviously Steve, it's no secret that Steve has loved and feared
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.760]   without-- throughout the company.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.840]   And yeah, I mean, I certainly heard stories about him getting upset, but this particular
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:48.400]   story we're talking about here, about him getting a bit touchy about the mobile mirror
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.680]   rollout is totally justified because I think it was a horrible thing.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.680]   So, yeah.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.840]   So what happened was, of course, what we're referring to is that--
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:03.160]   this is from a Fortune Magazine article which you have to pay for to actually see somewhere.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.360]   I haven't been able to figure out.
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.560]   I just wanted to download the article.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:09.680]   I would have paid three-- just in case you're wondering, Fortune, if you'd paid-- if I could
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.600]   just buy the article for $3.99, I would have-- I didn't want it on iPad.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.760]   I just wanted it on the web.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:19.000]   Anyway, so anyway, according to this Fortune Magazine article, they were talking about
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   it.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.840]   And basically, Steve asked everyone, can anyone tell me what mobile me is supposed to do?
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:31.240]   And then the team gathered and someone provided a answer.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:35.440]   That would be like as in a group of penguins, when they kick out the first penguin into
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.560]   the water to see if there's something going to eat that one.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.560]   Then, OK, then.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.560]   Exactly.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:47.560]   So one of the wilder females wandered into the grass.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.560]   He was the one that was in--
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.360]   He said, well, the other people would take a step back.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:59.800]   He said, well, it was supposed to do X, Y, and Z. And evidently, Jobs purportedly said,
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.320]   so why the F doesn't do that?
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.760]   And then it went down-- it went further to say that you should all hate each other for
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.720]   having let each other down.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:15.760]   So he was-- so sometimes we wonder whether-- we like when we don't like mobile me and
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.880]   we're frustrated with mobile me.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:21.600]   I think sometimes we wonder, do they really get that it just didn't hit the mark?
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.280]   And the answer is yes.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.280]   Yes.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.280]   They know.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.280]   Yeah, they do.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.920]   And to be fair, it's never hit the mark, even back when it was .Mac.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:35.880]   And I remember it being a source of thrashing back then when I was there.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.720]   And I mean, I even wrote up a really short proposal that they should just turn it into
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.880]   a social networking site.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.400]   And this was pre-Facebook.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:48.480]   Just somehow leverage it so that at least you can get the users that are Apple-- the
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.320]   Apple faithful to use it for something useful because it certainly wasn't working as a file
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.320]   sharing system.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.800]   Andy, do you think they're going to-- this whole report comes out.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.960]   It's mostly giving us an insight.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.080]   But do you think the mobile me is going to get a big refresher?
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.680]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:06.800]   I've always had the impression from mobile me that Apple knew that they would need this
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:11.200]   infrastructure big time at some point for something, but they never really knew exactly
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.520]   for what.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:19.480]   And so they really had to go for the Splundjancer saying that, well, it should have cloud network
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.040]   storage and syncing.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:26.760]   And it should have a relationship between the desktop and mobile devices, but not requiring
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.800]   desktops or mobile devices.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.960]   That should be free, but it can't be free.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:35.000]   So we will charge money for it.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.560]   And meanwhile, they keep pulling out things that actually-- all the features that they
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.320]   decide are actually useful that would make it worth paying money for, they decide that
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:47.480]   no, actually, we do have to pull those out and make those free.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:53.960]   I was-- the only big surprise from that little story was that Steve felt that strongly about
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.360]   mobile me to begin with, because certainly you never get that-- for something that this
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:03.480]   isn't like the ink handwriting system, where at some point there was a little release and
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:07.800]   a little announcement where there was, OK, now there's some sort of ink input system in
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.240]   the OS, but it was allowed to simply-- it was just an announcement just allowed to sort
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.400]   of go away.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:19.520]   Mobile me was this big event with a big keynote presentation and darken stage and people nervous
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.720]   on stage demonstrating this sort of stuff.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.080]   This tend to indicate that there was a lot of faith and a lot of promise in what it was
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.120]   going to do, but they just never pulled it all together like that.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.240]   So that's why I always thought that it was the unspoken hobby of Apple.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:36.000]   Apple TV was the instantly direct hobby of Apple.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.880]   Mobile me was just going to be just going to be ready so that when they did finally pull
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.800]   all those components together, they'd have everything in place to actually get-- pull
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.800]   the record.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:49.080]   I'm just surprised that something that's important would allow to just-- faster to the
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.640]   point where you wind up shrieking at people in a conference room.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.560]   Well, and I have to admit that I use Mobile me a lot.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:58.800]   I mean, I complain about it almost as much as I use it, but I also have--
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.800]   What?
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.800]   I'm interested for what?
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:01.800]   What do I use it for?
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.800]   I use my Mobile me account a lot for the biggest thing I use it for is I upload it to
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.160]   upload-- it's really easy for me to upload photos from Aperture and I don't have to think
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.160]   about it.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:14.040]   And I like the infrastructure there where everything's totally-- because I use Aperture for all
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.000]   of my photo stuff.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.560]   I use iPhoto on the road and Aperture at home and then I import the iPhoto stuff into the
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.560]   Aperture.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.280]   And the reason I do that is mostly because I like to keep track of how both applications
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.840]   are working.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.320]   But what I love is that integration with Aperture where I just say, "Make a mobile--"
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.360]   I create a little album and then say, "Make a mobile me," and then I have all of it up
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.840]   there and I've had.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.440]   And I know that there's lots of professional ways of doing that and I found that that's
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.440]   just really easy.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.640]   It's easy for me.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.280]   It's easy for my clients to want to grab a bunch of stuff.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.680]   Andy, we were going to say.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.040]   No, it's wrong.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.440]   I think that the way you use it exactly points to what the problem was with it and that it
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.560]   was always treated like one of the applications that was available.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.840]   It was treated about to the level of an iPhoto or something where it was an app but it wasn't
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.560]   a core infrastructure kind of thing.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:09.080]   I think that's really where Apple is starting to realize that it's got to be deep deep into
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.080]   the OS.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.360]   It's got to be into the genetic material.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:16.320]   It's got to be something that really threads between the different platforms that Apple
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.320]   supports.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.320]   And I don't think it was ever that.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.600]   It was always just sort of an application that had-- and I know that was the way the
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:26.040]   team was structured and the marketing team was sort of this side thing, not a core piece
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.040]   of the OS.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:31.400]   I have to admit that what makes it work and what makes it sticky for me is specifically
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:36.040]   the fact that it is integrated with so many of the applications now that I use.
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.120]   Being able to upload stuff or move stuff around.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.880]   You're talking specifically about file sharing.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.440]   So I use Dropbox.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.360]   And Dropbox has been rock solid for all this stuff.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:52.240]   See, I don't use Dropbox because you're a super user and you have terabyte files that
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.240]   you're transferring.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.960]   The reason I don't use Dropbox is because I share it with other people and other people
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.440]   put a bunch of stuff in it and they fill up my hard go.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.400]   Things like that could be fixed.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:06.680]   But just the rock solidness of the app and how it works, isn't that how I just should
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.680]   work?
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.960]   And if I just work like that, then I'd be happy paying that money.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:14.240]   You know, that might even be an insight into the best what we're Apple screwed up.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.280]   Where they call-- this had this thing called Mobile Me, which could mean anything and doesn't
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.680]   really communicate itself.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.440]   If they simply said we have this thing called I-Disk and there's this-- a separate thing
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:27.360]   that they're not going to talk about anything else but I-Disk, we were giving you a network
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.400]   hard drive that works over the internet.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.280]   Put it into your I-Disk, you have it available on every single machine.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.200]   Done out release-- release people from the room.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.200]   Then maybe a week later, you talk about this-- this thing called galleries and sharing.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.600]   Then maybe later on, you talk about the syncing features.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:47.120]   One of the reasons why Dropbox worked out so well is because all it is is one folder
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:51.520]   on all of your machines and in the cloud that synchronizes automatically.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.840]   Put it one place, it's suddenly everywhere.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.280]   Done and the press release.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.160]   Then you switch.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.920]   Mobile Me, again, my biggest problem with it has always been what's the story.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.920]   Why do you need to create this app?
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.840]   Admittedly, one of the things is that it is-- it's just hard to do.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.760]   Do it making these things work.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:18.560]   I mean, the notes went out to all the-- everyone here via email because I couldn't log on to
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.600]   Google Docs for some reason.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.480]   I've logged on yesterday, can't log on today.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.480]   All of this stuff can be difficult.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:34.080]   Now the question, Keith, is do you-- Steve's seen as intense, but do you have to be that
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.800]   intense to get the kind of quality that Apple gets consistently?
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.240]   Not a mobile me, obviously, but in many other things.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.240]   I don't know.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:49.200]   Steve Bulma is intense with these chair throwing antics and so forth, but does he get the same
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.200]   results?
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.680]   I don't know.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.280]   Well, I guess you'd have to have vision and intensity.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:01.240]   In this case, I think any mobile me user would have said the same words.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.560]   Your experience has been good, but OK, maybe not anyone.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.560]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.000]   I'm not saying that my experience has been good.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.320]   So I am very frustrated with mobile me.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.000]   I use it all the time.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.360]   I don't like Skype either, but here we are.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.760]   We're on Skype at the moment.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:23.000]   I feel like there are some things that I have that I really just go, this is a great
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.640]   item by itself and it's perfect the way it is.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.280]   And there's a lot of things that I just use because I can't find it better.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.280]   I think you just need to care as much.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:38.680]   I don't know Steve or anything, but you get the impression that he cares.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:45.040]   Sometimes he cares like a parent tailing off the child who doing the wrong thing or
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.040]   something like that.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:51.080]   Yeah, I mean, and one of the things that's interesting is that they are working, it
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:55.720]   appears to be that they're working pretty hard on institutionalizing Steve.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.680]   I don't mean that that.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.680]   Really?
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.680]   So institutionalizing like in Apple.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.680]   Is that what that happened?
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.680]   Yeah, yeah, let's know.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:07.800]   No, no, they're working on institutionalizing his idea, his approach, everything in the
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   Apple.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.800]   So they've been doing research on it.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.920]   That's the other thing that's in this article is that they've been doing research on it.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:18.840]   They have been figuring out like what are those key things that Apple has done that have
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.480]   been successful to make sure that even after...
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.320]   So that's kind of like how do you capture lightning in a bottle?
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.320]   Good luck.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.520]   Yeah, and that's the issue.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.520]   It's hard to just replace...
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.520]   It is, but I think it's a really interesting little thing.
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.520]   And I had not heard of this.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.680]   It wasn't something that I was familiar with, but I've seen it at other companies.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.280]   And it's the idea that you build up a set of...
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.960]   Really, they're setting up a university for what's...
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.960]   How does Apple think?
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:51.000]   But they set up a series of case studies of here's a problem or here's a situation.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.600]   And then here's how Apple dealt with it.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.520]   This is a good example of how Apple deals with things.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:00.920]   And it makes a lot of sense that if you have a repository of that kind of knowledge, then
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:05.040]   you can bring people in from the outside and get them to go through it and get a much quicker
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.400]   understanding of the way the company thinks.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.920]   Because every company does have a unique corporate culture.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.680]   And Apple is very unique, as is.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.560]   I more recently have worked for Amazon.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:19.040]   They have an extremely unique and extremely different corporate culture from Apple.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:23.960]   And they do the same sort of thing where they have sort of examples of here's the way that
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.400]   Amazon thinks about things.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.920]   So I don't think this is anything particularly surprising.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.680]   And I can totally see why they would want to do it.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:35.960]   So we'll see if MobileMe gets any better and we'll see if Steve gets any more intense.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:40.960]   But is anything that Steve said, or allegedly said, is anything that we all haven't been
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:41.960]   saying?
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.440]   No, here's the funny thing about this.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:53.160]   Because Steve, most of the time when I hear tirades, you hear the rumors.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:58.400]   About 80%, 90% of my go, "Yeah, that's what I was thinking, except not at the top of my
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.400]   lungs."
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:05.440]   Well, and also you never hear stories about how Steve went on a bomb scare because there's
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.840]   too much cinnamon in his latte.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:12.120]   It's always, here's something that's making Apple look really, really bad.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.880]   And I'm going to make you feel very, very bad about yourself as a result of this because
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.040]   you're responsible for this.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.160]   And that's how you end up with a brand that's 153,000,000.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.160]   Exactly.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.160]   Exactly.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:25.280]   Like the guy in the elevator, I stand by my statement.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.880]   Maybe he deserved to be like, "He's going to come here."
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.880]   I mean, post a lot of you.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.880]   That's not me.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.880]   I never worked there.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:33.880]   No, never.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.880]   So I understand you had free snacks.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:41.960]   I have it worked just as I got dressed down by that mean man in the turtleneck spooker.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.160]   I asked him what his name was.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.720]   He fired me.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:52.480]   So also, this is, as Apple works through all these updates, one of the rumors, we're going
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.480]   to pull out the rumor mill.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:58.360]   We need to have a rumor mill, like a little graphic in the rumor mill.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:03.040]   Apple possibly porting all of their machines or some of their machines or more machines
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.760]   than their iPhone and iPads to ARM processors.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.640]   Andy, does this dog hunt?
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.000]   I don't think so.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.360]   The basis for this would be that Apple has always been about CPU independence.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.080]   If they wanted to make that switch, it wouldn't be that difficult to do it.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.680]   Both from, they have the infrastructure so that they could just simply rebuild code to
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.640]   spit out pretty much whatever they want.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.280]   Also they have enough control over the developers that they would pretty much get everybody
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.920]   in line within about a year.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:35.400]   But Intel has a couple of new technologies that are kind of nice, but Apple has so much
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:40.200]   invested in their own technologies right now that unless Intel can tell Apple that here
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:45.320]   is how much less power we can, that our CPUs would produce than what you're using right
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:50.880]   now, or here are actual hard features that you could do with our chip that you could
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.360]   not do with that other person, there's no way they'd ever do that.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:58.320]   Well, but here's the question though, is it would it be easier to move to iOS or a more
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.320]   iOS like OS?
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:03.080]   Can I say that 10 times fast?
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.960]   Would it be easier to do that if you were using ARM processors as opposed to Intel?
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.200]   Now I don't think that, I think the big issue with the ARM processor is that it's not going
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.240]   to be powerful enough for a lot of power users.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:18.240]   But the question is, I have this little 11-inch case.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.480]   Do you like this case?
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.160]   I'm going to talk about that later.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:28.080]   Anyway, but I have this little 11-inch and I don't expect it to do very much.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.080]   I don't have, maybe I could put Final Cut on it, but I don't try.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:37.240]   I have a 17-inch that I use that I'm using for work work, and then I have this little
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.960]   guy that I just kind of wander around with.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:43.200]   I like that that's not doing very much these days.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.560]   Maybe I'll edit a full motion.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.280]   No, no, no, no, I'm saying I don't use it for Final Cut.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.280]   I don't think that I can.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.280]   Oh yeah, maybe I'll read it.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.240]   But maybe, maybe, the fact that you could do that.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.240]   Yeah, I think that they...
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:56.680]   So now the question is, Keith, is the...
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.880]   We're seeing this progression and you're a developer.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.280]   I hang around with those.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.160]   You hang around with developers.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.160]   Do you see...
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.160]   We've talked a lot about this on the show.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:06.160]   Do you see this inevitable push?
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.200]   I mean, is iOS 11 really...
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:15.160]   Or is OS 10 11 or OS 11 really just going to be iOS 6?
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.160]   Sure.
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:22.000]   Do you think that's the trajectory we're going or do you think that we're still going to
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   stay formed?
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:30.120]   Let me make something...
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:35.120]   It's a little bit of a cognizant here.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.400]   Yeah, I think Steve's right with the trucks.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.320]   We're going to be the truck drivers.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.040]   There will always be special tools like the mouse,
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.520]   whereas most people will be touch computing.
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:54.000]   I think that just the success of that has proven how right they are in realizing
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.800]   that the biggest challenge for most people is not the power of the processor,
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:05.560]   or the flexibility of the software, but how quickly can someone get their hands into it?
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.560]   Right.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:13.320]   And commercially, I can only see them doing more and more of...
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:24.360]   If not a total kind of conglomeration OS, then at least Mac OS would be more and more
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.360]   specialized.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:31.480]   But I do think you have to separate the processor from the OS question here.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:37.440]   And whether they go with ARM or not, it smells to me like it's probably more as much as anything,
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:42.560]   something they're considering, maybe even a negotiating ploy.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:47.840]   It's clear that they are going to be maintaining operating systems on both platforms for at
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:52.360]   least some time, and they've got to have developed reasonable platform independence.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:55.360]   And it's interesting that even Windows now runs on...
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.720]   Windows 8 runs on these ARM processors.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:03.960]   And for that matter, ARM is a licenseable architecture, so Intel has even licensed ARM
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.240]   in the past for doing certain things.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:13.680]   And one of the other news items is that possibly that you're actually going to see Intel building
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.520]   the ARM processors, theoretically, for Apple.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.520]   Right.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.520]   And I think that's...
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.440]   When I first read this, my question was, "How are they just going to give up on dual booting
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.960]   or being able to boot Windows on the Mac?"
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.640]   But it sounds like with Windows 8, at least, that still would be a possibility.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:34.160]   I think it's really going to be one of those things where they'll be monitoring the roadmap
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:38.000]   of both processors and just have to make a decision down the road.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:45.040]   What's the sort of price versus power consumption versus processor speed trade-off between those?
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.960]   And as long as they have something that's reasonably independent in terms of the operating
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.760]   system running on top of it, I think it'll totally boil down to it.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:56.800]   Okay, this device is going to be the low-power device that has a 12-hour battery life, and
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:02.600]   yeah, maybe it doesn't run as much high-end applications, whereas this thing is going to
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.640]   be more of the workhorse, and we know it's going to be a battery sucked, but most people
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.800]   haven't plugged in most of the time anyway.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.360]   I think it's going to be something where it's going to be less and less of a concern what
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:16.360]   the processor is behind it, or at least it'll be sort of transparent at the developer level.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.360]   Right.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.240]   So, yeah, you're going to say, Fred, Fred?
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.920]   No, no, I was going to say I agree with Ron.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:21.920]   I think it's purpose-built.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.720]   It's just like you and your Mac look air-man.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:28.000]   Well, so when I look at my air, I go, I could, you know, I mean, the only reason I use my
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.200]   air instead of my iPad a lot of times is I still need the keyboard, you know?
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:38.880]   And I saw one of the guys, I saw a guy with one of those, I guess at Brookstone, they have
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:43.840]   one of those, it's a case, but it has a keyboard built into it for the iPad slide your iPad
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.360]   in and I walked up to a guy at the airport, I just, you know, Apple users, you know, we
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.160]   just kind of walk up and start asking questions.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.520]   You know, you know, it's just like one of those, like, you're in the club and so we can talk
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.160]   to you and he said they're working away and I walked up and I said, so what do you think
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.160]   of this?
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.160]   And he's like, it's okay.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.560]   You know, it's like it's not quite.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:01.640]   And so for me, if I'm going through my email, I still feel like I kind of need my keyboard.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.840]   But you never use the Oregon, New York station?
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:06.840]   The Oregon, New York station?
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.840]   It's from in case.
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:10.280]   It's I think it was my pick a few weeks ago.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.800]   Maybe you weren't here.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:15.880]   I've ever since like week number two of having the iPad.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:19.480]   I've always known that the Apple wireless keyboard is the killer accessories for it.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:24.080]   And in case made this really great little folio case that you think that it's just a
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:29.240]   nice little wrap around simple little Velcro wrap around case for the wireless keyboard.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.920]   But then you fold it back.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:34.800]   It turns into an easel stand that lets you actually type with a thing in your lap.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:39.240]   That's the reason why I'm like, here's why I'm spending three days without a computer.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:45.000]   And the second reason is the second reason I don't use it as much as my iPad for all
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.360]   of my email is that I get too much email.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.800]   And the one thing about the iOS, both the iPad and the iPhone is if you get more than
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   200 emails a day, it doesn't work.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.840]   Like the way it caches and all the other stuff.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.240]   It's just not like it's you need something sucking that all off.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.240]   Otherwise you just can't.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.680]   Well, they're not really designed as primary email management machines.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.680]   Like they should be.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:05.680]   I mean, because that's what I want to do.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:09.080]   I want to walk around with my iPad and be able to answer, you know, to answer questions
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:10.080]   and everything else.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.080]   But it's just way too common.
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.080]   It's not there yet.
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.080]   It's not.
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:14.280]   You know, you can't really.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.360]   If you're an occasional email, I mean, when I say occasional, if you get less than 100
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.760]   emails a day, you know, it's fine.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.480]   But once you go over that, it just starts to over 200.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.000]   It's constantly caching and it's constantly not bringing everything down.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   I'm doing all that.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.600]   I'm doing main email on a real machine.
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:30.600]   Exactly.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:34.160]   And in the field, emergency email with my thumb on the iPhone.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.680]   And if I have time and I'll read the book on the iPad and I'm like, oh, you know what?
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:41.520]   Let me see if I got that message from so and so, then I can pop an email and look at it.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:46.560]   But I'm not doing primary responding and emailing and writing things on the iPad.
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:51.440]   I'm consuming mostly, even though I can create an iPad, I don't do it that much.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.440]   Right.
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:57.400]   So it'll be interesting to see whether the arm continues to move forward.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.280]   And we've got some other things about where Apple might put some of their money.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.480]   All those billions that they've been saving up, billions and billions of dollars.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.680]   They might be making some acquisitions here.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:12.360]   But before we get to that, I want to thank one of our other sponsors, Carbonite.com.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:17.720]   And the thing about Carbonite is, no matter what you're using here, being able to back
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:22.120]   up and back up to the cloud is really important.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:26.880]   It is one of those things that a lot of people, a lot of us don't do it.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:31.200]   But the reality is that eventually something bad is going to happen to your laptop.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.240]   It's going to happen to your desktop.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.040]   It's going to happen to your iMac, your Mac mini or whatever it is.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.400]   It's going to be a drive that goes down.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.840]   There's going to be a fire.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.080]   There's going to be a theft.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.080]   We had it.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.960]   And by specifically, I have a story about this.
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:51.360]   And Alutha, who works in our office, he's moving to Petaluma because we moved the whole
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:52.360]   studio.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.360]   So he moved along.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:55.440]   He was adventurous enough to come up here.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.040]   And he's really, really enjoying Petaluma.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.440]   But he had moved everything out of his apartment.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:08.520]   And the only two things that he left in the apartment to go do some laundry was his Mac
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:11.920]   and his iPad and the apartment building burned down.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:12.920]   It wasn't him.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:13.920]   He didn't do it.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:14.920]   But the apartment building burned down.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.920]   And this is the kind of stuff you don't think about.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.880]   You know, like, and he wasn't using carbonite.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:22.640]   So now we're like patching back together, you know, and it was like one of those things
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.880]   like you picked up the iPad and when you push on it, there's little bubbles and stuff like
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.080]   it didn't get burned.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.640]   It just got soaked.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.200]   So, but that's the kind of stuff that's the reason you can't have everything.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.600]   It doesn't matter whether you have a Drobo or a backup system on site or whatever.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.520]   You got to be able to put it somewhere else.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.640]   And things like carbonite is just a great way to do that.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.200]   So it's, you know, one of the big things is it's easy to use.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.920]   Even if you're a computer novice, you can totally set it up.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:46.920]   It's automatic.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.920]   So you just set this up like, I just want this to back up.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.240]   I just want to get this stuff up to the cloud.
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.520]   You can get back your files in just a couple of clicks.
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:57.120]   So it's easy to get those files back when you need them.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:00.120]   You can, you know, because it's off site, you know, you can get it from any computer.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:04.080]   So whether you can even use your iPhone or BlackBerry with their free apps.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.280]   And so you can get that data that data is now available anywhere.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.440]   And I've gotten to the point where I have so many little, so many different computers
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:15.400]   that I'm sitting down in front of, having that data accessible from anywhere becomes
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.080]   more and more important.
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:21.200]   So if you have to back up, you know, and get it from wherever carbonite is a great way
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.680]   to, great thing to look at.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:28.680]   And it's unlimited backup, unlimited backup for your PC or Mac for $59 a year.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:35.960]   So if you want to try, try going to carbonite.com and use the offer code, you know, Mac break.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.160]   So Alex, Alex, unlimited backup.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:44.240]   So I'm curious approximately how much data do you have up there knowing how much you
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.720]   create on a weekly basis.
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:46.960]   Are you stressing their servers?
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.600]   Do they have a farm just for you?
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:55.000]   So I turn my computer on, everything just goes, oh, you know, so the, well, I was, I was
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.920]   looking at my Drobo and thinking that it was like, I'm only going to be able to fit 15
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:49:59.920]   terabytes in there.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:00.920]   I don't know what to do.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:04.160]   So anyway, so the other thing you have to worry about though, on those things, of course,
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.480]   you got to pay attention to your bandwidth.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.920]   It's not really the, you know, that it's really the bandwidth there.
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.840]   But the, but carbonite.com is a great way to make sure that your most important things.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.920]   And the way I look at it is I don't try to back up everything.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.760]   That's not my, it's not how I focus on it.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:21.480]   What I do is I back up the things that I can't afford to lose.
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.960]   So the important documents, the contracts, the, you know, all those other pieces.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:30.160]   I also back up my, you know, the photos of my kids and the, and the key PR photos and
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.160]   all those things.
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.000]   Those are the things that I'm putting on carbonite.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   I'm not putting on everything.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.440]   I had this experience two months ago, one month ago.
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:44.640]   A friend of the family, the drive, drives just die.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:45.640]   You know, how drives just die.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:46.640]   It's just what they do.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.200]   And they dive all of a sudden.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.840]   And then, yeah, and it's always all of a sudden.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.080]   It's never, yeah, it's not like, oh, it's going slow.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.600]   It's just, it's not working.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.240]   And they come to you, of course.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.200]   They're like, my computer stopped working.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.200]   Why?
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.360]   And you, you see the sad Mac come up.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.600]   And then they're, you know, then you feel responsible.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.840]   You as a representative of the computing nation.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:11.160]   And then this person has said, well, how do I get my photos back in my movies?
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:16.000]   And I, you know, we ended up going to somebody who did drive, oh, specialty stuff.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   So very lucky, but, and very expensive.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.440]   And I was going to say, a little extortion later, you had data.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:25.840]   Got a bit lucky there, but you know, that was just totally unusual.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:27.000]   It could have ended so badly.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   And it often does.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.960]   So it's like, not just for yourself, like, it's kind of a geek insurance.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:37.320]   So, so you don't have to suffer the wrath of your family and friends going, how could
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:39.760]   you computing people let this happen to me?
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:44.120]   You have for not much money, you can rest easy at night.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:47.840]   Carbonite.com and the coupon code is actbreak.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:52.880]   So also we've got, this is Apple, of course, has, they've got some money.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.000]   And you know, they, they could make big purchases if they wanted to.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Bosscott.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   What?
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   Bosscott.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   I don't know.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.560]   Also just got sold for maybe twice as much as it was worth.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:09.960]   So anyway, maybe maybe maybe $8 billion more than it was going to save twice as much.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:10.960]   That's aggressive.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:17.120]   So anyway, the Apple, of course, some of the rumors are that Apple will either partner
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.720]   or purchase a nuance.
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:23.360]   Now nuance, of course, is the owner of Dragon Software.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.720]   Now Dragon Software has been around since the day.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:27.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:28.720]   Back in the day, it's been like, I think.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.520]   Since there were dragons apparently.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:35.760]   So these guys have been around and they basically have put together the bet.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:40.480]   It is really the most robust voice recognition system in the world.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:48.360]   So they, if it's really working, I have a lot of problems with my arms, you know, RSI issues
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:52.120]   that don't go once you get some of them, they don't really go away.
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:57.040]   And so I can only type a certain amount before I kind of burn up in the atmosphere.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:02.960]   And so I use a lot of different voice activated and I use the IBM one, I used all these other
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:06.680]   ones and I kept on getting excited about one after the other.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.840]   And nothing worked until I was using the new one stuff.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:15.720]   So it was, now, if you get a long email from me and it has a couple weird things in it,
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.680]   you'll find that that was all done with Dragon.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:19.680]   It's amazing.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.360]   So anyway, it's just a great piece of software.
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:24.560]   Now, of course, it's a great engine that drives stuff.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:27.520]   That's the thing is it's not just what they have that's valuable.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:31.520]   It's not really the, I mean, the end product is great.
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:36.040]   But what really what's valuable is that voice engine, that the ability to identify that.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:42.120]   And so the question is, is what are, you know, whether Apple, you know, I think Apple, you
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:43.320]   know, would want to try to buy it.
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.440]   But the question is, would they want to sell Andy?
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.280]   What do you think sell or partner?
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:50.520]   I would say if they could buy it, they could just buy them out.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.520]   Right.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.520]   That'd be great.
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:56.480]   Remember this is the company that bought Mac speech last year was the year before.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.240]   So they're already pretty well integrated with the Mac community.
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:04.320]   But if there's one huge, huge, just advantage to iOS over, over Android, it's definitely
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:05.320]   speech recognition.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:09.560]   I mean, every time that I eat my dog food whenever I'm testing out one of these phones
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:10.800]   to review.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:14.720]   And whenever I I'll spend like a week just immersive with this new phone with a new operating
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:15.720]   system.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:20.360]   And when I go back to iOS, the only thing I miss is the ability to simply reach up, tap
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:25.320]   that button and say navigate to comic books near here.
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.400]   And it will find me a comic book store near here.
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.840]   I tap one button and it'll navigate right there.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:33.160]   That's not just dial Bob.
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:36.760]   Did you say Sally?
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:37.760]   Exactly.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:38.760]   Bob.
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:46.560]   What I'm telling Sally, why doesn't you know the one one piece of speech recognition
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:52.480]   I would like to have on my my iPhone is for whenever I say dial Bob and it says dialing
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:57.240]   Sally, these are recognized me saying no.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:01.480]   And Sally is that girlfriend that I dated, you know, it's like a month ago and she's
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:02.480]   insane.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:05.080]   I wanted to say, you know, and I can't tell when you're telling me I've been like fumbling
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.800]   for the phone trying to hit the stop.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:07.800]   Don't dial that.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:08.800]   Stop dialing.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:09.800]   I think I'll always think about it.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:18.880]   I have to believe that the next major release of iOS is going to be heavily weighted towards
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:20.400]   voice dialing because Andy's right.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:24.640]   It's so much better on the Google devices and I just get annoyed every time I'm in the
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:28.680]   phone in the car with somebody who's using their Google phone and it's just working so
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:34.400]   nicely and it really is just terribly, terribly unusable on the iPhone.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:39.800]   And I think I'm sure Apple would love to buy nuance but everything I'm reading kind of
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.120]   indicates that it may not be possible.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:45.280]   It is going to be a really expensive thing to do.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.200]   You know, nuance, they're a public company so that makes it a little more complicated.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:51.920]   It means that they have to kind of want to be bought in some ways.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.680]   But expensive for Apple?
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:56.560]   Just because you know, nuance doesn't necessarily need it.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:59.960]   I mean, you know, you talked about drag and dictate and that's one of nuance's products
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:03.640]   that sort of their consumer facing product and instantly for people that haven't loaded
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:07.120]   that onto their iPhone they should because I use them all the time for like typing text
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:09.480]   messages when I'm driving or something.
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.480]   But I mean, that's a piece of what they do.
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:12.800]   But they're integrated into a lot of stuff.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:19.240]   You know, most voice recognition in your car or in automobiles is powered by nuance.
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:22.280]   They have industrial applications, you know, factory floor stuff.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.840]   So they're all over the place.
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:27.360]   The key thing about nuances is they have a lot of patents really locked up.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:28.360]   So right.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:30.440]   And that's really the value there.
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:36.240]   And I think that nuance probably wants to remain independent in a lot of ways because
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:42.400]   they see that their market has potentially be far bigger in the future than what's moving
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.400]   towards them, right?
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.400]   Mm hmm.
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:48.320]   That's the big thing is the market, the market now is moving towards wanting more and more
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.320]   voice activation.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.320]   Easier and easier.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.600]   What would be the advantage of Apple buying them?
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.200]   I mean, other than hey, these are all of them.
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:59.000]   Yeah, these are all of our marbles and Google you can't play with them.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.600]   I mean, is that the main thing or is it just they can they can do business development
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:07.680]   deals all day and levers the technology and make cool software and integrate it, you know,
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:09.040]   and not buy the company.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:13.040]   Why would they need to spend all that money to buy the company if not just to protect the
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.040]   IP?
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.040]   Why would they buy the company?
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.040]   It's just a department.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:17.040]   What do you think?
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:20.640]   I think they might be able to do something better than the current interface with that
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.640]   engine.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:25.120]   Like I look at, but they need to buy it to do that.
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:28.880]   If they want the engine, I think they do.
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:32.680]   And I mean, one of the hard things is if you're looking at iOS and you're looking at trying
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:36.120]   to do that, one of the challenges of course, so the reason that the little weird thing
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:39.800]   about dragging dictate on your iPhone is is that you're, you say something into it and
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:43.760]   then it uploads it to the mothership and then it downloads it back as text.
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.080]   But it does it fast.
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:50.080]   It does it fast, but there are some agencies and companies that would prefer not to use
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:56.320]   a cloud to, would prefer to keep all the text on the phone.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:02.200]   And that becomes one of the challenges, but it does sound like if you had a big data center
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:06.080]   and you put something like that in there, it would allow a lot of processing to go on.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.080]   But do you think that they would need to own it to do that?
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:12.880]   I mean, could they license just the engine, license the whole engine, license use, I mean,
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:16.520]   pay them half a billion dollars to license the engine for everything that Apple does?
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:18.600]   They could, but I do like the patents argument.
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:23.200]   They do like to kind of own the patent space.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:27.520]   And that seems to be how these big organizations work.
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:31.680]   So we'll see how that goes.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.040]   It's an interesting process.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:36.560]   It's something that I thought, I had a blog post that I was kind of on and off working
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:39.760]   on trying to figure out and kept on saying like what Apple should do with its billions
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.280]   and one of them was buy new ones.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:46.040]   Like just spend 10 billion dollars and buy the thing because it's just such a big thing.
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:51.720]   And it's important to people like me because if I pick up my phone and say, you know,
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:56.200]   my iPhone and I say call Carlita, which is my wife, I always get calling Callie and
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.200]   Callie Lewis.
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.200]   I call you.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:59.200]   Call me.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.200]   Call me.
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.200]   Call me.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:02.200]   Carlita, these are phone wire.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.200]   All these calls to Callie Lewis.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.200]   I was really trying to call you.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   I was really trying to call you.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:14.240]   So anyway, so we'll, you know, it would really help me a lot if Apple simply move your
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:15.240]   marriage.
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:17.240]   It would be an improvement to my marriage.
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:23.160]   So anyway, you know what the seek just so you know, the secret to not having that happen,
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:27.400]   just put in more than one phone number for a Cali Lewis and at least then it will ask
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:32.120]   you which one you should use mobile or and then you have that bail out strategy where
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.240]   you're like, no, no, no.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.240]   Exactly.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:38.840]   It's your Alex Lindsey back break tip of the week to avoid accidentally calling Cali
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:43.000]   Lewis and jeopardizing your marriage, but double entries for that.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.480]   You're a source of knowledge here.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:49.320]   And anybody else that you're supposed boyfriend or girlfriend might be threatened by.
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:51.320]   I'll be back after this.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:53.040]   So that's what you grew up.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:58.200]   Does anyone want to say anything about the Amazon cloud player other than everybody?
[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.200]   I haven't played with it.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.520]   Andy, have you played with it?
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.440]   Yeah, I like a lot.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:07.280]   It really already I was really just right on the fence between do I want to buy stuff
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.480]   by Amazon or do I want to buy music by iTunes.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:15.000]   And that was just enough to just tip me over into just defaulting to purchasing things
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.360]   by Amazon because you buy something and not only is it in your iTunes library, but it's
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:23.760]   also in a cloud server cloud player that you can access from everywhere.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.520]   And that's a really nice little trick.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:33.160]   The update only it allows it allows playback on iOS devices rest rest so we go it could
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.160]   play it.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:41.040]   I know I can't say that you can't play it on your iPad.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:48.440]   But I don't want to say yes, but I can't to OK, yes, it's not a great player.
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:53.200]   It's not equity with the Android app that you actually get that really turns you into
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.640]   having a really good media player that's integrated with the cloud.
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.000]   But at least now you don't have to like download the track and use the built in quick look
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.320]   feature of the operating system back to get playback.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.680]   Now you can actually again sort of clumsily, but you can least tap on a playlist and say
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:12.120]   yes, please play this entire playlist or play this entire album start to finish.
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:16.360]   So this is I'm way more impressed with what Amazon's doing with cloud music stores than
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:20.600]   anything that that Google announced at their Android conference today.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:25.120]   Ron, it sounds like Amazon is also looking at a color Kindle.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.920]   Do you think this is really going to make a difference for iPad users?
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:32.720]   Oh, you know, the color Kindle has been talked about for a while.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:37.120]   And I don't think it's going to be an iPad competitor, but I could see having I think
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:42.520]   you should look at a color Kindle is more like, you know, fitting into that niche of
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:45.760]   a magazine that you carry around the same way that you carry a Kindle around as a book
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.760]   right now.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.000]   If it could just have more, you know, have a color to it, then it would be more like the
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.400]   magazine you'd carry around.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.760]   And it just needs to stay at that price point where you're willing to have both because
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:01.000]   I, you know, I think the distinction is always going to be, does it play videos and have
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.520]   extreme interactivity?
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:07.480]   Or is it going to be something that's a little bit more of a just a kind of a passive device?
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:10.320]   I think that's probably the distinction you'd see there.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:14.720]   I just can't imagine my sign using a Kindle, a color Kindle or a Kindle period.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.960]   You just be a little confused.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:17.960]   And that's when I look at it though.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:23.000]   I mean, I look at I when I think about where the meat of the market is now, I oftentimes
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   I'm thinking about what are my parents, what I see my parents using, what I see my kids
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   using.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.280]   I don't really think like my son now walks up to my computers in my office, which I try
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.560]   to avoid, but he just goes up and touches the screen like he's expecting like when I
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:37.960]   touch this big 30 inch monitor, it's going to do something.
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.960]   Being conditioned.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.960]   It doesn't do anything.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:43.040]   So I realize he's going to grow up and not every using a mouse.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.360]   I want less devices Alex.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:49.560]   I don't like a color Kindle is great, but you know, I've got my little ecosystem going
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.440]   on and what's not the danger though?
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:56.080]   I mean, it's once you get into that ecosystem, it becomes difficult to get out of it.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:00.040]   I feel like I'm I'm devised out and all I have are Apple products.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:04.400]   You know, I mean, it's like, I don't want I have an iPhone, my iPad, my 11 inch and my
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.080]   17 inch and I'm just, but it's it's it's my point.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.680]   But at some point it becomes about what you have to get done, you know, who cares if you're
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.680]   using a Mac, a Windows machine, a Android machine or whatever.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:18.680]   Once you have your little concoction of devices that let you get what you want to get done
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.440]   fluidly and with the path of least resistance, it's hard to break out of that.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:26.680]   It's like, okay, why would I want to introduce another device into this flow?
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.640]   And I'm trying to figure that becomes this one of the things because I really want an
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.440]   Android for some things, you know, but I'm not sure if I really want an Android enough
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.120]   to to add another thing to my bag.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:38.360]   You know, that's the, you know, and it's mostly what for me to charge.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:44.760]   I mean, what what what for me, a lot of that is I want 4G.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.640]   I realize it's not so much the Android that I want.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.680]   I just want faster, a faster connection than what I'm getting.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:53.520]   I've seen a couple examples now and that's more, you know, so once that's handled on the
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.080]   Mac side, I'll be less.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:04:00.240]   But, you know, I mean, going back to the cloud player thing, I am curious.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:04.160]   I don't find myself using that just because my connection never seems to be good enough
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:08.080]   and I would be really annoyed with having my music dropping out.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.520]   I think I would just rather have it local.
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.560]   I don't have so much music that I can't have 90% of it local.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.560]   Right.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.560]   Right.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.240]   I think that as the cloud service as sort of a bonus, something that if you don't ever
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.280]   use it, you don't ever have to use it.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:25.600]   But the fact that if I am at some place with Wi-Fi, there are times when I buy I buy albums
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.320]   but I forget to sync them up or I forget to add them to this library but not the other
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:30.320]   one.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:34.320]   The fact that I'm sort of in there with a chance and that if I do really want to listen to this
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:38.720]   playlist that I set up a couple weeks ago but forgot to re-sync, at least it's there.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:45.960]   But I think that's the distinction between a cloud player and just sort of more of a drop
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:50.040]   box like scenario where you've got a remote disc that's smart about syncing to local.
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:52.600]   That's more what I would want.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:57.000]   And I think the Amazon player actually covers all those spaces.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.560]   That's actually also one of the reasons why I think that if Amazon did a color Kindle,
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:08.120]   it would be the best, really the best competition the iPad will ever see because you know that
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:14.280]   they would not be hesitant to make sure that this does not cost one penny more than $249.
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.400]   It wouldn't just be a Kindle with a color screen.
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:21.560]   It would be an Android 3.0 device that's had completely new software written for to make
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:24.960]   Android an actually pleasurable and palatable experience.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:30.160]   And it would really address the things that last time you were on an airplane, you saw
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.920]   a lot of people with iPads but you saw so many people with those $139 kindles and they're
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.480]   not like the nerdy sort of people like us.
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:42.240]   They are just the huddled masses yearning to breathe free and read Daniel Steele after
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.600]   a quick download.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.080]   And if you give them a device that says, "Yep, as a matter of fact, this will have, it does
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:51.480]   have access to the largest commercial, a book library anywhere."
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.080]   Also you can get your email on it.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:57.960]   Also all the music that you buy is available on this, a download to it automatically and
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:01.920]   you can stream to the cloud and all the movies that you want to, you can stream right through
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:02.920]   it.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.000]   Oh, and there's an Apple library for it.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.080]   So I know that you being an honest regular human, you don't necessarily want to have
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:13.800]   200,000 apps but I'm sure you've heard of this game called Angry Birds.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.400]   We have Angry Birds.
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:20.520]   So it wouldn't necessarily be a competition for people who go into an Apple store to buy
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:24.640]   an iPad but it would be a competition for somebody who has heard about these tablets,
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:29.600]   seeing people playing with these tablet devices and would take care of about 80 to 90% of
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:33.960]   the things that they think they want to use a tablet for and the kicker is that it would
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.920]   cost about half the price of an iPad.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:41.480]   Again, this is all presuming that they would sell it for $249 and I don't think that Amazon
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:47.520]   would be so silly as to try to do a nine inch tablet that doesn't run this kind of software
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.640]   and sell it for, well, we'll knock 40 bucks off the price but we will lock you into a
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.880]   five year contract for that $40 discount.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:58.080]   So we'll see if it goes anywhere.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.320]   Amazon still experiment.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.240]   I'm just glad to see them doing it.
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:03.760]   I'd love to see better implementations.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.080]   I'd love to see that move forward.
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:08.600]   I just want to keep on pushing Apple on those processes.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:14.200]   Now, one of the things as I said earlier in the show is that I put out this Twitter and
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:22.280]   I put out a tweet, I always call it a Twitter, sorry, that talking about asking people what
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.640]   their questions were and so on and so forth.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.920]   So I thought one of the big things that was coming up that a lot of people were asking
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.720]   about was thunderbolt.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:34.720]   So a lot of people don't understand what thunderbolt is, how it works and why is it important?
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.960]   And they've heard me wax on about thunderbolt being the best thing to add to a computer
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.960]   since the mouse.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.640]   But a lot of people are asking, you know, what is that?
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.640]   What is the thunderbolt?
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:49.800]   So what we've seen now is we've seen the Mac, Macbook Pro, of course, all the new ones
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.480]   have thunderbolt in them.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:54.400]   The iMac now has thunderbolt.
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:08:00.080]   Now we are now assuming that we're going to see Mac minis or hoping that we see Mac minis
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.400]   and Mac pros with thunderbolt.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:07.040]   Ron, can you give people a little bit of a technical, you're at the bottom of your screen,
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.400]   Ron, but can't you give people?
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.400]   Ron, I was lousy.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.400]   I was lousy.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:15.240]   I was hoping to ask me to give people a technical description of what thunderbolt is.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.080]   But you're our technical expert here.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:23.720]   You're here to tell us how does thunderbolt work?
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:31.000]   So instead of doing that, let me pose the question of are we going to see all of these
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.880]   things that have previously been internal devices turned into external devices?
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.880]   You know, all your hard work.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.480]   That's actually one of the big questions.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:41.120]   All your graphics cards, even potentially being external at some level.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:47.320]   I mean, does this really mean that the whole form factor of what a PC is can change in
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.320]   a lot of ways?
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:51.320]   I think that's what's interesting to me because it's got enough bandwidth to sort of act like
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.120]   a local bus.
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.840]   And no longer requires.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:58.600]   There's a lot of questions of, okay, if you move all this stuff external, aren't you just
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.240]   really, you know, ending up with some weird hybrid where you still have external cooling
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.240]   and all of that?
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.400]   But I've kind of already got some of that with, you know, my external Drobo, which has
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:09.000]   got his own little fan in it and everything.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.160]   And it's going to be interesting to see if the sense of this is a monolithic computer
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:17.840]   changes back to being more of a device with a lot of peripherals on it.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:18.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:22.760]   So to give people a little bit of background, of course, thunderbolt is it's technology
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.280]   that Apple and Intel put together.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:30.960]   It's 10 megabits a second or about 1.5 gigabytes a second.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:31.960]   That's a translation.
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:32.960]   Crazy.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:33.960]   It's a lot of data.
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:34.960]   It's a lot of data.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.440]   And that, of course, is symmetrical.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:39.080]   So it can do both directions at the same time.
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:45.720]   And so it is a so if you imagine Firewire is about one, the Firewire, your Firewire 800
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:52.840]   connection is at its fastest about one-fifteenth the speed of thunderbolt.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:57.000]   So just to kind of make sure that, you know, everyone's kind of clear what this is a huge
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.560]   jump forward.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:04.440]   And the issue is, is that, you know, a lot of the, we haven't seen any peripherals.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:09.240]   We have, we got to see test cases of them at NAB.
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.520]   Of course, professionals are really paying a lot of attention to this because I think
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:16.440]   we're the ones that are going to be affected pretty dramatically.
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:20.360]   Probably, we're going to be the first ones affected is people who are really pushing
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.160]   a lot of data around who need it the most.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:27.240]   And so, but anyway, so that's the basis of what thunderbolt is.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:31.080]   Now there's an optical, you know, it's theoretically an optical, but I believe what we're talking
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.080]   about right now is copper.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.080]   Is that right, Andy?
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.080]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:38.640]   That was originally designed as an optical spec, but now it's just simply copper.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:43.120]   But one of the greatest things about it is that it is that one port to rule them all,
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.280]   that one of the problems of the original MacBook Air, for instance, is that you had a, you
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:53.000]   had to suffer and sacrifice so much in the name of that slim, slim design where you only
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.920]   had one USB port and you had one little video port that kind of sneak it in and you didn't
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.080]   get a ethernet port.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.080]   You didn't get this.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.440]   You didn't get that.
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:06.720]   The right now, you have a connector that looks exactly like a mini display port connector
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.960]   that actually will also do the same work as a mini display port.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.800]   But that one thing on a MacBook Air that really could be the only port you would ever
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:20.120]   need on a MacBook Air and because all of the part of the spec is that you can daisy
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.080]   chain this box of these boxes.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:26.400]   All of a sudden, you're not just stuck with one USB port that's kind of slow for your hard
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.400]   drive.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.720]   They've unplug it to put in a card reader.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:33.520]   It means that you plug in a really, really awesome, super fast hard drive that can shuttle
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.880]   stuff in and out a huge 10 megabyte photos almost instantaneously.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.680]   In the back of that, you can have like a high speed scanner on the back of that.
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:46.000]   You can have three other device, a high speed networking device.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.440]   You can have another video codec device.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:53.080]   And then at the very end of that chain, you could still have a 24 inch monitor and with
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:54.520]   graphics acceleration.
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:58.160]   And because there are multiple channels of bi-directional data, it means that you can
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:04.240]   have, you can be doing a complete backup of your 256 gigabyte SSD drive onto that really
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.320]   high speed hard drive and it won't affect the video performance at all.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.160]   You can still be playing a game and be getting 60 frames per second.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:16.800]   So really, you go down to have one tiny, tiny little eraser head sized port on the side
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.880]   of a tiny, tiny mobile device that can just support six devices and they're all going
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.600]   to be kicking as fast devices.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:28.120]   Does anyone know whether the iMac, the iMac, the new one has two thunderbolt devices?
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:35.760]   They are two separate controllers so you do get now 12 different.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:40.320]   There are two separate channels so that you can have two screens and 12 devices attached
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.920]   to them and twice the throughput.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:44.160]   Which is mind-numbing.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.160]   So what does this mean?
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.400]   So all that's wonderful.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.840]   And I'm sure I'll use it.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:54.160]   But for the average consumer, that like me, I have an iMac at home, I got a Drobo sitting
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:13:01.120]   next to it, I have a scanner or whatever and a separate display and it all works great
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.120]   right now.
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:03.120]   What does this mean?
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.880]   Does it just mean, what's the benefit to me?
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.880]   Just faster throughput?
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:11.000]   Because my Drobo can only go so fast A and B, the only other negative that I feel right
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.920]   now is a lot of cables.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:17.320]   So do I have a cleaner desk and a slightly faster throughput just for the average consumer.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:20.240]   Now for the video editor or the audio guy, multimedia.
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.240]   What's average?
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.880]   I think for the average person you're probably talking about the ability to have one connector.
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:29.560]   I think the simplification of all this and then you have everything broken out all over
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:33.800]   your desk and it's all going into some feed that then has a little Thunderbolt coming out
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.040]   of it and popping it in.
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.720]   For people who I think are who shoot a lot.
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:41.680]   So and I do think Thunderbolt has more makes more of a difference for professionals, for
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.680]   the truck drivers.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.520]   I mean Thunderbolt is really a truck driver, I think, tool in a lot of ways.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:51.080]   I kind of see two consumer I guess.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:59.920]   Call it that benefits of a super data bandwidth bus kind of thing is one is when you walk up
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:08.720]   to your iMac with your MacBook Air, suddenly maybe you get all the power of the iMac as
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.920]   well as MacBook Air.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:14.560]   You start to treat those as nodal processing kind of units.
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:18.160]   You just, oh I need a bit more processing power to cut that movie.
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.600]   I'll just walk up to one of these machines.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.080]   I don't have to log into a new machine.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.920]   I don't have to share stuff across machines.
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:27.560]   I'll just plug it in and suddenly I can use both these machines like they are a single
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:28.560]   machine.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:31.040]   So I see that as being a potential.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.320]   I mean it's fast enough that you could connect, you know, when you talk about screen sharing
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.440]   and so on and so forth, you could have two computers connected via Thunderbolt and it
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.440]   would be the same.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:43.280]   If you could switch to the other computer and work on it and it would.
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.680]   Well I'm saying you combine the power of the machine.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:52.360]   I treat them as just two CPUs just a little bit further apart than normal.
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:59.120]   I believe Apple certainly has the technology within its kind of modular system to do that.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:06.040]   The second thing is if we're going to look at touch input in the desktop, it means if
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:12.720]   you want a flat touch interface that is a video screen as well to work with, then that's
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.920]   going to need some serious bandwidth.
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:19.080]   If you want to replace this on a great simplify things like the Cintiq.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:24.280]   A Cintiq is a great example of right now we've got this, I can see the Cintiq, I do reviews
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:28.680]   on this little one and I have a, it's got a DVI input and then I've got the USB input
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:31.960]   and I've got this little power thing at the bottom and then I've got all this other stuff,
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.000]   this interface and all these other pieces.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.440]   Theoretically you could have it, you know, it doesn't carry power yet but you could theoretically
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:44.000]   pop Thunderbolt into it and then that would handle all that communication.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.040]   I still have to power it separately but I'd be able to, there'd be a whole box there that
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.360]   theoretically I wouldn't need.
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.600]   I wouldn't need to use up DVI.
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:54.120]   I mean, DVI as soon as you start looking at Thunderbolt, I mean when you get used to
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:58.600]   mini display in general, DVI just seems like this big massive clunky mess.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:04.800]   So is Thunderbolt going to replace the dock connector?
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:07.880]   Probably, I mean, being like an iOS dock connector.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:12.840]   Yeah, yeah, the iOS dock connector on the iPad, iPhone, all that.
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:17.920]   Probably not because for one thing, there's a smart reason and there's a stupid reason.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:22.400]   The smart reason is that it is relatively high power compared to the dock connector
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.560]   if memory serves.
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:28.680]   The second thing is that you do still have to have something that by Apple's design standards
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:32.200]   is still bulky and square in order to make it work.
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:36.360]   The third problem is that it does require a controller chip in order to make a compatible
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:37.360]   device.
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.400]   You do have to license, I think, the dock connector for, if you want to build something
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:46.680]   for an iPhone or iPad, but essentially it's just wires into a bridge.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:47.840]   So there are a couple of problems.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.680]   I don't think it's natively like that, but if Apple were to ever want to really take the
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:56.480]   iPad to the next level, one of these would just open up what you could connect to the
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:57.480]   damn thing.
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:03.280]   And the, I do think that this year, I think mostly what we're going to see is a massive
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.520]   push into the professional market and to the truck drivers.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:10.080]   I think we will see stuff that's more consumer down the road.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:17.560]   But I think that when you think about the implications, we were looking at, you know,
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:22.200]   at, we're at NAB and we're looking at the idea of having two raids.
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.480]   Both each raid is raid zero and then it's combined into a raid one.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.280]   So you're mirroring to two raid systems.
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:35.320]   So it's a raid 10 and the, and then you could still connect an uncompressed feed from a big,
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.080]   big camera like some of the stuff we use on set.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.920]   I just want to add here, anyone who's just listening to this, they can't say little
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.880]   glint in your eye of happiness.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:43.880]   Okay.
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.160]   When we bought, when we bought our, when we first started capturing from, from, from
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:53.160]   these big cameras, I had, we built a raid from scratch and hooked it up via something
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:59.560]   like some crazy, you know, interface and it was 130 gigs and we could capture, you know,
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:03.560]   15 minutes before we had to wait for three hours to dump the drive.
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:08.720]   And, and so it was like this, this massive undertaking and we were the only ones that
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:09.720]   could do it.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:13.000]   And now we're looking at these little drives that I can hook up this, these cameras to
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.160]   capture uncompressed to the drive.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:20.680]   So I have two copies of my, of my footage in real time with a laptop on a set, you know,
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:24.000]   and that's the kind of stuff that I think we're going to see also with your photographer.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.200]   You know, I saw one of the things that Sonnet was showing.
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:30.600]   So of course we've heard about Lacy working on ones, everyone's working on them, but Sonnet
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:37.640]   had one four compact flash card inputs that had, so there's four compact flashes, okay,
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:42.240]   a Thunderbolt, you know, so now if you're a photographer, you could take four compact
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:46.880]   flashes, push them in and it will pull them as fast as each one of them is capable of,
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:47.880]   of copying.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:51.800]   Well, wow, that's insane.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.800]   That's what's, that's Thunderbolt.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.480]   If they had a light, but it might press it.
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:56.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:01.480]   So pulling that kind of stuff off is, is, you know, it's, it's a big deal.
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:06.920]   So for, again, for video professionals, for photography professionals, of course, there's
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:10.240]   going to be a lot of other things that we, that we see, but should be kind of fun.
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:14.200]   Anyway, that was, that was a big push of a lot of the questions that we had.
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:19.120]   And so we'll, you know, I think we're going to experiment more, at least when I'm hosting
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:27.480]   will experiment more with this idea of having everyone kind of send, send to send questions.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:31.080]   Most of the, what we designed for the show was, was all there.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:34.120]   You know, people, everyone was contributing via Twitter and outsourced.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.120]   It is.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:37.320]   I, I just thought, you know, I'm really into collaborative.
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.760]   I'm like, if you're doing it live, you're doing something, everyone should be kind of
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:40.760]   involved.
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:44.640]   So, so that's kind of the, the direction that I've been, that I've been trying to go.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:47.960]   So, and it's, it was just kind of a bit of, bit of an experiment and I think it worked
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:48.960]   out really well.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:51.960]   And I think it was a very, very, very important thing to do.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:02.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:05.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:10.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:11.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:12.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:13.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:14.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:15.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:17.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:20.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:21.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:22.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:23.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:24.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:25.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:26.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:27.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:28.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:29.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:30.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:31.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:32.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:39.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:46.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:51.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:54.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:55.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:56.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:57.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:58.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:20:59.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:04.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:09.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:17.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:18.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:22.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:23.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:24.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:25.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:26.960]   And I think it was a very important thing to do.
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:30.960]   And I think for most people, if you just want to sign something, mark something up, so you can mark up pages.
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:31.960]   You can add text.
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:32.960]   You can add signatures.
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:33.960]   You can add images.
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.960]   You can correct things.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:40.960]   You can-- so there's a lot of things that we would-- and you can keep little snippets of irregular stuff.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:48.960]   So if you're always adding a signature, or you're always adding an initial or something, you can just bring up the document, drag them in quickly and send it.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:49.960]   And it's really cool.
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:50.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:51.960]   So it's definitely worth checking out.
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:55.960]   So if you're interested, go to smile, software.com/macbreak.
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.960]   A PDF pen is $59.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.960]   A PDF pen pro is $99.

[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:10.960]   It's definitely worth checking out if you've ever-- I do not do-- I don't do faxes anymore.
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.960]   You know, like the whole sign or whatever.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:17.960]   If I just need to be able to email back, unfortunately, everyone's kind of moved on to where they're willing to take those kind of documents.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:23.960]   You know, I mean, it's very rare now that someone actually wants you to send them a piece of paper, because then they have to manage it too.
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:24.960]   Yep.
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:30.960]   And they finally-- most companies have moved into the-- into the century related to that.
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:31.960]   So definitely check it out.

[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:37.960]   And now, picks of the week.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:45.960]   And by the way, as people have been asking about line and iOS 5, I just felt like there's not-- we're getting-- we're going to do that as we get a little closer to WWDC, which is coming right up.
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:50.960]   I'm imagining we'll get more rumors before then, and we'll be able to dive into that.
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.960]   Frederick, do you have a pick for the week?
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.960]   I do have a pick of the week.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:00.960]   And my pick is kind of old, but I'm going to call it new, because I found a new use for it.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:06.960]   So a while ago, Apple released iMovie for the iPhone.
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.960]   Remember that?
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:08.960]   I've heard of it.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:13.960]   And of course, I downloaded it right away, and then it-- then it proceeded to just sit on my phone forever, and I never used it.
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:24.960]   Until I went on a trip with my girlfriend a couple weeks ago, and I took a bunch of pictures, and I imported them into iMovie, and made a great project out of it.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:30.960]   I mean, it was a full-on Ken Burns music attached to it, all this stuff that I looked like I made on my Mac.
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:32.960]   It was amazing.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:33.960]   And I did all of my thumb.
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.960]   So I only took a second to do it.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:44.960]   And the amazing piece was it was at the end, all I did was hit a couple buttons and shared right up to Vimeo, and it was online.
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:45.960]   It was shared.
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:49.960]   Everyone could see it, comment on it, while the trip was still in progress.
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.960]   So I thought it was pretty amazing.
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:24:02.960]   So what you're saying is, if you've been poo-pooing it, if you've been poo-pooing it, try it again, especially for photographers, because even, of course, my perspective is from the photography perspective.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:05.960]   But if you're a photographer, try it out just to do slide shows.
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:16.960]   You can drag and drop images right in there with transitions, set and start in endpoints for Ken Burns, you know, the pan over the images, add music to it, and publish it and go.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:17.960]   That's awesome.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:18.960]   And notice I'm doing this.
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:19.960]   This is how I edit.
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:23.960]   It's just like, it's just with your thumb, publish it and go.
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:28.960]   And I haven't even played, I don't have an iPad 2 yet, so I haven't played with iMovie on the iPad 2 yet.
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:29.960]   I don't know how it feels, but...
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:30.960]   It's nifty.
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:33.960]   On the iPhone 4, it's pretty amazing.
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:35.960]   All right, now, so that is the iMovie.
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.960]   Make sure to check it out, and Andy, what's your pick?
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:42.960]   My pick is a...
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:53.960]   I'm glad there's a really great app that most iPad users are familiar with from Autodesk called Sketchbook, which is my favorite, just little sketching and drawing app for the iPad.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:57.960]   And they have a version of it for desktops, and of course it's available from Akose.
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:05.960]   And so you can get Sketchbook Pro for $60, but they also have a free version on the App Store called Sketchbook Express.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:06.960]   Which is amazing.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:11.960]   I am so surprised that they call that Sketchbook Express and make it free.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:16.960]   Yeah, because it really is one of the best full-featured little drawing programs.
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:26.960]   It is exactly like if you want Photoshop and all of its drawing tools, for $60, you can get an app that's just as good for drawing.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:37.960]   Drawing digitally, whether you're using the multi-touch trackpad or stylus or a Cintiq as the $500 copy of Photoshop CS5.
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:46.960]   The Express version has some limitations being free, but they don't limit what you can do or what you can draw with it.
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.960]   All the tools are there.
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:52.960]   They just limit exactly how much money you could possibly make off the stuff that you create with us.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.960]   I think the largest canvas is 1600 by 1200.
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:57.960]   There are a couple of restrictions on layers.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:01.960]   There are a couple of restrictions on what you can import and export.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:06.960]   For instance, if you do draw something really cool, you can export it as a tip or a JPEG or a couple other things.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:09.960]   I don't think you can do it as a multi-layer Photoshop.
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:21.960]   But as a tool to really start to mess around with digital drawing and digital painting, and also a way to figure out whether you want to spend $60 on the full whack version of it.
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:25.960]   It really is one of the greatest free apps you can get in the App Store right now.
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:28.960]   There's just nothing hacked off about it.
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:35.960]   You'll be surprised at how much drawing you will do with this tool now that you have a really good drawing tool for the Mac.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:47.960]   And I find that for educators out there who are doing online stuff, go to meeting and doing all these other things, one of the things that I use it for is the Express one is like the ultimate whiteboard.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:50.960]   So what I do is I fill the screen and I have a bamboo.
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.960]   You did that on a screencast with me before.
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:55.960]   When you were demonstrating, we were on a call and you used that app.
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:27:04.960]   And it's just like, if I want to draw something really, really quickly, what I do is I share my screen with a go-to meeting or a wirecast or whatever we're using at that moment.
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:08.960]   Or if I'm showing someone something, I want to draw something out.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:11.960]   A lot of times with those applications, it's hard to get a really good...
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:17.960]   Then this is just perfectly smooth, it's beautiful, and you can sit there and do all your... what you would do on a blackboard.
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:21.960]   You can sit there and just draw it all out with a bamboo or a centique or whatever you're using.
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.960]   Or even your little trackpad with a little pic.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.960]   So all of those things are just great.
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.960]   It's great.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.960]   So that is in at Sketchbook Express.
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:35.960]   Sketchbook Express, by Autodesk.
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:38.960]   I think this is a piece of art by Scottie Young.
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:40.960]   He's a really great Marvel Comics artist.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:44.960]   He did a series, a Wizard of Oz series for Marvel.
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:51.960]   And just to show you how good this app is, the reason why they use this artwork is because the man is just playing a fan.
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:28:02.960]   And when they realize that, "Oh, this guy's doing this incredible artwork using our product, let's give him a couple of bucks and like half of them like draw us a piece of artwork we could use for our cover art."
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:08.960]   And I mean, it is just so organic. I know very few artists who are...
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:12.960]   There are a lot of artists making the transition from traditional tools to digital tools.
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:19.960]   I don't know many of them who aren't using this tool exactly because it gives you exactly that level of control and those level of effect.
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:21.960]   So really great.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:22.960]   Keith.
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:23.960]   Yes.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:24.960]   What do you have for us?
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.960]   Do you think I can feed in two quick pieces?
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:27.960]   Yes.
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:28.960]   Absolutely.
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:29.960]   Great.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:30.960]   Okay.
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:31.960]   So one is a iOS, an iPhone app.
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.960]   It's one of those ones that snuck up on me. It's been around a while.
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.960]   And it's called Pocket Casts.
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:41.960]   And it's a... I don't know if... I don't think it's been covered before.
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:43.960]   Pocket... Pocket Casts.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:44.960]   Okay.
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:45.960]   As in, uh, PODCasts.
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:46.960]   Uh-huh.
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:47.960]   Pocket Casts.
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:54.960]   And what it's built to do is let you manage your podcast listening much easier than iTunes.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:55.960]   Kind of does it.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:56.960]   And much more on the fly.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:02.960]   So if you're out and about and you like want to know what the latest episode is, um, of
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:07.960]   any of your favorite podcasts, especially Twit Network ones, um, you know, you can, you
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:12.800]   can look through them, download something on the fly or maybe you just want to grab a
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.960]   few things before you head out the door for the day.
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:15.960]   Right.
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:19.960]   Um, so it's really built specifically for the serious podcast listener, which of course
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:21.960]   all of you guys are.
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:25.960]   Um, and, and it's, uh, it's just an app.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:31.960]   You don't realize you need until you just think, I, I listened to a lot of podcasts at home.
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:35.960]   And, you know, it's nice to be able to just grab a bunch of stuff, head out, see what
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:39.960]   else there is without having to, to, to manage that whole process.
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:44.960]   So it's just built around finding and discovering new podcasts, grabbing them quickly on the
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:45.960]   fly, trying them out.
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:49.960]   Um, and, uh, it's nice to lap and, and, uh, actually...
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:50.960]   Who makes it?
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:51.960]   It's, uh...
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:52.960]   Shifty.
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:53.960]   Shifty Jelly.
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:54.960]   Shifty Jelly.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:55.960]   And Adelaide Australia.
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:56.960]   Ah, very good.
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:59.960]   So, uh, one of my peeps, I guess you could say.
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:00.960]   Um, long way away though.
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:06.400]   Uh, and okay, so my, so it says pocket cast and my second one is another one that sneaks
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:09.960]   up on you and it's stuck up on me and it's called Adobe fireworks.
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:10.960]   Now...
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:11.960]   Fireworks.
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:12.960]   Fireworks is fireworks.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:13.960]   Fireworks.
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:14.960]   Okay.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:15.960]   Oh, fireworks.
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:16.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:21.960]   Um, it, it comes with CS, you know, the creative suite and, and it get, it mostly gets ignored.
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:22.960]   It's just one of those things.
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:24.960]   Yeah, I thought that was canceled.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.960]   So, so that's big, you know, you got your Photoshop, you got your Illustrator and then
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.960]   there's some other coloured blocks I saw.
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:31.960]   Right.
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:32.960]   Some of them.
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:33.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:37.960]   But, uh, as an interaction designer and, and graphic designer and UI guy, it's, it's actually
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:38.960]   the right tool for the job.
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:43.960]   And, and anyone who's used to using, uh, omnigraphil on the Mac, uh-huh, will actually
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:48.960]   find this tool is the closest to work that kind of, in a set, you're not thinking about
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:51.960]   layers, you're not thinking about pixels, you just think about, I've got some stuff
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:54.960]   here, I've got some objects here, some objects here, let me just work that way.
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:55.960]   Hmm.
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:57.960]   I was actually thinking, because I use omnigraph for, yeah, dealing.
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:30:59.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:00.960]   Same here.
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:04.960]   And so if you, I used to use that a lot too and I kind of wanted to go, have more, more
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:07.960]   kind of pixel control, but still work the same way.
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:10.960]   I don't kind of tend to think in layers like the Photoshop guys do.
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:11.960]   Right.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:14.960]   I tend to think of, I've got this button thing here and I've got a window thing here and
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:15.960]   a square here, et cetera.
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:16.960]   Right.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:20.960]   Uh, so it's, and, and the beautiful thing about it is it's completely extensible.
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:25.920]   And then all these people out there writing extensions for it, which you let you do, uh,
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:30.320]   like basically the whole interface can be controlled from the extensions.
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:34.920]   It's hard to explain in a, in a two minute pick, but, but you, if you've got it, if you
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.580]   got to see a suite, uh, you've opened it up.
[01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:38.580]   You've already got it.
[01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:39.580]   There's that application.
[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:40.580]   You already paid for it.
[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:44.080]   And, and you're doing like web design, I mean, and, and basically I thought about this
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:49.280]   because I hear that Adobe this week has decreed that all of their web design is going to
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:50.760]   be done in fireworks.
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:55.600]   So they're telling all the internal guys to, to hate, this is the tool for it.
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.360]   This is what we want, want you to use.
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:02.480]   So I'm, uh, you know, I'd say if you, if you've got to see a suite, we make this dog food.
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:03.480]   You will need it.
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:04.480]   It's very good though.
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.480]   That's the thing.
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:06.960]   It is like the Mac early on.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:12.060]   It's like the underdog of the Adobe CS suite and it, it's got a kind of a following of people
[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:16.760]   building really cool plugins and stuff that, that, uh, let you do amazing stuff.
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:17.760]   So check it out.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:18.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:19.760]   Definitely.
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:20.760]   Yep.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:21.760]   One quick one.
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:22.760]   This was really quick, really quick.
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:24.360]   You got like 30 seconds.
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.360]   It's kitsch.
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:27.560]   You got a check out skitch.
[01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:29.560]   Screen capture.
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:30.560]   Yeah.
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:33.000]   Skitch is the, I mean, yeah, it's, it's just awesome.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.560]   That's why we, that's why I was excited to have a screech is, the skitch is amazing.
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:36.560]   Yeah.
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:37.800]   And now on the Mac App Store.
[01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:41.760]   It's now and, and do you, how is your experience with the Mac App Store?
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.920]   Uh, it's, what you mean as a developer?
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:45.920]   As a developer.
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:46.920]   Um, good.
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:47.920]   Actually good.
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:53.000]   You haven't had any major troubles when, when there was, you know, problems, they were very
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.280]   clear on what we needed to fix or change to adhere to the rules.
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:33:01.180]   Uh, and, uh, you know, I think it's a much better experience coming from a shareware
[01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:05.440]   background to be on that like for customer support.
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:09.360]   It's, it's, you know, they're not, I downloaded it and then when did it go?
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:10.360]   I don't know what to do.
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:14.360]   No, it's just like all like, all the questions are, uh, and then it jumps into your dog.
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.360]   Yeah.

[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:27.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:29.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:31.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:33.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:37.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:43.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:47.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:53.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:55.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:57.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:59.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:01.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:03.400]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:04.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.400]   Ron, what do you got for us?
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:10.400]   My pick is something called Better Touch Tool.
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:16.400]   And it is kind of the most ridiculously over-featured tool
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:18.400]   for controlling your trackpad.
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:21.400]   It takes you far, far beyond what your standard system
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:22.400]   preferences do.
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:29.400]   It lets you deal with custom things for the sensitivity of it,
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:33.400]   what tapping does, double tapping, multi-finger touching.
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:36.400]   It has full support for any kind of gestures you want to put in,
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:38.400]   including full user-defined gestures.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:42.400]   You can put in gestures on a per application basis.
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:46.400]   So if you want to have some certain gesture only occur inside of--
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.400]   How does it record the gestures?
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.400]   Can you gesture?
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:50.400]   Or do you--
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:52.400]   Yeah, so you kind of set up-- here's the gesture.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:54.400]   And I want to have it do this action.
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:58.400]   And I want to have it be only for Photoshop, for instance.
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:36:59.400]   Or something like that.
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:00.400]   Sounds fun.
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:04.400]   It is-- it's kind of a ton of other stuff in it.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:08.400]   You can really see that this is kind of where a lot of this stuff
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:09.400]   is going to be going.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:12.400]   And you can kind of take that first step yourself in terms of
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:15.400]   figuring out ways that you're going to interact with your touchpad
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:18.400]   in ways that are not currently supported by Apple.
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:21.400]   And it's really-- it does just tons of stuff.
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:24.400]   He's even thrown in things that are sort of like window management
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:25.400]   stuff.
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:29.400]   So there was a tool that I think Andy had mentioned a few years back,
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:31.400]   probably, here as one of his picks.
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:33.400]   It's called Cinch.
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:36.400]   It's a tool where you can kind of drag a window to the side of the
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:39.400]   screen and it'll pop into the half screen view.
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.400]   So you can easily lay out your windows just by dragging the edges
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:43.400]   kind of thing.
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:46.400]   Something like that is incorporated into this as well.
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:50.400]   It's got a lot of magic mouse support, which I don't use a magic mouse
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:51.400]   and I don't know why you would.
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:52.400]   But for those people that do--
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.400]   I love the magic mouse.
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:55.400]   Do you?
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:57.400]   Yeah, someone asked me, do they have the new iPad-- the new iMac you
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:00.400]   can choose between the magic mouse and the mouse and I was like,
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:01.400]   oh, magic mouse.
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:02.400]   Like I have that on my Mac Pro.
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:03.400]   I won't go back.
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:04.400]   I won't go back.
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:05.400]   I don't go back.
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:06.400]   I don't know.
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:07.400]   But anyway, if you're--
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:08.400]   I have a messy desk.
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:09.400]   So I don't like things moving around.
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:10.400]   That's my problem.
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:15.400]   Well, this will even let you customize the sort of the ignore regions
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:16.400]   on your magic mouse.
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:18.400]   One thing I miss that it doesn't do that.
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:19.400]   I wish it did.
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:20.400]   Magic trackpad, by the way.
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:22.400]   Oh, magic mouse and magic trackpad.
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:23.400]   We were talking about that.
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:25.400]   Yeah, I don't use the magic mouse.
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:26.400]   Sorry, I use the magic mouse.
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.400]   That makes more sense.
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:28.400]   Magic mouse, I won't touch.
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:29.400]   Magic trackpad.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:30.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:33.400]   I gotta say I use the magic mouse and a magic trackpad.
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:34.400]   On my Mac.
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:35.400]   On either side.
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:36.400]   Okay.
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:37.400]   And this show is over now.
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:38.400]   No, no, no.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:39.400]   So, here we go.
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.400]   So, yeah, you should just-- I mean, just get it.
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:44.400]   The other sort of nice feature of this is it is free.
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:45.400]   Completely free.
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.400]   So there's no reason not to get it.
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.400]   He has a nice little donate button on there.
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:51.400]   I would encourage everybody to do so.
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.400]   I definitely tossed him 10 bucks or so.
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:55.400]   Oh, it's called a-- what's the name of it?
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:56.400]   It's the name of it.
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.400]   It's called Better Touch Tool.
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:58.400]   Better Touch Tool.
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:00.400]   Yeah, and you can just Google that.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:05.400]   The URL is www.bosturbioastr.de.
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:10.400]   I assume I'm gonna say a German guy that's doing it, but it's really deep.
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:15.400]   And you can spend a lot of time setting up and configuring things, but it's got a lot of
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:16.400]   nice stuff.
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:20.400]   I was gonna say the one thing that doesn't do that, I wish it did do, was have on the
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:24.400]   touchpad the ability to ignore certain areas of the touchpad.
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:29.400]   Because what a reason my fat fingers or fat thumbs or something, I will occasionally get
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:32.400]   the double touch when I don't intend to.
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:37.400]   And I know part of the reason is because I've got-- my hand is kind of creeping over on the
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:38.400]   side of the touchpad.
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.400]   So maybe that's something that's coming.
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:41.400]   But overall, like I said, it's free.
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:43.400]   So there's no reason not to check it out.
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:44.400]   Great.
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:45.400]   Better Touch Tool.
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:47.400]   Now my pick I got to.
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:50.400]   I'm gonna go quick.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.400]   I'm gonna be quick.
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:58.400]   So the first one is a lot of people have been asking me about this case.
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:02.400]   So this is the Incipio case.
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:07.400]   And this is just a hard case for-- or a little soft kind of spongy case for my air.
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:10.400]   They make one for the-- I think they make it for a lot of things, but I have it on my
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:11.400]   level.
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:12.400]   It's a little grippy.
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:13.400]   Feel it.
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:14.400]   See, it's like--
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:15.400]   It's nice.
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:16.400]   So it's a little grippy and it keeps everything--
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:23.400]   And I just-- I have to admit, in the studio, I'd like to have everything darker.
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:28.400]   And then also I just wanted to protect it because I feel like this little guy is so fragile.
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:29.400]   This guy here.
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:34.400]   So this is the-- if you're watching, this is the-- it just snaps on.
[01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:40.400]   I was a little concerned because it gets really close to the power cable over here, but it
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.400]   pops in just fine.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:45.400]   And it just kind of keeps it all protected and it makes it a little bit grippier too.
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:46.400]   It doesn't slide around.
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:51.720]   So the feet, because they're rubbery, the one thing is when I set it down, I don't feel
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:52.720]   like it's going to slide along.
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:54.400]   You were going to say something, Andy?
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:58.400]   No, I was just saying I love the way the tolerance is on these cases for the MacBooks,
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:01.400]   the MacBook Pros, the MacBook Airs.
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:03.400]   It just looks like you dip this thing in plastic.
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:04.400]   Yeah.
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:05.400]   It's such a tight fit.
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:11.400]   And I have an in case on my MacBook Pro and I would never go out without it now.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:14.400]   On top of everything else, it makes sure that when you go through the airport and put it
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:18.640]   in the bare belt, you know that no one's walking off with your MacBook Air unless it is theft
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:19.640]   and not--
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:20.640]   Yeah.
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:22.520]   And also when you put it on the bare belt, you don't feel like it's getting all scuffed
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:25.720]   up when those guys move it around and bang on it and so on and so forth.
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:28.480]   I mean, that's actually the number one area for wear and tear.
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:29.480]   I'm like a leader.
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.480]   I'm a huge fan of that.
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.480]   That is really, really cool.
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:33.680]   Yeah, this thing is awesome.
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:36.800]   So anyway, so I really like it in CIPIO.
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:41.520]   The other thing, this was a suggestion by one of the Twitter followers and it is called
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:44.080]   QuickCal and I just installed it this morning and I love it.
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.480]   I'm already going to be using it all the time.
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:50.040]   I have a problem that if I don't-- if I'm talking to you and you don't see me put a
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:53.960]   meeting into my ICal, I won't be there.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:56.640]   So you know, like I won't-- if it's not in my account.
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:57.640]   Confirmed.
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:58.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:02.400]   If I don't-- and usually what happens is someone sends me an email and I just-- the
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:05.840]   main reason I use mail, number one reason I use mail is because I can right click on
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:09.840]   something and send it to ICal to make sure I don't forget things because I'm not-- I'm
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:10.840]   in whatever I'm doing.
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:15.560]   If the alarm doesn't go off, I am-- you know, there's a secret-- the secret to me, one of
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:19.760]   the secrets is that I don't-- the reason I have everyone call me and the reason that
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:23.560]   I have everyone come to our office to meet is so that I don't forget the meeting.
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:24.560]   [laughter]
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:25.560]   Exactly.
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:29.560]   Because I have the secret in Europe, so I'm like, "You work 100, 10,000 people."
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.720]   And I say, "Why don't you give me a call?"
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:34.560]   Because it's always like I'm working and if someone calls, I'm like, "Oh, right."
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:38.480]   Yeah, so I have a horrible-- I have a horrible time with conference call.
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:41.160]   I'm like, "Oh, now I'm going to really have to remember this."
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:44.280]   And so if you have that and you're talking on the phone and you need to put this in, what's
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:50.320]   great about it is you don't have to do some kind of crazy code or do drop downs.
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.720]   A lot of times for me, I don't want to go into ICal because it takes too long to do
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:53.720]   it.
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:59.880]   And it's a quick cow, you can just say, "Meet with Fred at from 130 to 2 tomorrow."
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:04.080]   And it figures out the date, puts all that-- it puts all that time in and it puts it
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.320]   into your ICal immediately.
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:07.320]   Bam, bam, bam.
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:13.600]   There's another one that is also available for the iPhone that I haven't tested.
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:14.600]   And I--
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:16.600]   You've literally downloaded this and I was like, "I'm this one."
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:17.600]   So in the iPad too, right?
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.680]   I believe so, I'm not sure.
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:24.440]   But it is called QuickCal and you should definitely go download it.
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:26.320]   I use it all the time.
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:27.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:29.520]   It is approved.
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:33.720]   Andy, where can people find you?
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:37.880]   As usual on my-- if you can spell my last name, you can reach my blog at anotco.com.
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:43.120]   If you can't spell my last name, go cwob.com for the Sledgelobasted ban with.
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:47.120]   As usual, I'm all over the Sunt Times, all over period.
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:48.120]   I'm just over.
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:49.120]   I'm so--
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:51.440]   P.M. people are pretty much over me, I think I've sensed.
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:52.440]   Never, never.
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:55.600]   Ron, where can people find you?
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:02.320]   Best place is probably on Twitter and it's just Ron Brinkman, R-O-N-B-R-I-N-K-M-A-N-N.
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:04.120]   Don't forget the second M.
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:05.120]   What happened, Ron?
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:06.120]   How did you end up with two N's?
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:08.120]   That's the question I have for you.
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:09.120]   It's better.
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:10.120]   Yeah, you know.
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:13.320]   The keyboard kind of sticks whenever I was filling out things.
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:14.920]   I just sort of went with it.
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:17.720]   No, it's the traditional German spelling of man.
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:18.720]   There we go.
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:23.720]   Look, Ron, you can say with the German accent if you want.
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:25.720]   Frederick, where can people find you?
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:29.920]   People can find me at thisweekinfo.com.
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:30.920]   That's our--
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:33.920]   --quip website and podcast.
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:36.720]   So popular that the forums are no longer operational.
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:38.120]   Because we are now switching--
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:41.640]   Yeah, this is droopy of the wall, but we are-- we're going to switch them over to the
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:43.920]   same forums that you're using on Pixel Core.
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:44.920]   Oh, you are.
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:46.920]   And they will be robust and they will stay up.
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:51.920]   You know, ours is an old-- you know, we use V-Bullet and it's old, but it's just--
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:52.920]   But it's working.
[01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:53.920]   It's sturdy.
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:54.920]   Old and sturdy.
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:55.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:56.920]   And AhmedFritterGvan.com.
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:58.320]   That's my personal block, right?
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:44:59.920]   And Keith, where can we go find you?
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:04.920]   Well, you can often see stuff I'm doing on skitch.com, skitch.com.
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:07.920]   Or my personal blog is UI and us.
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.920]   That's the letters UI and us.com.
[01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:11.920]   And what do you do there?
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:17.920]   I talk about user interaction, design, lots of Apple kind of stuff.
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:18.920]   I like it.
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:19.920]   I like a lot of stuff you posted.
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:20.920]   That's why I was pointing out.
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:21.920]   Yeah, I think.
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:25.920]   Sometimes I just would like things to be a different way and I mock them up.
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:27.920]   And then people go, yeah, I want that too.
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:34.920]   And oh, just, you know, fun, Apple, sexy, rounded rectangles, all that kind of stuff.
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:35.920]   Right.
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:36.920]   Nice.
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:37.920]   Fantastic.
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:38.920]   Remix.
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:39.920]   All right.
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:40.920]   Thank you very much.
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:42.920]   And for everyone watching, Leo will be back next week.
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:45.920]   I know some of you are a little concerned that I might be here for two weeks.
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:46.920]   Too weeks straight.
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:49.920]   But thank you all for tuning in.
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:50.920]   Break time is over.
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:51.920]   Back to work.
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:46:01.920]   [Music]
