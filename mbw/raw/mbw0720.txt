[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee Ritchie is here. Andy Enocho is here. We're going to
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:11.280]   of course talk about Apple's big announcements last week at WWDC. What could go wrong? Are we
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.200]   in a post-PC world? Why do we need Apple Silicon? And why should we call it Apple Silicon plus a
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.040]   look at the new ARKit 4? It's mind-blowing. It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.640]   the latest news from Apple and it's going to be a really slow couple of months.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.600]   Fortunately, there's still a lot to talk about. Renee Rich is here from iMore. Great to have you
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.800]   back. Miss Jeff. You say that, Leo, but I haven't slept in like... Yeah, you're exhausted, aren't you?
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.120]   I bet you are. I bet you are really. It's the best kind though. It's Chris Mccah in June and it
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.880]   just is so much. It's like, "All the presents are open and I get to put the Lego together now."
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.880]   Yeah. Yeah. No kidding. Andy and I co-also here. Good to see you, Andy. Hello. We thought we had
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.440]   Alex. He bailed at the last minute. That's okay because you two get to make it comic book central.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.120]   Are we allowed to guess whether Alex is at an undisclosed location? Maybe right where
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.160]   Johnny Saruji was last week. Are we allowed to speak to these? He's not here now, but okay.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.600]   Okay. So which one of you wasn't here last week? I forgot.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.840]   I was here. I seemed to Ray. I was here. Oh, must have been Alex wasn't here. So, okay, good.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.960]   All right. Because I know Lori was. And we got Lori's take on all of this on Sunday. She was
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.040]   on Twitch, which was great. Yeah, that was a great show. Yeah. Well, you liked it because it was all
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.400]   Apple. I heard from a few people. I would have liked it regardless because I like those people.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.680]   Yeah. And I did hear from Dan Patterson who said, "Thank God. I didn't want to hear any
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.840]   COVID news." And I didn't hear any COVID news. It was really all about the candy store.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.640]   Or the fruit company, depending on your point of view. It was Google I/O week. You would
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.160]   run the same thing with Android. I mean, just it happens a couple of times a year. That's exactly
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.440]   what Jason Snell said. Twice a year. It's all Apple all the time. And there's actually, you know,
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.880]   I didn't want to kind of steal the thunder from this show either, but God lay, there's a lot to
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:13.040]   talk about. I decided today to play devil's advocate because I keep trying. I tried last week with
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.360]   you guys that tried Sunday to say, "Okay, but what's the negative on this transition to Apple Silicon?"
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.760]   Oh, can I play the devil then? If you're doing the advocate? I'll be the advocate. You'll be the
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.360]   devil on my left shoulder, the devil. No, that's Andy on the right shoulder.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.240]   I have negative strength. As excited as I am about Apple Silicon, I do wonder
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:45.760]   if we're, haven't we been in a post-PC era for a while now? And is it really, does it really matter?
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.360]   I think ultimately I wonder, does it really matter what chip you're on, what even what operating
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:59.360]   system you're on? Because I see a world increasingly that operates off data and programs in the cloud
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.960]   on clients that can range from a Game Boy to a desktop in the client. And, you know, for instance,
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.080]   and I've been saying this about Windows for a long time, the next time a business buys a computer,
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.120]   they probably shouldn't buy a Windows 10 computer. They should just buy something they can connect
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.520]   to Windows 10 in the cloud and run their apps up there. And I, there's huge benefits to that,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.120]   maintenance, operations, security on and on and on. The only negative, the only downside is
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.800]   local data. If you're living in the cloud and the cloud goes away, then you kind of have some
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.880]   problem. You just explained why Satya Nadella is CEO of Microsoft now and not Steve Bomberg.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.120]   Yeah. Well, exactly. And, and, and, and, you know, we talked a lot on Wednesday and Windows
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.640]   Weekly about Apple's announcement because, and, and, and completely coincidentally,
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:58.400]   Microsoft closed all of its tours forever. And mixer, and mixer. And I think it's a Microsoft
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.080]   that is increasingly focused on exactly the scenario I just talked about. The Windows is nice.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.160]   Office is nice. It's got McNeillies, you know, it's always been, it's, it's always coming,
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.560]   but never quite arriving. You know, it's got McNeillie. We talk about the thin cloud and Larry Ellison.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.040]   We talk about the thin cloud and the early founders of Google. And we're slowly, we're slowly getting
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.280]   to the point where the actual cloud works enough to make it a non-horrible experience locally.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.200]   Yeah. And also with Microsoft, you see them. It was, it was, it was, there was that eight-year period
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.240]   in which they decided they didn't know what they wanted to be or they didn't want, they didn't
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.680]   want to admit that they actually like wearing ties, you know, you know, that, you know, that, you know,
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.440]   that it happens to like so many people, like so many men and women where it's like, well,
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.680]   I'm going to buy this rock and roll t-shirt, like, which I don't wear anymore because I feel like I
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.680]   just don't want to wear them anymore. So you saw Microsoft feel as though, oh, I'm going to, I'm going
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.720]   to develop a smartwatch and I'm going to develop like a consumer. I'm going to have an, I'm going to
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.920]   have a special version of Windows that works on an iPad sort of thing. And it took them a while to
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.280]   realize that there are reasons why they have the market share that they have. And it's because
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.280]   they don't know how to be Apple. They know, but they know, they really know how to be Microsoft.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.760]   So the Microsoft store was always a very, very odd sort of choice for them to make because it was
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.160]   such a brilliant choice for Apple because they are a, they are a place where if you're in a mall,
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.480]   you will buy this sort of stuff that people in malls like to buy in addition to being a service
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.840]   center. But for Microsoft, it was like, we really want one of those two. Please, can we have a
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.280]   writing mower? I know that we don't, I know that the neighbor has a big lawn and we have a small
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.600]   one, but I really want to writing mower. It's really true. It's Microsoft writing mower.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.480]   It's really true. The thing where I think it's differentiated though is that
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.520]   if you are something, and I totally believe you have the same vision of a mobile endpoint,
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.760]   we're all going to have little marbles or mother boxes in our pockets that authenticate us,
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.760]   through biometrics, connect to the cloud and recreate our computing environment in AR or
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.840]   opportunistically with whatever hunk of glass would happen to be near with any sort of input
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.280]   method that's available. But I think there is going to be at least short term decade long
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:16.080]   divide where some people don't care at all where all of the operations on that data are completed.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.200]   You know, they're just as happy for Google or Microsoft to do it on the cloud as the
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.240]   offer it to happen anywhere. And there'll be some percentage of people that want, that's,
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:31.040]   that still want control over that data and want the more private data acted on locally
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.440]   and having cutting edge silicon in iPhones and iPads and Apple, whatever, you know,
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.120]   the next generation of products is will be a competitive advantage for them because they'll
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.640]   be able to do something. I actually was thinking about that last night. I thought you could build,
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:50.880]   I kind of had this notion of it was a sci-fi story almost. Shouldn't everybody, every home,
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:58.320]   every person have a secure enclave that stores everything they do. And that is somehow online,
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.800]   doesn't matter where it's hosted, but some, you know, could be in your closet, but it's somehow
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:08.080]   online and accessible with all of these edge devices that we're eventually going to be using
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.720]   because that's clearly what's happening that you just described it with a watch and glasses and
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:21.600]   IOT devices. We want to be able to access our data everywhere, but we want a secure private enclave
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.280]   and it even goes along with this vision that Tim Bernese Lee and others have expressed
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.000]   Breschenire too that maybe we should have control of our data and then sell it or lease it or let
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.560]   allow somebody to see it. Well, the only way you do that is in your own secure enclave.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:41.840]   So, but that doesn't seem like much of a role. Here's my problem. Apple just announced the newest
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:48.400]   shiniest thing I've ever seen. I love it. It's the equivalent of Princess Amidala's starship,
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:55.040]   you know, with Apple silica created by Alex Lindsay. Yeah, it's beautiful. I want it,
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.560]   but they made this thing in an era when, you know, we don't really need starships anymore
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.840]   because we got teleportation, you know? Not quite though. I'm just told being spread about the galaxy.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:13.680]   But I think that I think you hit it on the head earlier that it used to be that we would think
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:21.840]   think of computing in terms of mobile and mobile and desktop or mobile and not mobile, let's say.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.360]   So, meaning that the things that are designed to be carried in your pocket,
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:31.600]   worn your wrist or a tablet that's so easy to carry around, you'd carry it even if you don't need it
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.160]   versus a somebody who runs a desktop operating system, be it a really, really slim notebook
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:42.160]   or really, really powerful desktop. Now, however, in 2020 and 2020 going forward,
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:48.880]   there's the third category, which is I don't care, you know, where and those are the people
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.800]   for and that's why I think that Apple put so much, not only so much development, but so much focus
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.560]   on in the in the year they're announced last week on Safari because basically apps that run
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:07.520]   within a browser are the king of, I don't care, computing, because it does, it does like that,
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.600]   your basic biscuits and gravy computing where I want, I need to get my email, I need to do
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:18.800]   messaging, I need to get access to some sort of powerful, but not necessarily hammer of God
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:25.760]   powerful office suite. All that sort of stuff is done really, really, really well by anything
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:32.160]   that can run in a very good web browser. This is why this is why so many old computers have a
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.320]   great lease on life because used to be you'd say, Oh, well, I'll install Linux on it, which doesn't
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.360]   put quite so many demands on it. Now you might put Linux on it just to say all it has to do is run
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:48.240]   run Firefox or run a Chromium based browser. And it's suddenly a perfectly usable laptop again.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.000]   So I think that that's something that Apple is very, very wise to keep focused on because as soon as
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.440]   they seed that the the I don't care computing category to, well, they're just going to use Chrome
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:04.640]   and that's about it. That's when they lose the attention of their users. That's when they lose
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:10.320]   the ability to sort of project Apple specific enhancements to their users as well. Well, and of
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:18.960]   course, Apple Silicon will have amazing battery life and has a great low power curve as all
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.800]   all arm architectures do. So maybe that is, you know, maybe I just I feel like Apple's
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:31.440]   Apple's designing a Ferrari and we're all getting bicycles. It's just not like it's like with
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.360]   Stadia or you look at all these technologies and it's like, yes, for like, it's like 80
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.000]   per ton of time, it's 80% good enough. And I think it's going to take five years to maybe iron all
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.320]   that out. And in the meantime, Apple will have their own silicon. They'll be designing exactly
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.000]   for what they want. And they're going to make sure like when you look at, I forget who posted it,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.080]   it might have been DHH, but they were posting benchmarks for browsers. And thanks to the stuff
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.560]   that Apple builds into the chips to do JavaScript acceleration, it just radically outperforms
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.920]   with getting another browser. So you want an Apple, it's a hybrid best of all the one Apple's
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.600]   in client. Yes, that's it. It's not my thin client to be Apple. Well, and there is a market
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.160]   there. And I guess, you know, it's kind of the same market. It's just a little bit of a different form
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.760]   factor as the laptop market. So yeah, and in a way, really your phone and your iPad are thin
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:27.760]   clients in a lot of the uses. So yeah, I just, I, I wanted to bring up the one negative. I really
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:33.440]   saw this move to Apple Silicon as transformational for technology in the computer industry,
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.240]   actually not for technology for the computer industry. And then it hit me. Maybe there is no
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.640]   computer industry. You want battery life on your, like, on your thin client is like,
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.400]   there's all sorts of really compelling features that once you control the silicon, you can,
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.280]   like they have their own H.265 and code decode. And that means that when you watch Netflix or
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.600]   Apple TV, it just lasts longer and is better processed than it is. And all of those things.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.080]   I still want a computer without a
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:09.760]   two terabyte hard drives. I want 100 teraflops. We don't know, like, can you install Linux on
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:14.240]   this? Like we've heard that you can install, I'm like no longer signed versions of Mac OS.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.920]   And that means like, if you put it in reduce security mode, you can go in and do that.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:23.360]   Slow the unpack that one. Because that's interesting. Okay. So we saw, of course,
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:31.040]   we saw Linux running in emulation. And we're saying that the new Apple hardware will not
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.960]   require a signed operating system. So there's two modes. There's two, when you get, you'll be
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.720]   able to choose between two modes. The first mode, the default mode, the mode I'm going to call
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.600]   like for mainstream users runs exactly like an iPhone and an iPad and it can run iPhone and
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:51.680]   iPad apps. And it's just total security. It's exactly like the iPhone security model. You can,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.800]   though, go in and change that setting to reduce security and that disable system integrity
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.480]   protection and a bunch of other stuff. I don't think it's officially called Hobbes mode.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.680]   It's analogous to what Microsoft does with secure boot on Windows and what Google does with
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.960]   secure boot on a Chromebook, right? Yeah, it's similar to that. The only difference with the
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.920]   iPhone and Mac is that you PC's external PCs and Chromebooks, you can turn it off. It's a little
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.760]   tricky on Chromebook, but on PCs, you can turn it off and buy us on many PCs. Yeah,
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.840]   you could never do that on Apple, right? You couldn't install your own arbitrary operating
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:29.520]   system on Apple hardware. You could and then it got complicated with the T2 and then you had to
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.080]   boot in to get rid of SIP and it was a whole complicated thing, but it was a hobbyist thing.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.000]   And now you'll be able to do the same thing. It looks even more easily but
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.720]   theoretically to do a dual built Mac Linux machine.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.400]   Well, so we don't know. They did say that you'll be able to run like versions of Mac OS
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.760]   that Apple's no longer signed, but they haven't mentioned anything about any other operating system.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.200]   That's really exact opposite direction. They're going with the iPhone, isn't it?
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.600]   But didn't they specifically mention virtualization of Linux installs? They showed that. Yeah,
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.040]   virtualization, but not like native. That's a virtualization. Yeah, that's okay. Hypervisor.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:07.120]   And maybe it maybe it works. I just don't know. It's just what we haven't heard anything yet. So
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.840]   like those interesting things bring that up, though. Stressing on. Well, it was interesting.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.080]   In this talk, there's a whole session on Apple Silicon and how the secure boot works
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.320]   and the two different security modes. And they also have this really cool new restore process where
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.640]   you no longer have to hold down those keys or try to remember what those keys are.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.800]   Now, if you hold down the power key, touch ID key, it'll give you a menu.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.840]   Oh, how will you choose which boot option? But also it has a conceit.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.960]   And this is something I'm wondering about for the portless, inevitably,
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:42.720]   portless iPhone too, or portless, whoever makes a phone. It's got a hidden recovery partition.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.280]   So even if you annihilate the drive, you annihilate the normal recovery partition.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:52.480]   It's got a completely sealed, secure, little tiny instance that it can use to recover the
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.600]   entire machine if it needs to. That's cool. I thought it was super clever.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.800]   So you've watched all have you now watched all the sessions? Most of them.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.520]   I'm doing them in order of priority. I've got a whole list of prioritization.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:08.000]   And I'm just going. So I've done all the Apple Silicon ones. I've done a lot of the iOS interface
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.360]   ones. I've done a lot of the iPad, OS ones. I'm starting on the watch ones.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.480]   There's so much to unpack. There's 200 sessions. Yeah, there's so much goodness.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:22.800]   And I asked this last on Twitter with Jason Snell and Dan Morin and Laurie Gill.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:30.560]   Isn't this a better WWDC doing it this way? It's so much more inclusive. Anybody can participate.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:36.880]   Yeah, I think so. It's particularly because I think that it also gives Apple
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:43.760]   more. It's less of a distraction for Apple now because they don't have to get the entire
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.640]   dog and pony show running for the circus tent up and running for an entire week of their schedule.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.520]   It's more like, well, this person, this team is completely ready with their content. So let's
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.520]   just have them do all of their sessions right now three weeks in advance. They're in the can and
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:02.720]   now they're free to do what they're actually being paid to do. Actually making sure that these
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:08.880]   features that they just talked about actually work by September. And it's always been a big
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:15.760]   thorn in people's side to get these big circus tent sort of things running. The effect on
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:21.200]   productivity, the effect on schedules, it's considerable. And the fact that they keep doing
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.840]   them shows you how important it is that they how important it is that they have these regular events.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:32.880]   I have to say now that I'm when you're talking about this boot, this really is a perfect example
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:40.080]   of why leaving Intel is a good thing because you really were defined somewhat by the requirements
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:46.640]   of the x86 chips as to your boot process now. And to work around it. I mean, they work, they
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:52.160]   created a whole they made and stuck in and charged us for a whole T2 chip just to provide some level
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.560]   of security around the process. And now they can do literally anything they want. Which could
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:02.560]   be good or bad. I, you know, we've had time now to absorb this. We did Mac break weekly pretty much
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:10.000]   the next day, last week. So but as I absorb this, I want to reiterate, I feel like this was very
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.280]   good news for people who love Mac. Yeah, I think this is part of my job to point out things like,
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.200]   Oh, do we really want a desktop operating system that locks you out of a lot of the things that
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.600]   make the desktop experience so valuable? That's my job. And I do sincerely feel those things.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.520]   However, I'm capable of feeling multiple things at the same time. What do we lose?
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:38.880]   One of the one of the one of the one of the one of the advantages of having, depending on your
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:44.800]   who stats you believe, less than 20% or less than 10% of the market share is that you are completely
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   Microsoft has has desktop computing covered. Anybody who needs traditional desktop computing,
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.720]   it's covered. They have that option available. So you should you should now feel free as a
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.480]   manufacturer to say, let's go a little bit nuts. Let's push the let's push the envelope a little
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.360]   bit more so that people who are using Macs for specific reason, because they've looked at the
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:12.160]   ecosystem of Windows and decided that's not for me can get some absolutely unique advantages that
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.520]   that come from a company that's not only just developing every scrap of code that's on this
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.280]   thing, but every scrap of hardware that's inside this thing. So I hope that Apple goes, I wouldn't
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.840]   say a little bit nuts, but I would be disappointed if they went if they did this switch to a whole
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:31.680]   new architecture, and they didn't take advantage of all of the freedom that they have now as engineers
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.440]   to develop a computer that's exactly the way that they think a computer should run.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.880]   Yeah. What are we giving up?
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.600]   When role and boot camp.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.640]   But besides, yeah, and maybe not boot camp. We don't that's.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:48.160]   Well, no, so I don't know if you saw, but they John Gruber had Craig Vigeri D and Jaws. Yeah.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.160]   And they talk specifically about what he said was like hobbyist features,
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.080]   but that boot camp was not surviving the transition in the future for that kind of stuff.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.400]   It's going to be virtualization. Yeah. And they said it'll be just as good. You won't need it. But,
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.640]   of course, people who like to run on bare metal say. So yeah. So if Windows are like,
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.600]   and some developers love the Mac because they could run Unix and Linux and OS and Mac OS and
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:14.240]   Windows all on one machine. So any for a lot of people, Windows is not relevant. Like if you're
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.800]   on Chrome OS or you're on Mac OS, it's not relevant. But for other people, it's an absolute half to
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.880]   half. So they're going to have to. The same way like now gamers just have like, they have their
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.840]   Mac book and they have their gaming PC. They may just like do other things more on their gaming PC.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:35.280]   Yeah. This is we have people who are older who grew up through the floppy disk wars. Remember,
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.680]   remember when they tried to give us three and a half inch floppies? We said, no, five and a quarter
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:48.160]   or die. We had to understand that we have to understand that there are people that are saying
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:54.160]   that, hey, if I can buy an $80 device that fills in the gaps that my $2000 computer doesn't have,
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:21:00.800]   and I don't want and just as you said, Renee, I would much rather buy a $300 to $700 game system,
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:06.320]   console game system to do the gaming. I don't care that that that this platform is not necessarily
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.840]   good for gaming. As for what we give up, I'm still concerned that Apple's going to walk things down
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:17.680]   more than I would like. I'm still concerned that if I have if my if my favorite CD Ripper
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:22.960]   is a open source project that hasn't been updated since three years, but still works perfectly fine
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:29.200]   on a machine that that will accept that, hey, look, dude, I trust this app and I own this computer.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   So you're going to run this app, even if it means my doom, I'm concerned that we're going to lose
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:38.480]   some of that power. I think that's that yes, I'm less worried about it today than I was after,
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:47.200]   let's say our 81 of watching videos, but I'm still slipping this in my back the back of my mind.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.640]   Well, it's interesting, for instance, this alternate reduce security boot.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:56.400]   One of the things Apple called out was that for those of you who need certain kernel extensions
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:01.120]   that we're no longer going to allow, because that's an that's a real insecurity. That's
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.760]   surprised the hell out of keeping it. Yeah, you could do it in less secure boot and you can
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.400]   boot your own kernel extensions. It's it's that kind of thing.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.840]   For now, saying that for now, but it doesn't encourage me a little bit.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.800]   Ability boat. Yeah. And they have to be signed, right? So that's the only other concession.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:22.640]   Apple, I understand that Apple is facing a world where there's really two threats to users privacy
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:28.400]   and security. And they've decided to double down on both. But there's a consequence to doing that,
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.680]   which is freedom. So I understand they're trying to balance those
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:40.000]   dueling priorities. And they're probably going to come down on privacy and security,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.800]   because that's what most people want. Well, I like the default. If you're smart enough to go in
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.320]   and turn it off, then you probably understand the consequences of turning it off. And that
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.880]   seems to me like a really good user user interface balance. So what 100%?
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.560]   You talk a little bit, Renee, about the changes in Big Sur on iMore.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:06.000]   A lot of the concern, I'm trying again, trying to bring up the the concern or the issues people
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.160]   worried about now that I've done cheerleading for about eight hours on this stuff.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:18.640]   There are. We don't criticize it, Leo. They can't fix it. Okay. True. And I will say again,
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:24.640]   the minute they ship the first, what it looks like to be a maybe a iMac or a 13 inch MacBook Pro
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:32.640]   with it, Apple Silicon, I will be in line to buy it. I can't wait. But there are some concerns.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:40.720]   Everybody has all long been concerned about the melding of iOS, iPadOS and macOS. And this seems
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:46.560]   to have been furthered in some in odd ways. Like iPadOS is more like macOS and macOS is more like
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:53.360]   iPadOS. Read those tea leaves for me, Renee. So the thing that struck me when I was talking to
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.920]   people this week is that Apple and I think a lot of us view these very differently, especially Twitter,
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:03.440]   because as much as I love Twitter, it is very loud, but very niche. And a lot of the concerns
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.000]   that Twitter brings up are things like, Oh, the silicon is becoming similar, the operating system
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.480]   components are becoming similar. Things about the interface layers are becoming similar.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:16.640]   And when I talk to people at Apple, they don't look at the products at all like that. Like those
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:21.440]   are just little Lego blocks for them, but they're still building different products over them.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.840]   And not the least of which because both of those products are billion dollar businesses. And until
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.760]   one of them starts to slide, they don't want to lose those billions of dollars that they get from
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:35.280]   both of those revenue streams. But I think moreover, it's like what we saw. And I hate to go back
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.840]   to Steve's truck analogy because it's, it's, you know, it's, it's slabered in so many ways.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:45.040]   But with the trucks are super popular now. And in part, because people started adding car
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.040]   like amenities to them, like they became more comfortable. They started using the same component.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.520]   So they became easier to manufacture. But we don't look at a truck and say, Oh, it's got tires and
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.840]   an axle and a steering wheel and these kinds of seats. Oh, they're merging it with the car.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.680]   You know, because on one side, you have the SUV on the other side, you have Optimus Prime. There's
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:07.040]   like a wide range of these things. And I think to Apple, that's how they see it. They want badly
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:12.800]   the efficiencies that come from having all the same components for these things. But to them,
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:18.400]   they're still building the iPad car and the Mac truck. And they really don't understand why we
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:23.920]   keep giving them static over it. It's more, it's more being worried than anything else. And
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:28.960]   as the more I think about it, the more I realize that a lot of my concern is that I don't see the
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:36.400]   same sort of delight from developers. iPhone developers and watch developers have a certain
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.360]   amount of delight in coming up with something interesting and coming up with something that's
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:47.040]   unique. I don't see the same sort of delight universally in the Mac community. I'm sorry,
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:54.320]   no, I'm going to walk that back as a half a step. I'm saying that once we, if we encourage people to
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:59.920]   be iPhone developers that then transition to Macs, if that's what happens, I'm wondering if we
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:04.880]   can convince iPhone developers to say, no, no, no, stop, stop, don't just use extra screen real
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:10.160]   estate. There are opportunities here for creating an amazing Mac app that are just as exciting as
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:15.120]   this wonderful iPhone app that you started off with. And so that's my concern that if Apple,
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:20.880]   even without intending to sense the signal that if you're hip, if you're new, if you're
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.400]   wonderful, if you're cool, if you want to change the world, you're building a Mac app, you're
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:29.840]   able to get an iPhone app. And now it's easy for you to actually make a Mac app to sure if you want to.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:37.520]   That's kind of won me over. I mean, they made messages, right? That's an incredible endorsement
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:42.720]   of a catalyst as a technology, because that is the most important app for Apple. Like they probably,
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:48.000]   like, you can argue Safari, but just like out of usage numbers. And that's one of the things that
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.240]   keeps people, when people talk about the ecosystem, they mentioned airdrop, they mentioned messages,
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.920]   you know, it's about all of that. And they're at the point now, like they certainly weren't
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.160]   three years ago, certainly weren't two years ago. This year, they're putting messages in
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.000]   catalyst. And that's the sort of thing I look for, because it's not words. It's like,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.120]   we're confident enough in our technology that we can finally give you sent with lasers.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:14.400]   But wouldn't it be more significant, at least from my point of view, to create a version of
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:20.240]   messages for Android rather than a version of messages for Mac? I think that would be the most
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.840]   that would be an important step for the app and for the entire platform. And also,
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.480]   protect people together. I think they have time, man. They have time.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.160]   I think that's not in their business interests. They like the science garden.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:37.440]   They are making, I have to say, they're making a, I mean, for a gated community, it's really nice.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:42.320]   Well, I will also say that there's two things Apple does really badly, internet services and
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:47.040]   other platform apps. It's still true. I mean, there's like, look at Windows and like,
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.920]   you look at music. The music is fine on Android, but like, I don't know if it's anyone who
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:58.640]   would say it's best in class on Android and iTunes never was. And Apple's also like,
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:04.080]   they have a business model based approach. Like, what like this has to add to our money and or our
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.680]   ecosystem. And that doesn't either. And I don't think people would pay a subscription price.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.120]   They bundle it with TV or something. I don't know.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.600]   I'm with you, Andy, because I use Android, but yeah.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.400]   Outside North America, people don't care.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.080]   Yeah, they don't really. That's actually a bigger problem, right?
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:26.400]   A lot of what Apple has been doing is to appease, to appeal to other international markets.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.640]   That's what it grows. Also, also it's line and yeah, it's hard to be what's app.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:36.720]   Also, this is this is an iffy time to put lots and lots of money into developing a messaging app
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.480]   with end to end encryption. Yeah, you might have to redo it.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.200]   It's wonderful. And now it's now now we have to put in some back doors.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.920]   Yeah. Yeah, you might have to do that over there.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:57.600]   So Big Sur looks more like iPadOS. Couldn't help but notice Jason Snell observed this in Mac world.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.480]   Those touch targets look very suitable for touch.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.560]   This is so funny to me because I was watching everybody on Twitter and it became like a
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.840]   Rorschach test because everybody who believes that the iPad and the Mac are merging said,
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:14.640]   oh, look, everybody who wants a touchscreen Mac said, oh, look, the touch targets are way better.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.400]   Bigger, that's a sure sign that it's going to be a touchscreen Mac. And then the people who just
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.560]   can't wait for Apple glasses are like, oh, look, they took all the sharp edges off, which is a no
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:30.000]   no, so therefore this is part of Apple. And then other people are like, oh, no, it looks more like
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.880]   an iPad. They're finally bringing the iPad and Mac together. And the last people are like, I just
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:39.680]   I just want OS 10 back and you get off my lawn. It was just like a whole some spectrum of
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.760]   so everyone saw what they wanted. I you don't think touchscreen Macs?
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.800]   Oh, I think I should have been a heartbeat. It's like Eddie, like remember, Steve Jobs had no
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.800]   small tablets. People are going to shave their fingers down. Nobody wants that. Nobody wants
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.680]   video on an iPod. Nobody wants a pencil. Nobody like and then like Eddie Q is like, oh, but Steve,
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.800]   like we could get a lot more. Oh, okay, great. You guys go do it. You screw it up. You're fired.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:08.080]   But that's fine. You go. I feel like I feel like and one of the things Apple is the burden on
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:14.080]   Apple is going to be on these new Apple Silicon Mac and Tush is they can't they have to be redesigned,
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:21.040]   right? You can't just ship the MacBook Pro 13 in the same case with Apple Silicon. Nobody will
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:26.960]   say, well, I don't be an easy lot. Yeah, it'd be an easy loss to take. Yeah, you need to do a new
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:32.720]   design. What a great time to do touch. I just want to say it's like the well, they'll definitely do
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:40.480]   that, right? I'm not so much excited about touch so much as I'm excited about an iPad Pro that
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:50.000]   iPad Pro form factor that runs Mac OS because with being able to run to try out so many different
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:57.680]   like Windows Windows designs, never enough that got me like hooked on Windows. But when Samsung
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:03.520]   sends me like a Windows 10 tablet that looks looks and plays exactly like an iPad, meaning that when
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:08.080]   I just want to comic book reader, it will just be a comic book reader. So something I just want to
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:12.720]   toss in my bag and uses a book reader or toss in my bag and just uses a movie reader. But then
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:18.080]   when I really need it to be a to run my desktop apps, it's there as well. That is an amazingly
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:23.040]   compelling factor. And you're going to get that or touch or not. I mean, they said that you could
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:29.360]   run iOS apps on Mac OS, but it probably goes both way. Yeah, that's it. That's going to be a really
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:35.120]   interesting teardown when when a whole bunch of engineers who do not work for Apple try to figure
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:43.520]   out what is actually physically preventing a Mac from running on an iPad Pro hardware. Not that
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:48.000]   not I'm not talking about how do we jailbreak this so that we can install Mac OS on it. But we
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.920]   I'm really keen to find out the answer to the question. Is this simply a dogmatic question of
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.800]   we don't make Macs that look like iPads or is there well here are the problems we were run into
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:06.400]   if we try to make an A12 based Mac inside like a really, really super scale. Super low RAM and
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:12.720]   zero exposed PCI lanes. I think are the two things that have to fix right away. Yeah, but still it's
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:17.920]   that's what they fixed by the way in the developer kit, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, a little bit.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:23.680]   Is that interesting? That's exactly what they did in the 16 gigs of RAM and ports.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:31.760]   We yeah, but by the way, I don't think that was too hard for them to do. So it's conceivable
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:37.680]   that Silicon team is really good. It's conceivable that they could have a very smooth gradient
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:43.200]   from the I'm gonna start at the watch all the way up to the Mac Pro. There could be a very
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.360]   soon and they set a family of so sees family, which also that was confusing to some people because
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:52.080]   some people assume so see means no discrete graphics even at the highest end. No, that's the beauty
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:56.000]   of it. That's one of the reasons that's one of the great benefits they're going to get. It explains
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.640]   why they thumb their nose at Nvidia for so long. They pushed metal so hard. They struggled along
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:08.400]   with this Vega crap because they knew we're going to be doing GPUs. And you know, we talked a little
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:13.520]   bit about gamers PC gamers. Oh, they're never going to be interested in Apple Silicon.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.360]   But wait a little these game companies and the gamers see what kind of
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:23.680]   GPUs Apple can put together 120 frame per second fortnight. Yeah, I see no reason why Apple
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:31.280]   to assume that Apple doesn't have equally amazing GPU capable and also imagine a stick like I
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:37.760]   they've put so much money into not just the Mac Pro, but the concept of the new Mac Pro.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:44.160]   And the ability to for example, if you have Apple Silicon Mac and you do a lot of Final Cut Pro
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.480]   work and you're like, I'm going to add a ProRes accelerator to it. But if you do something else,
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:52.720]   maybe there's like a dedicated math accelerator or audio engine accelerator and we sort of lose
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:58.640]   the concept of what a GPU is, you bring home your let your super light 12 inch MacBook ARM
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.560]   and you sorry, I can't say ARM anymore Apple Silicon. And then you plug that into whatever
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:07.200]   the dock thing is. And suddenly you're driving eight, you know, nine K displays is ludicrous.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.080]   What what you can do when you start controlling your own Silicon device to me. Yeah.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:17.760]   It's great. And again, it's happening at exactly the wrong time because PCs are dead. So I wish
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.240]   I wish they'd done this 10 years ago. They'll have a good they have good 10 years before
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:27.120]   this really hits. But I honestly think that we're going to live in a different world with
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:32.720]   the computing. Well, it's there's the other classical computing known as boring computers.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:38.160]   There's there's a reason why boring fleet style cars sell. Oh, he's so because people need people
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.760]   need people need people need boring stuff. They don't care about that. So we make boring potatoes.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.440]   That's not what Apple makes. They make them. Oh, no, no. They don't make tourists.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:50.960]   They just understood. I thought you're talking about like windows and like windows tile.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:35:00.160]   I honestly think windows even has much many legs to I think honestly, that's why such as you said,
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:04.240]   that's why Satya Nadella runs Microsoft. It's it's going to have to have tools to make their
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:08.080]   glasses absolutely at least for a while though. It's hard to make. No, no, no, but I can develop
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:13.520]   right now on VS code running on a server on a thin client. You could do plenty of develop.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:19.600]   You don't know there's no and what's changed is it used to be somebody would sit down at their
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:26.560]   computer that this is it and everything would be there. But now we can see we have many computers,
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.880]   many places that we would want access to that stuff. It doesn't really make sense for
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:36.720]   anything to be located in one spot. You can run VisiCalc on the cloud report.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:42.880]   Yeah, we have we have sinking but sinking everybody who's tried sinking. It's a kind of
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:49.760]   you know that Dropbox kind of that's not that's not the future. The future is a single source of
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:54.880]   truth that's accessible from all your devices. And there's no and it probably was doing much of
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:00.480]   the computing. You're absolutely right. And that's why Microsoft is as invested so heavily in
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.880]   virtualization to make the hardware irrelevant but to make sure that their software remains
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.800]   completely relevant. So when you're trying to when you're when you've got a company that needs
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:15.120]   5,000 seats and you're you come to them saying that here but by our servers instead or better
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:22.480]   yet by access to our cloud our cloud of power instead we can add you can add 10,000 seats whenever
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:27.360]   you want. And plus you won't have you won't have users were able to screw anything up beyond the
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.400]   ability of a remote administrator to put things right again. So yeah, it's it kind of it also
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:38.080]   makes me wonder I don't think I saw a lot I don't think I saw any news about Mac virtualization
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:45.040]   not that this is a big deal for Apple again they've got every other they've got a roadmap and I don't
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:50.240]   that's that's nothing more than a than a detour I think off the main roadmap. But it would be
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:56.720]   interesting if Apple simply said that we we want the we want the Mac to have an ability and a mixed
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:02.880]   OS or mixed missed desk mixed desktop sort of shop. And if that means that we will be able to
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:09.520]   we will allow to people to at least buy seats by virtualization licenses for Mac OS then so be it
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:14.800]   that would be very very interesting to me. Well, interesting too is before WWDC Apple rolled out
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:18.560]   a bunch of education updates you know they typically get a bunch of stuff out of the way.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.840]   And one of them that I thought was really interesting was a very Google like thing where
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.960]   they previously had multi user for iPad for schools and they it turned out that some like some people
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.200]   didn't even want that so they have a new ability where you just pick up an iPad you do whatever you
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.800]   want to do and then it just blows your session away the next person picks it up and it's a whole
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.640]   new clean environment for them which again other systems have been doing for years but that's
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:43.840]   literally your thin client there you have an iPad that's very capable that can push pixels
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:48.480]   around like nobody's business but it's completely ephemeral from one student to the next. Yeah,
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:56.000]   well that's what happens right. That's clearly the future. I know nobody everybody's going kicking
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.960]   and screaming saying but that's what we got away with away from with one person one PC.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:05.680]   Isn't it ambient computing the Leo it's like the Star Trek computer or Jarvis or Friday where
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.200]   we just have the words. Like you said that no you don't care where the course. I'm asking you
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:13.120]   something just do it for me. Right. That's what you want. You know and Apple still you know Carson's
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.880]   saying well Apple could sell secure boxes. Yeah but they don't need to be a computer.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:21.600]   Apple could have a very good business. They shouldn't be. They shouldn't be. Apple probably
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:29.520]   will have a very good business. I'd say in 2030 selling beautiful gleaming chrome secure enclave
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:35.040]   boxes that you put in your foyer or if you look at the three things that Tim Cook is actually willing
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.320]   to talk about which probably means are the most important things that he thinks that people need
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:45.760]   to hear about Apple. It's AR and VR. It's ambient computing and it's automation and all of those
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:50.560]   things are what we talk about when we talk about the future of computing. It's things doing stuff
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:55.600]   for us at our command and popping up things for us to interact with when and if we need them.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:01.920]   Yeah. It's very it's very telling that one of the what I think is one of the best technologies
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:07.600]   that Apple introduced in the past 10 years back to my Mac is kind of fell by the wayside certainly
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:12.160]   not a priority. It's mostly been rolled into features that are kind of invisible in other parts of
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:16.800]   the experience. When you get to the idea of it doesn't it doesn't matter where you are in the
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:21.600]   world or what device you're using. We are going to do all the backend stuff to make sure that you
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:26.000]   can access your files back home or back in the office if you want to. We will make sure that we
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.480]   can find that connection if you want to run a run a mirror desktop on whatever device you're using
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:37.360]   right here and right now. That was such super powerful stuff and I used it all the time.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:46.560]   Admittedly, I used it on a Hackintosh Dell notebook but still. I use it. It's it's it points out that
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.280]   Apple at some point had that discussion internally and decided that we would much rather take the
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.840]   feature what we're much of our ask ourselves. Why do people want to go back to the Mac and if
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:00.240]   it all actually it's mostly files great will make it really really easy for them to sink into iCloud
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:05.600]   and do they want to actually have open up their own desk their their desktops remotely. Okay. Well
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:09.920]   we'll make sure that there's some cross device compatibility that goes on and we don't we don't
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:14.960]   the idea of having a fixed piece of hardware that is running or able to be woken up from sleep
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.840]   attached to a network 24/7 is not the most elegant solution to what we see as a problem. Yeah.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.480]   It's really interesting. It plugs it all the time.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:28.160]   Let's take a little break and then when we come back there you guys have been busy.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:33.360]   I've been relying on you. You guys I've been watching some of the developer
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:38.400]   developer-y stuff because basically. Did you watch the AR kit for demo yet Leo? Yeah. No. See I'm
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:44.880]   doing stuff. I'm watching stuff. The coolest stuff is it's like I've got at least three things on my
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:50.400]   list that why the hell was this not in like the two hour long like like keynote really.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.920]   This is the most awesome thing ever. Oh good. That's what I'm going to ask you about when we come
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:59.280]   back from the break. Because I've been watching the boring stuff you know Swift UI and you know I
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:04.080]   mean. No but you want to code Leo that makes sense. That's right. I now this is kind of stimulated
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:09.840]   for years all I did was device independent code you know command line maybe a little tiny bit of
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:15.360]   gooey that didn't look like anybody's real gooey but I'm much I much more interested in that because
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:20.880]   that's the the point of coding for me I'm a hobbyist is thinking about problems and solving
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:27.120]   them in code not the painstaking and now that I'm doing it I really remember how bad it is.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:35.680]   Drawing of screens and dragging of buttons. Oh my god shoot me now. It feels like 90% of
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:43.920]   Mac code these days and certainly a iOS code is gooey designed. But I like the logic underneath
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:48.320]   you know I like the model I don't want the viewer the view model. Remember two years ago when Craig
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:55.440]   changed dot red to dot blue and every developer in the room. Yeah it's a lot of that because so
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.120]   that's what I'm watching and I realize that's the bitter pill I'll have to swallow if I want to
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:05.440]   make an iOS app but I do love the idea of making something that will run in the entire Apple ecosystem.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.960]   I think that's interesting. It's a fun project for me and so that's what I'm watching but you
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:14.720]   guys watch the sexy stuff so I want to know what the future is going to hold Renee Richie and
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:20.880]   Andy Inaco we are talking about well you know we're talking about the good stuff.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:26.400]   The juicy stuff. I showed today thank god I had a good night's sleep last night. I showed
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:31.200]   today brought to you by my mattress. If my mattress could speak it would be moaning and groaning.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:35.280]   I'd say get off of me Leo you're so fat why'd you gain so much weight?
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:41.280]   No it would be saying Leo come to me. I think it is it beckons to me come to me.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:46.640]   Get in get in this lovely Casper bed with the Casper sheets and the Casper pillows.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:53.280]   Let the glow light lull you to sleep. A beautiful world awaits and then I start dreaming and it's
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:43:01.120]   like what am I doing. Look we can't Casper can't fix your dreams but Casper can give you
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:06.560]   a great night's sleep. It's a sleep brand that makes amazing. Here it is my beautiful this is my new
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:12.960]   the newest Casper mattress. This is the hybrid and by the way that compact box I'm opening
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:19.120]   is that's a king size. That's the biggest they make it's a giant mattress. You open it up it goes
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:26.160]   it's like it's like in a sous vide bag and as soon as you unseal that the air goes
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:31.520]   and it just goes full size. But one of the things I love about Casper is no airing. I bought mattresses
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:36.480]   much more expensive mattresses from the mattress store where they say well wait a three days before
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:41.280]   you sleep on it because we have to get all we have to air it out. Not the Casper. It smells fresh
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:47.120]   it feels good. So there are now a number of Casper models. I want to kind of describe them for you.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:52.320]   The original Casper mattress combines multiple supportive memory foams that does something unique
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:58.160]   it gives you a quality sleep service with both the right amount of sink watch see how my my hips
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:02.720]   go in there and then the right amount of bounce so you get firmness because I you know my back will
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:08.800]   be laughing at me sleeping. No I'm saying like you know how like sometimes you watch food videos
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:13.040]   and you're really really hungry. I'm watching how much you're doing that mattress. I really
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:18.080]   wish I had like a new mattress and that I was on it right now. My mattress is 10 years old. It's
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:23.680]   so good. It's so good. But I have to say I did make a slight error because I unboxed it in the foyer.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:31.680]   It's just not a good place to nap. Let me put it that way. Oh no. But we do we eventually move
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.480]   into the bedroom of course. The breathable design though is nice too especially in these hot summer
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.680]   nights because it sleeps cool regulates your body temperature throughout the night.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:47.040]   People love the original Casper with over 20,000 reviews on Casper Amazon and Google. It's now
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:51.440]   4.8 stars. I don't think you can get better than that. It's rapidly becoming the internet's
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:56.000]   favorite mattress. But that's just one. There's also the wave which features a patent-pending
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.880]   premium support system to mirror the natural shape of your body. The essential which saves you
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:05.840]   money. This is the one you give the kid going off to college or you know you get for your first place.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.520]   Streamline design at a price it won't keep you up at night. Still a great mattress. Still a
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:15.200]   wonderful mattress. The hybrid that's the one I'm sleeping on has the pressure relief of the award
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:19.840]   winning phone but it also has durable yet gentle springs which gives me a firmer edge. Casper is
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:25.760]   amazing. We have I love my Casper pillow the sheets. It's just a better sleep experience all around.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:32.320]   Now you may say well that's nice Leo. That's nice but why should I because Casper and they
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:37.840]   invented this direct to consumer model for mattresses. They realized early on the real
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:43.280]   expensive mattress isn't the manufacturer isn't the shipping isn't the selling isn't the marketing.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:48.960]   It's the stores. The stores market up most of the time at least doubling the price. If you didn't
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:54.400]   have mattress stores you could save a lot of money by selling direct to customers. That's what
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:46:00.160]   Casper does. Now a lot of customers when they first said this but I want to try before I buy
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:05.600]   Casper said okay here's what we're going to do 100 nights. You get to sleep on it for as long as
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:10.080]   100 nights at any time in the first 100 nights if you say it's not for me we will come and get it.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:13.920]   You don't have to jam it back in that box. We will pick it up. We will take it off your hands.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:19.920]   We will refund you every penny. There is absolutely no risk and I don't know about I mean for a free
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:25.360]   trial that's the longest I've ever heard of 100 nights more than three months. Free shipping
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:31.360]   painless returns in the US and Canada Renee. Get a Casper mattress today. I always say
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:35.680]   Canada Renee every time I say Canada I say Renee. I've got so many Casper products. I really
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:42.400]   appreciate their Canadian service. Yes thank you Casper. You can save $100 towards select mattresses

[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:07.440]   In fact I'm going to go back to bed right now. You guys take over. You guys take over.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:13.840]   That's great. Welcome to Comic Book Weekly. I know that's what I'm going to stop you.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:20.480]   Do you find it going to a digital approach now? At the very controversial cutting their ties
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.680]   to diamond distributors like Renee. Were you as freaked out as I was about that?
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:29.840]   All I'm going to say is that 2020 is the worst DCU movie. I've seen some. Oh my god I know.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.000]   I think that is going to snap his fingers any minute now.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.200]   It would be a blessing at this point. It might be. If you can find it Leo Matthew Panzerino
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:46.720]   retweeted something on the AR 4.0 demos that shows a visualization of this new technology they
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:52.000]   have which basically pulls down everything from Apple Maps including all the look around features
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.200]   along with the point cloud of the vicinity that you're in all the information you've acquired
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:04.560]   about that vicinity and like orientation of your device and everything. It's sort of mind blowing
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:11.520]   how step by step a year after year they've been rapidly expanding AR kit. I mean I'm sure for
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:16.160]   obvious reasons but just the amount of stuff they're showing off this year is ridiculous.
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:21.280]   So it's a video right? It's a Twitter video. He retweeted it a couple days ago.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:29.360]   If you can get past all the bread AR kit for I do not think it's possible for anyone who doesn't
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:36.000]   Hoover up what's going on in AR to internalize how wild this is. This is the metaverse building
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:42.640]   equivalent to he just tweeted it out. Explain. This is a he's retweeting Joel Bernstein.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.960]   And I take it this is the Apple presentation you were talking about.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.200]   Yeah without worrying about any of this complexity.
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.560]   Yeah well I just missed it because it was only. So when using two tracking.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:57.760]   So let's see the here's the video map data from Apple Maps around your current location.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:03.760]   Part of this data is a localization map that contains feature points of the surrounding area
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:09.600]   that can be seen from the street. Then with the localization map your current location
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.800]   and images from this is just mapping for this is not a our kit.
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:20.400]   That's the rest of it is all a is all a our kit. So you mean I can take all this data that Apple's
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:25.760]   been generating for years for maps and their version of what do they call it they don't call
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:32.240]   it Street View but look around. Yeah and it's now available as data for my augmented reality.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:38.080]   Yes. Whoa. That's why. Experience if you don't make apps but experience.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:45.520]   That's why he's talking about the metaverse right. Yeah. So what do you think is going to happen.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:50.000]   Grand Theft Auto Cambridge Massachusetts.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:58.320]   I hope boy that well the metaverse implies that you would be able to put on your Apple branded AR
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:05.040]   glasses and be in Cambridge right and I could go and meet Andy at the MIT flea market and we could
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:11.920]   wander around right. It would it would be it would be an interesting application to say that I don't
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:17.600]   if all I have to do is transmit the part that is Andy and I could I don't have to transmit the
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.600]   part behind him but we're not talking about chat here that that would still be a really
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:25.760]   inefficient way of doing it. I think this is one of those really great features where
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:32.720]   the opportunities for a really really clever developer to make something great with it are
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:37.360]   apparent enough that you just go ahead and do it and then let those let those folks create those
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:41.920]   opportunities like imagine an architectural app where you want to figure out like what will
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:48.480]   happen to shadow lines if we put this building here or what will happen if I want to I'm considering
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:54.960]   visiting this location or having a music festival in this location at this time of year and also
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:51:01.280]   I've access to to 50 years of daily weather data for that date in the date in the year and now I
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:05.760]   can actually figure out not only figure out what it's going to look like but also model with the
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:11.120]   traffic flow is going to be as to what actual consumers are going to benefit from it beyond
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:16.960]   look around anybody's guess. I think I think that some features are there for this is such
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:21.280]   a this is such an interesting we've we've spent so much money developing this data set it we would
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:27.120]   not be realizing the value of this data set if all we did was used to enhance maps we want to
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:31.760]   enhance the entire platform and the only way to enhance the entire platform is to make a new
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:35.200]   resource available to developers and that's why they're making this data set available.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:46.160]   So do I need a new iPad Pro with LiDAR to take advantage of this? I know as a developer I don't
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:50.320]   but I would probably it would work better. It's better well it's going to be in stages like right
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:54.160]   now it's on the iPad Pro because they just needed to get LiDAR out in the world and they showed
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:59.280]   some demos now with the new depth API and with the new heat map for measuring depth all the things
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:04.080]   that you can do with that and everybody presumes that's coming to the iPhone this year and to Apple
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:09.360]   glasses eventually but just to make Andy's Map Break Weekly experience complete you could imagine
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:14.880]   like Pokemon Go or Wizards United where they are actually interacting with the real world it's not
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:20.720]   just a digital thing happens to actually layered on top of you but it's running around trees it's
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:26.480]   climbing buildings you look up and there's the Hogwarts dragon curled around the bank on your
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:31.440]   street down the corner there's King Kong on the Empire State Building because I've always wanted
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:35.680]   to see King Kong on the Empire and they announced that too they announced that you can place AR
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:42.240]   objects right now with iOS 14 in what they call points of interest like like major geographical
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:48.240]   locations around the world. This is interesting so this is a essentially a heat map that shows not
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:52.880]   temperature but depth closer to me it's cooler the how far the way it's hotter
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:53:00.240]   and that is a smooth gradient that is very so that's why you could place and totally
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:06.080]   occluded like you can you can do full object occlusion with that map that's one of the biggest
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:12.880]   one the biggest steps forward for AR is for the ability for okay your Pokemon to walk behind a
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:19.120]   chair and the chair is covering up where is is occluding a character or an object that's supposed
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:24.160]   to be walked behind it it's really really cool it was it was very very cool to say everybody gather
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:30.480]   around was a three years ago four years ago WWC gather around this strangely tech wood brain
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:37.120]   textured table yeah and play ping pong and enjoy our AR experience oh no no no no no don't move the
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:43.760]   phone off the table but it's going to be this is see this is like this is a great look forward
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:49.680]   looking thing for when we do have the sort of a hollow lens style wearable AR glasses where
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:54.320]   it's not just projecting a small piece of information that's useful it's not just displaying a widget
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:59.520]   it is actually doing magic leap sort of stuff because that's when you get things like i'm going to put
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:05.280]   a display on that wall over there that simply reminds me of like when someone is online or not
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:10.960]   I need to talk to that person and that's when you get interesting I will say hippie like but really
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:16.160]   still very very interesting interfaces like like what google showed off at i/o a few years ago but
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:21.280]   never delivered on saying that well yes we yes we could when giving you map directions that you're
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:25.440]   that you're following as you're walking just give you like floating arrows to go around things but
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:30.560]   wouldn't you rather be like following a fox that just look at foxes and and the fox is waiting at
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.920]   the street corner and sitting and like cleaning its paws because he's waiting for you to catch up
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:38.000]   and then he's going to like actually go left to show you to keep following the fox isn't that
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.920]   more interesting because this it taps into uh it taps into software that is that's in our brains
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:48.800]   that is not that is pre language you know there was a time which we didn't have turn left at this
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:54.800]   next intersection make sure that you're on elm street but simply that oh well i'm going to i i know
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:59.360]   that there's a fire over there and i want to go to the fire so i'm just going to walk until the fire
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:04.320]   is getting bigger and bigger in my mind's eye that's not just cute it's not just the the ultimate
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:11.360]   caveman skeu morphism this is making things that are in things that you you can infer how it works
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:16.080]   that you're you're wired up to simply understand that this is what you're meant to do as opposed
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:22.320]   to learning a clever new interface so this is why this sort of stuff could be uh quite transformative
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:28.080]   so you're gonna point earlier leo and andy's point now the reality kit is also added um video as a
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:34.400]   texture so you can do things like place a screen on the wall and watch your tv and ar but also map
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:39.360]   the screen to like an object and have an animated face or map it to water like a river and have
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:44.400]   an animated texture so it's just ramping up the realism that you can deliver and also the certain
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:48.640]   like the opportunistic uh interfaces you know we all see in the movies right like the screen just
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.640]   appears in front of them and he taps it and it's really the gestures that are doing the work but as
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:57.440]   a human we relate to whatever the physical object is in front of us so if you're just mapping a video
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:01.520]   of an interface and reacting to what we're moving our hands on just makes that experience nicer and
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:08.080]   that's that's again shipping in ios 14 watch as i run this augmented reality vase all over this chair
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:20.000]   um power to be your best so uh it's apparently doing ray casting uh i don't see any lighting
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.720]   effects but at least it knows what carries it's it's good it looks like when she was a kid yeah there
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:29.680]   you go now vase is always that attention to the fat to the surface of that object it's just like
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:34.080]   you're you're running that around the chair yeah that's pretty amazing and the and the object's moving
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:42.480]   uh this uh means i would guess that lydar in every uh future apple device yeah yeah yeah i mean
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:47.520]   it's privacy respecting too which in ways that regular cameras have been problematic in the past
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:52.240]   which is a nice benefit for apple yeah because yeah the lydar and radar are really important
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:57.760]   technologies because you can't it's it's very clever to say hey this is this this cameras this
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:01.920]   device is a camera that's taking pictures at 60 frames per second as soon as people say camera
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:05.680]   taking pictures they don't want any part of it right particularly if you're in the room with it
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:10.800]   but when you say well no it's actually radar it's uh so it's not actually seeing anything it's only
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:15.760]   taking really really high depth like distance measurements and let's not let's not mention that
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:20.480]   if it's sufficiently sufficient technology that it's actually mapping everybody's faces as they go
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:25.200]   when so they're getting much much more information than pictures but but you know what i mean here's
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:31.600]   the face mapping uh demo that you were talking about and this is more than mimogies right this
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:39.200]   you could you could map it on to uh i mean you can make uh what is that um snapchat filters yeah
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:46.640]   wow e wow that's exciting i must say that is a breakthrough technology i think it's more it's more
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:52.000]   and one of the many things that impress it for this are when it becomes stuff like uh uh a kit
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:57.440]   that you could uh a when it becomes like a plug-in for i-movie uh not not even final cut but just
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:02.880]   well i want to make a movie but it's only me and my two friends and neither of them are dogs or
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:08.880]   orcs and i really well i really need a dog in this scene let's just make let's just do motion like
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:14.640]   on the fly motion cameras or that this character right that's the sort because i i keep coming back
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:20.240]   to how wonderful how incredible it is that you have all of these youtube creators that are well on
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:26.160]   in their 20s or in their teens who grew up with non-linear editing and a high definition camera
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:31.600]   right on their phones and just like i learned how to write because i had access to word processors
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:36.640]   from from basically the first time i tried to use that tried to learn how to write uh which made
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:41.520]   me which which gave me certain advantages that other generations didn't have once we get into
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:45.840]   the sort of thing where now the generation that the the generation z or double z or whatever they're
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:50.640]   calling it these days the this generation says whenever they have creative ideas that involve
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:58.720]   actually i really want the story i'm telling to take place in space but imagine that uh that the
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:04.720]   mongol hordes are a space conquering race and and ten minutes later or 20 minutes later just by
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:09.440]   downloading some stock 3d imagery or by building it themselves their story that they're telling is
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:13.680]   taking place wherever they want it to happen i'm so excited to see what happens when that becomes
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:22.320]   casual and free yeah uh what else did you see that you like fill me in save me the time yeah
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:28.880]   one one of the one of the biggest things was uh just uh that there's one there i think there's only
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:35.760]   one area in which apple is objectively failing they are not doing the job and is reaching a crisis
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:41.440]   point and it is wrong that they aren't moving making visible steps to fix it and that's the app review
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:47.760]   process uh making it so uh so opaque and so nope we've made this decision and now you're powerless
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:52.640]   to change it uh the they made some announcements that are basically saying that number one if we
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:57.440]   have a problem with your app we will still allow you to do bug fixes so we're not going to say that
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.440]   that's a security problem a security problem that has to stick because we don't like the way that
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:07.680]   you're doing it using a controller and number two they are giving the they at least giving lip
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:14.160]   service to saying that uh now we are giving you more opportunities to debate why we why we made this
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:20.000]   why your app should not be affected by this change and also not only talking it's almost like looking
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.280]   at the change to the constitution saying that not only that but you can also argue that this rule
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:30.720]   itself is bogus and you need to change it and the idea that they're they're even putting that into
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:36.240]   like a public uh a public statement during WWDC shows that they are aware that they've been
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:40.880]   they've been hugely dropping the ball on this and that they need to make changes i thought that
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.520]   that was one of the biggest pieces of news from WWDC because that's that is the thing that whether
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.400]   developers are complaining in public or complaining in private when i'm talking to friends of mine
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.960]   that is the one thing that makes my jaw drop every single time that says that wow you make one of
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:00.720]   the most important uh and there are four people that i could say this uh you are making one of the
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:05.600]   most important and popular apps on the Mac platform and apple is just screwing you around and you're
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.800]   giving you're being given no uh no uh indication that they're even thinking about this carefully
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:15.760]   that they're just simply a low level person they saw like i've read like come up on a on a panel
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.240]   so they press the bananade button and that's and you can't do anything about it and it's always shocked
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:26.000]   me every single time i am so glad to see that at least we'll see if this actually actually pays off
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.880]   but i'm so glad to see that apple is is recognizing that they should probably not be screwing over
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:37.040]   developers quite so gleefully as they have been in the past i didn't have a chance to see it all but
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.840]   i think there was some iap changes to the people said were positive coming out of WWDC what's the
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:46.080]   iap in app purchase in the uh in it's all you know so iap had the in app purchases yeah some people
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.560]   seemed i didn't have a chance to follow up on it but some people seemed happy with some of the
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.240]   changes that were being there was this all precipitated by the fight with base camp and
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:02:01.040]   dh h over uh hey or is it just um exacerbated by i mean like i i think i think a lot of things like
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:06.560]   it's also the society we've had enough well like also like we we've been stuck at home for months the
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:10.560]   entire world was insane and like an app but an app review letter is just too much at this point
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.640]   that's it i can't take it anymore i think that's true like i think there's so many things in our
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.480]   society that have been bad for so long and i'm not making any false equivalency about where
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.280]   app review relates to any of the other things we've had it's done every the last we don't want
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:28.480]   our k like google youtube tv is raising his prices i thought twitter explode this morning like we have
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:33.200]   just had enough as a society we were saying this far no further you will not make you will not make
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:38.160]   us pay anymore yeah my kid is clang painting clarinet lessons from a second house a small day
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:44.480]   i'm gonna be a man at somebody in apple it's gonna be you yeah i did see that somebody
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:50.960]   tweeted that his kid had taken up a violin lessons and his apple watch said i hear a siren so
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:59.280]   can you call them is a critic did you just read judo clas you call them uh the stentler and
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.760]   warder baldorf app for the for the apple was somebody said that they've been working on the soap
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:08.480]   app since before covid 19 apparently they've always turned into hand washing so then why is there no
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:13.040]   brush your teeth app i mean i give kevin lynch a huge amount of credibility i mean he was the flash
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:18.800]   guy for a very long time but where's my brush your teeth app i agree can it only be a matter of time
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:25.040]   you're happy about sleep though right mike is so happy about that yeah um i and i heard some people
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:29.120]   are complaining i i'm myself included initially that it doesn't do as much as other sleep apps
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:34.160]   like other sleep apps will show you uh light sleep heavy sleep r.m. sleep but when i asked about it
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.080]   they said like they have no found like they have no understanding how they're getting those numbers
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.440]   they're men they don't want to put apples name on anything that doesn't like is it because they
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:45.440]   know they'll get all sorts like everything will be scrutinized by every scientist in the world
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:49.760]   so they want to make sure that if they do ever offer that it's like those numbers are provable
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:55.440]   using its scientific models they don't i'll tell you the other reason privacy the one of the so the
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:02.080]   guy who came up with a lot of this is philippe con uh formerly of borland and turbo past gal the
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:08.080]   guy invented the smartphone camera uh his latest business motion x is all about accelerometers and
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:14.640]   taking data uh and apply and using his data sets for machine learning i talked to him uh on
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:20.080]   triangulation a couple of years ago when he was just shipping these and they're sold under the
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:24.720]   assertive beauty rest brand i think these paddles that go under your mattress i've had them for some
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:33.200]   time that that give you all of that information deep sleep light sleep r.m. um breath uh heart rate
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:39.040]   um you know resting heart rate all of that stuff and and i've had that for some time i've also had
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:43.200]   this aura ring which actually probably does know a little bit more because it's right on your
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:47.440]   finger so it can actually measure your temperature your heart rate i don't know if it gets breathe it
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:53.040]   couldn't get breathing but but they bay philippe said it's based on machine learning models they collect
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:05:00.000]   millions and millions of data points and over time they can kind of understand what they're seeing
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:06.320]   and i have to say that the assertive paddles and the ring pretty much agree you know within say
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:11.200]   10 20 percent uh the amount of time i spent in deep sleep and stuff i think apple may also want
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:18.080]   to dodge that bullet because in order for them to get those uh to get that kind of uh learning a
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:22.960]   they're just catching up they're just starting now and b they'd have to kind of collect data from
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:28.400]   people a lot of data for dancing leo i mean they can detect different leg and awesome dancing is
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:33.040]   awesome yeah dance dance dance that is the first time i've ever seen a presenter at any tech conference
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:40.800]   dance we're going to play the jonathan morris and i jonathan uh what's the jonathan man video again
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:47.760]   aren't we what didn't i think i think when uh when ceb jobs announced that the determination of
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:52.960]   ios 9 didn't he dance on that the cardboard coffin that was wild that was wild i had never seen that
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:06:00.080]   before ben toffy what that in his trajectory column about all this uh the funeral for macos
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:05.040]   nine i had never seen and there's that jeff of tim coat dancing at uh the
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:11.360]   elia bono yeah yeah you too all right so there's been some dancing i wouldn't necessarily call that
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:18.480]   dancing dancing oh true okay true uh and actually steve does not at the at the keynote jules was
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:23.680]   demonstrating the apple watch dance that was very very well done i was impressed yeah the uh the
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:28.880]   funeral for here let me play a little bit of this i had never had you guys remember this i i guess i
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:38.400]   wasn't at this this was the funeral for macos wrestling isn't it yes yes that's his theme yes
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:45.520]   they have a coffin and it ain't cardboard andy they have it was a fancy coffin on stage they got the
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:54.880]   organ music there's fog i i don't i don't tap yeah yeah all i need is stone hinge coming down and then
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:07:05.440]   steve opens the coffin pulls out a giant box macos nine and reads its eulogy which is hysterical
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:13.120]   this was 18 years ago or no more than that yeah 18 years ago may six two thousand two
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.520]   macos nine was a friend to us all
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:25.440]   he went tirelessly on our behalf always your fault didn't write this huh i don't know it's very funny
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:30.880]   it's very funny um it made the point quite effectively yes anybody any developer who thought
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:35.760]   oh i bet that i can i can still get by without having to support i was 10 for a little while oh no no
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:41.680]   no it's over and it wasn't by the way he had it was long ago had been supplanted by ostin but
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:49.040]   he just wanted to tell everybody stop stop stop stop and i think the coffin he puts a rose on the
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:58.480]   coffin and i think i think it actually descends into into the into the stage i did that for north
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:07.680]   today i made a tiny Canadian coffee coffee there goes bye bye they say late at night on the apple
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:14.880]   campus when the moon is full i think you're howling reverberating off of those kirk walls well
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:22.160]   they we got to do that for mac o s 10 it's over it's 11 yep they took it to 11 i think that this is if
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:28.160]   you're going to do it this is the time yeah make sense yeah this is this is so significant that
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:33.280]   it really is almost like a relaunch of the platform if anything i think that they were a little bit
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:38.080]   conservative because if they're if they're going to be this disruptive and i mean that in the in
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:43.840]   the neutral sense of the word they may as well go for broke uh but i'm so glad that they have
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:50.240]   made all of these changes because that one of the reasons why i was for the for the past few years
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:56.720]   less last year that i've been worried about the future of the mac was that my god the mac finder
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:04.000]   in the mac uy looks so frumpy yeah it looks it it looks like the first 10 minutes of that movie
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.040]   where like the male or the female nerd is like clearly the the costume department said okay now
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:13.360]   remember and a half a half hour into the movie like they're gonna they're gonna like take all
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:16.480]   these elocution lessons they're gonna get a whole new wardrobe or they're gonna find out that they're
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:20.960]   prints so we got to make sure they look really really dumpy at the very very beginning and that's
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:26.000]   what mac o s look like compared to every other operating system that i've seen yeah so i'm glad
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.520]   so that's you if if nothing else apple really really achieved the the achieved uh being able to
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:38.240]   convince people that no we're not just hanging on to the mac as a development platform for ios and
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:43.040]   watch o s we really do believe it they've been saying it all along but i've been what i'm sure
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.840]   that i've said this time and time again on the show but what i've been looking for is give me a sign
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:52.880]   don't just keep telling me right actually show me proof that you intend to keep the key something
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:58.480]   known as a mac and tauge uh for the least the next five years do we have any reason to believe
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:05.440]   ming qo sorry even saying oh before we switch this can i just say that i do want to sneak in and
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.920]   just let a little bit of the air out of the tires of the new messages and facetime app yes icons just
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:15.440]   a little because they're they are so puffy compared to everything else they are marshmallows do you so
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:22.560]   you make them all the developer uh preview yes so i have it and i i'm g- guessing Andy hasn't i have
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:28.080]   it yeah i have rather oh you have so tell me what you think of it uh start with riné what do you
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:35.680]   is it you think it's inflated no i i really like like overall i really really like it it's it is
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:39.920]   refreshed it is lighter it's it's like the it's better affordance because everything is a little
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:45.040]   bit more space it can breathe i think the completely transparent menu bar is a little bit bitsy like
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:49.920]   it it lacks the cohesiveness of an actual bar but you can hide it now which is great and i think
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:56.240]   some of the new icons are fine but i think overall um the watch gets to have round icons and apple tv
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:03.040]   gets to have rounded rectangle icons and ios has those superlips icons and i think it's a disservice
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:08.320]   to the mac to let to have them lose their own distinction that they've had for years and that
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.960]   could be like arbitrary shapes or angled rectangle or something that lets the mac have its own identity
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:18.480]   and just make them the same old superlipses that are on iphon so i i i don't think all of the icons
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:23.520]   are bad i think i think some are flatter and some are are puffier and they should normalize
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:28.640]   all of that but in general i think the the the i switching the icons to be exactly like mac or
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:36.560]   sorry shaped like like iphon and ipad apps is a ed service to the mac yeah um i you know i i i'm not
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:42.160]   a design guy so i don't i don't have any strong feelings when with the other it definitely looks
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:47.920]   a little um it is interesting like you can choose your wallpaper to be that one which is just like
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:52.800]   ios but they also have a traditional mac like a picture of oh they do have a picture big sir
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.320]   yeah of big sir that you can use instead you get the and both of them are working light and dark
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:01.280]   mode oh that's interesting choose your choose your allegiances are you hashtag team iphon background
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:06.720]   or hashtag team mac because the iphon background is the one we've all seen which is abstract layers
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:13.360]   of color to sort of simulate big sir the water the mountains the you know ocean but how are the
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:19.040]   beauty the power the beauty those i got to say those bars are big those icon bars are
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:23.680]   jine jineormous you want to touch them we are i do i'm trying to touch them right now yeah
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:28.960]   yeah and i i absolutely accept that people are going like rene said the people are reading into
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:34.640]   these design changes both on ios and mac ios the way they want it really does look like they're making
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:41.040]   this much more touch friendly whether that's whether that's to have simply to have visual consistency
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:46.080]   with ios or whether that really is the idea of we're going to need that the title bars of these
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:53.360]   windows to be grabable by a fingertip as opposed to a mouse or a trackpad i see a lot of error
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:58.400]   around there i see a lot of transparency around there that i'm still trying to get used to i see
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:06.960]   them trying to minimize the visual impact of the menu bar as if part of that message is to say
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:11.040]   don't look for features up there you're supposed to look for features within within content windows
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:17.840]   i like it i i did find it more off putting after i finished my first day with it than i did this
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:23.360]   morning when i was messing around with it it really i really think that the i'm trying to figure out if
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:30.960]   using safari is going to be the biggest tell to what apple wants a mac app to look like and if so
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:35.680]   i'm kind of hoping that apple dials it back a little bit it's been a long time on safari
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:41.760]   yeah it just well it just feels like remember the difference between ios 7 and let's say ios 9
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:45.040]   when when they absolutely decided that okay it's time to get rid of the original
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:52.880]   ios iPhone interface and start updating a little bit it was dark it was it was like a like a salt
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:58.880]   flat where there was correct and exactly no let's get rid of all the colors like let's make all of
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:04.320]   like the text really really skinny let's not give you any sort of indication of one thing on this
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.080]   screen is more important than something other that something is trying to get your attention
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:13.360]   and but they saw them you saw them dial that that back over the next couple of years i think
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.800]   that we're going to i hope that well naturally we're going to see a certain uh once it's once it's
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:25.280]   off the off the ranch and into the hands of not not real people yet but closer one step closer to
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:31.440]   real people in the form of developers who can give lots of feedback um it's i'm i'm keen to see how
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:37.920]   real people react to it when the public beta hits uh very very soon because if it if it doesn't feel
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:43.680]   like a Mac you you've kind of you've kind of messed it up uh and it still feels like a Mac but it is a
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:51.440]   big big step yeah um a couple of things the privacy forward very much in fact there's a privacy
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:56.560]   report that tells you what trackers are on a page a lot of people go through your other plugins on
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:02.400]   other browsers to do that that's nice apple is also and there's some real consternation in the ad
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:10.160]   community about this uh essentially giving you a pop-up that says hey you know you have an
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:16.800]   there's an ad tracker that's being used liver personalized ads for you do you want to allow that
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:22.160]   or you want to ask the app not to do that and by surfacing that this has always been apparently
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:25.920]   always have been in the settings but it's deep within so nobody knows about it by surfacing that
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:31.520]   as part of this new user permissions dialogue that all apps will have on iOS uh there's a lot of
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:37.920]   concern that apple by killing it's like it's gonna kill its IDFA it's i think like a lot of that i
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:42.480]   thought was like try because a bunch of people who i see complain about nothing but ads and the
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:47.200]   and the tracking and all goes on are suddenly like worried about the ad companies because apples
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:52.800]   doing it and to me that just smells of like apple headlines and i think apple like apple does this
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:56.640]   they did this with battery shaming and all we saw was a jovie apps in the battery shamer and then
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:00.720]   they fixed it they did it with bluetooth and all you saw was all these apps are deliciously asking
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:04.880]   for your bluetooth information and they fixed it and they just did it with the clipboard and we
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:09.680]   saw tiktok asking for the clipboard every three seconds and they fixed it to me it's like that
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:15.920]   that's what you do you you you you disclose and you get consent and they add industry if they like
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:20.400]   if they have any pride at all in their business model they think it's a good business model that
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:24.000]   it's good for them and it's good for us then they should have no problem with us actually
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.480]   being aware of what's happening on those web pages and if they think there's issues with it this
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:34.640]   highlights them and they can they can fix it i did hear you know i do agree with ben tomsen that
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:39.680]   it does make it harder for smaller competitors because google and facebook have a tremendous
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:45.520]   capacity to serve you first party cookies that you know startup advertising and smaller networks
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:50.800]   just simply can compete with and so it's even with gdpr it's easier for google and facebook to handle
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:55.680]   that than it is for the small companies but i still feel like looking at it from the business
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.600]   point of view is the wrong end of it you look at it from the user point of view and for the user
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:04.880]   this is a huge win absolutely yeah and also the commitment that apple has to this is very very
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:10.880]   important i i've always thought that uh i've always thought that one of the problems that apple
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.280]   had and it's oh we're the only company that really cares about privacy the problem with that
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:19.440]   messaging was that oh but we really don't care if people keep continuing to track you and collect
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:23.440]   information through our web through our web browser or is there anybody else's web browser
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:29.680]   this absolutely is reversal of that uh not only because this is exactly the sort of uh position
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:35.680]   that is important in this day and age to not simply say oh i don't know if you know it but there's
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:41.520]   like 14 trackers after you safari is like let's let me give you the report on exactly what battle
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:46.480]   fit what the battle is like behind the scenes right now here is every single instance of a website
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:50.480]   that's trying to get information and how they're trying to do it and letting you have control of
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:55.920]   the situation uh and so just uh just this week um there a whole bunch of new like hardware based
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:00.160]   web api's that got uh that got released that apple is announced they're not going to support
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:06.160]   simply because it allows fingerprint it's an opportunity for extended fingerprinting to identify
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:10.240]   you even though you've taken measures to make sure that your browser and your incident can't be
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:15.360]   can't be fingerprinted this is an important thing for the safari brand apple has to for everything
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:18.800]   that apple does they have to say here is what i know the chrome is the most powerful browser in
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:23.600]   the world i know that firefox is the most popular open browser in the world but we have safari and
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:29.760]   here is what here's the unique advantage that we can deliver uh and then it's not only uh it will
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:35.760]   not bog down your computer as though it's been thrown into a scottish bog but it will also not
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:41.040]   only will it not drain your battery but also it is the most proactively uh security oriented
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:45.120]   browser that you can install right now yeah and i'll add to that a little bit in saying that you
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:50.000]   know and not not really google's fault but google's in the position now that microsoft used to be in
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.720]   that they are so popular that people are coding for chrome rather than coding for the open web
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:58.560]   and it's not that there aren't web standards it's that they're like more like web suggestions and
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:03.120]   every vendor um implements them in a way that best suits that company because it's just natural
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:06.800]   and google sees everything as a web app and apple sees everything as a native app and they have
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.640]   different interpretations but the end result is there's a lot of stuff that doesn't work as well
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:16.480]   on safari and the only sort of ability apple has to affect change beyond that is that the webkit
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:20.960]   engine runs everything on iphone and ipad which are hugely popular right so by doing things like
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:25.120]   this they sort of force the web a little bit in their direction too we haven't talked about uh so
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:31.040]   go ahead so just a quickly you notice that you don't see very many uh websites right at this point
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:35.440]   that say ooh i'm not going to let you proceed until you turn your ad blocker off or whitelist us
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:40.080]   you see it sometimes but rest this would be a way that the entire ad community could say no we
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.520]   are going to force you to turn off ad blockers because otherwise we're not going to allow any
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:49.360]   content to pursue in any way shape or form because they tried that initially but they got the metrics
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:54.720]   back and say when we make somebody do something to read an article that we that that's this person
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:20:00.240]   hasn't even read yet their reaction is to leave and go to one of the other 18 terabillion
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:05.520]   pages that are on the internet yeah exactly so then i they're not apple is doing something they
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:09.280]   know that they can do is not as though you're going to see a pop-up saying that i'm sorry safari is
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:16.000]   not supported by by this content please switch to a less less and security and browser instead
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.920]   yeah please use an address if you want to okay we're gonna do this now i mean
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:26.400]   i wasn't planning on doing this right now but i don't want to do this right now i'm just saying
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:30.160]   because like even if you even if you change your default web browser in ios it's still the web
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:36.160]   kit rendering engine like there is like the it only goes so far down that stack yeah it's such a
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:40.640]   good thing that you know we don't have things like apps on ios you know stealing information for
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:45.680]   the clipboard we never said i agree with you on this saying like they they have they have an
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:50.960]   unusual amount of control to wield this as a weapon on ios and look what apple did we there
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:56.240]   was just a tick-tock is like 56 other apps that were just saying hey can we look at your clipboard
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:00.880]   what are you doing there what are you doing that's good that's great apple i mean it's it's
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:04.560]   it's terrible when it happens with things like hey you know or some of our friends there are some
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:09.520]   really bad apps that apple in a position to go okay bye bye you go make a little bit on the west
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:14.000]   apps now you know yeah there are only the only issues when it looks like it's in there for their
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.800]   business reasons as opposed to to protect users and sometimes it does look that way maybe they
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:24.800]   can make an argument if it's not but it does look that way yeah how credible is mink qiqo is he's
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:31.920]   saying he's the analyst who sends out these notes and he's saying there will be a a 13.3 inch mac
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:39.600]   book pro running apple silicon and an iMac i have to say he says it's a 24 inch iMac which makes me
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:45.040]   think what why would they make this yeah yeah why would they do that but it is an all new form
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:51.200]   factor and that they would both launch probably in the third or fourth quarter of this year
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:57.600]   or early 2021 i like that because apple's not nostalgic but those i believe are the first
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:07.680]   Intel max the chip and the iMac which is interesting here yeah i be i i'm i'm just guessing here
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:13.040]   but i i'm just surprised i would be surprised if apple did not want to make the macbook error or
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:17.840]   the macbook nothing one of the first max out the gate because people are buying that people are
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:24.720]   buying that not for power and not for flexibility they're buying it for freedom from physical tethers
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:29.600]   to to this this cursed ground and the ability to simply say by the way the macbook that used to
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:35.040]   get 10 hours of battery life now gets 14 to 15 hours of battery life that is immediately
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:39.040]   convincing people that this is why we so this is one of the reasons why we switch to arm it is
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:45.280]   flying the flag for i'm trying to figure out if i'm just being sort of like an apple marketing
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:50.480]   dupe by calling it apple silicon instead of arm i'm trying i'm still navigating that choice so i'm
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:56.560]   sorry i never said x86 that's how this is the way i mentally just find it even now power pc to intel
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:01.520]   but they do have arm 64 on the technical slides it's just it's it's not an arm they said it's
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:06.400]   an armpit in the union yeah yeah they said yeah but i i think it's important to say it's not a
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:13.520]   cortex chip it's an apple chip yes it's not arm as delivered by a wall calm it's it's
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:19.040]   a by arm well arm doesn't deliver anything no but they make the cortex that people can just fab
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:23.280]   if they want to like the cortex design and apple's not using the cortex design so it like it's
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:29.360]   a nebulous thing because like it's not like uh like do people insist on calling amd and x86 chip
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:34.480]   most of them just call it an amd chip right and they're fine with it but i think apple silicon's
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:38.960]   fine and that doesn't it is a marketing term andy but i think it's also distinct to
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:44.400]   distinguished from arm i wish they would announce their new name sooner than later so we don't have
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:51.600]   to keep saying it because it's a lot of trial on it maybe it's trial yeah they'll have a new
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:56.640]   naming and numbering scheme i presume to distinguish them from the ios chips or maybe not maybe it'll
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:05.120]   just be a 15 or something x14 just go right after the x86 heart oh that'd be cool uh well i want i
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:12.240]   i reason i ask actually this is this is for me i'm asking for a friend uh because i i don't think i
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:18.240]   want to buy another computer of any kind until i see these and i can hold out till the end of the
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:22.800]   year i don't know if i can hold out some next you're not alex you like alex wants no part of a brand
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:26.720]   you are machine that he doesn't know how final cut and all his rendering stuff runs on
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:30.400]   he's much rather you buy at leo and tell him in the latin the next few years and i'd much rather
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:35.920]   painful it is and then he buys the mac pro yeah and he could tell me about that so we're different
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:41.440]   people yeah yes i honestly i've i've been getting this question i'm sure we're all being being this
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:46.480]   question like a million times for it by people who read less listen to us or you know join us for
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:54.320]   dinner but i keep telling people that if if you need a mac this year uh and maybe if you can wait
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:58.640]   until the fall to see what kinds of hardware apple releases as this part of this first wave
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:05.120]   do that but i wouldn't wait a year and have if if if i if i'm stuck with like a 10 year old mac that
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:09.600]   is not getting the job done that i cannot edit videos the way that i want to do it i can't run
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:14.400]   photoshop the way i want to do it or any other reason like that i still feel as though any intel
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:20.320]   mac you buy this year is going to have the five at least the five-year utility life that i expect
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:27.280]   to get from any brand new computer yeah as jose told groover on the talk show he bought a 16 inch
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:31.920]   macbook pro for his daughter because she's going to college his fall she needs something now uh
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.240]   jason snell said he did the same thing for his daughter although it was just a macbook air he
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:41.440]   couldn't afford the 16 but but and actually macbook air is a perfect college uh but i do the same
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:46.480]   thing is i have to run final cut like i depend on running final cut and i'm sure it's going to run
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:51.840]   on the r macs but i i know like every plug in i buy everything is going to be exactly the way that i
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:56.640]   needed to run for the next few years and i can look at people on twitter and see how it's working
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:02.080]   for them and then make a decision after like i just don't buy that revé board i'll be the guinea pig
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:07.040]   i will buy the revé board i buy an air in a heartbeat i would buy uh uh apple silicon air in a
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:12.320]   heartbeat and apple silicon mac pro i would stick i didn't tell for what if they did a macbook pro 13
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:17.600]   that was almost as thin as an air like thinner than the existing one which they could do right
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:23.840]   and had 20 hour battery life that might be and had no bezel that might be pretty you know so it's
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:29.520]   i would want it but my but i need final cut and so that's like yeah anything anyone on the pro
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:34.640]   work for like you talked to briana woo and they barely support the th their 3d app she uses on intel
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:40.560]   you know yes yes that was a good tweet they yeah i mean if i if one of the first uh first
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:48.480]   apple silicon based macs that apple releases this fall were a mac mini which is the undisputable
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:54.080]   the desktop computer that i want in my office uh to when i make my upgrades i would almost certainly
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:59.040]   buy it i would not i would not mind being you know eating the first generation of dog food uh
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:03.680]   partly because i'm intrigued by what an arm processor is going to be giving me two years from
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:08.320]   now and i can't afford to buy two two fifteen hundred dollar desktops and two years just out
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:13.840]   of curiosity um on a notebook uh when it comes to a notebook i'm still sort of like hedging my
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:19.600]   bets i don't know what i want right now uh but that's i would not hesitate to buy an arm based
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:23.440]   mac mini if one released i'm not gonna i'm not gonna buy an i-mac because an i-mac is just not
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:32.960]   not gonna want i'm not gonna i'm still skeptic i'm still uh the the macbook pro is still not necessarily
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:39.600]   what i want it doesn't instill joy in me immediately as as conda would as recon to what might say
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:43.760]   and so i'm still trying to figure out if that's what i want i'm and i'm still even trying to figure
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:49.520]   out if a two thousand dollar laptop is still even relevant to how i use computers in 2021
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:56.080]   as opposed to the mid-2000s but but i'm all i'm trying to communicate here is that i don't think
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:01.360]   anybody is gonna be hosed if they buy an Intel based mac this year uh you you you have to you
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:07.280]   always have to balance uh my my advice to people is always the same that don't consider a hardware
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:11.840]   upgrade until you have a firm idea of how it's going to either solve a problem for you or create
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:17.840]   an opportunity for you uh but the other thing is that if you need a computer today think about
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:22.240]   everything you're going to lose in the next year by waiting until next year for a machine that
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:27.920]   might never actually come or might be irrelevant to your needs like imagine if i were holding off
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:33.280]   on a really really bad old macbook for two years saying i know there's a there's a major redesign
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:37.760]   of the macbook macbook pro coming so oh by the way here it is and now it has a keyboard you can't
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:42.000]   possibly use so you're kind of an idiot for waiting two years when you could have been using the
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:49.600]   last generation of good for you macbooks true yeah uh and certainly i think we've all converged on
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:53.760]   this we talked about it on sunday on twitter as well that if you need a mac there's no reason not
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:59.040]   to buy a mac right now there's no reason to lay uh and if you don't then it might be worth waiting
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:08.640]   i just i don't remember but my sense is those g4s felt pretty old pretty quick not because they were
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:14.320]   old but just because you wanted the new intel mac but into the intel was providing such well
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:18.800]   there's a tweet by steve stratton smith that that he put up yesterday where he said the developer
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:25.280]   transition kit which is a two-year-old ipad chip runs x86 64 code in emulation faster than the
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:30.640]   surface pro x runs it natively uh paulkom what are you even doing and that again this is like the
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:37.120]   worst that we will ever see um ap uh uh a mac OS running on apple silicon and it's really like
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:41.520]   and apple's done year over year over year improvements they said a hundred times in 10 years
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:48.720]   improvement so intel is still doing so badly that it's hard not to imagine within two three years
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:54.080]   they'll have a significant lead uh not not maybe not in terms of like what a zion can do but in
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:59.680]   terms of power per watt and what apple can do in like the people complain about mac books all the
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:05.040]   time how hot they are nobody complains about how hot an ipad is and it's fast so if there there
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:08.800]   are certain aspects that are highly appealing about what this combination is going to bring yeah
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:14.720]   and the benchmarks are out and uh i don't want to report on them because they're out illegally apple
[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:18.720]   was very clear if you got one of the developer kits you were not to benchmark it but they do leak out
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:24.480]   uh because people forget that if you if you geek bench it it's going to be posted on the site unless
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:30.640]   you say otherwise uh and you know it's not the it's not as super fast but it's but it's pretty
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:36.080]   impressive the two-year-old architecture could could run as well as it has and almost everyone
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:39.760]   has been running it in emulation they've been downloading geek bench from the mac app store
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:43.520]   which is the intel version and running it through rosetta is really so the numbers you're seeing
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:50.080]   as the emulated yeah that's really bad yeah on an ipad chip yeah so i know i'm excited i
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:57.920]   i mean honestly if my real advice be you probably don't need a computer just stop buying computers
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:06.720]   that's your mistake what they want you to do you don't need a computer uh but i don't need
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:12.000]   no stinkin computer yeah uh apple design there are other stories we'll go to those real quickly
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.640]   uh before i get your picks of the week apple design award winners came out and yesterday or
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:23.680]   today i think and uh darkroom which is a beautiful photo editor it's a you know actually darkroom
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:29.440]   an ipad to me yeah is why i don't need photoshop or lightroom it's just gorgeous from bergen it's so
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:36.320]   good uh i haven't played this game loom with three o's from iorama studio it's an animation
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:42.560]   playground with music creation tools we'll be doing this on ios today next week we're going to do all
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:49.840]   of the uh we'll do a demo and and play with all of the award winners uh shaper 3d which is a cat app
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:32:00.560]   for the ipad wow um that's wow again wow an ipad and apple pencil um i haven't tried it later this
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:06.720]   year they say it's going to use the lydar scanner so you can generate 3d and 2d floor plans
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:13.440]   wow just wow staff pad i haven't used any of these this converts handwritten musical notation into
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:19.520]   digital sheet music that's cool and then you can use your apple pencil with it after you've done that
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:25.760]   in the game series i do agree with this the apple arcade game syanara wild hearts which is
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:30.720]   not only beautiful is an album it's a music album and it's got a great soundtrack
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:38.640]   that's from uh simigo from malmo sweeten and another beautiful one sky children of the light
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:45.600]   which is a social quest that uh actually comes from that game company they did something very
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:50.720]   similar i think it was on the xbox of the playstation that i played that i really liked and this is
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:58.640]   kind of the continuation song of bloom from indeed developer philip stullen mire a one guy a one man
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:06.160]   crew uh looks like there's popcorn involved i don't know a song of bloom uh where cards fall
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:13.600]   so beautiful yeah the game band publishers snowman that looks like a kind of a platform
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:18.640]   puzzle game right that was one of the inaugural apple arcade games where like it was just so moody
[01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:25.840]   and atmospheric all these cars structures yeah gorgeous yeah so there you go the the winners
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:32.720]   of the apple design awards eight developers eight apps uh i would say the ones i've played
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:39.600]   they're all stellar i mean it really just shows you what great work is being done on ios well done
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:44.560]   yeah apple is that which there was a mac category like just to and use point previously maybe they're
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:48.400]   waiting for the relaunch before they have a mac category again well then they can have a unified
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:56.480]   category it just runs the apple silicana category um would be great would be great to see like at least
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:02.960]   maybe it's a special award or a special competition for shortcuts i think yeah such sophisticated
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:07.520]   and interesting shortcuts these days almost like almost like it would be like the best demo it'd
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:13.680]   be like the best the best use of one finger touch on an apple watch or the best use of one tap uh
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:17.920]   on a what does that do we go in or just math we wait yeah really there's only two choices like
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:25.840]   i'd also i honestly would love to see things like clips be highlighted because i want to see more apps
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:31.680]   using clips so there's an opportunity for apple to uh to promote some of these technologies yeah
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:35.920]   often they launch these really neat technologies and then you know nobody pays them any attention
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:39.840]   or launch day like the when the ios version launches they typically have categories that
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:45.200]   highlights all the apps that best represent what the new features in ios are like on the front page
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:50.240]   of the app store you love all the clips apps and all the arkit four apps and all the apps that use
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:55.440]   whatever other new technology they want to be the best widgets probably yeah all of that stuff apple
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:03.600]   is adding as uh firefox has done support for encrypted dio dns it's d oh and d o t that's a good thing
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:09.920]   at a lot of people don't like it especially internet service providers it is not a vpn
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:14.480]   in fact it's it you shouldn't use it and a vpn use one or the other but it does at least keep your
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:21.280]   ISP from seeing what pages you're visiting so that's a good thing yeah a new way to get an apple
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:26.720]   card if you've been turned down my son who's just getting started in his credit life doesn't want
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:33.040]   to apply for an apple card because he's afraid of getting turned down well henry now you could apply
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:39.680]   for it and if you do get turned down they have a four month plan a path to apple card telling you
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:47.200]   how you can get approved in as little as four months it's an opt-in program leverages information
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:54.000]   the Goldman Sachs used to determine credit worthiness to outline why they were declined and have
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.640]   helped them improve those specific financial markers so that in four months
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:08.480]   they can achieve the holy grail and apple card apple wants to consume consume
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:17.280]   it's good for everyone rumor your personal dreams you can make you can make more money and buy more
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:25.360]   people yes it is the way it is the way another rumor from mr quo or mr ming qi i'm not sure
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:34.400]   qua ming qi san no no he's chinese nevermind ming qi shin shang uh yes shin shin shin who says
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:42.800]   that apple will not put the charger or ear pods in the next iphone and i for one because there's no
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:46.560]   ports leo i mean how could they have a how could they have had a little bit of a part with no ports
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:52.000]   actually i think this is a good idea there's billions of tons of e-ways created every year by
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:58.880]   useless chargers certainly by now you have a charger you could use with your iphone and if not you can
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:04.640]   buy one from apple yeah new one it looks like a 20 volt i don't the thing that's interesting to me
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:10.400]   is that people are like well apple better cut the price of the iphone by the same amount as the charger
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:16.000]   believing that the retail price of like i think it's like 20 bucks for the five watt and 40 bucks
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:22.160]   for the uh 18 watt apple paste dollars like they very very little for those things and they're never
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:28.320]   gonna sell a six hundred and ninety seven dollar iphone so the only logical thing i like they're
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:33.520]   probably gonna eat the cost of 5g like a lot of vendors have risen of raised prices by a hundred
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:38.560]   but i mean look at what a samsung phone cost this year compared to last year they're just gonna
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:43.360]   eat that cost and then they'll hope that you don't notice the loss of couple accessories along the way
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:48.000]   that's actually we'll order them if you want them that's what mg seeker says he says the number one
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:55.120]   reason is margins because of these expensive 5g components and the covid hit to the supply chain
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:59.440]   he also says it's good for the environment because it makes these boxes smaller you can ship them
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:04.560]   easier and he says it's the next iphone that's not going to have ports so you might as well get
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:10.800]   people used to it i think that's fair i think that's fair and then you know it's all about
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:16.560]   getting people to expect a little less but but wouldn't it be now this this is this is something
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:20.800]   that occurred to me after i was working through my complicated feelings regarding this rumor
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:27.120]   but wouldn't it be interesting if apple did the math and realized that here here's the number of
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:32.160]   of chargers we are not going to ship in this calendar year in this region and simply said
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:38.960]   we are going to we're going to package and like just little like blister packs uh the same sort of
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:42.560]   like really cheap two dollar chargers and we're going to basically send them out to every apple
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:48.160]   store and if someone comes into an apple store with an apple iphone that they've bought in recent
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:53.040]   history and said hey i need a charger they just get it they're just handed a charger immediately
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:57.520]   so that too so that to say that look if we if you really need a charger if you really
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:02.320]   if you don't already have one or if you think that you can't afford 10 dollars for a charger
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:06.800]   but via amazon coming to an apple store will give you a charger we also will take note of
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:10.960]   comes the last time you asked for free when we gave one to you but not only would that be saying
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:14.400]   that that would negate the idea well how come you're not giving me what it used to give me but it
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:18.480]   also say that oh my god i can't believe i lost my charger be able to walk in an apple store and
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:22.800]   like be handed a charger that would be like one of the most amazing good will things that they
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:28.240]   can do through the apple store that's true i'm not i'm not you want to buy for fine you get a bumper
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:35.840]   babies that's how they do that's how they do it i wonder um i mean the reason that they ostensibly
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:42.480]   they kicked hay out of the app stores because when you download the app and open it up it did nothing
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:49.280]   and we don't want apps that do nothing well what if you bought a phone and you didn't have a charger
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:54.480]   in it it wouldn't you really you'd be kind of stuck too wouldn't you especially in jurisdictions
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:58.240]   where you can't ship a phone with electrical charge anymore yeah you'd be kind of like well
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:04.000]   that's nice here's a piece of glass it looks like the e was going to mandate this anyway and i know
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.160]   apple has been pushing back really hard i like the thing with the EU though is they're so
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:13.120]   nebulous like when they said that you have to have standardized charges do they mean the plug
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:17.840]   do they mean the cable every news outlet covered it differently and it's it looks like they mean
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:22.800]   they're gonna actually mandate no plugs in boxes and apple fought them on the cable but it doesn't
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:27.040]   look like they're gonna fight them on the plug because the plug doesn't mean anything to it lightning
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:30.960]   like it doesn't doesn't care about lightnings or white white fight them on it the whole thing is
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:36.800]   just i i don't know what percentage of apple iphone buyers don't have a charger but maybe
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:42.560]   and if you swap from android you probably have a usb c charger you know usb c cable
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:47.520]   so put the cable in the box or no i guess not will they yeah no i believe the cable is supposed to be
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:51.440]   in the box okay yeah last i will say i will say that i will say that i'll be really bummed out if
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:56.240]   the next iphone ships without a charging port or a data charging slash data point port i don't think
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:00.880]   it's nearly time for that yet no probably a year or two and i wonder if the technology
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:05.520]   like in the arm act sorry i'm calling it arm acts already huh the apple silicon mask where it has
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:09.600]   that recovery partition is going to be part of their their answer to some of the problems with
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:14.640]   portless devices sure yeah there you go and they there's i'm sorry and i know that you're trying to
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:17.200]   wrap up i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:23.840]   but but they so long as my position has always been you can't if you're going to take away something
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:27.520]   from me making sure you're giving me something that is as compelling something you're taking away
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:31.440]   so if apple were able if two years from our three years from now apple's going to make the case that
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:36.560]   well and thanks to our our our best in class battery life now you can get now you get three
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:42.320]   three days worth of battery life uh out of out of a single charge so it's no long unlike some of our
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.480]   brothers and sisters the android community you are not going to run out of run out of charge
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:51.920]   and need to have a usb battery pack with you at all times and but and also we've identified this
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:56.880]   as a point of compromise for people who be their government or individuals who are trying to get
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:00.960]   data off of your phone without your permission and we've also introduced so many different
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:06.320]   technologies that allow you to recover this this machine uh recover your device without having to
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:11.200]   plug it into a device that we've essentially we feel as though we've addressed every need for
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:16.320]   an actual physical connector and and gotten rid of it i would that i would fall in line pretty
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:20.160]   quickly if they just simply say we decided it was bumming us out that we had to cut a hole in our
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:23.200]   beautiful iphone so we didn't good luck with that that i'll say
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:29.920]   bye bye see uh or it could have like you still have a smart connector and an adapter that
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:35.200]   lets you plug it in the two that's i like to have a smart connector on the back that solves the whole
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:40.240]   yeah just what they're doing with the ipad pro and the keyboard now right yeah i don't think
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:46.320]   that would work as well because uh the life that i the life that i lead with iphones and with android
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:51.840]   phones right now does not involve well i buy i own one charging standard two charging stands it's that
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:58.160]   i always have a position i i'm if i'm two rooms away from the room where i have my one or two chargers
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:03.840]   and that's a big problem for me where uh where we're asked if i were in a position where at some
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:10.160]   point in life at some point in in in every year i misplaced my i oh that's my three foot charging
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:14.400]   cable i'm when i need a six foot one and i'll order a couple of more from amazon which means that
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:18.800]   there's one in my every single blacktop bag i have there's one pretty much uh within reach
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:25.040]   everywhere if it were sort if i'm one of the bummers of my uh of my sony walkman music player
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:32.160]   as i as i said when i made it a pick of the week is that it uses the stupid like you know original
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:36.800]   sony walkman style charge non-standard charging port which means that there are times where i don't
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:41.120]   use it because i need to i'm i know i'm gonna be going for a walk later in the day but i can't find
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:46.800]   my one copy of this charging cable so it goes uncharged for for a good amount of time i fear that
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:52.720]   that if apple decided that pogo pins is going is going to be the way to go again another set of
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:56.720]   incompatible cables i'm going to need i don't think that's going to be as good as simply saying just
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:03.280]   give us usbc just give us usbc what's wrong with you especially on the pro-iphons yeah i take it
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:08.160]   on the earth i take it back we are in a hurry to get really shook for two important reasons
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:17.680]   one the first launch for space force is mere minutes away it's a gps satellite but it is the first
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:26.480]   launch for space force gi joe and i've got a brisket on my trigger that i think i have
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:33.440]   there we go that's the real reason brisket is always an acceptable excuse for ending at any
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:36.480]   meeting early i've got my blood let's get
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:41.600]   wrap it and foil sorry gentlemen i need this vehicle it's a brisket emergency
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:50.800]   last story apple is losing apple news is losing the new york times i don't know if this is
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:55.760]   be the first of many defections we've talked before about how publishers are not thrilled about the
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:00.400]   fact they don't get any customer information from apple that it doesn't drive a lot of traffic
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:06.000]   very few organizations are as big and as rich and as powerful as the new york times but
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:12.160]   starting yesterday times articles no longer appearing on the apple news feed
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:18.800]   so we'll see if this what this means for for apple is still only in like four countries i mean
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:25.200]   it's it's so the opposite of every one of the apple's other services yeah i just i i keep checking and
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:31.520]   i just i get too much useless material and it's just not a good feed for me and i can't bookmark
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:36.560]   and send it out anyway because it just sends out a bookmark sample news which is useless i think
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:40.320]   they're fixing that too i think they're also adding a way which i wanted where if you click on a link
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:44.080]   to a web it's an article that you don't subscribe on the web but you do have it through apple news
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:47.920]   it'll send you to apple news which has always been my frustration with like wall street journal
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:54.000]   and york times yeah i don't pay for some of these and so i can't see him yeah um okay if you know
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.360]   and by the way that's we didn't we barely touched on ios 14 but there's some nice
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:07.280]   really nice features coming so many the ability to uh set a different default browser and email
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:12.000]   program which i think is we need a bigger show of you yeah we need a bigger show but the great the
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.120]   great thing is that week by week we we are weekly less dumb about what we what we knew a week before
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:20.800]   that's true oh and for people who are because a lot of people are complaining they don't see that
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:26.720]   in the beta developers have to flag an app saying it's a candidate for browser and for email and apple
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:30.880]   has to approve it because they don't want some company to make a scam browser that just redirects
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:35.360]   to their amazon affiliate links or just shows you a bunch of tracker ads so like if chrome says
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:41.680]   we're a browser i was like yes you are but if like vida browser x3z or something comes up and says
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:45.120]   please you're like no sorry do you want to make promise absolutely do you want to watch the rocket
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:52.240]   go up is it almost time john is it five more minutes okay space force
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:57.760]   that can be our like like three hundred million dollar outro if we time it perfectly if we time it
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:03.840]   right andy and i go your pick is a week uh unfortunately coleriner passed away today at oh no
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:10.560]   not not unexpected but but still very very sad uh my uh where do you start where do you begin to
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:15.680]   talk about how wonderful he was i'm just going to use my pick of the week to recommend it i i was
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:21.920]   an avid collector of his memoirs he started writing his memoirs in his 80s and his audiobooks of these
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:27.280]   memoirs are amazing because he did he did start off life as a performer quickly became a writer
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:32.640]   performer but you can see how much how often and over the previous like decades he had told each
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:37.680]   of these stories and how he had honed each of these stories about his life and his his making
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:42.800]   his way through it at the atembrane story he has honed each story to raise her precision not an
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:48.160]   ounce of fat on it uh and there if when i've got my look at my greatest hits in my in my audible
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:54.480]   library uh starting with my anecdotal life uh if these are often just the coleriner's call
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:59.840]   writer stories so it's we were lucky to have him as long as we did i mean he was even doing a
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:06.400]   quarantine podcast dispatches from quarantine and he was he was old and he had a great twitter
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:12.480]   count and he just never ever ever stopped that is so aspirational to be to be fortunate enough
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:17.200]   to have your health and your wits about you in your 90s but also to not have lost your passion
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:23.200]   and the joy you you you you take in the career that you so luckily found for yourself when you're
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:30.000]   18, 19, 20 years old that is such a blessing it well at least the 2000 year old man is still alive so
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:38.000]   yeah we will uh i will go home tonight and watch all of me so um yes yes yeah all right that's a
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:44.080]   sad way to go but uh yes i'm glad you mentioned it i hadn't heard um i'm big big big fan of course
