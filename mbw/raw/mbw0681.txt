[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Andy, Renee, and Lori are all here.
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.680]   We've got lots to talk about, including some really nice pictures from Andy with the new iPhone 11 camera,
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.800]   how the new Deep Fusion software, which is now in testing, will make a huge difference.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.240]   We'll also talk about the jailbreak called Checkmate that can't be fixed,
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.600]   but isn't really much of a concern for anyone. It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.880]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest Apple News and their back,
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.000]   Renee Ritchie and Lenore Gill. Lenore, I don't know.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:51.600]   I'm more. They were away last week, but we're really glad to have you guys back. Andy Inaco also
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:00.080]   here. You've all got new iPhones. I know that. Andy's been posting like crazy.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.200]   So many. It's a fun little camera, ain't it? Have you done a slow fee yet?
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:13.920]   No, because I couldn't figure out. I only literally last night thought about what I could do as a
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.120]   slow fee. That's not just like, again, like slapping myself on the face and watching the flesh from my
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.720]   face going bla bla bla bla bla or doing something like that. I feel as though if I bought a box of
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.160]   like a bag of Czechs party mix and then just like sort of like try to eat it out of the bag as it
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.960]   falls onto my face, there is no dignified way to take a slow fee. I cannot figure out any
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.720]   dignified use for the slow fee. But you look, there's nothing you look damn fine and well lit too.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:52.240]   That was again, it was like, it was so it took such a good selfie. Granted, this was like in the
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.120]   like morning sunlight, but it took such a good picture that I was like, okay, I guess I was,
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.240]   I took a nap on my glasses and they're all askew, but I don't think I'll ever get a picture.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.680]   It's a good perfectly willing to have a skew. Yeah, exactly. It's like, okay, that's pretty much
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.360]   what you're going to get. That's the, that's a promise that I can deliver on that I will have
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.760]   a skew glasses. Like, I didn't want to, I didn't want to try to redo it because it was like, no,
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.720]   it's not going to be as good as that. I'm probably never going to be up that early again.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.120]   Some great night shots too. This is beautiful.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.080]   Yeah, it's, it's weather. I mean, it's, this isn't, and I'm not going to say that it is,
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.560]   it's dramatically better than night sight on, on my Android phone. But what if the, the real
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.120]   breakthrough is that you're talking about being able to take pictures and settings that you were
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.800]   never able to take before. And it really makes you want to, hey, I'm talking, I'm taking a walk
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.200]   here and this could be, and let's see what the night, the, the night photography feature will do
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.320]   with this. And it's just, you just get this brand new toy that you cannot stop playing with.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.840]   And then there was now, I was trying to, I was trying to remember if it's, I think it was iOS 11
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.640]   that lets you, when you're taking life, when we have a live picture that you can have,
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.600]   you can sort of rewind or fast forward a couple of frames and select that as an export that as a
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:21.120]   full framed like photo, but I can't figure out whether with the iPhone 11, if that's actually
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.680]   full resolution or not, I don't think it is, is it? It's definitely the same number of pixels by
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.320]   don't know if it's upscaling it. Yeah, I believe as they use the move file for that,
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.760]   they jettisoned the JPEG and then you operate on the move on the MOV file.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.040]   But it's still pretty good, particularly when you have like pictures, when you take a picture of a
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.000]   bee landing on a flower and it's almost there, but not quite, then you realize, oh, wait a minute,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.880]   they actually did capture those frames. But the other thing that I'm really in love with,
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.800]   it's just such a simple thing, automatic keystone correction, where you're used to it being able to,
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.840]   like the picture below right there, where you're used to it being able to automatically find it,
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.680]   oh, I bet that's a horizontal line, let's level it on that horizontal line,
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:11.040]   but it will also make sure that green front door, because I was shooting up the stairs,
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.960]   it's like keystone perspective away from you. And so it's actually kind of magic, you touch the
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:24.160]   auto button and not only does the picture animate to the right level, but also it sort of like
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.200]   tilts in the right direction so that now all the everything that's facing you that's supposed to be
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.440]   right angles is now right angles. And it's really, I just love the, not only the fact that they've
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.480]   done this, but also how they've implemented it and kind of made it look almost like a video game.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.240]   You just want to press the button, see what happens. So for those of you listening, you can see this
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:51.600]   at Andy's Instagram, Instagram.com/ihnateko. And yeah, there's some really nice images there,
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.720]   really does show off the, I could tell you having fun with it, show off the camera. I'm having super
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.320]   fun. Some of these are, I did post processing with Photoshop, but that's, I think I've kind of
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.960]   changed my mind on how to kind of evaluate for myself how well these really, really good phone
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.160]   cameras work where it used to be, okay, well, I'm going to go to the Boston Public Library,
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.000]   and I'm going to shoot the same scene with like four different cameras to see how they work.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.800]   Now I think I'm just going to take that, take a picture with the iPhone 11, and then I'm going to
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:29.920]   try to take the same picture with my regular like Olympus, like real, real standalone camera.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.640]   And just, and then maybe even do a little editing on both because that's kind of how you work with
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.480]   any real camera, because I think the pictures that come straight out of the iPhone 11,
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.480]   the only complaint I have is that they could use a little bit more salt. It's like they're a little
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.400]   bit dull in color. I suppose I should say conservative in color. I really wish they
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.680]   popped a little bit more, but it's easy to fix inside the photo app. So when you start to
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.880]   see what's there by putting it into Photoshop and treating it like a real photo, you can really
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:08.880]   get some great stuff out of it. So I'm on Friday of before or after my radio at the Boston Public
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.800]   Library, I'm going to do, I'm going to go to the public garden and do my usual like squirrel tests.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.560]   And that's going to be like the big, that's going to be the big fun and also have my tripod,
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.520]   and that's going to be the real, like real aggression. I'm going to see what this thing can do when I'm
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.680]   not just walking around and having fun with it. As somebody said in one of the comments, I feel
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.720]   sorry for camera manufacturers. This is, this is, yeah, thing is, it's in your pocket. You got it.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.720]   You know, if you pixel peep, okay, maybe there's going to be some issues. I think one of the reasons
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.360]   Apple decided not to heighten the colors is because that's what Samsung does a little bit,
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.880]   and maybe they wanted to offer something. They prefer you to do that on your own,
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.240]   because you figure like if they crush the blacks and boost the stats, you'll like it more, but it's
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:55.920]   harder to recover. Well, I'm not sure that's really true given that when you do the push the
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:01.440]   auto button yourself, it's going to, you can always take that back later on. I think it could
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:07.760]   still capture all that data, decide to give you like a more seasoned picture. It's like, I kind of,
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.680]   I often say that yes, the McDonald's hamburger has lots of salt and fat in it, but people like
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.960]   lots of salt and lots of fat. So I agree, I agree that things could be, you could really go overboard
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.600]   with that, but I just don't want people to take a picture of a sunset and be disappointed by what
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.840]   they see and think that they're gold. Yeah, exactly, particularly if someone, if they're comparing
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.320]   to somebody who has a a Samsung phone that's going to boost the colors a little bit more,
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.280]   but also has an OLED screen instead of their LED screen and think, oh, wow, how come my, my,
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.840]   my iPhone's quote greatest camera in the world takes such lackluster photos. No, no, it takes
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:49.360]   great photos just like go into the photo, go touch the edit button and just slide that slider a
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.640]   little bit to the right and you'll love it. And you'll especially love it when you, a year or two
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.800]   later when you just when you start learning how to use Photoshop. And now you realize that you've
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.520]   got so much data in there that you can turn that into even much better sort of image. So that's,
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.120]   that's all I'm thinking. But yeah, the thing I was talking about with the line correction is that
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.440]   they, if you flip on the use, the continuous data from that, it'll actually shoot the wide
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.600]   angle camera at the same time. And then if it has to move the picture or angle it or rotate it,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.080]   it'll fill in. Instead of you cutting off the sides, we're having to crop down, it'll fill in
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.520]   with the data from the wide angle camera and give you just the photo you want, not with, with very
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.080]   few compromises. You can't have it on with deep focus because they conflict, sorry, deep
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.680]   fusion because they conflict. But if you're not using deep fusion, you can leave that on and just
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:46.320]   always recover external imagery. So many questions. All right. Deep fusion will put on the back burner,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.840]   it is starting to come out in the beta. And I do want to talk about that. But for those of us who
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.040]   don't, where are these settings? Is it in the, is it in the settings?
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.400]   And camera? Yeah, camera, there's a, there's two settings, one for video, one for video and one for
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.000]   image. The video one is on by default because when it does that new quick video, it needs to
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.360]   auto stabilize. And that means that either has to crop or it has to pull data from the wider sensor.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.760]   So what it does by default is pull data from the wider sensor so that it can do the stabilization
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.720]   while you're still getting the video that you see. So this is, they don't turn on photos capture
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:26.560]   outside the image and videos capture outside the image. And then underneath it, auto apply
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.440]   adjustments is the, is the straightening thing you're talking about? Yeah, it'll do both. It'll,
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.920]   for example, if we take a picture of me, you, Andy and Lori, and I get cropped out a little bit,
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.720]   it'll, it'll notice that my face is cropped and it'll re it'll backfill the image with the data from
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:46.160]   the ultra wide lens. It's not on by default though, because there, you know, Apple is overly
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.720]   sensitive about privacy. And if you're framing a shot to keep certain things out of the photo,
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.240]   they don't want you to accidentally include information that shouldn't be in the photo.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.880]   So that's something you want to go into photo into a camera settings and turn on.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.000]   And it sounds like all three of those. And what's also cool is that if you go in, like,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.840]   you'll see that little yellow button, it looks like a frame with like a, like they called it
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.480]   magic frame before, but a frame with a little star and that'll turn yellow and pop up auto if
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.880]   it detects something. Where is that? But if you just go into crop, if you go to one of your photos,
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:22.480]   okay, let me open a photo here. Right on the, on the, because a live photo, there's a little
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:28.720]   icon on the left. And if there's extra, extra crop data, there's a little icon on the right,
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.360]   but you can also go into crop. And if you've gotten that extra data, you can manually move
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.000]   it around inside the crop. Like if things are on set, just want to see.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.040]   So I have a yellow dot underneath that dial on this photo. What does that mean then?
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.360]   It's not that that would be the top right corner of the photo.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.840]   If you had that, that being enabled. Apparently, I don't, apparently I didn't have it enabled.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.320]   Oh, nuts, man. And it'll throw out the extra data after a month, so it doesn't clog up your storage.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:00.480]   These are pictures I took at our little party we had last Thursday at the distillery.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.600]   If you take half of Carston's head now, maybe it'll work.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:10.640]   I got to say there's, there's so much real, this is the biggest change that they've,
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.440]   I think they've made to the basic interface of the camera app and the, and the editing features.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.320]   This is probably the first time that I'm actively recommending people to go to the iBook store and
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:26.320]   download, download the user guide for the new iOS and the new iPhone.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.200]   That has all this stuff. And that that's not a complaint really about
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.920]   about how difficult, quote, difficult, unquote, this app is to use. It's just that they've put a
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:39.920]   lot of features in here that I think by necessity don't absolutely explain themselves.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:47.760]   And there were a couple of things where like I normally turn off live picture because in the past,
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:53.200]   it's just been, I've thought of it as this really annoying feature that just makes sure that I
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.960]   can't actually see photos as photos when I scroll through them. It'll always give me like a really
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.720]   lame quasi movie and had to remind myself to turn it back on because it's now doing a lot better
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.040]   with this. So if I don't have live photos turned on, none of this, no, this applies.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:15.760]   Well, exactly. The stuff about being able to the old iOS 11 feature about being able to select a
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.720]   frame before or after the one that you actually took. Because I was always under the impression,
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:26.160]   live photos degraded the image slightly. So it does because it's like Renee said,
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.520]   it's taking a JPEG from the dot move file. So it's not shooting at the full resolution,
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.640]   the full capabilities that built in camera. But if you're, but you'll still have the original
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:43.120]   photo of your kid swinging at the pitch, but you will also be able to pull out exactly the picture
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.640]   of the of the ball getting going off. That's the best. That's the best shot feature.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:54.080]   Does that also required for the making it a little bit wider? Do any. No. No. Okay.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:00.080]   Yeah, I'm gonna have to read the manual. Clearly. Yeah. This is good. And more importantly,
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:06.160]   the advice that applied to previous versions may not apply very well. Like turn off live photo.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.840]   There might be a reason you want to have a hundred articles on I'm more. Oh, good. Lori,
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:15.040]   that's you know, I'd much rather read Lori than the manual. So that's good to know.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.240]   A little more interesting.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.520]   Absolutely. I have better pictures.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.120]   No, I know. You know what's great about those? They have a long tail because I always go back
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.120]   and say, how do I do this? And I could find Lori's article. That's always a good thing.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:30.160]   Yeah. And we always get them updated so that there's so now you've got both versions,
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.360]   like you've got the iPhone 11 and and the older iPhone how to use your camera stuff. So it's all
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.400]   it's all mashed in there for people who don't have the 11 and 2. So.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:43.760]   So deep fusion's coming out and that changes everything or what? It's in the developer beta now.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:49.440]   Neelai Patel calls it sweater mode because all of Apple's demos with the life.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:56.080]   You know, I can see why they would do that though because the sweater you you can zoom in to see
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:01.520]   the knit of the sweater. So I can see why they're doing that. They're using like a very textured.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.200]   Okay. So what does deep fusion do that's new, Lori?
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.800]   Look at your article. Are you still writing it?
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:16.000]   Well, you know, we didn't do a whole lot about deep fusion because it wasn't out yet. So nobody
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.320]   has written anything about deep fusion yet, but don't worry, it's coming. It enhances it and
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:29.040]   sort of like makes it like a little bit brighter and deeper. It's almost like having
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.160]   not and this is silly to go this far, but it's sort of like having a film camera.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:40.320]   It really get it captures the detail in in a much better way and a much deeper way so that
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:48.080]   you kind of get like a brighter, clearer picture going. So if you can remember, you know, your old film
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:54.800]   photographs, if you were to like, you know, put them into your computer and like zoom and zoom and
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.880]   zoom, you get really deep and get really detailed way in the background. You can do that.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:05.280]   Not quite like that, but you can really get that kind of extra detail with with the
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:12.320]   deep fusion going. Here's from the Virgis article. The iPhone 11 11 pro cameras will now have three
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.120]   new four modes of operation will automatically kick in based on light levels and the lens you're
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.880]   using the standard wide angle lens. Standard wide angle lens is not ultra wide. That's what I'd
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:28.080]   call the normal lens, the middle lens, right? We'll use Apple's enhanced smart HDR for bright to
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:34.880]   medium lit scenes. Deep fusion will kick in for medium to low light. And then it's night mode for
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:42.880]   dark scenes. The tele lens will use mostly deep fusion with smart HDR taking over for very bright
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:48.640]   scenes night mode for very dark scenes. The ultra wide does not support either deep fusion or
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:55.280]   night mode. It always uses smart HDR app. That's confusing. But how the whole point is Apple isn't
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.800]   why you even know this, right? They don't even want you to think about it. You know, I was going to
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:04.400]   I was going to say exactly that. I've something that confused me was, okay, when is it using a
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.760]   when is it taking a regular picture? When is it using smart HDR? And when is it using deep fusion?
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:15.280]   I know that it's giving me a visual reminder whenever I'm using night mode where they could
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.240]   they could have just simply said, and we've we've we've used a lot of new we've used a lot
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.720]   new technologies to make sure that no matter what the situation, it will take the best picture
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.600]   possible when they're talking about, okay, now it's using now it's using deep fusion now it's
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.400]   using smart HDR now it's not even doing HDR. We want to know what the hell's going on.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.280]   Yeah, I just put it in a blog post like Google would just say we use HDR plus for older pixels
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.880]   and we use super zoom for newer pixels and here's all the nerdy details and it's in a blog post
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:49.760]   only there's all fine. Yeah. Yeah. It's also a little confusing because supposedly night mode only
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.440]   uses the white ultra wide super one. Yes. No, it only uses the regular
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:02.160]   wide angle. Well, it says though, it will use night mode for standard and tele if the scenes
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.440]   are very dark. Yeah, I believe it'll crop in like simulate the way it does for for some of the other
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.280]   shots when there's not enough light, it'll simulate the telephoto because you have enough data.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.560]   You can't simulate ultra wide because so the ultra wide has the main shooter the wide angle
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:23.120]   has 100% focus pixels really good. It's like the best 12 megapixel camera you can get and it does
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.560]   all the heavy lifting. The telephoto has some focus pixels and OIS, but it's because of the
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:34.080]   aperture. It's not as good at low light. So sometimes it'll switch to the main camera and just machine
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:40.240]   learn it to make it look like the telephoto. The ultra wide angle has no focus pixels and no OIS
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:45.200]   but it can get wider shots, but you can't simulate that with the wide angle because you don't have
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:52.640]   the ultra wide data to work off of it. Right. So this is what Apple told Neelite. There's no
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:57.680]   indicator in the camera app that deep fusion is on. It's invisible to the user. There's no
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:02.880]   indicator in the photo roll. It doesn't show up in the ex-if data. Apple says that's very much
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.520]   intentional. It doesn't want you to think about how to get the best photo. The idea is the camera
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:14.320]   will just sort it out for you. By the time it's different than smart HDR, I guess that's important.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.440]   By the time you press the shutter button, the camera's already got three frames. They talked
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:22.480]   about this on stage. At a fast shutter speed, that's to freeze motion. Press the shutter,
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:30.240]   it takes three more shots. And then one long exposure shot over exposed probably to capture
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:36.800]   detail. The three regular shots in the long exposure shot are merged together into what they
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:43.920]   call a synthetic long. Then deep fusion picks the short exposure image with the most detail.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:53.360]   It has three, remember, emerges it with the synthetic long exposure. But it only merges those
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:59.440]   two frames. The two images are also processed for noise differently than smart HDR in a way
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:06.240]   that's better for deep fusion than that's not all. The images are run through four detail
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.160]   processing steps. This is all by the way in the blink of an eye while you, you know,
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:15.680]   basically while you're looking at the picture. Pixel by pixel, each tailored to an increasing
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:21.040]   amount of detail. So this is where the machine learning comes in. The skies and the walls,
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:29.040]   lowest band, skin, hair, fabrics, the highest or sweaters, the highest band. And then this
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.320]   creates a series of weightings for how the two images are blended, taking detail from one in
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.960]   tone, color, and luminance from the other than generating the final image. I presume Renee that
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.600]   you already have this, you're on developer beta, yes.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.840]   Yeah, although it hasn't shown up for me yet, but Matthew Pansvino also has a really good write up
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.680]   on tech crunch where he gets into a lot of the details about how the two images are generated
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:55.360]   and merged. But it's really smart. Like it takes those two final images and generates a double size,
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:00.720]   I think 24 megapixel final image out of it. And it's a little bit like, I know some people really
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.840]   want to be able to manually control night mode and they can't or they want to manually control
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.400]   deep fusion and they can't. He has a good workaround though. If you turn on what we were just talking
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.680]   about that magic crop, it turns off deep fusion because it's forcing the ultra wide to shoot
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.080]   and deep fusion can't use the ultra wide. So right now because of that technical imitation,
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.120]   you have to choose between having the extra crop data or having deep fusion. But you can play
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:30.400]   one off the other. I have to say the sample images that apples provided, here's another guy in a sweater.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:36.160]   It's amazing. You can see an eyelash on one of the sweaters. It is really astounding.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:41.120]   Yeah, the detail is really good. And yet where you don't care about detail, it's fine.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:49.360]   Neil, I says it takes about a second longer for the image to be processed, but that's a second is
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.520]   one thousand one. You can't beat it. Like when I was trying it at the event, by the time you hit
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.160]   the gallery button, it's pretty much done. So you'd have to be a super fast interface person to
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:03.520]   even see the end bit of it, I think. Yeah. And that's really something that Apple needs to be
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.640]   praised for in addition to the quality of the images that when the frustrating, I think that my
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.760]   pixel camera takes really good pictures. But the number of times where it just takes a while to
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:19.520]   process something, the number of times where I can't get the next picture in as fast as I want to take
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:24.800]   it is just frustrating. The biggest fail of any camera, no matter who's designing it,
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:29.040]   no matter whether there's a phone or whether it's a traditional camera, is you press the button to
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:33.280]   take a picture and it does not take a picture. No matter what the excuses, whereas every single
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.160]   iPhone I've ever used from the very, very beginning, when you press that white button,
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.800]   it will take some kind of a picture that will never be anything less than good. And that's what a
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:48.240]   phone camera is supposed to be able to do. It's not necessary. All the extras that you can get in
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.960]   an app like halide camera and everything you can do within the regular camera app to adjust exposure,
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:58.560]   change focus points, use different modes. Those are all great. But the whole purpose of a phone
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:04.000]   camera is here is a big white button. And when you push this, you will get a picture that is not
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.360]   less than very good. Because that's what people use phone cameras for. I mean, people like me,
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:15.360]   who are nerds for photography, they I love, I love editing it on the device. I love putting it
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:21.840]   my my MacBook and then seeing what what all kinds of monkeying around with Photoshop can do.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.480]   But people want a good snapshot of this place where they went to of the or their friends at
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:32.720]   this bar or their parents, seeing their grandkids for the first time. They don't necessarily care
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.880]   that, well, the shadow details and very, very good or there's a blown highlight right here.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.400]   They want to make sure if they press this white button, all they got to do is press the button.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:45.760]   They'll get a really, really good picture. They don't want to have to like shake the camera
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:51.680]   to figure out why is it kind of locked up right now? And why is the the white button gray for the
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.280]   next for the next two or three seconds, which is what you get sometimes with Android cameras.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.720]   So that's I don't want that to be lost in the shuffle with all this technical stuff about what
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:04.080]   it's doing with machine learning and processing. The fact is push a white button, get a really good
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.920]   picture that's always been the thing that is almost exclusively a feature of the iPhone.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:17.040]   Fun to know. Yeah. Panzareno, Panzareno points out that while there this is actually a really good tip,
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.280]   make a note of this when you get deep fusion. There's currently no way to turn off the deep
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:27.440]   fusion process. But, but because the over crop feature of the new cameras uses the ultra wide,
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:34.800]   a small hack to see the difference between a deep fusion and not deep fusion is to turn on
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:41.200]   over crop, which will disable deep fusion as it does not use the ultra wide lens. Renee,
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.720]   would you explain what he just said to me? I don't understand. What is that?
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.600]   There's a hardware limitation where because there's no optical image stabilization and no focus
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:55.360]   pixels on the ultra wide, it's not used for a lot of the fancy stuff. It really is just a regular
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.720]   camera. It's not used for night mode. It's not used for any of those things. So when that is
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:04.160]   enabled, it can't do a lot of the extra things. But when you turn that off, it's going to, so I'm
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:09.280]   not explaining this very well, deep fusion can't have the ultra wide camera on at the same time.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:16.560]   And the extra area data can't be used when diffusion is on. So you can pick between the two. And
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:21.280]   which whenever one you pick is on, the other one turns off. And remind you, how do we turn on the
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.960]   extra area data? Is that live? That was what we did before. When you went to the camera app and
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:30.160]   you said capture outside of capture. So if you turn that off, you'll have to turn that off to
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.040]   get any deep fusion. Yes. And if you turn it on, it turns off. So that's why Apple leaves that
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.720]   off by default. So I'm going to go back into my camera. Well, they said, no, they said,
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:42.640]   they said that wasn't there was like other technical reasons I understand is privacy based.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah. You said that too. It'd be better for people to have it off.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:50.640]   When do we get deep fusion? If it's in beta developer beta now, it's still a little ways off,
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:55.440]   right? Yeah, usually a couple for the dot the point releases were pretty fast, though. I mean,
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:02.480]   3.1.1 came up at the torrid rate of point releases. Who knows? Yeah. They are they are paddling while
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:07.920]   the cutting off kind of amazing. I can't even keep up anymore. I was actually just updating to
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.560]   3.1.2 right now while we were talking. Oh, yeah, that's right. That came out too.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.160]   All right. Well, let's take a break and then I want to talk about that and what's going on.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.040]   Oh, Leo, can I just add one to Andy's point? Yes.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.200]   Previously, I mentioned this before, but when we were at CES, a lot of the Android Central
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.760]   writers were switching out of pixel and onto Samsung or Huawei, just because it doesn't get
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.760]   the camera out of memory fast enough and it was dropping frames. And Daniel Bader's on the same
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.680]   thing now that he has a baby because he doesn't want to miss that little baby move or drop frames
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:41.040]   on the video. So it's one of those things that at the Silicon level, Apple has really invested a lot
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:45.040]   in. And to Andy's point, I think it has a lot of credit for not just making a good camera,
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.360]   not just making a good chip, but building all these custom storage controllers and
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:54.320]   imaging pipelines and accelerators that make sure that you press that button and you get that photo
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:27:00.400]   every time. It's damn impressive. That's all I can say. Good. Good.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:06.480]   It really is. And I can't, as you know, I'm going on vacation about three weeks to the Middle East.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:12.000]   I don't think I'm going to get the pixel for in time. Google's event is October 15th. I'm leaving
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.480]   the 21st, which is a bummer because I was like, I can send you one. Hey, Google. Oh, this is a
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:24.720]   wrong show for that. But I would love to take both and kind of do some side by side. But hey,
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:30.240]   that's life. I am going to be taking a ridiculous camera. You know, and I'll try to, I'll try to
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:38.080]   compare what Apple does because I'm bringing the Sony A7 461 megapixels. All right. So,
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:43.280]   so basically, if you if you aim it at the correct side of the planet as your subject,
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.840]   you will get a usable picture. You'll get everything. Talk about those. Well, but actually,
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:53.280]   that's the funny thing, because this is infinitely harder to use. With with all that resolution,
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:59.040]   low lights difficult. Plus, you better not have any hammer, hammer, shake or hand movement or
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:03.280]   anything because you're going to have real motion blur with all those megapixels. So,
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.280]   this is actually technically going to be a lot harder to use than the the iPhone.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:12.560]   We are you are you taking that for testing purposes or just no, it's my new camera. I just got it.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:18.800]   Yeah, it just seems so bulky to carry around. Shut up. And no, no, this is this.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:26.240]   Let's put it this way. This is six iPhones worth of camera. But this is why I think the new camera
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:32.080]   technology, not just an iPhone, but in all phones, is so great because that like we used to all
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:37.040]   carry around these big bulky cameras. And now we have a phone that actually it's obviously not
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.760]   going to compare to your camera. Well, I don't know if that's true. Most of us. Well, I guess
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:47.760]   we'll find out. Well, no, well, I mean, yes and no, but I mean, I took a lot of camera gear to Machu
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:53.920]   Picchu a few years ago, including a Pixel 2. And the best picture I got was with the Pixel 2.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.800]   And it was mostly because of the timing and I had it and it was right there. But it also did a good
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:08.880]   job. And so, you know, look at the difference in weight and size and cost for 99% of the these.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:14.720]   Yeah. Which one are you bringing to CES? Well, okay. So Carson, that's an interesting question
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:19.600]   because Ant and I are going to do the Leo and Ant Show at CES in January. And what we want to do
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:24.880]   is just gun and run, just quickly want run from booth to booth and do a couple of minutes at every
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:31.120]   booth, right? Do 20 or 30 of these like capture every booth at CES that's worth it. And at the end
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.680]   we'll do our top, you know, each of us will pick our five favorite things or whatever. But the question
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:42.000]   is, especially Filmic Pro comes out with its multi camera edition by January, which I'm sure they
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.240]   will. This would be awfully easy. I just put this on a little gig maybe with a microphone.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:51.760]   On the other hand, I've got a shotgun mic that goes on this and this has great video capabilities.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.920]   I'm gonna, you know, we're gonna do we're gonna do some tests. We're gonna go to some
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:02.080]   conferences and other events with both and see which one is the best result. My guess,
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:10.320]   the iPhone's gonna win. Well, convenience. A lot easier on the other hand. And for years,
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:17.920]   TV news shooters continue to carry around giant beta cams, 45 pound beta cams on their shoulders,
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:23.200]   even though they could get a much lighter because it looked more professional. People didn't take
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:29.680]   them seriously. They were with their eyeful. It's a lot easier to hold one of those steady than to
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:35.840]   hold a little camera. Do you ever heard of a thing? Yeah, right. Have you ever heard of that
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:42.320]   Osmo, the thing? Yeah, that's what I was just thinking. That's true. You got a steady cam for crying
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:50.560]   out loud. All I'm all I'm saying is that one of our wonderful members of this panel, Renee,
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:56.080]   as upgraded his camera and he's not for a studio and he's not shooting everything on an iPhone 11
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:02.400]   or a Galaxy Note. Are you using a red? No, I have a C200 for a roll, but I shoot everything else on
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:09.040]   the iPhone. All the B roll is iPhone. How's the color matching with that?
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:14.880]   You've got the Canon, right? Is that a Canon? Yeah. And then you've got iPhone. Normally,
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:20.640]   the color matching is difficult, right? Yeah, but because I'm working with so many different,
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:28.800]   some people at Mobile Nations shoot with Canon, a lot of them shoot with GH5s, a lot shoot with
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:34.800]   Sony's. I think Michael Fisher is shooting with a Fuji right now. So I've given up at this point
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:40.080]   for B roll. I just end these different depths of field and they have different styles.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.920]   So I let that be eclectic and I just worry about really nice a roll on my head.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:51.600]   I'm sorry, the only point I was getting to there is that I think that the median quality of photos
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:57.040]   is now pretty much overlapping between a professional camera and a really, really good phone. However,
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:03.280]   the best pictures and the best video are noticeably always going to be coming from not just a better
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:08.000]   camera, but also a camera operated by somebody who knows how to operate it, then it will be by
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.600]   an iPhone. But again, in terms of running gun, in terms of taking a picture and making sure that
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:18.480]   you got a good shot, I think that you're going to get much better shots on average with a regular
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:23.920]   camera than something that requires me to stop and think each and every time I squeeze the shot.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.640]   And look at this deep fusion image. I mean, I don't know if I could get a better image than that
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:36.480]   with the Sony, honestly. Yeah, I could think of ways to approve it, but not in terms of, hey,
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.840]   Josh, before we go before you have to get your plane, let me get it. Let me let's get a picture
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:45.040]   of you. I would I think the way to improve that would be, hey, Josh, let me make you uncomfortable
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.520]   while I make sure I dial in things absolutely perfectly and set up this bounce light and do all
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:54.320]   this other sort of stuff. That's the it's the other good advantage of these cameras, phone
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.640]   cameras is that people think you're just goofing around when you just take a picture with your
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.760]   phone camera. They don't know that this is something that, well, Josh, I know that you're about to
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.840]   you're about to do cave diving for the first time. And I'm really concerned you're going to die. So
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:13.200]   I want to have a good picture of you to remember you by before you die. And let's also that,
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:20.960]   because the iPhone is connected to the internet, this number of steps to get the video or stills
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:27.120]   out of the Sony process them, upload them. That's a few days later. That's more like film.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:33.520]   The iPhone, it's on Instagram in three seconds. And so for move to say nothing about journalists
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:40.320]   who are need to get need to get this off of their off off of away from the site and onto an
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:44.640]   international server as quickly as possible. That's going to be a consideration at CES because if I
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:49.600]   especially film a pro comes out because they have their own storage. If I can shoot this
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:57.040]   on film pro do the reverse do the forward maybe even do a zoom in one shot one take
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:00.400]   it's saved to film a pro and it's uploading while I'm going in the next booth.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:06.000]   I don't care if the iPhone looks like a potato. That's going to that's how we're going to do it.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:13.520]   Yeah. And it doesn't look like a potato looks great. It's arguably better than almost anything
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:18.000]   else. I mean if the video is spectacular on the iPhone, it's really impressive. And I have to say
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.240]   if I'm a camera manufacturer, honestly, maybe not, you know, if we've been laughing in Nikon and
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:28.800]   Canon because they're kind of stuck with mirrors and they're, you know, but honestly, maybe they're
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.760]   smart. Maybe there's maybe there's maybe there's a slide done like a Fox because the market that's
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:38.800]   going to continue by Canon and Nikon's is going to buy the big heavy bulky $10,000
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:44.960]   DSLR and the cameras that are in trouble already are the point and shoots the stuff in the mid range
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.680]   where I would love to have a play Leo like car play but where your iPhone or Android can just
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:54.640]   take over your Nikon or your Canon's interface. We can do that. We can almost do that now because
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:35:00.720]   all of the Canon Nikon Leica Sony all have software that allows you to open it up, see through the
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:06.560]   lens on the iPhone or on the iPad shoot immediately transferred over because I think they recognize
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.800]   that's pretty important. Yeah, I'm thinking, oh, you're gonna hate me too. I'm thinking I'm
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.680]   I want to depends if this new iPad that's been rumored comes out with a camera. Oh, I love that so
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:20.560]   much. We did see yes like that. The viewfinder is so good, especially for closeups to really
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:26.320]   frame things. I'll be so embarrassed walking around. Hey, can I just shoot a video of your of your
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:32.400]   boots here? I really if you have the smart the smart keyboard dangling off the bottom, you get
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:38.880]   double points. Even better. Yeah, why did I take it off? Hey, can I shoot a video? I'm from twin.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:44.640]   Best accessory you want you want one of those like black cloth hoods like when a old but
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:49.920]   played photography read just like you look at a nun. Lean into it. Oh, yeah, lean into it. Wait a
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:58.160]   minute. I can do that. Yes. Oh my god. You're like Indiana Jones. Do you mind if I shoot your
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:04.480]   boots? I'm from twin. I'm gonna cover you. We're big time. I guess pepper spray. But it'd be
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:09.760]   worth it. Big time. Now you're gonna hear you're gonna hear a long poof and then a cloud of smoke
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:16.240]   that's just the magnesium going off. Oh, I've been watching deadwood where that's how the
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:21.200]   newspaper guy shoots everything. And he always it always the flash goes off too soon. He's always
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.680]   all all right. Let's take I have to tell you a break, but we'll come back. There's so much more
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:32.240]   to talk about Renee Richie, I'm more calm and the vector podcast, which we now know he shoots in
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:40.240]   multiple color temperatures. I'm a mess. He's a mess. Look, Ethan. No one noticed. That's the
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:46.400]   funny thing. Nobody even thought about it. Lori Gill, managing editor at iMore. Great to have you
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:55.520]   punk rock singer hair color yellow today yellow. Today. Yes. And Andy Inaco sideburns exactly where
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:59.920]   they left them. All your sideburns are where we left. Does that the new Apple watch you're showing
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:05.920]   off there? Young. Yeah, this is also the remote shutter for my scroll pictures on Friday. Oh,
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:10.400]   we're going to have to talk about that. Yes. There's lots to say Andy with of course,
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:15.840]   WGBH in Boston, Boston Public Radio. Our show today brought to you by Zapier.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:22.800]   I am such a fan of Zapier. I use it all the time. I set up a new Zap every day. I think of a new
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.760]   thing I want to automate. If you've not used it, you've got to check it out. Zapier is kind of what
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:34.080]   we dreamed of in days gone by when we thought someday everybody will be programming. I almost
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:40.320]   don't want to say that because it's not programming. It's it's it's automating, but it actually between
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:46.800]   you and me. It really is. It's just easy. Zapier connects the apps you use, whether it's Twitter,
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:57.440]   Facebook, sales force, your SQL database to other apps to automate your work. 1500 plus apps,
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:07.600]   your email, your your CRM. And it means that you can automate the boring work that you do over and
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:11.600]   over again. I'll give you an example. We just set up our Twitter forums. I'll talk about that a
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:18.800]   little bit later on. I wanted a way to automatically get the new shows as they are published into the
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:24.000]   forums. I thought, I wonder if Zapier supports discourse or software? Yes, it does. Oh, well,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.360]   then I could take the RSS feed when I see a new item. I can automatically create a new forum post.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:34.960]   You it took me literally a minute. And we got this automation going and I'll never have to touch
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:39.840]   it. Never have to look at it again. And that's the that's the whole key to this is if you do
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:45.120]   something over and over again, you should automate it. You should automate it. That's what Zapier
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:52.880]   lets you do. By the way, Zapier supports multi step zaps. That's really handy whenever I in my
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:57.920]   news reader, I favorite an article. It automatically sends it to pinboard. It automatically tweets it
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:02.640]   to Twitter. It automatically creates a new line in a spreadsheet at Google Sheets. So Carson could
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:08.240]   add it to the show. Multi step zaps really mean you're efficient. In fact, so efficient.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:14.720]   I love this stat. Four and a half million people currently using Zapier on average. They save
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:21.520]   40 hours a month. That's like getting a fifth work week every month. But you don't have to do
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:26.640]   anything. Build the solution you need in minutes. No more wasting your time on tasks you know could
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:35.120]   be automated because Zapier can do it. Go to zapier.com/macbreak zapir. Connect the apps you use the most.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:39.600]   Let's Zapier take it from there. And you don't have to ask a developer help for help. You are
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:44.720]   you're a coder. You'll feel powerful. You'll feel strong. Make more time to grow your business.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:50.640]   Make more time to do the things you love. Get more done right now through November. Zapier is free

[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:07.680]   We thank Zapier for their support. I've been using him for years. And what's fun about Zapier
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:12.960]   find new ways you think about new ways to use it all the time. My next step is to kind of integrate
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:20.240]   it into shortcuts so I can have my holy grail. And I think I can do this. I haven't sat down
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:27.360]   under is that when I leave the house to come to do iOS today it sends a text with a pin on the map
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:32.560]   of where I am and how long it's going to take to get here so that Micah and the team can have
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:40.960]   another cup of coffee. It's going to happen John. Zapier. Zapier.com/macbreak.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:51.840]   You like a rutweiler or something. Where do we want to go next? What is going on with updates?
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:59.520]   We are now at 13.1.2. Remember Alex used to always say never install the first big iOS update.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:07.760]   Never install the update to the update. Not 13.0 not 13.1. He says install the update that fixes
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:13.520]   the things that the update to the update broke 13.1.1 but we're already at 13.1.2.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:20.160]   There was a hell of a problem with some people with iPads. They got the update that knocked out
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:26.240]   their Wi-Fi which made it impossible for them to get a future update. And yeah you just want to
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:32.000]   bolt their hand. And yeah it was a rare thing and there was a fix available for it but it's like
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.520]   when you realize that not only not only do I not have Wi-Fi I now unless I go out and buy myself
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:43.520]   an ethernet adapter for my iPad there's no way that I can get the patch that will fix this. Yay?
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:57.600]   So my puzzlement is why didn't they catch all this stuff in the public beta. They did months
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:02.480]   of public beta. They did months even more months of developer beta. How come they're finding these
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:08.720]   bugs now? My guess my only very partially informed guess is last year with iOS 12 they took that
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:13.200]   moment when they said okay we're going to push back some features and we're going to have our
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:18.960]   best engineers work on making it more performant especially on older devices and they literally
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:23.120]   did. The people who invented the framework stopped working on what they were doing next and they
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:27.840]   went back and they fixed performance and it was a really really great saw it was like probably a
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:32.160]   beta was probably a solid as some of the releases have been and it was fantastic but what I think
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:38.400]   that they didn't carry that on and they should have kept that pace where maybe they don't have all
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:42.400]   the features but they're keeping everything rock solid and instead I think they went back
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:47.200]   to a very aggressive release schedule and when you start adding an iPad OS and everything they did
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:52.560]   then it simply just stretched everybody too far and not all of it was ready in time for release
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:57.360]   and unfortunately when you have those iPhone shipping they're going to have iPhone iOS 13 on them
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:03.840]   and it's been catch up ever since. Yeah I understand the 130 and then the rapid 13 one that's just
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:08.000]   what happens you have to make these months ahead of time so. Well usually it's not like usually the
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.120]   .1 comes out like late October and they make a big deal about it because it has a new emoji
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:20.480]   and that really you know drives all the downloads. This year it's like 13 is at 13.1 is in beta it's
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:25.760]   coming out a week after 13 came out and now we've got the .1 and now we've got the .2 in beta. How are
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:32.080]   we doing with .2? Are people happy? I think it's just a developer one that came out right now I think.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:41.840]   13.1.2 or do you mean 13.2? 13.1.2 I'm sorry my numbers are bad I used to call it. I know well
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:47.520]   I apologize at least I get the desk. They're happening so rapidly that it's getting us
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:53.440]   so confused anyway but I think a couple of one really big thing that came out and maybe not
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:58.080]   everybody thinks it's that big of a deal but I think it's pretty cool is that shortcuts now work
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:05.200]   on the home pod so you can now use your home pod to trigger those shortcuts that you have set up
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:12.080]   in your home which is just kind of like another great addition to the to the general situation
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:16.640]   anybody in your house can trigger them if you want that was an intended update that they were
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.840]   going to ship though right that was something they said well that's coming. Yes exactly.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:28.720]   Oh no actually no this was actually I don't think that they intended it to not be available in 13.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:34.640]   I think that it was something that they may have the dimensionally left out. Yeah and they may
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:40.480]   have intentionally left it out at 13 but it wasn't originally when it was originally announced at
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:46.160]   WWC they I don't think they said and this will be coming later it was it was originally intended
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:50.960]   to come out with 13 and then they postponed that and fixed some bugs so that it will work in
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:57.600]   13.1.2. They also released for people on 12 still 12.4.2.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:05.520]   And that's for older devices so it's for so I'm wondering if there's a security issue maybe
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:10.640]   because sometimes there's secret security issues they're fixing yeah
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:17.840]   it could be it could be we don't know and they also released watch 6.0.1.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:23.360]   Yeah. What was that for? I think it's all just buggling since right now.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:28.080]   Like bug fixes battery life fixes comms fixes I think it's just a lot of stuff that had to be
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:33.840]   tweaked. I understand if there's new hardware that you you know the the long public beta was with
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:38.400]   last year's phone so I understand there's new hardware then oh there's a new watch there's new
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:42.160]   phone you maybe have bugs that you didn't anticipate because you didn't get to test as much.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:48.400]   So do you think we're going to see 13.1.3 next week or do you think it's going to be a while now?
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:54.880]   I would actually look I'm not I'm not opposed to the Google Chrome streaming bits model.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:58.640]   I mean I know some people really don't like to install things that they don't know about but I
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:04.880]   think we're moving to an era where you know we shouldn't be like slaves to the windows update.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:10.160]   No we need to update. We need to update. Yeah the problem is it's annoying the people so yeah what
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:15.600]   if you did it behind the scenes what if you just updated and let people opt out if they are really
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:20.080]   nervous or they work in production or in some other controlled environment and then they get a
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:25.840]   roll up every Windows Tuesday or whatever that's fine but other people you know they're just
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:33.360]   their device is just always up to date. I don't know about that when when Apple puts things on your
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:38.320]   phone without sort of getting your permission ahead of time you know we saw how that turned out
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:45.120]   and that was not not so happy when they did it with you with the U2 album so we're not we're not
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:51.280]   we're not familiar with that way of doing things we're familiar with with a way of doing things that
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:56.720]   is more asking our permission letting us know and and the idea of it just happening in the
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:01.600]   background once a week I don't think people would be happy with that with that. If it did by the way
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:06.240]   it doesn't know this auto updating it still doesn't seem to really do anything or maybe it's just waiting.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:13.200]   Well also I don't think iOS is architected so that it could apply every update without having to
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:17.120]   do some kind of a restart at some point we're doing something that's going to be disruptive to the
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:23.120]   user and the nothing nothing will just make me blow my top like okay great I've got I can
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.400]   I'm going to make my train it's going to be no problem I just have to be out of here in the next
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:30.080]   five or ten minutes all I got to do is download these four documents to make sure I have them on
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:34.640]   the iPad before I leave as long as I do that I got plenty of time and if I were to activate my
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:39.360]   iPad say hi yeah I'm we're applying updates right now we should be done in about 20 minutes
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.360]   yes only 20 minutes but I would be spitting nails to think that now I'm going to have to figure out
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:49.440]   how I live without these four files it was going to be a simple thing for me to do before you did
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:53.600]   something without asking me to give me a feature that I probably don't want or bug fix it doesn't
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:58.480]   really apply. And that's what happens with windows all the time and people are really about it.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:03.760]   It often happens with with my Mac as well there are times where there were many times in the
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:09.120]   past year or two where something just my Mac to start acting weird or something when my Mac
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:15.760]   may or whatever and I suspect oh god haven't I been saying no to applying an update that's been
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:20.640]   wanting to apply for the past three days and as soon as I restart and apply the update for some
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:25.120]   reason it seemed as though it kind of half installed something and now I need to restore
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.720]   stability by actually doing a fresh restart it's like thank you.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.880]   - Thank you. - Thank you for a sparkle where anytime you'd launch an app it would want to update
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:35.440]   you're like no I want to work. I want to work. - Yeah exactly. - And only like cable saucer would
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:43.680]   apply it after you work. - Yeah. There is a new jailbreak in town checkmate for all iOS devices
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:51.040]   running older chips A5 through A11. What's interesting about this one it is a ROM exploit.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:56.960]   So it's in the Apple boot ROM the secure boot ROM which means Apple can't really fix it.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:01.920]   Obviously- - It's not a jailbreak yet though. - Oh it's not. - It's an exploit that will likely be a
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:07.040]   jailbreak very soon. - Oh yeah. So that's how it all works. - It's not going to be a jailbreak.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:14.480]   You first you've got to find a way to crash a machine or jump into some code and then you can
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:20.000]   figure out how to make it useful. - And like so what this basically is like you said it's a solid
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.680]   jailbreak is a boot ROM exploit. Sorry not it's a boot ROM exploit. Previously most of the exploits
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:30.400]   have been operating system exploits which means Apple can update them and fix them in all of those
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:35.600]   frequent updates that we get. But as far as I know there no boot ROM exploit has ever been closed.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:40.400]   There's still a boot ROM exploit from 10 years ago I think on the A4 devices that has never been
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:45.520]   closed. So what this does is for jailbreakers for security researchers one of their biggest
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:49.600]   jobs is to get a complete boot chain so that they can get access to the device to either poke
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:55.360]   around for security purposes or to jailbreak it. And what this does is make that first part solid.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:59.760]   So they no longer have to worry about this on any of those devices from the iPhone 4s
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:04.560]   to the iPhone 10 that part will just work. They still have to worry about all the other stuff and
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:10.720]   for now it's going to be a tethered jailbreak and it's not a persistent exploit either. It goes
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:15.840]   into SRAM copies itself into it goes into SRAM to execute. So when you reboot you've got to do
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:20.800]   it all over again and for now plug in all over again. But for someone who just wants to play
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:26.800]   around with iOS that is not an impediment like for a bad for a bad actor you know it's it's not a
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:30.560]   great story because you have to have physical access to device it's only for as long as that
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:35.200]   access persists it's a whole bunch of hoopla. But for researchers and jailbreakers it's like
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:40.240]   the second coming of the Holy Grail. Yeah. That's good. By the way that's good. All of this is good
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.920]   it's not doesn't lower your security appreciably but it does make it possible for people to.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:47.440]   No like for celebrate and for a great place it's exactly like they already have those exploits
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:52.320]   this is just an alternative and if those exploits go away they'll just use this instead. So it doesn't
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:56.480]   change the deal in terms of sort of the black market for these sorts of things but it's a really
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:01.120]   big boon for jailbreakers and security researchers. Yes and it's also a big boon for people of border
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:05.040]   control who want to just take your phone away out of your site for just 10 minutes.
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:10.000]   And well they can't secure a secure enclave yet so I mean like it doesn't give you access to
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.720]   anything that's encrypted which is most of iOS data still so you'd have to then give it back to
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.480]   me force me to enter the passcode which you could have done before you took the phone away.
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:23.840]   So it can't be it can't be used remotely and it can't be used without the phone being unlocked
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:28.960]   first so that's. It can be used it just won't give you access like it'll give you access to the
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:33.920]   system but it won't give you access to personal data. Could it be used to install apps that the
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:42.960]   user then wouldn't see? Yes but if they had it but they had it but they developed it made a good
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:46.720]   point he said like you it would like have to be a family member basically and at that point
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:50.400]   they could just wait for you to fall asleep and put your finger on the on the passcode because
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:54.800]   that's the level of access you need and again anytime it reboots or it closes you have to do the whole
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:52:00.960]   thing over again. Go ahead Deloitte. Yeah so it's really it's really fairly secure for anybody who
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:05.520]   would be worried about something like this just like Renee is saying you actually have to have the
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:10.800]   phone on your person because you have to plug it into a computer and it won't bypass the pin it won't
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:18.400]   bypass the your access to your personal data so those you know all those factors in place
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:25.520]   even if someone steals my iPhone and tries to sell it on eBay they still can't get into my phone and
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:30.960]   and you know do what they want with it because there's there's still all these security places
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:35.680]   security features in place that stop that from happening even if they have my phone on their
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:42.400]   person directly so you're still very secure and this is really just to me like it's such a it's a
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:48.800]   celebration for jailbreakers I am not a jailbreaker but I have an iPhone SE right now that I'm thinking
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:53.600]   once there's a jailbreak attached to this exploit I'm probably going to do it just because I've never
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:58.240]   done it before because I've been a little bit scared to but I have an older device that's just
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:03.600]   sitting there waiting to have some fun stuff done with it and I think it's creative that people are
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:08.960]   going in there and you know putting on Linux or even Android on an iPhone or you know changing the
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:12.960]   settings so that they kind of have widgets places where you can never have them before to me that's
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:21.440]   like this beautiful creative world that that now gets this sort of extra treatment because
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:26.720]   you know you can update to every new operating system with these phones as long as Apple supports
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:33.040]   that device and still keep jailbreaking it so they can be on iOS 14 on an iPhone 10 and still
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:39.280]   jailbreaking but that seems so amazing to me and so much fun yeah as soon as someone finally comes
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:44.000]   up with an Android install for an iPhone I will do it not because I will think that this is going
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:49.760]   to be a useful thing but I just want to see the eye of Sauron just open right there in the brain
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:54.480]   and the windows windows mobile or pommel-west handy do that I'm like
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:54:01.280]   I just have to say having jailbroken a few phones in my day that it never makes the phone better
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:07.520]   in any respect but it is fun if you're a hobbyist though yeah it's interesting it's it's amazing
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:13.360]   that you can do it and the principle that I I paid a thousand dollars for this phone I own this phone
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:18.000]   if I want to ruin this phone by tinkering with the software I have the ability I should have the
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.560]   power to do that this company is not leasing it to me they can't tell me not to do something with
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:26.480]   something that I actually own truthfully I used to do it all the time on Android devices because
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:31.360]   that was just basically it's different on Android and on an Apple jailbreaking just means you can
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:36.000]   sideload apps which you could do on Android without jailbreaking on an Android it means you have
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.760]   root access which means you get the you know the sky's the limit you can put all kinds of
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:43.680]   firmware on you can flash it remember flashing roms yeah yeah I used to do that all the time because
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:47.920]   you yeah you could get different versions of Android you get you know cleaner you get in the
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:53.280]   elevator you'd flash a rom you get out with it yeah yeah yeah you literally could keep on your phone
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:57.760]   a number of different ROMs and if you felt like a different ROM that day you just go and it would
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:04.080]   reboot into a new ROM here is something you should be more worried about this is what looks like to
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:12.640]   all intents and purposes a normal lightning cable right wrong this is a cable created by OMG cable
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:19.520]   he demoed this for a motherboard vice at Defcon and now he's mass producing them or at least some
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:25.280]   semi-mass producing them what this cable does it plugs in it charges your phone just like usual
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:33.760]   it seems like it's a normal lightning cable except it has a Wi-Fi adapter in it and it allows a bad
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:40.960]   guy to access your phone and for people who ever people who don't see the picture we need to
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:44.960]   reiterate it looks there's no it's not like the the connector is a little bit thicker it's not as
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:50.560]   though there's a bulge anywhere you would not mistake this for anything other than a plain vanilla
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:56.560]   like one-to-one knockoff of the standard like Apple lightning cable yeah I think if you don't
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:00.720]   expect it closely you might even think it's an Apple cable if you if you didn't if it was just
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:05.440]   lying on the if it was just lying on the table at a conference saying hey but hey for as a courtesy
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.760]   to everybody else if you want to charge your phone just plug it right on in here it's still
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:15.040]   chance charges for data it's still transfers day charges the phone transfers the data it still works
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:20.640]   like an Apple cable except it has a wireless hotspot which allows a bad guy to run commands
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:29.600]   on the computer not the phone on the computer and go through the phone so here's the omg cable
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:35.760]   app running here an iPhone that allows you to paste a payload in so I guess it's not hacking a
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:41.200]   phone it's hacking the Mac or the yeah yeah but you see it's it's always cool when like a product
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:46.400]   like this or a thing like this good we just want we're just using it for security research purposes
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:51.920]   and of course the app has like a glowing green skull as the logo yeah it's just research that
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:57.040]   guy's dead for other reasons I intended this death rate to be used only for peaceful purposes
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:04.160]   and apparently he's figured out a way he was selling handmade cables at Defcon for 200 bucks each but
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:09.360]   he tweeted on Saturday after months of work I'm now holding the very first fully manufactured
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:15.280]   omg cable so I gather these will be for sale probably at the hack five store somewhere like that
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:21.200]   you can just for re oh we have a fact there it is they're already listing it on the hack five store
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:29.040]   great that's nice that's great see these are the things people really should worry about that's
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:35.600]   you know don't when you're plugging a USB cable or a USB thumb drive into something that's when
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:41.760]   that's when your troubles begin apple has worn to third party keyboards and iOS and ipad OS
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:47.360]   can send data to the internet without permission now don't we always get that warning anytime we
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:55.120]   install a third party keyboard yep so why is apple is this something new it's been that way
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:58:03.920]   since iOS 8 nothing has changed oh it's another bug that it hasn't resolved yet even if you don't
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:15.120]   authorize oh that's bad apple plans to fix the bug soon an upcoming software update um 13 - maybe
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:23.840]   anybody 13 3 um or 131313 because I would hope that that would get fixed a lot faster than just
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:32.160]   you know the next dot iteration I'd like it to be the dot dot iteration so I just feel so sorry for
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:37.600]   all the people who are so excited about iOS 13 they got the they got iOS 13 tattooed on their body
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:44.400]   somewhere and it was okay when they go nowhere 0 2 but now they got well again that's going all
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:49.680]   the way down my leg I'm glad you've operated your cameras because the flesh tones I thought
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:55.520]   it was missing out something now you can really see the if you authorized a keyboard like google's
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:59.920]   gboard or swift key or grammar lay our sponsor or anything like that you're all right it's the
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:04.800]   problem is if you've got some rogue third party keyboard see authorized keyboards
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:11.920]   uh are currently prevented from recording your password that's why it's kind of a weird experience
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:16.160]   with it's why I stopped using third party keyboards because the apple keyboard will take over when
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:20.960]   you're doing a password or whatever this is different because if you haven't authorized it apple doesn't
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:26.880]   know to do that so basically do not put third party keyboards on your phone if you haven't
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:32.160]   granted them access if you know if you just oh I'll download this and and and use it later delete
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:38.240]   it now yeah uh and of course you really do want to trust those keyboards as that warning tells you
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:44.160]   and swipe is built in now so you don't have to honestly I feel no need to go to a third party
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:49.200]   keyboard anymore apple made it ugly anyway and now with swipe I'm happy the swipe board
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:56.160]   they will what do you think you use swipe huh you use swipe oh yeah but i'm an android
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:01.760]   user member from way back so i love swipe to me it's a much more accurate way to type you got to
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:07.360]   get used to it yeah my wife doesn't it's surprisingly accurate actually I oh good I don't feel comfortable
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:13.360]   using it feels weird to me yeah you have to get used to it but I I was purposefully like kind of
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.600]   going off the rails a little bit and like I'm just gonna you know just really mesh my finger
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.400]   around here and see if it is still gonna figure out what I'm saying and it would no I was kind of
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:30.320]   surprising it really does it uses that sort of predictive type to get you a lot further down the
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:35.600]   path of the words than you realize so I still feel weird using it because it just feels different
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:42.800]   to me to swipe but I'm I'm very impressed with the accuracy of it I think it's a much faster way
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:47.840]   to to type and I think it does a very good job as you could see of recognizing it if you haven't
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:53.200]   used it the other thing I love is pressing and holding long pressing the space bar and now I have
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.320]   complete cursor control much better than having that magnifying glass that you had to move your
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.240]   finger out of the way so you could see where you were and all that stuff I think this is actually
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.560]   the best keyboard apples ever delivered I really find the three swipes for undo redo much
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:13.040]   clue gear on the iPhone and on the iPad though I do not like that I don't even do it on the iPad
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:18.640]   it's fine because it's so big my big pause I just like the cat typing in his gifts yes I think those
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:24.240]   gestures are not such a good idea but you know one thing that I still need to complain about is
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:30.800]   that I'm surprised that it gets hoodwinked by so many common elements of punctuation like
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:36.640]   if I type in ellipsis that is supposed or if I type in ellipsis instead of doing whatever the
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:40.720]   digging into the keyboard to get the actual character if I just type three periods in a word
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:45.520]   three periods in a row it just numbly says it oh well if there's a period there should be a space
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:50.240]   after that well no unless there's three of them in a row and it's an ellipsis or unless I'm using
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.200]   it as part of punctuation side of quote I mean I don't want the next word to start with a capital
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:00.080]   letter it's actually just a continuation of this of the of this regular sentence because
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.320]   the number of times where I have to go back and manually edit something that it automatically
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:08.640]   corrected for me that's that's the sort of thing that gets that does get me annoyed that again when
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:13.200]   it does like like with auto updates when it does something automatically for me to help me without
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:17.360]   giving me any choice in the matter when it screws up that's just super annoying I'm and I'm surprised
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:22.000]   it makes that mistake to begin with I just did it on my didn't but you're right there's a lot of
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.960]   times there I can't I I have to make notes on what happens but there there there a lot there are
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:31.680]   a lot of times where yeah you see there's a space after between the end of the ellipsis on the this
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:35.920]   no dot dot dots oh I did that I put that there okay I said you guys have quite about Pokemon how
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:40.160]   how horrible the autocorrect gets in your way yeah well that's another matter entirely
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:47.840]   um it doesn't speak that language you know it happened yeah I should there's there are times
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:51.280]   where it happens I should start making notes about it but maybe also that you don't have
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:56.800]   that you have the space after period turned on and there may be some things that when I do a
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.480]   double space for your personal dictionary which I still wish they would let you see an edit is
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:05.360]   has some weirdness in it yeah you know yeah they're like but I will say that one of the one of the
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:10.960]   things that that attracted me to android to begin with a few years ago was that the keyboards were
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:17.280]   so much better and then what the standard ios keyboard was and now they've addressed so I
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:21.600]   I agree that there's almost no need for replacement keyboards anymore because I think they've put
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:26.800]   so much extra protein in the stock keyboard that pretty much everything I would have asked for
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:35.280]   they've given me as a part of the stock uh I was watching uh monday night football last night
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:41.440]   and they had what was clearly a bit moji on the screen but they called it a me moji
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.080]   which is very much like the nfl calling their surface tablets ipads
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:56.880]   now I think apple should like that uh but apple is being sued because they listed me moji with a
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:05.200]   registered trademark symbol uh in its trademark list on its website and apple has success
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:12.240]   fully registered the me moji trademark in some countries outside the us but it apparently has not
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:20.400]   in the united states and the atlanta based company social technologies that owns the me moji
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:25.280]   trademark in the united states is sewing so you can't put that are there in the us
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:31.680]   let's go on the iphone trademark yeah I think it's gonna matter just a matter of a bag of gold and
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:35.760]   everything else and you remember what steve jobs did didn't respond saying well we're just
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:40.320]   gonna continue to use it because we we feel as though if this goes against us we can just
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:46.240]   write a check and make you go away mmm they're probably right so I didn't realize that apple
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:53.440]   did not own me moji trademark in the us and uh the nfl is breathing a sigh of relief right now
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:59.760]   although the bitmoji people are pissed snap snap bones bitmoji now snap right don't want to miss
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:08.880]   the snap no oh cryo real apple says it was one of the uh jennars right one of the jennars said that
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:13.200]   she was not using snap anymore yeah like a billion users they lost a billion users there's a billion
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:18.240]   dollars they're stock plummeted yeah because kendall jennars said i'm not using it or was it
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:25.280]   kylie i don't know one of them one of the case yes i'm gonna say yes one of the kardashian jennerv
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:31.040]   clan apple is planning according to the wall street journal to bring some of the movies it
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:37.680]   makes for tv plus two theaters first weeks before the release on streaming tv this is a picture in
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:44.240]   the journal of sofia couple of directing bill murray in a new movie that she's working on called
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:51.040]   all on the rocks this is will be one of apple's first theatrical releases uh by agreeing to give
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:58.960]   theaters an exclusive run of their movies uh well for one thing it gives you a you know a clear title
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:05.280]   to the academy awards yeah i expect they're doing this right absolutely if you're if you're
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:12.240]   gonna get big name directors they're not winning an oscar is not a small thing for the men to go and
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:16.960]   to and to basically give that up to make sure that you're you're streaming first that's not an
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:21.120]   attraction for them so they're gonna ask for that they're gonna get it i mean the irishman
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:27.600]   is uh from netflix from netflix by uh scur saysy that's definitely getting a theatrical release
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:32.000]   and that's all that's i'm sure that was part of the understanding from the very very beginning
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.960]   you know wait a minute you don't listen to this from the wall street journal in recent months
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:42.160]   talks between theater companies and netflix about showing awards contenders like the irishman
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:48.000]   in their cinemas have fallen apart after the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.560]   exclusivity so you're right i mean you can bet it's yeah that didn't last that long did it right
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:59.520]   they were sad that's easy the academy rules mean that all you have to do is make sure that it has a
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:05.360]   two-week run uh in theaters in new york and l_a_ that is advertised and then that that you're
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:09.920]   actually selling tickets to it so if a national chain doesn't take it all they got to do is go to
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:14.960]   an independent art house movie uh thing and saying give give us a qualifying run that's
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:20.400]   and you'll probably make some money off of it by being the only theater in in america for
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.320]   this these two weeks that are running the brand new martin scur saysy movie that everyone's saying
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:29.520]   is the is the there's a thing that will end all crime movies everywhere because he's closing the
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:34.880]   door and it sounds like a business plan uh it's a minor going to start us a
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:39.440]   model here well you got news having academy award contender that should how hard could that be
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:45.520]   right a friend of mine is a producer for uh for bill plumpton the uh the animator
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:52.720]   and so part part of his job is as when he when bill does new shorts or does new uh does new
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:56.800]   features is to make sure that in addition to the other places where they're running them with the
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:02.880]   movie it gets a qualifying run to make sure that it can be considered for for uh best short or best
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:07.520]   feature animation Oscar you can bet it's an easy thing you could bet scurs saysy and daneiro both
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:12.560]   made that a part of the deal uh i can't imagine oh yeah i mean because spielberg is being so salty
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:18.000]   about it they have no choice well so yeah exactly spielberg said that uh and this really i think
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.840]   came up because of uh a fonzo quarron's roma yeah which did it have a theatrical release
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:31.200]   it must have yeah the same kind of token two week thing his his his his come uh his
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:36.640]   the nature of his complaint is mostly is not so much that oh these these aren't really movies
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:43.920]   but the fact that if this is on netflix on in in october every single academy voter will have seen
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:49.840]   this movie and have had a have an opinion upon it whereas if if if if you have one of these other
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:56.640]   smaller sort of movies that will get three weeks in uh october or november uh maybe they will see
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:01.840]   it they will have seen it maybe it will have left theaters before they got that chance uh and maybe
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:07.440]   it is not available on streaming or not available as a academy screener at some time with these so
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:11.840]   that so they're so they're he's feeling as though it will that makes sense it's not about art it's
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:18.240]   about having an unfair advantage yeah no there nobody is as soon as the the arishman is released
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:23.520]   on netflix there is nobody who is subscribing to netflix it was not going to have seen it
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:29.120]   and i'm guessing everybody in hollywood has a netflix subscription i would have their parents
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:34.320]   in their hands they have their parents password yeah uh let's take a little break then we're
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:39.920]   going to talk about tariffs i know everybody's clamoring for more tariff talk on mac break weekly

[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:38.080]   cards bank numbers you can't really do much about that right you can't really stop that but express
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:46.880]   vpn can at least protect you and protect your own data when you're online express vpn it makes
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.000]   it so easy to use a virtual private network when you're out and about or even when you're at home
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:59.360]   because your isp's is buying on you too lots of isp's resell your data to advertisers and marketers
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:05.520]   of course there's the guy in the hoodie actually it's john the guy in the hoodie in the back of the
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:13.840]   studio there you look like a hacker john i'm going to use a vpn from now on on this thing we got a
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:19.680]   hacker in the back of the studio express vpn it's easy to use one click apps on your device
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:29.680]   turn it on boom you're protected iPhones android devices mac windows express vpn is lightning fast
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:36.720]   it's not free and to me that's a feature you do not want to trust a low cost or free vpn because
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:42.400]   it costs money to provide those servers all over the world and if you're not paying them somebody
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:48.720]   else is there in we know vpn providers insert ads into your stuff so you see ads that aren't
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:53.360]   actually on that web page that they sell your stuff like your isp does they sell your stuff to
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:13:00.640]   marketers they log everything you do not express vpn they've been they've been audited third party
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:05.680]   audit they take keep no information fact they use this trusted server technology that makes it
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:11.680]   impossible for them to keep any information about your visit they have servers all over the world
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:18.240]   so you can emerge into any country you want it encrypts everything strong encryption
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:23.520]   and it's fast they have so many servers that is the fastest vpn i've ever used
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:28.240]   and all this for just seven bucks a month i think that's a great deal if you're not paying for a vpn
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:34.560]   they're monetizing you express vpn number one vpn provider according to tech radar according to
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:41.040]   cnet according to the verge according to me go to express vpn.com/macbreak right now to arm
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:46.320]   yourself for the next two three months of express vpn for free when you get a one-year package that's
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:57.520]   the best deal and it shows some support some love for macbreak express vpn.com/macbreak do not go out
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:09.360]   unprotected express vpn.com/macbreak so we had the story this week that apple is going to make the
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:16.720]   new mac pro in austin texas president trump treated yay hundreds of jobs at the flex plant there
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:24.240]   however according to bloomberg despite all that the u.s trade representative has denied apples
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:30.480]   request for tariff exemption on components made in china they there's gonna be a 25
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:41.040]   percent tariff starting in november right or is it december december december i think i think five
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:46.240]   exclusion requests were denied because apple quote failed to show the imposition of additional duties
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:51.040]   on the particular product would cause severe economic harm to you or other u.s interests
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:58.320]   what about me the guy buying it this this right on the heels of the president's tweet great
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:03.840]   news apple announced it's building its new mac pro in texas hundreds of jobs in austin and for
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.400]   suppliers across the country i guess he doesn't want apple to get anything from china right get it
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:15.520]   all from the u.s can they could they also the also these aren't new jobs are they they were i think
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:38.240]   they're existing job that's like sp
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:43.120]   i did you know you're already paying how much for this mac pro i probably they're probably right it
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:48.240]   will not impact i mean i don't know what the price will be and apple probably will absorb the tariff
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:54.400]   i would imagine yeah that's what most analysts are saying that i think the last time i looked at
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:16:00.800]   it they were saying that the terrors will add about 10 to 15 percent to the to the unit cost of an
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:07.840]   iphone and that analysts have no inside information but they believe that apple is going to be if
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:11.520]   they if they actually have to do that they're gonna have to they're gonna be eating the cost for the
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:17.280]   foreseeable future because then this is kind of consistent with a lot of political experts are
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:22.320]   talking to me about the ones who are dealing with manufacturers and dealing with industry that
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:26.560]   they know that there's an election year next year and that if they do anything drastic such as to
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:30.960]   move their entire supply chains all of their problems might be going away if there's someone
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:36.480]   else in that office even if it's another republican in that office this time next year so that's why
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:41.600]   a lot of people are like let's sit up this next year if we have to plan for the next four years after
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:46.560]   that we'll do that then but right now let's just tunker down for the foreseeable future the way it's
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:54.880]   going it could change next month so yeah apple asked for a relief on 15 it got relief on 10
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:04.080]   um apple said there are no other sources for this proprietary apple design component made in china
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:11.600]   yeah um but no tariff waiver or relief for mac pro parts that are made in china
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:19.920]   that was another tweet yeah this is where apples brilliance is kind of as biting them in the butt
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:24.160]   because one of the reasons that that allowed the renaissance to happen was Tim Cook before he was
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:29.360]   CEO of apple understanding that if we can if we can get things on the on those ships really really
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:36.000]   fast and not have to keep lots of stock on hand if we can essentially build menu build and support
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:42.560]   manufacturing power inside china that we're we can get as much capacity as we want then that's
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:48.400]   gives us such a huge edge on everybody else that it's just going to be like a tsunami however they
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:54.960]   he did not foresee with the previous previous republican and democratic presidents that something
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:59.520]   as bad as the trade war that's happening right now could possibly happen so that's why other
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:05.840]   manufacturers who who were also of course heavily invested uh or heavily reliant on china but they
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:11.120]   were also having manufacturing in uh in Taiwan they're having manufacturing a south career they're
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:16.560]   having manufacturing uh in india they have they spread out their bets a little bit partly ironically
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:21.600]   partly because apple was buying up all the manufacturing capability for a lot of the assembling that
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:27.600]   they actually needed to happen so this is this could be really bad to be fair it would be nice if apple
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:37.920]   made every bit of the mac pro in the u.s is it just impossible i just i don't not not right now i
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:43.360]   think that another another analysis analyst i read uh was saying that it would take them about
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:49.840]   two years to move critical manufacturing outside of china to basically not be affected uh by any sort
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:56.080]   of a trade war between the u.s and china uh i've failed to understand exactly his logic behind it but
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:02.480]   he has a pretty good track record and so that's uh i i put that in my brain with an asterisk but it's
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:09.440]   the best data that i have so yeah what do we think about uh new product announcements in uh not 2019
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:15.120]   are we gonna see uh do we know any thoughts as we get close we're now in october next month
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:22.880]   in case you didn't know november then comes december level usually does have a mac event uh you might
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:28.080]   call it or maybe an ipad event depending on how you see it but this model does usually have a
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:35.200]   october event and it's so you know it's coming and i think there's a lot of rumors going around
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:40.960]   that we're going to see a new macbook pro 16 inch and a new ipad pro that has the three cameras you
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:47.360]   mentioned that earlier um i i think these started looking like pretty solid uh rumors right where
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:53.520]   does that rumor come from it looks like some guy named rene richy he even started that right is he
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:58.080]   pretty good is he pretty good on these things what she is he is what do you think rene it doesn't
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:03.760]   always no i didn't i didn't start that rumor i forget we we saw a bunch of dummy units come out
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:08.320]   which like they did before the iphones that had the full camera system but i really like the idea of
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:13.760]   it so i just i commented on it and i know some people are really hoping for OLED on the ipad but
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:18.080]   yields are still low prices are still high and uniform brightness it's still not good
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:22.400]   so i think that's why we're seeing people like gwoming cheese saying that it'll be ill skip OLED
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:28.400]   and go straight to mini led next year mini led which is a new kind of display technology that uh
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:34.720]   which is not micro led it's completely different but it's still good what oh okay i i thought it
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:41.760]   was like micro led it's not huh no it's what apple is using for the pro the um xdr pro display xdr
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:54.400]   yeah all right leds smaller than 0.2 millimeters yes little teensy weensy leds all right so um
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:21:00.080]   godly i'd love it if a new 16 inch macbook were to come out before i leave for the middle east on
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:05.760]   october 21st probably but they're eventually usually the end of october it towards the end of
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:11.600]   october i'm gonna i'm gonna put out my my prediction yeah let's see i do you're good you're good you're
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:17.840]   100% so far i was pretty good that's i think the the new macbook line that we that we may or may not see
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:24.000]   i think we're gonna see it on let me get my exact date on here i think we're gonna see it on
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:30.960]   she's reading the t-november first november first that's that's my guess the day after halloween
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:38.000]   yeah all right all saints day all so nobody bet on that please i don't holy day i'm wrong i don't
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.920]   want to be to blame for that is the is it an event like that you're trying to get
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:48.400]   uh get in the market get into the supply chain before the holiday buying season is that really
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:53.520]   what's going on or it's a pro device like a super pro device and it's probably gonna be expensive
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:58.720]   the first year so i think it's it's it's like the mac pro it's like Alex Lindsey's gonna buy
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:03.040]   ten of them yeah just waiting for you to announce it do you think that we're waiting until we can
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:08.400]   say uh yeah we're gonna be able to ship the mac pro by the end of the year i were waiting to
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:13.200]   find out how much the wheels cost according to the group yeah they still haven't said how much the
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:19.120]   wheels are cost well they said how many do you want which i think was a good answer yeah i want all
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:25.440]   four please i want one corner to scrape along the floor of my office can you make that happen
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:31.040]   i want to be like a real production studio with three wheels thanks all right so so it is possible
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:34.640]   because i mean last time we talked rene you were kind of thinking there wasn't going to be an event
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:40.880]   no i i'm i think you're still thinking there wouldn't be an event right well i mean it's a lot
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:46.080]   of work for them it's a lot of work for us but i want the stuff i think i want something going
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:51.920]   now i want that i pad pro i want the 16 inch macbook i want both of those yeah yes
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:56.320]   and i know like a lot of people again are saying well the ipad pro last year was so great what can
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:01.120]   apple do to get us upgrade this year but that's not how anybody but tech pundits thinks apple
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:05.200]   doesn't want you to upgrade year over year i mean they know certain people are going to do it but
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:09.440]   they already have those people at new what they want to do is if you never bought one or you haven't
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:13.280]   bought one in a few years when you're ready to buy one they want to make sure they have a good one for
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:17.680]   you to buy so you don't you know go somewhere else and they they accomplish that usually with
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:21.440]   a big redesign and then a few years of incremental and then a big redesign and a few years of
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:29.680]   incremental hmm have you played arcade on your apple tv yet i just played it yesterday it was
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:35.040]   pretty fun what are you playing laurie i started i started playing lego brawls just because i wanted

[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:56.320]   set up my uh steel series uh yeah that's what i got yep yep just went for it and i was like yeah
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:02.400]   this is this is pretty fun this is goofy and you just run around and um you're you know fighting
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:07.760]   teams and and you uh your team has to try to beat their team capture the flag style i think it's a
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:15.440]   little it's a little over watchy it sounds like a little yeah yeah yeah yeah uh so i got the uh
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:21.040]   series five loving it love always on love always on i can work out and look at my heart rate i just uh
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:26.560]   which one leo which one did you get i got the uh titanium dlc with the link band i know you're a
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:32.560]   band guy i love the link band i spared no expense for a watch i'll be trading in in a year
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:39.360]   or or handing down yeah i've been actually handing him down that's what i do uh what i've been doing
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:45.280]   yeah it's nice i don't think the titanium is in any appreciable way different than the aluminum
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:50.640]   i actually got the titanium in black and i returned it to get it in brush metal because i
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.480]   wanted something that would look more distinct i like the new materials i always try to get the new
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:25:02.240]   material yeah but the dlc titanium looked like the looks it's like the aluminum yeah yeah i hope i get
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:08.720]   so you know you know out of this no you know that's all it matters i know you're stealthy
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:13.520]   you're like it's like who's weighing you wouldn't know this isn't some cheap apple watch
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:18.560]   actually the band is kind of a giveaway that's ridiculously expensive what are the best apple
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:24.400]   watch bands you have the ultimate guide of course you do you are the ultimate apple band connoisseur
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:31.120]   actually karen if you let karen write this one she's an amazing shopper let me just take a moment
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:39.200]   and and give karen a shout out because she is a shopper she knows what's good she knows what's good
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:47.840]   for all different types of people a lot of these are not apple made yeah yeah we put the more expensive
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:52.880]   ones down at the bottom you know so we're just trying to the people that just want a nice pretty
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:57.200]   inexpensive one they get them we put those up at the top for them but if you scroll down toward the
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:02.640]   bottom you see some of our more favorite ones that we think are sort of fancier and nicer
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:09.280]   personally the nomad i'm actually oh no i'm i'm wearing it whoops i almost did it again
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:15.280]   i'm using i'm wearing the patent quill oh i like the patent quill right now i have the nomad leather
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:20.960]   which i really like i i also have that one but i'm wearing that that no mad pad sorry the patent
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:24.640]   quill one right now they're a little more rustic with the stitching they have big stitching and stuff
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:33.280]   i like that yeah yeah oh look at the march plus that's nice that's a nice band they have some really
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:40.800]   creative ones yeah oh and the catalyst by the way that i there's the catalyst for the newest um
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:46.800]   no that's actually that's going to work i'm trying to get my sizing right the um apple
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:51.040]   watch series four and apple watch series five it'll fit both of those i love having that because
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:59.040]   i take it with me when i go camping so it's it completely covers the um the watch and the watch
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:04.160]   face and everything is waterproof and even though you can take your your apple watch in the water
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:08.720]   it's way i feel way better about taking my apple watch in the water when i use the catalyst case
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:14.560]   because it's very secure um and it's it's tightly sealed over it has that nice thin membrane so you
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:20.480]   have good touch access to the to the screen one of my favorite um watch bands is the catalyst
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:24.240]   but i don't use it every day because it's a little bulky so i only use it for like camping
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:29.760]   and if i go somewhere where i know i'm going to be in the water a lot this is a very good article
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:34.880]   i'm going to send this to the person to whom i handed down my apple watch
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:43.600]   well i will make sure that Karen knows um that you appreciate the hard work that she put in
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:48.560]   this is a lot of she's going to buy a lot of bands and try them all oh there's the catalyst
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:51.760]   they're $70 that's nice and that includes a band
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:58.480]   yeah it is it's it's a full watch band that um oh yeah it's it's actually great so you take that
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:04.720]   in the water that's great yeah i take it take it camping with me so even all the dust and dirt
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:09.920]   that we kick up and all the campfire ash and everything i don't have to worry about uh
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:16.320]   any muck getting on my my apple watch at all even though you're pretty safe without it but i just
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:22.720]   like to do that anyway it just makes me feel better what do we think about battery life on the new
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:28.960]   watch what do you guys what do you what do you see and what are you getting well so Russell Holly
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:34.880]   with um wrote this amazing article for i'm more where he took a series four and a series five with
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:43.920]   him um they were the uh non cellular ones uh GPS only apple watches he took them out on a 50
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:50.240]   mile bike ride and he tested them both with the exact same apps the exact same things running the
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:57.440]   exact same activities tracking him and he came back home after a 50 mile bike ride and the battery
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:04.240]   percentage was worth exactly 62% for both of them and one of them was always on the watch the series
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:10.640]   five was always on so it is very accurate apples very accurate when they say that the battery life
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:17.680]   is not diminished um because of the always on battery but or sorry the always on display but
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:24.160]   i do have to throw in a little caveat there that apparently there are some people who have the
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:30.320]   cellular model the apple watch cellular plus GPS series five that's what i have.
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:35.120]   They're experiencing battery drain really so maybe i i don't know are you experiencing not
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:41.120]   everyone is though i i don't nobody's ever really been able to kind of pinpoint what was causing
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:45.840]   it what has been causing it but it doesn't appear to be the always on display that's causing the
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:50.320]   problem as much as the cellular that's gonna be the yeah that's probably people who are in
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:57.600]   marginal connections which has always been problematic for phones uh you know i i put just as an experiment
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:06.000]   uh the uh sound pressure meter that's always updating on the um on the watch just to see
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:12.400]   how that reacted and i love this by the way this is so nice you could see how loud the noise is
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:18.320]   you should take this to your next rock concert oh i i do actually make sure i have it always on me
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:22.960]   yeah and i get notifications every time i'm at a show that it it lets me know hey it's a little
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:27.600]   bit loud in here but the complication is great because you can actually look at it and see what's
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:31.120]   going on right now and i thought well that's got a drain it didn't not at all
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:36.160]   i'm easily getting home with 50 percent at the end of the day no problem i think it's pretty
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:43.200]   impressive yeah i had the only time that i had a i had really bad battery life early on and that's
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:49.600]   only and as soon as i turned off the ekg monitoring it got it went back down to like a good like day
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:55.920]   and a half at least the way that i use it so good i had disconnections at first like it would
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:59.120]   disconnect from the phone and then the battery go crazy trying to reconnect and then i just
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:04.160]   repaired it and it was fine yeah this has been really stable uh haven't had any problems with it and i
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:10.320]   do love the always on man that is so nice yeah that makes this in every way now the perfect watch
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:16.080]   except for well maybe not kind of still size is a little funny but yeah well there's uh i also
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:21.040]   like the attention to detail i i noticed the other night that if you're wearing if you're wearing long
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:26.080]   sleeves if you if the sleeve is covering the display that will that will disable temporarily
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:30.880]   the always on display until you like roll up your sleeves until until it's like uncovered
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:36.400]   so it doesn't bother keeping the display on all the time unless the the display is actually
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:42.160]   outside exposed to light and visible which i thought that that somebody that somebody was thinking
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:47.600]   that was a that was a good idea if someone got like the twenty dollar outback steakhouse gift certificate
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:52.880]   at apple for thinking of that i fix it did it tear down they said essentially very similar not
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:59.280]   not in layout but very similar in parts to the series four which makes sense apple stopped selling
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:05.120]   the series four uh and said just either get the cheap series three or get the series five
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:10.640]   um bigger battery though that's definitely uh that's definitely okay so some people are
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:16.720]   recommending even even there to say that if you can find uh like a uh a discontinued series four
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:21.520]   or maybe at a good price yeah that you're that the recommendation was that you're not going to
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:25.520]   notice that much of a difference that if you can get a hundred bucks off you much rather than
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:29.680]   have a hundred dollars to spend on like three or four cool watch bands i'd pay a hundred bucks
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:33.440]   extra for always on i think that's worth it me too it's the thing i've been waiting for the longest
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:39.840]   yeah yeah i've realized since since i've been hanging out with people who have the always on
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:45.040]   i'm glancing down at the wrist all the time checking out their watch face so it's kind of a
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:50.880]   new idea that you better make sure that you're uh that you've got your good watch face i'll be looking
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:55.600]   at it what do you use lory what's your watch face um right now i've actually got the um
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:01.120]   i can't remember what it's called it's the info the informational one yeah but i i love the solar
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:06.080]   one actually i i you i switch back and forth between those two because i love the the look of the
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:11.440]   solar one that's the one of the new ones for um watch o s six but uh i need that informational
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:15.920]   one to kind of remind me of everything that i'm doing all day and it's got lots of little
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:21.840]   complications on it to you know so i'm just quite like quickly in there the i use Infograph modular
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:30.480]   infograph the the analog face has the most complications it has eight yeah yeah nine sorry nine it's
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:35.520]   very busy i can't even see what time it is i use the infograph digital for my daily dashboard like
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:39.520]   whenever i'm working it's just on it tells me everything like having a heads up display on my
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:44.560]   wrist yeah what do you have the middle so i'm using a fantastic cal is my middle because that's my
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:51.200]   calendar same yeah i love that yeah you're gonna have noise and i have uh activity rings then noise
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:57.600]   then weather and uh yeah yeah i've got weather i actually i've just changed because i we were
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:04.080]   demonstrating uh air quality so i changed this from whatever i had i forgot now uh probably i've
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:09.040]   been looking at i've been looking for for a quote-of-the-day complication or something rec just that loaded up
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:15.520]   with with good phrases uh i tried to do that as a reminder and then it started like this really
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:21.120]   positive like affirmative sort of phrase now it starts to go excuse me you're you're overdue on
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:25.520]   make sure you stay in the moment and be grateful for everything oh shut up oh they should make a
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:33.440]   party about your view of you so good yeah yeah god i can't i can't see i i think the karen apps are
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:39.600]   really funny it's just that there are some days where i just don't need that in my life even i don't i
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:46.400]   know this app doesn't know me personally i know it's i just i just don't need it well it's raining but
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:52.000]   that's okay loser like you probably wasn't gonna be going on Saturday night anyway like thank you thank
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:35:02.880]   you very much couple couple of uh quick updates um pixel mator photo 1.1 is out with ipados 13 support
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:07.360]   i i'll tell you i'm glad i bought it it was only five dollars when i got it when they first came
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:12.800]   out and that thing is a great photo editor i'm gonna keep that one around congratulations to apple they
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:22.320]   won the un climate action award because they are 100 renewable which is pretty good remember when
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:28.160]   they bought built the the apple uh campus the new apple campus they had the solar panels in the
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:36.320]   entire garage apple says it now runs on 100 renewable energy uh invested 300 million dollars to power
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:43.520]   its supply chain with clean energy um and they have also donated an undisclosed sum to preserve
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:49.280]   grasslands in Kenya so apple getting a un climate action award for environmental work
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:36:02.480]   huh let's see syri and spotify making up at least in the next beta of iOS you'll be able to ask syri
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:10.160]   to play stuff on spotify if you're not on the beta though it's not there yet praise of the lord
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:17.120]   is is that a big deal for you i mean it's it's just that they were so whiny like they they wrote they
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:22.080]   wrote they made their complaint as if apple was specifically targeting right them to be mean when
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:26.720]   it was just no api existed in the minute the api comes out they're doing it apple scalp on
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:34.240]   them with it and the world is fine well they've buried the hatchet or or something yeah anyway it's
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:39.520]   it's uh i'm just happy for people who want to use that functionality will have it yeah yeah i
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:45.520]   am not a spotify user anymore apple music is won me over but uh i think i would use syri more often
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:51.680]   if it would access more like more of my absence as a default i wouldn't have to specify the
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:55.600]   apify just could like set a default for it to do it so one of the things i would really
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:37:00.320]   short cuts helps with i love about androids you can decide what browser what email
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:05.120]   what messenger you want to use and just say this is the default just stop trying to load those
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:10.000]   other ones i just but that that that's a great point that lori made i think that people are people
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:16.160]   are not going to switch from spotify to slo-mo because excuse me spotify to apple music because
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:22.640]   schlo-mo doesn't support spotify but the fact that spotify now is now supported by schlo-mo means
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:27.200]   that more spotify users are going to use slo-mo right so it's good for apple it's good for
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:33.840]   spotify yeah all right let's take a little break and then we'll get your picks prepare
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:41.520]   the picks and a reminder of course that we do ios today before the show every week this week uh mica
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:48.160]   and i talked about sensors in our lives uh not just the apple watch but sensors for sleep and
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:56.080]   and diet and all sorts of tracking we also reviewed mario kart tour it's out now a lot of fun although
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:02.560]   i'm waiting to shoot a drop with a subscription i know they're gonna i know they're gonna charge
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:08.640]   me any minute now and the same price is arcade right yeah five bucks a month yeah
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:15.200]   and in fact i showed i compared it with the sonic racing which you get with arcade i have to think
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:19.360]   unless you really want to do mario kart and i know a lot of people do it's really a fun game
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:24.240]   um but you play the free levels to make sure it's the mario kart you think it is because i don't see
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:32.400]   any multiplayer screen or anything like that but uh if you can live without having you know mario
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:37.600]   and and the rest the sonic is a pretty good racing game too and it comes with a hundred other games
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:46.080]   for the same price uh let's take a break more uh coming up in just a second in fact our picks of
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:55.520]   the weep but first a word from gazelle it's that time of year the new iPhones are here maybe the
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:01.200]   new iPads are coming time to clear out the old get with the new and the best way i just want to hear

[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:15.120]   i gazelle it i i basically sell it to gazelle before i think this is a great idea it's a trusted online
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:20.560]   marketplace for selling your old devices and well if you think about it it makes perfect sense
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:27.440]   to buy them because gazelle has lots of cherry gear pre- or pre-owned but also fully certified
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:33.600]   and you can save money depending on the condition so you can choose devices in good or excellent

[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:42.320]   untitled goose game and after the first yep after the after the first hour i'm like okay i have to
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:48.880]   stop right now i have to book out like a day thursday where i can just spend all day playing
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:52.960]   this game so i'm having way too much fun with this and the things i need to do all the rage
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:43:02.240]   it's it is it is a work of art it really is it's a it's a beautiful paradigm for creating a game
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:08.640]   where there are things that you have to do and yet the level of conflict uh that is definitely
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:14.000]   there between your really annoying goose that you are and the and the people that you're interacting
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:20.080]   with in this sleepy english village it's it's it's definitely conflict but it's things like i found
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:25.600]   myself like spending ten minutes just like you're you're in the garden just realize that oh if i
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:30.960]   if i pick at this at this uh cistern i'll turn on the water and then the garden will have to go in and
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:35.520]   turn it off and we'll just sort of like be staring at me and i'll honk at him and flap my wings
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:39.440]   and he'll just like get all grumpy and then walk away and then of course i'm just gonna turn that
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:47.360]   cistern cistern on all over again because i honk at him and flap my and and it's it's i can't really
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:53.040]   describe how satisfying and pleasant this game is one of the reasons why i don't detect it i don't
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:58.800]   really get into gaming that much is that when i'm playing a if i'm in a situation where i want to
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:07.760]   pull out a game to play it's because i oh his audio made it all the way through almost to the end of
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:16.640]   the show he got goose he got goose there it is it's back it's back that's too bad because what i
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:24.480]   was saying was so brilliant well i forgot what i was so i'll just i'll just i'll just simply summarize
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:31.040]   that it's a it's a very beautiful piece of art i love uh i just love the environment i love honking
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:37.840]   at humans and annoying them in the ways that gukki's annoy people and being a sort of a kind of conflict
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:42.160]   without being like hey i'm gonna make this guy fall off a ladder and hurt himself no it's not
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:47.280]   gonna be that you're just gonna like make his make his a noise his water cistern overflow and then
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:52.320]   you're gonna honk and annoy him and there and the things you have to do so it's it's a very real it's
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:57.760]   a challenging fun beautiful and relaxing game it's not the sort of like fast twitch that a game
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:03.840]   that gets me so amped up and so nervous and jittery that can't go back to work afterward because i'm
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:11.040]   just i'm not relaxed now i'm absolutely not i'm for loco uh say of mind after doing that so
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:14.960]   i can't recommend it highly enough it's it's i think it's i don't know if it's still on sale
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:19.200]   but even at the full price of i think 20 bucks my goodness what a beautiful piece of art
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:24.560]   still only 15 bucks goose dot game it's an epic game so that means unfortunately you have to
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:30.480]   install the epic launcher but it at least it does run on a mac and pc yeah you get to look forward to
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:34.960]   like little pop ups it's yeah yeah exactly and switch i bet it's great on this because that means
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:42.160]   gonna be in fun yeah i you know i true i downloaded i bought it i downloaded i played it
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:46.640]   and there's a little puzzle i thought i know people are going crazy over this game it's cute
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:50.880]   i don't think it's like better than any of the arcade games i've got
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:57.840]   oh but it's so funny you just get to go around and annoy people you know it's interesting it really
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:04.000]   does remind me though of apple arcade it's that flat style of animation i think that's the new thing
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:10.800]   really well in apple arcade yeah yeah uh goose dot game mac pc nintendo switch hog
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:15.040]   hog i'm installing it right now i'll make some hogs
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:23.520]   laurie gill your pick of the week it was going to be entitled goose game actually i love that game
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:30.000]   so much but i just discovered this morning and and bought this myself because i was so excited about
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:37.840]   it um apple it has put a bunch of um halloween or horror movies on seryl for halloween and i
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:44.480]   bought the um i bought the eight film friday the thirteenth collection i think i own one through four
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:50.560]   so it was like for twenty dollars i'll take the other four yeah there was it's such a great
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:55.840]   twenty bucks for all of them for all eight of the friday the thirteenth movies yes it's so
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:01.680]   real so if you like halloween movies or sorry if you like horror movies or if you kind of want
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:06.320]   to get into them for halloween there's a bunch of them that are only ninety nine cents on rental
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:10.960]   and i think that apple is going to carry this through the entire month of october so if even
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:16.000]   if you're not ready now to to get into the halloween spirit i'm pretty sure this sale is going to last
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.840]   all month long so you can just kind of check back and see if there's anything you want to rent or
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:28.080]   something it's it's really cool nice i gotta go in there i wouldn't mind owning all of those
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:31.840]   at twenty bucks i wouldn't want to spend a hundred bucks on it but twenty bucks and there's and
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:37.600]   there's others that are um like a big there a lot of them are like just two or three movies but
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:43.120]   there's a couple that are like a really big there's like the paranormal activity six movie collection
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:49.280]   um the friday thirteenth one i said there's four movie collections so if you just kind of run a
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:53.920]   room around in there and kind of see what all they have even if you're not into the friday the
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:59.040]   thirteenth you might find one of the other um collections one of the bundles to be worth
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:06.640]   worth picking up you bet rene richie pick of the week so i was sure lory was gonna use this one
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:11.360]   so i just waited to make sure she wasn't before i picked it and when i started tweeting the photos
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:16.640]   of night mode on the iphone 11 and what it could do there were a bunch of people like uh apple
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:21.120]   sucks they didn't make it on the older um on the older phones and apple will tell you that they need
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:25.120]   the hundred percent photo pixels and they need the processing in the eight thirteen but there's an
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:32.400]   app called neural cam which does not the same way apple's doing it but does really good work
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:37.200]   on older iphone so if you have like a ten hour or a ten you know going back for a while
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:43.520]   it will do the same sort of long exposure and neural network technology machine learning
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:50.240]   technology to give you a really good version of night mode on devices that apple simply doesn't
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:56.000]   support so if you don't have an iphone 11 you don't have to be super salty about it you can just go
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.640]   to the app store and get neural cam and it does like you do have to hold still and you have to do
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:05.760]   all the things that you think you have to do when you want to take longer exposure but it really
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:12.240]   punches above its weight uh for those for those sorts of harder to get uh images and it'll it'll
[01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:19.040]   give you really good results uh no matter which older iphone you have very nice very nice i don't
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:24.960]   want anybody to be left out Leo yeah all right some great pics all across the board
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:30.480]   and i already bought goose games so then that's spinning actually honk
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:41.200]   thank you everybody just gonna start annoying honk honk honk it's spacebar to honk right honk honk
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:48.000]   are you playing on the switch yeah yeah it's probably the a key it's the it's the why why not
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:53.760]   laurie gill you find her at i'more.com she is uh gonna be busy in a month i guess apple
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:50:00.640]   announces quarterly results october 30th i will not be here thank goodness i'll probably announce
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:06.800]   a new hope be wishing i wish you oh that's why you think november first for the event is that why
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:15.120]   sinking the day after yeah get those quarterly results out of the way clear the decks makes sense
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:21.040]   well laurie will be covering it of course as she always does at i'more.com and of course sick
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:27.520]   burn is her band and you'll find it somewhere in the Sacramento area most of the time every once
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:34.400]   in a while what's the website for sick burn um i think we just have a face facebook page so i can
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:40.960]   search for slash burn on facebook yeah not the russian version the american version
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:48.640]   and he knocked out when you're gonna be on the wgbh this week in boston yep uh blossom public radio
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:57.360]   uh 1130 a.m you can either listen live on the radio or listen to the stream live at wgbhnews.org
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:04.160]   and uh you can also listen to that stream later and we are as we are most fridays at the blossom

[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:57.120]   to tell you what you get for your money and what you give up and whether it's a good deal or not i
