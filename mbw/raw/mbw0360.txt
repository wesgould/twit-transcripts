[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   With Mr. Haggis here, he's been eating Haggis all weekend. Mr. Alex Lindsey Beck from Scotland.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   So good.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I don't know how you could say anything with sheep and the word sheep intestines in it is good.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Haggis is so yummy.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   What is it roasted? Is it a stew?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   They made it in everything. So I had one where I had one where I had a chicken breast stuffed with Haggis.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Which was very, very good. And then I had straight Haggis.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   It's like a spand.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   It's not much Haggis in there.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Haggis, Haggis, Haggis, eggs and Haggis.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I think I'm really happy that I've been thinking that you should really create a house of Haggis.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Haggis, Haggis, Haggis.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Haggis, Haggis, Haggis.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   All right, good. You could show us, did you have Zuvide Haggis?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   No, I didn't have Zuvide.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Oh, oh.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I bet you that would actually be good.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   House of Zuvide Haggis.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Yes.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   You shouldn't laugh, Renee Ritchie. You've got Poutine.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I was going to ask Alex if he had Haggis Poutine.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Renee Ritchie is here for mymore.com.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Also, Andy Enaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Enaco, what is the unusual Boston tree?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It lapsed out.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Bugs.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.400]   I'm not, see, I've got me really concerned because I don't know of a single like Boston
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.480]   area delicacy that's really, really horrible, which means that the probable solution is
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.000]   that there are horrible things, which is that I grew up in Boston.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Oh, Moxie. There you go. Moxie.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Moxie soda is horrible.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   It is the most.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.920]   And the weirdest thing is you go into this like 1920s licorice flavored soda and you go
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.000]   into every single store, like the stop and shops that have like 80 million square feet
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   will always have exactly two two liter bottles and one 12 pack of Moxie.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   That has never been, they freshen them once a year.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Who is the guy who's getting that like one foot of shelf space for Moxie soda?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   It is the most horrible thing I've ever tasted.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Wasn't there a Stephen King in the, and one of his novels, was it didn't Moxie?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I think it was in the 112363 Moxie features.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.520]   I think that no, I think that in the stand, there was one of like the worst demons from
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.800]   the lowest levels of the pits and he came up and Stephen King said he smelled almost exactly
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.000]   like Moxie and not quite so pungent.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   The smell, the taste and the air dissipated after only an hour raspous.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I'm stuck with that on the roof of your mouth.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Stephen King went to Lisbon Falls High School and famous for its Moxie Days, a celebration
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   of the soft drink Moxie and the Canabec Fruit Company which appears in 112363 is locally
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   known as the Moxie store.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   So there you go.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   There's the Moxie connection.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Hey, look, oh, else is here.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   His last time in the studio before a while anyway, Mike Elgin of Google plus and Elgin
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   back on the computer world.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   He's going to be heading out.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   This is the man without a home.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   The man without a country.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   That is correct.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Well, the whole world is my home.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   A better way to think of it.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Nowadays.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Absolutely.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   So you're going to go to Florence.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Florence Italy for six weeks.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Oh, God.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   What a life.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Well, you know, August and Florence though.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Nobody can tell us it's going to be a hundred degrees and, you know, that's Celsius.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I mean, it's supposed to be really hot this summer.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   A lot of mosquitoes, stuff like that.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   But you know, somebody's got to do it.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Hey, I'm very proud to be included in the classics section.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Apple has celebrated surprising because Apple's always had kind of a love hate relationship
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   with the podcast.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Stephen Jobs even said they're, what are you, he made fun of them a little bit.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Amateur radio.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   But they are celebrating one billion subscriptions.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   That means one billion people have pressed that button.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Subscribe.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Wow.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   That's a lot.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Although, you know, I would guess most of the people in our audience have pressed that
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   button hundreds of times, you know, unsubscribe, subscribe, you know, well, whatever.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   But they do list some of the top podcasts and I have, I'm happy to say one of ours, the
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Twitch show is in there as the classics along with this American light, happy, three friends,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   real time with Bill Maher, Smodcast, Kevin Smith's podcast, NPR and on and on 60 minutes.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   We aren't featured anywhere else.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I think that's fair that you probably, each producer gets one, right?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   That's fair.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And once you discover the one, you'll discover the rest.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   That's a good thing.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   That's a good thing.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   That's a good thing.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   You know, almost as old as and certainly as popular as this week.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   You're like the Eagles greatest hits and only in podcast form.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Now I know.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   I know you've got the perennial album that always always gone.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   God Henley feels whenever Hotel California makes it to the top of the, you know, the one,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   best 100 songs of all time list.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.380]   But all my children are my favorites.
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.000]   I was doing some looking through behind the scenes photos and I had a couple behind the
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   scenes of like the first time we shot video of Twitter.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Wow.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   You know back in the, it was at the apples cottage.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   No, well at the, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   At that bar in Nevada.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Oh gosh.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Loylens.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   And none of the cameras matched and it was.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Oh, I do remember that.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And I, and I, I was sweaty from running capels.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Classic.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   You're right though.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   It's good for podcasts in general to get this kind of attention.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And I'm thrilled that we're included in that list.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I'm hopeful that Apple is now sort of changing its tune about podcasts.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   It's always kind of like you say, had a love, hate relationship and hopefully that was,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   you know, something, maybe that was something that Steve Jobs had a personal thing against.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Cause you know, they spend money on it and they don't make any money on it.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Right.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   There's a lot of infrastructure.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   They actually have editorial staffs.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   They have their pay, whoever.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Somebody does this.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Whoever did this is a paid, you know, they have a group of people who do this.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   So it's, it's really nice.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And I personally believe that podcasting is the most under appreciated resource in the world.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.500]   I mean, I personally get so much out of it, you know, and everybody's complains about
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.800]   being too busy, but then, you know, when you're going to go hiking or, or do the dishes, do
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.280]   housework, whatever, you can always be educating yourself.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:42.400]   I think if Steve Jobs were alive today, he would look at things like Ted Talks and some
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.000]   of the other prestigious shows and say, you know, 60 minutes and say, okay, this American
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   life.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.080]   This is not just somebody in the basement.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.080]   It's the same reaction.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.520]   People had the blogs in the early day.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.520]   They all blogged.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.920]   They were in their garage making a computer.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.920]   One thing I think Apple though, I think it's I don't think you give Apple credit.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.000]   I think you give credit to podcasting for surviving.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   For eight years.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Right.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I guess it is.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.120]   And I think that I think when we look back 30, 40 years, I think that unless Apple makes
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.360]   a major change, I think people are going to look at that they were sitting on top of a
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.480]   gold mine and they just completely missed the boat on content.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.840]   You know, because they are, if you look at where, where YouTube, where Netflix, Amazon,
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.920]   all these folks are investing in content.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.000]   You know, they're not just, you know, and they're, and they're, and they're, and they're
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.360]   getting any nominations for two.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.360]   It shows.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.360]   Yes.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.360]   First time ever.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.840]   And, and just did a Netflix just to hang out for their earnings call yesterday.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.400]   So they have a good one?
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.880]   And, but the, they got 600 new thousand new subscribers just from a recent development
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.880]   alone.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.880]   Right.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.840]   And the thing is, is that, is that Apple beyond all of these companies has the ability.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.640]   I mean, they could spend, they could spend $50 million on a movie every week only releasing
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.080]   into iTunes and they would, and it would, even if they didn't make any money on it,
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.080]   which they would.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.080]   Why does it Apple do that?
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.240]   It would barely show up on the, it would barely show up on the radar.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.000]   And it's not that Apple has to learn how to do content.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.120]   Apple just has to learn how to hire producers that make content.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.480]   I mean, you know, it's, you know, they could become, you know, they could be doing that
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.480]   content.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.480]   Oh, anybody could do it.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.480]   Sure.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.480]   And they could be releasing the content.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.360]   What about YouTube being in the content business?
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.920]   And I'd have the same complaint about Apple because you don't, it's what, it's what Jeff
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.520]   Jarvis calls channel conflict.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.520]   Mm-hmm.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.120]   It was what the movie industry got sued for in the early days when they owned both the
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.200]   theaters and the means of production.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.840]   They, they, they were split up.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.440]   Basically because it was too much control.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.640]   Well, just an example, they, they, they promoted to it on the, but I doubt that they would
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:42.240]   promote Matt Break Weekly because this is a show that's honest and about Apple and they
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.240]   don't like that.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.640]   And I mean, I don't, I, that's the channel conflict.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:51.440]   It's a big problem with YouTube because YouTube, presumably a video on YouTube gets
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.760]   better search results than YouTube on Vimeo, let's say, because it's owned by Google.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.400]   Google would say no, but I, I find that hard to believe.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.680]   But I think that up, you know, as a producer of content, you know, I, I look at it as, you
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.760]   know, it's pushing more money into that pipe, you know, and it's creating new opportunities,
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.880]   you know, for producers to, oh, it's great.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.880]   And if you sell it content, it's great.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.640]   Well, and specifically content that if you don't have, if you can't get into TV, but
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.480]   you want to make some money working on it, the problem right now is that everyone's still
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.600]   trying to figure out how to generate revenue with it.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.600]   I mean, Twitter's figured that out, but mostly here's my, here's my issue and that you,
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.000]   you, you hit the nail on the head.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.640]   It's hard to turn that money down, but you're doing a deal with a devil.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:36.360]   It was the issue I had with iTunes and podcasts in the early days too.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:42.200]   It gives one company a lot of control and suddenly there's this issue in the case of
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:47.200]   Google and YouTube of are they unfairly promoting their stuff in the case of Apple.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.880]   Really the only, it's, it's the 90% of our downloads are still through iTunes.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.960]   So they have a, they have a tight grip on what we do.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.520]   And if for some reason they decided to block Twit, we'd be screwed.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.520]   So I don't lie.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.440]   I never, I, you know, I've always said from the day that Apple started carrying podcasts,
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.360]   which was 2009 was later, it was much later.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.120]   I said it's the best thing that ever happened to podcasting and the worst thing.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:19.400]   But I think that one of the things that's important is that the, we, you know, as podcasters,
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.520]   we want to make, no, it's to our advantage to have TV be decentralized.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.960]   And so having new, new people coming up, I think, I agree.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.920]   Isn't it become the new incumbent and suddenly control at all?
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.400]   I don't think the whole point of podcasting me is to democratize the media.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.400]   It is.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.400]   And to give everyone a voice.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.760]   And I, and I think that, but I think that Apple like pulling more people away from TV
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.280]   and into iTunes means that we have more people that are looking at this as a, as a valid,
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.600]   a valid solution.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.040]   And so when, when there's original content on Netflix, you know, when there's original
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:55.760]   content on Amazon, on, you know, on, on YouTube, Brian and W says, this is what you get when
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.760]   you build your business in our chat room on free services.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.560]   I always thought Twit's been rather disingenuous about this.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.560]   Not at all.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.560]   It's not something we chose.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:08.800]   In fact, we make you, you can subscribe to our stuff in about a hundred different ways.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.840]   And every way possible, we constantly encourage you to do so.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.000]   But the fact that the matter still is that most people choose iTunes and that disturbs
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.400]   me if I could make that less of a, well, choose a good easy.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.000]   Well, and, and that's the advantage.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.480]   The best of the things and the worst of things.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.760]   The advantage is you want to be easy.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.760]   You want to make it easy.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.160]   It's even worse than you say because Apple users in general are the kind of people who
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.880]   buy things in higher numbers.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.640]   So you, there's an advertiser supported company.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.360]   And I don't know if I know, if I know that that's true.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.400]   Well, I do say people who subscribe own Apple's and therefore subscribe and propose.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.920]   Well, I mean, look at the story with the, with the more tell.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.520]   We don't make more money on this show than we do on non-Apple shows.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.520]   Let's put it that way.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.520]   No, no, no, that's not what I'm saying.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.840]   But what I'm saying is that the people, I mean, I think that, you know, the vast majority
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:59.040]   of people who use iTunes, for example, are Windows users because the vast majority of
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:06.120]   Windows users are, you know, they're using iPhones and stuff like that.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:11.360]   But what I'm saying is that in general, the anything related to Apple, anything that attracts
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.520]   the Apple customer base is going to skew towards spending more money.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:20.560]   If you look at that, the hotel, which automatically, you know, upgrades, rearranges the results
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.560]   for searching for hotel rooms to the more expensive rooms because they know you're using a Mac.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.440]   That's an example of somebody responding to the fact that Mac people and Apple customers
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.080]   in general tend to spend more than non-Apple customers.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.920]   So you know, yeah, they, the majority of your people come through iTunes, but it's also
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.680]   the average user is probably a bigger spender as well.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.680]   Except for apps.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.200]   Not dollar for a game.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.200]   Too expensive.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.200]   Premium.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.080]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.920]   That's certainly been the case, but I think that's changing.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.960]   I do think that's changing.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.880]   I'm not sure.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.640]   There was a survey we quoted on Twitter, and I don't know how accurate it was, of 6,000
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.800]   developers who said that they were starting to make more and more from Android.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.400]   It was only a small difference.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:13.560]   It's certainly been the case up to now that Apple, well, it might be because Apple costs
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.560]   more than anything else.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.040]   So it's, you know, it's self-selecting.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.240]   If you buy an Apple, you're willing to pay more.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.480]   And arguably for better quality products.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:27.480]   It's the hardware thing.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.400]   Even if you have an expensive Apple device, you're still not willing to pay a lot of money
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.240]   for the content that goes on it.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.240]   Because it broke now as you bought an Apple device.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.240]   But I think a lot of people are spending a lot of money on apps.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.040]   They're just not spending a lot of money on each app.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.040]   So I think that's the-
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.520]   To get back to your point though, Alex, content is rapidly becoming disassociated from its
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.000]   means of distribution.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   That's great.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.440]   And as long as you don't have a monopoly in any one hand, I'm fine with Apple making
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.920]   content, Netflix making content.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.920]   Well, I think we're past.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.360]   I mean, I think that we were in danger of that at some point.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.480]   But I think that there is so much money that is going into online media right now.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.480]   When you look between-
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:04.120]   And the big players are Netflix, Amazon, Google, and Apple.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.120]   Those are the four.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.120]   And those are the-
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.120]   Because Apple's not creating content.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.120]   And I think-
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.120]   And you have that iTunes festival once this summer and that's it.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.960]   And Apple's going to get passed by the other three because they're not-
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.720]   And they are in the poll position.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.440]   They make all the software that we use to make the content.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.280]   They have the distribution to-
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.280]   It is insane.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.840]   The only reason I can think of it, the reason they don't get into it is specifically to
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.840]   avoid antitrust because Apple could create-
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.840]   It's DOJ would be interesting.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.280]   And I don't think that that's possible now because I think if they had done it in ten
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.920]   years ago, Apple could have built a vertical production pipe that would have made Krupp's
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.760]   arms look like a walk on the part.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.840]   You know, and so because they would have had anything from I would go like that now,
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.840]   I don't think it's possible.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.080]   Now I don't think it's an issue.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.280]   I think it's as simple as they don't feel as though they're in the business of producing
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.280]   television.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.720]   They're not in the business of producing film.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.800]   The idea of putting together a technology company versus putting together a creative
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.680]   arts company, they have overlap, but there's such different mindsets.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.680]   Just buy Disney.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:03.280]   I mean, engineers are people who are used to getting tangible results and being able
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.480]   to be having their feet held to the fire saying, "Well, this does not work and therefore
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.200]   this is not a finished product."
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.560]   But creative people, they're used to be able to have coke fits for three weeks on end,
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.720]   not go into rehearsals, not hand in, draft.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.720]   But they don't have to know any of that.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:22.720]   And they just hire people to do it.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.720]   I'm just thinking is that you just hire producers and say, "I want to make a show."
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.520]   I doubt Netflix didn't have any expertise.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.680]   They hired the right team who then hired the right team who then put together an incredible
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.680]   series.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.960]   But what we're learning now, Netflix is soul business is content.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.960]   They don't sell hardware.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.960]   They don't sell software.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.000]   I know, but their entire business is putting things into that.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.280]   But it was distribution, not production.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:50.440]   Yeah, the thing is that Apple doesn't lose $2 billion a year on this stuff.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.320]   And it would still be worth doing because it can help them build the model.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.320]   So here's the problem.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.880]   Well, it's not like iTunes is doing badly.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:02.680]   No, but the thing is, they're constantly begging content providers to, "Can you do
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.680]   this?
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.440]   Can you make this available?"
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:10.920]   And between iBooks, between what you could do with iTunes as far as Apple could be using
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:17.360]   these as proof of concepts to show how you integrate an iBook that's sold with the movie
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:24.320]   that's sold with the whole model to show the advertisers or show other content companies
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:29.320]   what would happen and use their content specifically as a case study that you put out.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:34.720]   And I think part of it is also the leverage is the way to do this and the Google way to
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.280]   do this is to go ahead and make mistakes and go down that path.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:48.320]   But the idea is that if Apple started pressing down on that direction, it also gives them
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.680]   leverage because what I would be saying in the back channels is, "Here's the deal.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.120]   We've started making content.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.960]   You either come to the plate and make deals with us or we're going to run you into the
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.520]   ground because we can spend this.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.520]   We can spend $10 billion a year on this content."
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.880]   How much money was spent on a loan ranger and how much money did it make?
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.600]   It's not about $3 billion at the price.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.360]   But that's a good example.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:17.600]   At what point does Apple gain leverage saying, "Hey, look, we put $18 million on a sales account."
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.480]   Let me ask the question this way.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.840]   Until recently, maybe until now, Apple's entire position was, "We do all this other stuff
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.560]   so we can sell hardware."
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.000]   That we are a hardware company.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.160]   We do an operating system.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.000]   We do iTunes.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.680]   We do everything we do to sell hardware.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.600]   Is it time for Apple to rethink that?
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.040]   Is that strategy working?
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.360]   I think it's still selling content.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.120]   I think it's creating content so hardly.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.280]   They say, until recently, I think they're making money now, but they said for a long
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.120]   time iTunes is just break even.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.080]   They said, "We don't do it to make money.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.640]   We do it to sell hardware."
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.640]   I think there's a good chance of that.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.840]   If you were to ask me five years ago, if Apple would be investing massively in building
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.800]   these maps, for example, and I don't want to change the subject to maps, but the amount
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.840]   they've been investing in acquiring companies to compete with Google in maps, I would say
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.840]   you're nuts.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.840]   They're not going to do that.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.840]   They sell hardware.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.200]   The maps sell hardware we know now.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:22.280]   The question is, does controlling Hollywood sell hardware?
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.280]   I don't think it does.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.280]   How far do you have to go?
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.280]   I don't think about controlling Hollywood.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.280]   I think it's scaring Hollywood.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.280]   Exactly.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:34.200]   Andy mentioned the cost of the Lone Ranger.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.840]   That's lunch money for Apple.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.440]   Apple could literally buy Hollywood.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.480]   They're so much bigger than Hollywood.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:46.680]   Are they really used to saying, "Here is a project that we put $250 million into.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.960]   We put it on sale and it made back about $18 million.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.320]   We are so totally going to look at that product over again.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.320]   That's not the philosophy of Apple.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.320]   I don't think it's only a case.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.240]   I do 100% agree with you on the idea of Apple.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.720]   Apple really has to move the company more heavily towards content.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.800]   Not away from hardware, but they have to make that more important because the problem
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.160]   is that they're making great phones.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.160]   They're great.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.160]   They're new.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.160]   They're novel.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.160]   They're hip.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.960]   Rather, this style of phone is wonderful, but then all they have to do is be behind
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.440]   the ball once and now this phone is no good anymore.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.720]   We're asked if you're selling the Eagles greatest hits, once that's finished and once
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.200]   that's a saleable product, you can sell that forever.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.200]   Here's another problem.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.040]   I think the reason Netflix is doing what they're doing is specifically doing
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.200]   to improve their position with the industry.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.720]   They're not trying to turn that into their only business.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.440]   What they're trying to do is make sure the industry gets that they will either supply
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.120]   them with content or they will create the content.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:45.960]   The thing is, I don't think that the industry in a industry that is becoming more and more
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:50.560]   difficult to navigate, having more players with big money rolling into it, is not something
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.840]   that most Hollywood folks want to see.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.800]   It's also a problem in its own right and it's a problem that Apple has to overcome.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.520]   You talked about other successes like the iPhone and stuff like that.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:03.280]   What Apple does is that they want to improve the content consumption experience.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.280]   The mother of all content consumption experiences is television.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.440]   And Apple is not going to sit on the sidelines.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.880]   They're going to do whatever it takes to be in the driver's seat in terms of the future
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.120]   development of television.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:19.720]   And if that requires, maybe it doesn't, but if it does require the funding, and remember,
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:24.280]   what Amazon has demonstrated is that a movie studio is simply an investor.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.280]   That's it.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:29.760]   That's what Kickstarter, I mean, even Spike Lee is going to Kickstarter to do two crowd
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.760]   fund movies.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:36.760]   Well, here's maybe the answer from Seatower who's listening to us in Sweden today.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.680]   An article from February of this year.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.280]   Tim Cook talks up Apple's software and services.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.280]   He says, "We are not a hardware company.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.040]   This is Tim Cook.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:52.520]   There are other things we're doing and could do to have revenue and have profit flow.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.040]   The sale of an Apple device to a customer isn't the end of the relationship, the beginning,
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:00.720]   and there are all kinds of elements including retail designed to capitalize on that fact.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.600]   So even Tim Cook, I think, is looking at a new Apple.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.600]   Microsoft has done this.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.000]   Microsoft was a software company that is now making hardware.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.960]   And it's a tough time right now, especially for manufacturers.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.480]   And I think you've got to find new lines of revenue.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.520]   Somebody said, "Oh, Wall Street would never allow Apple."
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.200]   Because remember, they're publicly held, would never allow Apple to get the content business.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.640]   On the other hand, a Wall Street might start to punish them for not doing so.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.520]   Apple has over 100 billion reasons not to worry about Wall Street things.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.520]   I think the statement that Apple is not a hardware company is literally the dumbest thing
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.520]   I've ever heard.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.520]   That's Tim Cook.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.920]   They're obviously a hardware company.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.880]   They may be also a hardware company.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.200]   But they're a hardware company.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.120]   They've said over and over again that they're not a hardware company.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.080]   Historically, they've always said that those who want to make the best software make their
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.440]   own hardware, it's probably better to think of Apple as a product company.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.440]   Yes.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.440]   As opposed to a services company.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.440]   Hardware is a bank.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.440]   Hardware is more of a philosophical software.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.440]   Yeah, for that.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.960]   Yeah, but it's important though to where the company is going.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.160]   And I think it's important to say we're not a services company because they suck at services.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.760]   People don't go into the Apple store and oo-gle all the stuff in the Apple store and go,
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.840]   "Wow, this is amazing software."
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.840]   Right.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.840]   You know, they sell hardware.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.840]   It's tightly integrated.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.840]   That's what people buy.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.040]   Certainly, that's why I became an Apple user.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:16.840]   It was OS 10 or in early days, System 7 on great hardware, quality hardware.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.200]   But this is generic hardware at this point.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.040]   This is a PC.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.480]   So what is to distinguish it?
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.240]   It's the software.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.240]   It's amazingly better than any other hardware.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.600]   I mean, I just spent $3,000 for this laptop.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   It is this class.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.240]   It's better spending $400 for Windows laptop.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.080]   There are companies making equipment now.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.080]   Thanks to all of your feedback.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.920]   And Alex runs to one OS 10 on a hackintosh if they would let them.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.120]   I mean, some people just want the OS 10 experience too.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.640]   Okay, we're going to take a break.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.640]   It's a great conversation.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.360]   It really does speak to the soul of Apple and where they're going.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.840]   Congratulations on 1 billion podcast subscriptions.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.880]   I think that's a very encouraging thing.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:57.120]   And maybe it'll help Apple remember that podcasts are maybe not a revenue source, but they're
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.520]   a part of this ecosystem of content that they--
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.880]   Congrats to Leo for being there.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.120]   And I'm thrilled that we have at least one show in there.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.440]   I think they did pick per provider.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.200]   And if you're going to pick--
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.200]   Yeah, that's pretty clear.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.600]   --you're right there between Happy Tree, Friends, and Bill Maher.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.000]   So we're really categorized.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.440]   We're in the classics, which means we're old.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:22.480]   Actually, I was thinking podcasting started in September 2004 was the first time Adam
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:27.320]   Curry created the little-- whenever Python script that he did.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.760]   So that was the first time it was coined as podcasts.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.880]   I mean, RSS feeds and they're proto-podcasters.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.360]   A lot of people are doing it for longer.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.720]   But if we say September 2004, we're about to hit our ninth and two months, our ninth
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.720]   anniversary.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.920]   And my first podcast was October 2004.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.720]   So yeah, it's been a long time.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.720]   Pretty classic.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   Next year, we'll have a party.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.720]   Leo, you should--
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.000]   We'd be in Toronto and we'd be up on the region.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   That's right.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   We'd have some hardware laying around.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Remember that?
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   We'll just pull out about a move to--
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   The mode to.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   The mode to.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And you're at a laptop.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   That's great.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Oh, those were the days.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:06.520]   But I-- just on a personal note, it's been very, very good to me.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:14.840]   If we didn't have a method, a means of distributing on the internet, Twit wouldn't exist because
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.760]   we needed-- I knew there was an audience for Tech TV, but Tech TV had relied on a very,
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.680]   very expensive medium, able television.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.160]   Thank goodness for the internet.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.680]   I don't know if we have-- I don't like to characterize this as a podcast.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.680]   Is this a podcast?
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.480]   If you're watching live, it's not a podcast.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.480]   What is it?
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.120]   But at the internet and podcasting have been very important to our business.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.800]   So I'm thrilled to see this acknowledgment from Apple.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.000]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.840]   Our show today brought to you by another important part of the ecosystem, our fine advertisers.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:49.160]   In fact, one of the companies that's been with us since we started selling advertising
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.680]   is Citrix.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.720]   And they're-- one of their top products-- I think it might be their number one product
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.720]   is Go to Meeting.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.560]   And certainly, when we use almost every day here, you got to have meetings.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.240]   And during the summer, when people are traveling and out and about, when they're having haggis
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:07.880]   and Scotland, or they're enjoying risotto and ferens, you still have to have meetings.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.040]   You still have to get together.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.520]   Talk face to face.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.760]   And that's where Go to Meeting is so amazing.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.160]   With HD faces, you see their faces.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.240]   You're seeing their screens, sharing screens back and forth.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.240]   And it's portable.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.240]   It's mobile.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:26.280]   Go to Meeting works not only on Macs and PCs, but on iPhones, on iPads, Android devices,
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:31.240]   you can actually present-- now you could present from an iPad, which is pretty cool.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.480]   This is what I actually use when I'm overseas all the time.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.280]   You can buy my own Go to Meeting account.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.480]   And I just simply say, hey, I'll just set you up a meeting.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.800]   If I talk to a couple people, and I'm just constantly doing it because I can hook to
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:40.800]   my Wi-Fi.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   And the other thing is how easy it is to start a meeting, which really makes-- it really
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.800]   does.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.600]   You can send them out and email the invitations people.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.280]   Just click the link and it goes.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.880]   If they don't have the software, it stalls in seconds.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.200]   I just really-- it's a great product.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.800]   All you got to do is try it.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.800]   Go to Meeting.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:55.800]   Click the orange.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.800]   Try it free button.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.200]   Yes, the apps are free on iPad, iPhone, Android.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.360]   And go to Meeting itself is free for 30 days.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.960]   If you visit GoToMeeting.com, click the Try it free button.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.200]   Please do use our offer code MAC break so they know where you heard it.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:14.720]   Go to Meeting.com, try it free, promo code MAC break, 30 days free of a must-have.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:18.800]   It's just a good thing to have in your hip pocket.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.800]   And try it.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.960]   Use it.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.760]   The first thing is to not only install it, but then to remember, oh, yeah, I could do
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.760]   that.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.760]   I could do it.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.760]   And once you start doing that--
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.760]   Oh, because it's so convenient.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.760]   It is so easy.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.760]   My company.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:36.360]   Hey, I got new software for the MacBook Air, supposedly to fix the Wi-Fi issue.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:42.120]   Also I didn't know about this, but Photoshop was flickering.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.360]   So there are three fixes in this update.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:49.800]   And then an issue which could cause audio volume to fluctuate during video playback.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.840]   I don't think I'd noticed anything but maybe the Wi-Fi issue and not sitting here where
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.440]   we have pretty strong Wi-Fi, but sitting in my office, sometimes it would drop the Wi-Fi.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.680]   I haven't used it enough to know.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.400]   I definitely had a lot of problems with Photoshop and Omni-Graphel for whatever reason.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.400]   We're both--
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.200]   Sounds like a video driver.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.600]   It was on my retinas.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.840]   You'd see them suddenly breaking up.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.640]   One thing they didn't fix, and I wish they would-- I think it was a non-tech who discovered
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:23.760]   that the SMB stack on OS 10 in general is really slow.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:29.720]   So you can't get full throughput on device to device transfers on 802.11ac.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.800]   You're getting really kind of pathetic throughput.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:39.600]   So they haven't apparently got a patch for that, but I hope they're working on that.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:47.200]   Other stories, I watch-- boy, the drumbeat, it was like the Apple TV.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.520]   Are we still talking about the idea that it might do a TV?
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.520]   You just did, Mike.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.520]   Yep.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:55.400]   I've got the same thing with the iPad, same thing with the iPhone before they came out.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.880]   Well, they don't ship anything, so we've got to talk about what they might ship.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.280]   I watch-- what is Tim Cook wearing?
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.920]   Well, that's a Nike fuel band.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.920]   I feel like he's a fuel band.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.000]   Is it Director of Nike?
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.320]   What is Bob Mansfield wearing?
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.000]   He's wearing a Nike fuel band.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.560]   What is Kevin Lynch wearing?
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.560]   I don't know.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.560]   A microphone.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.560]   A microphone.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.560]   Yeah, I don't see--
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.360]   I think he had one of those little clip-ons somewhere.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.840]   Oh, he has something on him?
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.840]   I'm looking.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.840]   Well, there's just something that people running the project that I'm going to make.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.840]   Oh, OK.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:29.480]   He's not wearing-- well, he's wearing a suit and tie.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:36.200]   So the question is-- now the latest is Apple is talking to sensor and fitness experts.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.200]   Well, that would make sense.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.200]   Yep.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.680]   It's going to be-- I think it's going to be a primarily fitness-focused thing.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:48.360]   And I think the big challenge for Apple is we tend to look at smartwatches based on the
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.320]   ones that have shipped, like the Sony Smartwatch.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.080]   They're coming out with their second one pretty soon.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.640]   And these are completely unacceptable for the general market.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.640]   They're big, clunky.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.320]   It's like a television set on your wrist.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:05.320]   They're completely unacceptable for most women who have smaller wrists, typically and
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:10.680]   typically are used to the idea of having sort of mini-watch, the female version for--
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.320]   If they wear watches, that's the real problem.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.160]   So Apple's challenge is to come out with something that's good enough for business.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:23.000]   It's elegant enough for people with good taste and it's small enough for everyone to wear.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.040]   And I don't think it's possible to do a Sony Smartwatch style thing, but with Apple and
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.200]   meet all those constraints yet.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.200]   So I think they're going to go after fitness and sensors.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.880]   They're going to have-- to me, by far, the most compelling piece of information that's
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:44.200]   emerged is the idea that the fingerprint recognition people within Apple, authentic
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.160]   people, are involved in the project.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:51.520]   And I had written this extensive call to Mac column recently about how I thought the iPhone
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:59.040]   would become the identity thing, not just to secure the phone, but to be your signature
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.960]   in the world in general.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.920]   And man, if they could do that in a wristwatch, that'd be even better.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.680]   And I don't think it's an either or thing.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.840]   I think they could pursue it to be both.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.080]   But I mean, that could be the killer app for a wristwatch.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.080]   That's your ID.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.080]   It unlocks doors.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:19.440]   It eliminates passwords, enables you to buy things without even pulling on--
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.040]   I'm dreaming of global entry.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:27.560]   So this 9 to 5 article-- 9 to 5 Mac article by Mark Gurman focuses on, as you mentioned,
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:32.720]   people added to the team coming from a financial time story, analyst reports, and so forth.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:38.440]   Kevin Lynch, who they acquired as former CTO of Adobe, along with Bob Mansfield and
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:43.400]   Senior Hardware Director James Foster, leading the team according to this article.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:48.680]   Johnny Ive involved with design, Craig Federini with Federighi with software.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:55.120]   Supposedly, they're talking to sensor chip and battery power efficiency experts.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:00.760]   The group includes a series of longtime Apple employees that created the first--
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:01.760]   let's see.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.200]   Oh, I guess it's just like kind of a hit squad.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.520]   Battery power experts.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:10.640]   They've relocated engineers from Mac projects to focus on power efficiency.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:16.000]   As you said, they say the authentic team that people who Apple acquired with fingerprint
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.720]   readers are also involved with IWatch developing fingerprint solutions.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.720]   I did you think--
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:30.920]   I think the one of the most interesting indicators here is just if you look at any mall, any
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.320]   bus, anything, you see so many people who are wearing Fitbits now.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.880]   I think that's really the direction that Apple would want to go there.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.880]   It's become a status item.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.880]   Not unless you're up to fitness.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.880]   Not unless you're fitness.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.880]   I don't know.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.880]   You're just in shape.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.880]   See, that's the thing.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.360]   I wear this in lieu of being in shape.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.360]   Exactly.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.360]   It makes me feel like I'm--
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:52.200]   I mean, people very correctly make fun of people walking around with Google Glass because
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.960]   it's such a big, really weird thing to walk around with.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.720]   You're wearing an electronic device on your wrist and it's still--
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.480]   It's going to be hard to get some people to say, "I'm going to wear this piece of jewelry,"
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.000]   but people are wearing it now.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.280]   I think that Apple tends to go after products that are-- give them opportunities as opposed
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.400]   to breaking absolutely new ground.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.440]   And now that they have all this indication that people are willing to spend X dollars
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.480]   for this device and they're willing to wear it every single day, it really has made me
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:20.720]   think that rather than a watch with a digital multi-touch face or anything really, really
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:25.080]   awesome like that, it will be something similarly awesome that only does a couple of things,
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.840]   like check your sleep patterns, check your activity patterns, incidentally tell you what
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:34.000]   time it is, and at least have some sort of a Bluetooth, very low power transponder on
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.880]   it so it can do cool things like when you're holding your iPad, holding your iPhone, will
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:43.440]   automatically authenticate purchases you make on the iTunes Store, maybe even put in
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.560]   passbook functionality so that you don't even necessarily have to hold up your phone
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:53.000]   at Starbucks because you've paired this with the Starbucks app on your-- you've basically
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   left a digital key on this from your Starbucks app on your phone and simply tapping it against
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.280]   a transponder at Starbucks says that, "Okay, this guy's authorized to use this so why even
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.080]   make him take his phone off the pocket?"
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:10.320]   One of the things I think everyone should keep in mind is that people talk about Google
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.680]   Glass, which I'm getting my Google Glass tomorrow by the way.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:13.680]   Congratulations.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.680]   Thank you very much.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:20.280]   Speaking of big dorky things, I will be going to get Google Glass.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:26.280]   So the wristwatch and the Google Glass is not as much of an either or proposition as people
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.600]   tend to frame it as.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.360]   Wearable computing involves the services that happen offline.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:36.960]   The idea of always having an intimate relationship with your device is something that's going
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.440]   to affect everything, including phones.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.600]   It's going to blow back to the phone.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.000]   Some of the phones that have been announced or rumored that are coming up over the next
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.600]   year are essentially going to be wearable devices in the form of a phone.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.280]   They're going to have the same kind of notification situation.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.480]   They're going to involve much better battery management.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:59.080]   They're going to be much better at giving you this augmented reality view of the actual
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:03.480]   world and your actual context than phones have been in the past.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:09.800]   So it's really the whole wearable thing and phones are all moving forward in the same
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.800]   direction.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.240]   That's the direction of awesome services like Siri and Google Now and all the things
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.200]   those services touch.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.760]   It gets me excited as the medical side of this for some reason.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.840]   I guess that's why I wear a fit, but this is my sleep pattern for the past week.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.440]   I can see the average hours.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.320]   I've slept the average number of times I awoke.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.880]   It's like you sleep like a baby, you wake up every two hours screaming.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.880]   It's great.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.880]   It's pretty much nice.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.880]   It doesn't.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:40.000]   If it has sound sensor, but listen to who Apple, according to this story, the company's
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.400]   Apple has rated for employees AccuVane, which specializes in portable device sensors that
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:55.400]   map out veins in the body, C8 medicine sores, which makes non-invasive blood monitoring
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:02.600]   sensors and sensionics.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.400]   I tell you, I would buy that watch if it did one thing.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.040]   If it gave me blood pressure readings.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.600]   I don't know if it could.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.400]   One of the more interesting things about this story too is that you look historically
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:16.320]   Apple's biggest problem in guy English what this years ago was retention.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.720]   People in the original iPhone team have gone, people original iPad team have gone.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.360]   Mark Zuckerberg's big pitch to Apple engineers has come with us.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.360]   We're the new future.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:28.800]   Then you look at the iWatch project and reportedly it got Bob Mansfield to come back out of retirement.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:32.240]   It got original iPhone engineers to return to Apple.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.240]   It's the new start.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.240]   It's the thing to be excited again.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.040]   It's the thing that's going to, the next thing that's going to dent the universe and
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.560]   to put all that talent behind this kind of project and to focus it in this direction,
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.120]   I think for Apple as a company is also hugely important.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:49.920]   The Oceanics makes a thing you swallow that ties via Bluetooth to your phone, although
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:55.120]   it could also go to wristwatch to give you glucose, real-time glucose measurements.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:59.480]   That's for a diabetic would be huge, no more pinpricks.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:03.720]   It can display the rate and change of glucose change, graphical trends and alerts for impending
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.000]   hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.760]   As the aging population around the world.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.600]   As aging population myself, I'm thrilled.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.640]   That's the whole thing is having all that in a fashion.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:19.760]   I also think that Apple is very aware of the fact that a lot of its iPod business, the
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.600]   way people interact with people go running, they go to the gym or whatever.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:28.320]   A huge percentage of these people have an iPod or some kind of Apple device.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.200]   The Apple store, you can buy the thing that lash the whole iPhone to your arm and stuff
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.200]   like that.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:37.720]   People really want to use Apple devices for fitness.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.200]   That's beyond the medical stuff.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.520]   It's fitness, just running and exercise and just daily fitness.
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.320]   If they can add a bunch of sensors and be ahead of the curve on that, that would be
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.320]   awesome.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:51.080]   Then as they go forward and Moore's law makes everything cheaper, they can add what I think
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.920]   is going to be the killer app for the iWatch, which is Siri.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:57.480]   I want to talk to it and I wanted to talk back to me.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   That's going to be incredible.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.480]   I'm not sure how that's better than a phone in your pocket because it could do the same
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.480]   thing.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:07.320]   I'm not sure that's a killer app for a watch.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:12.760]   Using my glass for the past month, I think the coolest feature of it is this little thing
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.880]   right here, which people usually think is some sort of an activation button, but it's
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.560]   actually bone conductance.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.200]   It doesn't actually have a speaker.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.440]   It just basically tickles the back ear.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:25.240]   It works really well too, it's surprising.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.160]   It works well in noisy environments as a pickup and everything like that.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:34.760]   It got me looking at different kinds of Bluetooth headsets because you're absolutely right.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:40.600]   A lot of the stuff that Glass can do could be done via Siri with an extra level of sophistication.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.360]   What you really want is not something that forces you to stop at the three corner and
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:49.200]   start doing this to look and interact and say, "Hi, Siri, could you please do this?"
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.160]   What you really want to be doing is to keep on walking.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.320]   You don't want to have your eyes taken up anything.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.320]   You don't want to have your ears taken up anything.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:59.800]   If they were to make a Bluetooth headset that simply did not block the ear canal, not
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:03.600]   only that, but because it doesn't block the ear canal, as you're walking down the street,
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.200]   people don't know you're even wearing this thing, but you can still communicate with
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.680]   the phone in your pocket and still get information back from it.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:14.320]   That would, to me, be one of the most interesting Apple products of the past decade.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.120]   They're going to hire Andy to be on the team.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.840]   So, the money can be used.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:22.240]   I specifically in the city, specifically wear headphones, specifically to block everything
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.240]   else out.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.600]   Well, the other thing, including oncoming trucks and everyone else.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.600]   Be careful crossing the street, dude.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.760]   And I imagine also though, if you're not a history of accessibility and if you're blind
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.160]   and you're wearing an eye watch and there's eye beacons in the building or in the park
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:41.080]   or on the hiking trail, that's the commercial you see at WWDC in Christmas time for a product
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.080]   like this.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.120]   Just in general though, for wearable computing, Leo, you asked the question, is it that much
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.120]   better than a phone in your pocket?
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:49.160]   The rumor is about Moto X always listening.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.560]   You could talk to it presumably in your pocket and it would respond to you.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.560]   Yeah, but the point isn't that it's necessary.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.960]   None of this stuff, none of this stuff is necessary.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.240]   These are like the firstest of first world problems that we're trying to solve here for
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.240]   the most part.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.760]   I think it's looking at a whole new way of computing.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.760]   Absolutely.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:10.080]   I had the same argument for people before the iPad shipped and it was like, what do you
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.080]   need that for?
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.280]   You have a laptop, you have a phone, you don't need an iPad, it's dumb.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.880]   But when you use it, then you, oh, I get it.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.000]   A lot of this is how it feels to exist in the world.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.440]   It's a news user interface.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.440]   It's user interface, but it transforms your psychology.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.440]   That's really the benefit.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:28.760]   It's not that you need it or that it's that much better than a phone in a practical sense.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.000]   It changes the whole psychology.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.320]   We have seen now always on information flows are valuable.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.680]   I mean, look at Twitter, you've got Twitter scrolling by all the time on your computer.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.600]   That is an information service that is ineffective ticker.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:47.040]   I think I would love information about my body, about news, about what's going on in
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.040]   the world around me.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.960]   I watch answers in a building about my oven.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.640]   You use an eye grill, I use an eye grill.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.800]   I know what temperature the chicken breast is, what temperature the grill is, all of that
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:56.800]   stuff.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.800]   Siri, how do I feel right now?
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.920]   Yeah, that's not the way am I and what am I doing here?
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.200]   The real point is that the trend of computing is not necessarily making things smaller,
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:11.280]   but instead of having that one big home computer that sits on a desk in your living room and
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:15.360]   you have to walk up to and that has to do everything for you, is to break up that $1,000
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:20.280]   computer into maybe a dozen, $100, $1,500 computer.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:26.600]   Your phone, the reason why the iPad was such a difficult thing to imagine is that the secret
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.600]   wasn't simply a tablet computer that runs an operating system.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:33.640]   It's the idea of what if we took away everything from this laptop that is not necessary from
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.360]   the context of a tablet app?
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.680]   What would we be left with?
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.120]   Just like glasses, what would we be left with if we were going to take away?
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.120]   A phone is what would we take away?
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:45.960]   Everything that is not necessary if you just want something in your pocket that just keeps
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.040]   you connected.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.680]   And then when you move on to the watch, what is necessary if all we want to do is to be
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:55.560]   able to collect data that's useful to the user and also have a bare amount of communication
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.560]   with that device.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.440]   Because remember this person already has a phone, they already have a tablet, they already
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.080]   have this other device, they're not going to be able to, they don't want something that
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.040]   does those, all those things.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:09.400]   They want a tiny device that communicates, excuse me, that projects just those core features
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.880]   into exactly where they were.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.880]   Exactly.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.000]   To your point, I wrote a column over the weekend and looking five years into the future, what
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.800]   it's going to be like to use computers.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.880]   And it's going to be a lot like having an invisible friend.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:24.160]   Your laptop's going to be listening, your wristwatch, Google Glass, your tablet, your
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.840]   TV, your house, your car.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.640]   It's all going to be listening, you're going to talk, you're going to basically mumble
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.200]   to yourself and hear voices in your head.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.040]   We're all going to be like insane people walking around.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:36.960]   But it's going to be awesome because there will always be like your invisible friend
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:37.960]   listening.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.000]   And it kind of creeps people out to think about that.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.360]   But it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be like that.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.360]   It does.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.560]   It's the same thing with iOS and the cars.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:49.560]   You're decoupling the experience from the hardware and then you can do all sorts of fantastic
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   things.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.360]   Data goes from being pulled to being pushed and suddenly it's wherever you need it to.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.360]   There you go.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:57.600]   And by the way, this answers the question we asked of the last segment is Apple, a hardware
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.120]   company, a software company or a services company.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.520]   Something like this is all three and needs to be all three.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.520]   The service has to be meshed with the software.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.720]   And the services is the hardest part.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.040]   Andy, you said what?
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.240]   Classic Apple product.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.640]   That's a classic Apple product.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:18.520]   If you took away the iTunes store or iTunes or the hard, unique hardware of an iPod, you
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:20.640]   would not have the same thing.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.680]   It really is all three work together.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:26.280]   It's built from the ground up by a team that really is thinking of all three at the same.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:31.680]   And you know, Apple, maybe the only company that has the cash, the will, the market to
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.280]   do something like this.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.880]   And also let Samsung A go do it.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.880]   The freedom.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:37.880]   Google also does.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:38.880]   Google maybe.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.000]   I mean, Google and Apple are really the only two super interesting companies at this time,
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.320]   chiefly because they both have enough deep pockets and they essentially have screw you
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:52.920]   money, meaning that it does it's not important to Apple that they have the number one phone
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:53.920]   in the market.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:54.920]   They're making a good profits.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.520]   They have the ability to do whatever they want to do.
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.240]   So they don't have to make a big screen phone if they don't want to.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:04.760]   Google too has enough money and also enough diversity in their business that they can
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.760]   do.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.960]   Well, what if we just make 10,000 units of Google glass, put it out there and what the
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:12.080]   hell it might turn out to be something we want to pursue it might not.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.200]   But it's interesting enough that we want to pursue it.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.240]   So that is the real buying power of having that kind of a checkbook.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:22.160]   Yeah, this kind of interesting because everybody's like, oh, Apple should buy Disney, Apple
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.360]   should buy the music industry.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.440]   What should Apple do with a hundred million or pressure to not under pressure to build
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.880]   huge market busting products anymore.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.880]   They do want to do that.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.880]   They're trying to do that.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.040]   But it's not as though the next thing they make is going to make or break the companies
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.920]   because just going to be the next thing they do, which is a wonderful place to be in for
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:37.920]   any tech company.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.280]   You could pretty much count on Apple to innovate it.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.280]   Samsung just steal it.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.440]   And Microsoft mess it up.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.440]   Microsoft to say, we've got one too.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.840]   Coming next year.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.280]   I really like this idea.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:58.000]   And I do think that if you know, if Apple thinks big enough, this could be huge historically
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.520]   in the Apple has in the past thought big, iPhone was a big thinking thing and took years
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.480]   in the making as we have learned.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:09.960]   But lately, Apple seems to have been not so ambitious.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:15.240]   I mean, compared to historically, from Mac to iPhone was a long period of time from iPhone
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.600]   to iPad, which is the variation on iPhone, not as long a time, but they do think big,
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.280]   but it's not a year after year thing.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.600]   I think that pace is unsustainable for anybody.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.920]   I think what my view about Apple is that the reason we they sort of raised our expectations
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.680]   because they did some several earth shattering things in a row.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.280]   And then they've been kind of right.
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:37.520]   What they do is they take they find a horrible content consumption experience.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.960]   It's just on the content consumption side.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.400]   And then they fix it with a grand vision.
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.000]   They ship it and then they perfect it.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.560]   And so they're still trying to perfect their vision for the iPhone, for example, and they're
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:53.200]   not just launching every new thing, grabbing every new technology that comes out and just
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.320]   throwing it in for the sake of shipping it.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.440]   And so it's going to be the watch, the TV, I think these things are coming.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:02.080]   And then when they do, then everybody will be talking about how innovative they are until
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:06.280]   they get into the perfecting mode, in which case they won't be innovative anymore.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.280]   But that's not how they operate.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.640]   Not to disappoint, but it looks like this is not going to be something we'll see this
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.640]   year.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.640]   It's a 2014 product.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.120]   That's what it looks like.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.360]   What will be going to release the TV this year?
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:20.160]   Oh, you're never I am so skeptical on the TV.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:23.600]   But okay, that's a watch I get.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.800]   And you're right, we're all wearing these fitness things.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:30.200]   You know, I mean, the watch I get and boy, I'd love it if it would, you know, tell my
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.400]   doctor, you know, everything I need to know.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:40.520]   Right now I use stuff from why things I have a why things blood pressure and a scale.
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:44.840]   And I have, you know, this the Fitbit, which has, as you saw, and it would be great to
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:48.000]   combine all that I could send an email in my doctor with my blood pressure readings over
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   a period of time.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   It'd be nice to be able to do all of that.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   What do you, what do you think?
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.200]   Marnay Richie, the keeper of the rumors.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.160]   What do you think Apple will announce this year?
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.880]   We've got presumably an event in September, if they do it like last year, September and
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:02.880]   October.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.840]   Yeah, then they'll revamp pretty much everything again.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.760]   I mean, the retinoc, I mean, the thing is like, let's just do it once a year and we'll
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.760]   just do everything.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:14.440]   I don't know if it's a new thing or it's just to re I mean, Apple, they don't historically
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:19.840]   put products on the shelf for long periods of time, making a thin iPad five and a red
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:24.560]   and iPad mini are incredibly non-frivial things because you're balancing massive displays
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.560]   with light products.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.320]   And it's not really the thinnest that they care about.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:31.040]   It's the lightness that they care about with battery life.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.960]   And they're not going to ship an iPad that has five hours of battery life.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.040]   It's a non-starter.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:40.840]   So it takes a certain period of time to get a new iPad design up to that, to being a viable
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:41.840]   product.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:45.440]   And it takes a while to get the panel technology and the LED technology and everything to make
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.720]   a red and iPad mini a viable product.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:51.640]   And I think what we're seeing is just the realities of the changes Apple wants to make
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.560]   in those products are taking this long to get to market.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.160]   And if they could have done it sooner, I don't think they would have waited.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.920]   They would have done it in the spring.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:02.680]   Some have said no iPad mini update this year.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.560]   Is that, do you think true?
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:08.400]   It's I don't from when the last I heard the mini retina is still not ready.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:14.240]   They could do a revamp of the non retina mini, which sounds like it's on the table.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:17.640]   But whether they choose to do that or not, I guess will depend on how functional and
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.560]   how marketable they think it is.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:23.560]   But you know, the Apple is not really interested in getting us to buy a new iPad every year.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.560]   They're never market.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:28.880]   So I think it's a really good thing to do to make the 2011 or sorry, the 2013 iPad so much
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.920]   better than 2012 one that everyone will go and upgrade.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.800]   They want to get new people who haven't bought before and they want to get people who are
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.160]   two or three years out and are willing to upgrade.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.920]   So the year over year difference won't be major.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.600]   But if you look back two or three years, it'll be an impressive difference.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.320]   I mean, iPad four is pretty much a done cooked product.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.040]   I don't know where you go.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.800]   You later faster and lighter.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:48.800]   Digger, lighter and bigger.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:52.240]   So we're seeing and I don't.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.640]   I take this stuff with a little bit of grain of salt, but some of Apple's partners reporting
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:58.560]   Apple testing different sized screens like a 13 inch iPad.
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:59.920]   And also a bigger iPhone.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:04.360]   I think the bigger iPhone is it's got to do that.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:05.360]   But it won't be huge.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.480]   I don't I think they're going to have a slightly bigger iPhone.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.480]   They still be.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.480]   Or an half inches.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.960]   Yeah, some like it would be under five.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.200]   Well, it'd be well under five inches for sure because they.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.200]   I had scale.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:19.360]   If you take the current iPhone, you blow it up to 4.99 is exactly the panel they make for
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:24.040]   the retina iPad right now, which would mean that Apple would have a dense iPad mini, a
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:27.920]   less dense iPad, a dense iPhone, a less dense iPhone on two different.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.000]   So that is a five inch screen.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   That's a five inch screen.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   Yeah, four point nine.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   I boy, I'd be very interested in that.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.280]   Yeah, I like the five is a good is to me is kind of a sweet spot on a phone.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.320]   Yeah, when the iPhone first came out when they even when the iPhone five first came
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.600]   out, it seemed reasonable.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:45.200]   But with all these gigantic, you know, Android phones out there, it just seems tiny.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.680]   You know, this is a five inch screen.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.480]   I don't think it's that doesn't feel that big.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.040]   Yeah, it's not it's the galaxy.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.040]   It's four.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:56.800]   No, I mean, I mean, I mean, it's just like a galaxy note, which is only half an inch
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   bigger.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.440]   And yet somehow, but you do the thumb reach around the outside.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.440]   That's quite a read.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.200]   You want to go up to, you know, you do the five to you.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.640]   You're not going to be you're not going to one hand an iPhone five unless you jog it around
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.640]   your hand a little bit.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:11.160]   I mean, the thing the interesting thing with the larger screen iPhone is that right now,
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.960]   there are people who are choosing between iOS and a larger screen because you can't get
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.800]   iOS on a larger screen.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.480]   And you know, to Apple's benefit, millions and millions of people are choosing to go
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.200]   with iOS on a foreign screen.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:25.760]   But if they offer iOS on a bigger screen as well, then those people no longer have to
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:26.760]   make that decision.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:31.240]   And instead of having one product that's a yes or no for people, suddenly you have two
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:35.400]   products and you increase the addressable market considerably for your devices.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.840]   And the other thing is that the Apple's having problems moving the more expensive phones
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.240]   because people are just saying, okay, it's all iOS is iOS.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.240]   Let's get the iPhone four.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.240]   Let's get the iPhone.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.240]   Right.
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.200]   But if you say, well, okay, fine.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:50.440]   But let me show you this movie on this screen versus the screen.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.840]   And suddenly they can find the extra 99 bucks in their pocket.
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:58.120]   We have seen in fact that those less expensive iPhones are selling surprisingly well, maybe
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:00.400]   even out selling the iPhone five and some cases.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.880]   It's kind of it's kind of a wake up call for us, isn't it?
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:07.120]   Because we keep saying the oh well, but it's been proven has a better radio and the cameras
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:08.120]   better.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.040]   But there's so many people for whom this costs $100 more.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.920]   I've got $99 on my pocket.
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:17.480]   And let's forget about the amount of money costs over the course course to your contract.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:19.400]   But that people are really price sensitive.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.080]   There's the factor of this is good enough.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.760]   It's not the best, but this is good.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.520]   But the difference between the four difference between the four and the four S. I mean, I
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.120]   just pains me to know people buying fours.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.760]   Yeah, the four S people.
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:32.760]   The four S.
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.760]   The cameras are in hand of a hundred bucks.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:38.800]   Because my wife's I'm getting close to doing an interview because the camera the camera
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.800]   is so good.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.800]   Exactly.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.800]   That's that's incredible.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:47.720]   I mean, I've been doing for because I have a certain product that I'm under NDA for.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:52.720]   I was going all over Hill and Dale yesterday taking like side by side by side by side by
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.960]   side comparison picks with a phone.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.320]   Oh, you have the Moto X?
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.760]   How do you like that?
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:03.800]   Oh, well, what I like about the iPhone 5 is that it's slim but the light.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:07.600]   And so this morning I was dumping all these photos and looking side by side by side by
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:08.600]   side.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.600]   And it's amazing.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:15.920]   No matter how in one of these phones has let's just say a rather remarkable image sensor and
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.720]   rather remarkable technology backing it up.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:24.280]   But the iPhone 5 still it may not necessarily be the best phone on the best camera on the
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.280]   market anymore.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:30.280]   But for technology that debuted a year ago and next to all of the great the greatest phones
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:33.960]   in the past two or three months, it's still like it's it's it's it's it kicks a butt of
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:35.440]   every all but one.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:40.080]   And even so, it only loses to that phone in certain specifics.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:46.040]   I still think the iPhone 5 camera is is overall better than any other camera on the market.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.600]   There there are some that do better in bright light.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.400]   Others do better light but none that do better.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.840]   You've admitted to having the 10 20 haven't you Andy?
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:58.400]   I saw one at a press event last week.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.160]   I might have had more experience since then if I certainly not.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:06.600]   So that would be that would be I've I've been quite impressed by what I've seen of this
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:07.600]   one.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.600]   So that would be that that would be the big test.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.400]   I mean, I think 41 megapixel sensor.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:16.280]   Yeah, the case thing about all that is that Apple put that sensor into a phone that's incredibly
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.080]   almost needlessly thin.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.960]   What they managed to achieve in that ZX is that Z index is crazy.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:25.320]   It kind of makes you want to wish that Apple would make that iPhone max with the $40 battery
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.320]   and the thick lens.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:31.120]   Yeah, what I want to see is I want them to forget about thinnest because if you put
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:35.360]   Apple's approach towards taking data off of an image sensor and assembling it into a
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:38.520]   really pleasing picture and that's really what we're talking about.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:42.040]   Not just the sensor, not just the you can source a sensor and you can source a lens
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.640]   for a whole bunch of different people.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:46.440]   The idea of simply here is the data coming off of that lens.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:50.440]   Now, is there is there information inside that shadow or is that just dark shadow?
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.440]   Okay.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.440]   How about this section here?
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.440]   Is that so bright?
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.800]   We can't resolve anything out of it or should we try our best to get some detail out of that
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.800]   shadow?
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:01.000]   Apple has not that cold so well.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   I would like to see Apple do what Sony has been rumored to do, which is that Sony is
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.480]   rumored to have a lens.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:13.680]   It's like a DSLR lens, standalone lens with the camera electronics built into the lens.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:20.040]   And when you attach it to a phone, it uses NFC to turn that into the lens for the phone.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:23.520]   We've been talking about that on this weekend photography for about four or five years.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.680]   Imagine if Apple did that.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:26.560]   How great that would be.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.560]   But would anybody care about that?
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.560]   No, no, they really care.
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:35.040]   The thing that I want is as I'm running up this interesting device that I'm under an
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:38.960]   NDA on, I'm exactly like you.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:44.640]   I'm so like, oh, but I hope people care that the pictures are so much better with this
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:48.240]   camera phone rather than another device.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:52.640]   Because there are people who say, oh, well, I know that I'm expecting my first child in
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:53.640]   eight weeks.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:54.640]   I'm not going to buy a real camera.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.840]   Look, I've just gotten my new $99 with contract phone.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.240]   It's got a camera and everything.
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.120]   No, it's your first child.
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:02.600]   You're the real camera.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.840]   I will give you $300.
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:06.600]   Please buy a real camera.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.600]   And it's so funny.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:14.200]   You take a real camera and with my two kids, I took a Canon 5D with short, good depth of
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:15.200]   field.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.960]   And they're like, you should go into that as a business.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:17.960]   I was just taking like snapshots.
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:18.960]   They were like, this is amazing.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:22.480]   Because everyone else takes them with little cameras.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:28.280]   And what I would say is that the number one issue for the camera is that still a problem
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:29.280]   on the iPhone.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.080]   Well, is low light conditions.
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.080]   Oh, all right.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.320]   I think the number one issue is low light conditions.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.920]   And that's all they should be focusing on.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:38.480]   But that's expensive if you want to do that.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.120]   They're also better than 90 something percent of the market.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.120]   They are.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:44.480]   But I'm just saying that that's the way you have something to stand out.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:50.120]   It's because going to taking pictures of your kids in your house in the evening, watching
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.440]   TV or something like that.
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.520]   And yet, I bet that's how most people are doing it.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:58.920]   And so the thing to acknowledge is that people are buying a camera phone as their primary
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:55:59.920]   camera.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.920]   But I'm saying that.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:01.920]   So how good can we get it?
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.200]   I'm saying you push that down the path of...
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:10.600]   If you could make the flash sort of a thing at a pass, so you would never need it, that
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.160]   would be amazing.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:16.160]   Well, that would be a revolution.
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:21.760]   Any camera with an intelligent flash incorporated in it, the differences between those kind
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:26.840]   of pictures and pictures with no fill flash, no stop motion, no nothing.
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:30.400]   I can't tell you how excited I would be if the only rumor that I heard about, not the
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.400]   eye.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:33.360]   This year's iPhone, I think we all agree, it's just going to be like a bump.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:35.280]   It's not going to be a reinvention.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:40.160]   But I can't tell you if the only rumor that I heard about the 2014 iPhone is that they
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:42.640]   decided to make it a third of an inch thick.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:46.120]   I'm like, oh my God, we're going to see a great deal.
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:49.120]   We're going to see a big image sensor.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.120]   We're going to see multi elements.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.560]   This is going to be great.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.160]   I'd be shocked if Apple does that.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:56.040]   In fact, I'm shocked that Nokia decided to go with this.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:58.200]   I think it just becomes a specialty product.
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.120]   I just think I...
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:07.120]   I refer to it in my preview of the 1020, I very happily refer to it as a ZFC design,
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:10.280]   ZFG design, saying for zero dams given.
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:15.840]   So if you're a design walk, fine, complain about this bump up for the lens.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:20.400]   I don't care if that makes you happy that the fact that this is a little bit thicker
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.560]   is going to upset you because of the aesthetics.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:23.560]   That's great.
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.560]   We don't care.
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:25.560]   But what our job is to make the best camera we can possibly...
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:28.880]   Because this is what Nokia is taking, and I think it's probably the correct one, is
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:32.600]   that what is becoming important is computational photography.
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:40.960]   So in fact, this is what John Peter Broadmont told me when he was here is it's all about
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:45.520]   the fact that you've got two things, a big powerful computer and all full-time internet
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.240]   connection behind that lens.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:50.040]   So let's get the lens to a certain point.
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:53.400]   But I don't know how far you have to go to get enough data into the camera that it can
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:54.720]   fix some of these other problems.
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:55.720]   I don't know.
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:57.360]   Can you make low light photography work?
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:58.360]   You can drastically stabilize it.
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:03.320]   I think for the average user, the iPhone 5 camera experience is already pretty darn awesome.
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:04.320]   I think most...
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:05.320]   To me, it's not low light.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.320]   It's funny that you said that.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.480]   Because to me, it's speed.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:11.480]   It's the speed of launching the camera and the speed with which you can take pictures.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:15.440]   And if you're taking pictures of little kids, it's just not fast enough.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.040]   For everything else, it's almost 7.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.320]   You've tried on iOS 7 yet?
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:20.480]   No, is it better?
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:24.520]   Well, I can't say anything, but I would try on iOS 7.
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:26.920]   They show us some demos.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:31.040]   If you go back and watch them again, the camera demo is really good.
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.840]   Well, to me, that's the place to attack.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:34.960]   It's all software to me.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:38.680]   If you could do HDR really fast, that would be killer.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:41.320]   And what I'm surprised that someone hasn't done is...
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:44.400]   And maybe I'm not smart enough that this doesn't work.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:47.760]   But the way Fovion works is Sigma uses Fovion sensors.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.600]   And what they do is they stack the RGB.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:55.640]   So they stack the RGB so that it produces a sharper image.
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.040]   Because really, all of the images we look at are sharpened.
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:59.600]   Because I really wish I could say something.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:00.600]   That's a ruin zone.
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:03.920]   But to see MOS, all the pixels are next to each other.
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:04.920]   So frustrating.
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:07.360]   You spend more time not talking about the Moto X than anything.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.320]   I know, it's so frustrating.
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.600]   So anyway, so what you want...
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.600]   That's a good idea, though.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.520]   Yeah, what you want is a Fovion sensor.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.080]   It's a hell of a knife.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:16.920]   Mixed with a CMOS sensor.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.560]   Never sign the NDA.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:20.200]   I did ask, is it a Fovion sensor?
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.320]   They said, first of all, they said, what the hell you're talking about?
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:23.680]   Right.
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:25.240]   They didn't know what that meant.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.280]   Right.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:27.040]   Good sign.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.400]   And they said, you know what?
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:33.480]   You don't look like at all like David Pogue to me.
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:34.840]   I have a picnic ribbon.
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:36.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.840]   Anyway, all I'm saying is that's a great idea.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:39.840]   That's a great idea.
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:45.080]   But the point being that I think there are ways to get better performance out of little
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:51.360]   thin, crappy 50-cent sensors and then put it through this powerful computer.
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:52.800]   Because there's no denial.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:55.400]   These things are really powerful computers now.
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.640]   And I have to admit, I own...
[00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:01.800]   I keep posting posts from my Google Glass to my Google+ account.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.040]   And people are routinely amazed at the image quality.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:08.520]   But they have to be explained is that number one, the software automatically senses the
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.520]   need to do HDR and will apply it automatically.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.560]   And secondly, by the time it goes up to Google+, remember one of the big things they announced
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:19.280]   at Google I/O was that they have sort of an automatic enhance that goes into all Google
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.040]   plus photos that has to be turned off, not turned on.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:27.160]   And that basically, so it's OK that this device has this tiny 5 megapixel sensor.
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:30.520]   So long as there's software that can, again, take those numbers off the sensor and put them
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.640]   to develop them into something wonderful.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:38.120]   And you mentioned that the 1020 is nobody's going to buy it.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.360]   If that was an Android phone, a lot of people would buy it.
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.360]   It should have been the only thing wrong.
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:46.280]   I'm not saying that no, but what I'm saying is that I'm hoping that I hope that the people
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:50.160]   don't care thing is going to flip both ways.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:55.000]   Because I hope there are people who will come into an AT&T store and see these three
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.480]   phones and say, "Well, you know what?
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:59.440]   I hear your argument that iOS software is better.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.000]   I hear your argument that the Android marketplace is really, really big.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.240]   Really, I really don't need a half a million apps.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.240]   I need 10.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.240]   Windows Phone has those 10.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.240]   Great.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.240]   I don't care.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.240]   Give me the one with the big phone with it with a great camera.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.240]   I hope that happens.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.160]   I'm not sure if that's going to happen, though.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:16.000]   And to go back to Leo's point, one of the reasons Apple makes their own chipset is because
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.800]   they put a digital APS signal processor in that.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.720]   And they're making a new chipset this year.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.440]   And traditionally Phil Schiller has had his whole photo segment and something they care
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.440]   deeply about.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.320]   So I wouldn't be surprised if that photo commercial earlier in the year showed they
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.040]   put a lot of attention into the image processing again.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:37.400]   We're 30 minutes away from Apple's quarterly update.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.600]   It's quarterly report.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.280]   Anybody have anything to say?
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.680]   You've predicted this is a good time to predict.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:48.360]   The horses are in the gate.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.160]   The little bunny is ready to go.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.160]   What do you think?
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.720]   I'll do it as a point that Apple will be doomed.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.680]   A lot of analysts say, well, the analysts' predictions are all over the map, more so than
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.320]   usual, this quarter.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:08.480]   I can't imagine that they're going to be surprisingly good.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.480]   I guess that's the question.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.080]   Are there going to be surprises at all?
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.920]   I think it will be vaguely disappointing.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:18.840]   No, my wireless accessible or not, it will be termed in the media as disappointing.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.840]   Apple will be doomed.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:20.840]   Exactly.
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.040]   That they have not introduced tons of new products already this year.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:28.200]   That is the downswing before the traditional fall upswing will largely go ignored and we
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:31.320]   will have a bunch of people manipulating the market to their own benefit and it will be
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.320]   just another Tuesday.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.280]   Yeah, that sounds exactly right.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.280]   I agree.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:41.040]   We don't care about any of that, but what we do care about is what it tells us about
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.080]   the company and what the company is up to and what little tidbit sample leaks out.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.080]   I think that's the thing.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.240]   I think we're going to tell you what Tim Cook comes on and says, "By the way, we should
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.240]   expect some interesting new products in September or something like that."
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.480]   All in on strings.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.200]   I love the criminology of it.
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.160]   I know Andy hates it, but I love it.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:03.560]   I love to sit there and say, "Oh my gosh, he used the word XYZ or whatever."
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:07.000]   That means that they're going to be a blind Tesla or something.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.800]   I do think we're going to hear the phrase.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.920]   That's a very interesting space and we're observing it quite closely.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.440]   Yes, you should watch what we're doing.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:21.520]   All the threads are being pulled.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.000]   All the threads are being pulled.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.520]   Sounds like Apple's pulling a lot of threads right now.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:30.920]   I think we'll see them like we're like special extra long cup cuffs.
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:36.640]   I don't want to see the shape of the tan line that I've developed on this wrist.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:39.240]   Hey, that's right.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.400]   Then a big triangle.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.400]   There's the criminology.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.640]   What do the tan lines look like?
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.640]   That's significant.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.760]   That looks like an up tan line.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.840]   No, I'm pretty sure that's a fuel band tan line.
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.560]   See, it's slightly indebted.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.120]   We'll find out.
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.160]   Me and Munster will ask about a television and Tim Cook will hit the question back at him
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.680]   like he talked about his mother.
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:59.440]   He'll be just like the last quarter.
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.760]   Munster is the only guy still talking TV.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:04.040]   He'll stop the week before Apple announces it.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.040]   That'll be the trial.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.480]   He'll say, "Yeah, I guess they're not doing a TV I give up."
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.880]   I am now more and more.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.760]   I was skeptical even on the watch.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:16.120]   If these reports are true about the team they're putting together, seeing it be as
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:20.000]   much a fitness device, that really intrigues me.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   The biome-med stuff.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:29.880]   The thing that is intriguing to me about smart watches is that everyone is doing one.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.240]   What do they know that the rest of us don't know?
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.240]   I mean, everyone.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.240]   I would give up.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.240]   I would give up looking at Apple.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.240]   I do have a watch.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.680]   I have an argument for cost about as much as an Apple watch.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:42.280]   I would give it up in a heartbeat for something that would keep me connected.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:43.280]   That's right.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:49.960]   I think most of the companies are getting into it because I've talked to a couple of
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.560]   people about this used to run very large companies.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.520]   They were telling me about the...
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:58.000]   It's easy to tell yourself that the math is correct.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:04.320]   Given the effects of known celestial objects, there should be a planet we can't observe
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.320]   right there.
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:09.600]   Let's start firing a rocket ship to land there because the math says there's a planet there
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:14.000]   we can land on and start harvesting an emptanium from.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.600]   Sometimes there are products that are like that where people think that the math says
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.000]   that people would want a watch.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.320]   The timing says that with people adopting these highly personalized devices and these
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.960]   highly intimately connected devices, the math...
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:32.760]   I have a spreadsheet blank blank blank that says there must be a market for smart watches
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:33.760]   at this point.
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:37.600]   We got to get in there with our 1.0 product so that the 2.0 product will be there to take
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.120]   grab those money and spend money with those fists.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.120]   I agree with that.
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:44.160]   Also to the point is that there are going to be two kinds of smart watches.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:49.360]   They're going to be the kind that are like the pebble or some of these others that are
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:54.120]   sort of open and can function with any major phone.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:57.960]   Then there are going to be the others, the iWatch, the Google Watch, the Samsung Watch,
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:03.480]   possibly the Microsoft Watch, that are going to lock you into that company's stuff.
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:10.760]   If you're Apple, you don't want people using the Google Watch because there goes Siri.
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:14.000]   You don't want them to use the pebble either because you want them to use the Siri Watch
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.520]   or the one that's going to become the Siri Watch.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:22.120]   There's a game that's being played there between ecosystem, I don't want to say lock-in, but
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:27.560]   ecosystem support that companies like Apple have to be aware of.
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:28.560]   Why not say lock-in?
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.560]   Okay, let's play lock-in.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.960]   I'm comfortable saying that.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.280]   I think that Apple could make a...
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:40.720]   Just like Apple's perfectly happy making iPhones and iPods and copies of iTunes that work fine
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:44.720]   on all systems because it serves them very well to make sure that people buy the phone.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.080]   They don't want to just sell a phone to 8% of the marketplace.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.800]   They want to sell it to everyone who's not using Linux.
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:53.400]   Look at our two best examples.
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.840]   We have the Sony Watch.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.920]   They have their own development program.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:01.160]   People are not writing for the iPhone, they're writing for the Sony.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.280]   Then you look at Google Glass.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.680]   Google Glass is basically Google now that you wear on your head.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:07.680]   That's what it is.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:12.320]   They went so far as during Google I/O to have an entire session saying how to avoid your
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.840]   warranty on Google Glass.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:14.840]   I love it.
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:17.960]   And explained, if you want to run a Ubuntu on it, that's really dumb, but fine.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.600]   Here's how to put Ubuntu on Google Glass.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.960]   It's a computer.
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.480]   But yeah, I think that if Apple were to do a watch, there's no chance whatsoever it
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.840]   would work with anything that is not running iOS.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:30.400]   That's one of the reasons why the more I think about it, and we've all been talking
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.960]   about this endlessly for about a year, the less I think that it's going to be what we
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.320]   imagine to be a color touchscreen watch face sort of thing.
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.880]   I really do think it's going to be something more like the Fitbit where Apple can even
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.600]   afford to create a less expensive product that works with more services.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.000]   But it will evolve into that.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.800]   And once you go down the path of embracing one of these devices, you're probably going
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:55.200]   to stick with it for several generations.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:59.320]   So I don't think there's any question in three, five, ten years that wearable computers
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.920]   are going to be everything we imagine.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:04.400]   They're going to have little Princess Leia things popping up in the hologram.
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:08.000]   And they're going to cure cancer and all that stuff.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.040]   So they want to get you started on their watch.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.040]   Here's the possible possibly incendiary comment.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.040]   If we're thinking about a wristwatch as like a color screen like this, is this a little
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:24.600]   bit like when Microsoft was envisioning a future of tablet computing as here is Windows
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.440]   XP running on a tablet?
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.440]   Yes.
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.520]   I just don't think we have the imagination to figure out.
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.360]   Maybe it's a big clamp.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.440]   I know.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:35.440]   The eye nipple clams.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.440]   Most people wear those.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.600]   Wear those as it is.
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.440]   So that's a very good transition point.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.960]   I think it's going to be something that we are not going to.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:46.240]   It's not going to be a smaller version of an iPhone on a wrist.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.800]   It's going to be something more interesting.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.600]   That's absolutely true.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.120]   It's always going to be a narrower pipe than our other devices.
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:56.120]   But a screen makes a whole lot of sense if they can get the battery life down because
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.320]   it's essentially extends the skin.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:02.440]   There's no such thing as too much screen real estate to a certain extent.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.280]   That solves the problem of Apple having a smaller phone.
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:08.800]   You have a smaller phone and then another square inch or so on your wrist that enables
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:12.880]   you to divide the visual load of what you look at and where you look at and stuff like
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.880]   that.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:17.560]   So I think really high resolution screens are coming to watches whether they come out
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.920]   in the first generation or not from Apple.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.560]   There certainly will on the other devices.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:28.280]   So I think we're heading for a world in which batteries all through the bank.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:32.480]   And a high resolution screen curved glass in the whole bit.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:37.440]   And they're going to do a narrow subset of things in a really high quality, high fidelity
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.440]   sort of way.
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:41.720]   And it's probably not wrong to look at the Apple TV model where the Apple TV comes out
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:45.160]   as a little box and it goes on your television and it really only works if you have the rest
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.920]   of Apple's ecosystem supporting it.
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.120]   So it's not really useful to anybody else.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:53.360]   And then over time there's rumors of it becoming a full blown television with an SDK.
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:54.920]   But it takes a long time to get there.
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:59.080]   And that history has taught us that the first iPad changed the way we thought of tablets
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.360]   but it wasn't great on its own.
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:03.280]   It became great with iPad 2 and then iPad Mini and iPad 4.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.760]   There's an iPhone.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:08.000]   It took Apple three or four years to get the hardware to the point that they could start
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.640]   writing the software that they wanted for mobile devices.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.320]   And I don't see the watch being any different.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:16.520]   We'll get a first implementation that's like an Apple TV that does very limited things
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:19.800]   but changes the game enough to maybe mainstream the technology.
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.960]   Then over time it gets more powerful, longer battery life.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:25.640]   And Apple can start treating it as a software platform and that's three or four generations
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.320]   down the road.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:31.360]   One more story and then we're going to take a break and get our tips of the week.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.280]   The Apple developer site's still down.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:36.120]   Apple a little more communicative about what's going on.
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:41.920]   I just got this image from Apple when I went to developer.apple.com and clicked the iOS
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:42.920]   dev center.
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.120]   We'll be back soon.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.800]   They've been down since Thursday.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.800]   So it's almost a week.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:51.120]   Last Thursday an intruder attempted to secure personal information of our registered developers
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.040]   from the developer website.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:56.760]   Sensitive personal information was encrypted and cannot be accessed.
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.360]   By the way, I'd like to know more about that.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.360]   It wasn't encrypted.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:00.360]   It was assaulted.
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.600]   How was it encrypted?
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.960]   Remember if they've got the data, they've got time to brute force it.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:09.320]   So encrypted alone is not necessarily sufficient.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.280]   It's a start but we'd like to know how.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.640]   However, we've not been able to rule out the possibility that some developers' names,
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.760]   mailing addresses and/or email addresses may have been accessed.
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:24.040]   Those mailing addresses and/or email addresses, doesn't mention passwords.
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:26.560]   In the spirit of transparency, we want to inform you of the issue.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.120]   We took the site down immediately on Thursday and have been working around the clock since
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.680]   then in order to prevent a security threat like this from happening again.
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:38.120]   We're completely overhauling our developer systems.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:43.160]   Sounds like they're rewriting it as we speak, updating our server software and rebuilding
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.480]   the entire database.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:48.840]   We apologize for the significant inconvenience our downtime has caused you.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:54.080]   This is a bad time when you're in the midst of iOS beta coming real close to the release
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.080]   date.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.760]   This is about the worst time that could be down.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:02.240]   If your program membership was set to expire, it's been extended, et cetera.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:13.280]   One researcher, UK-based Abraham Bolech, claims that he found this hole.
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:17.880]   He says he under 13 bugs in the system, highlighting a hole that could leave data from the developers
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.880]   that are exposed.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:24.320]   Bolech claims he showed 73, Apple, 73 user accounts from its own workers to illustrate
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:25.360]   the flaw.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:31.440]   When he contacted them to help them fix it, he says he was able to get data from more
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.840]   than 100,000 users.
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:36.360]   He says, and boy, I'd stay in the UK right now, Abraham.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.600]   Maybe go somewhere, I don't know, how is Ecuador's now?
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.120]   Ecuador embassy.
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.720]   He maintains he did not hack the system for malicious purposes.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:46.560]   He did get 100,000 users' information, though.
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.000]   Apple viewed his access as a security breach.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.360]   Oh, surprise, surprise, and shut down the developer center.
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.760]   He's saying he's the guy who caused this shutdown.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:58.120]   Yes, this is really, we're all taking this guy's word for it.
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.800]   Only he said that Apple shut it down because of him.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:05.720]   I think there's a possibility that that's probably the case, that he alerted them to
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:10.760]   this problem, but they may have looked into it and found lots of people running in there.
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:14.360]   Maybe there have been hundreds of people who have exploited that bug.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.360]   Maybe there haven't been.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.360]   He could be, he's just looking for publicity.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:23.120]   He's clearly a publicity hunting type of person given his track record.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.480]   So we really, really don't know.
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:29.560]   What happens in the absence of information is everybody will jump on whatever data they
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:30.560]   have.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.920]   This guy filled the void with lots of information about what he did.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:39.760]   I really don't know that that's possible that they're not even related, in fact.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:42.160]   Yeah, that's what I thought too.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:46.560]   And the key phrase there is rebuilding the database.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:50.240]   And that certainly says that's certainly says that re-encrypting everything using it
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.480]   entirely in technology.
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:14:00.120]   Well this gets back to, if you're on the internet, one thing that I used to not be
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:04.080]   very good at and I've become kind of religious about is when you think about your passwords,
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.000]   you know, making sure that you don't have a single password.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.160]   Yeah, change password for every site.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:13.840]   And you got it, whether it's one password or last pass, you want it generating a totally
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.000]   random code.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.880]   You know, into that rather than you trying to think of something that reminds you of your,
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.480]   you don't want it to remind you of anything because most of the, many times getting into
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:28.320]   this is more of a social process than a technology process of how they hack into something.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:33.400]   And so we use last pass because we can share passwords.
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:37.160]   Like our big thing is we never want to email a password or text a password to each other.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:41.040]   So we, you know, want to have a central place that lets us move things back and forth between
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.040]   each other.
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.560]   And so, but otherwise one password, but I mean this kind of stuff, every time I see one of
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:48.280]   these, I'm like, you know, it's because, and you want to think about it for your whole
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:53.440]   company because any one person who's not doing that, you know, is a weak link.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:58.040]   Yeah, there was a hilarious scene in the most recent Dexter where Dexter was trying to guess
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:02.400]   his sister's password and she has a notoriously foul mouth way of speaking.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.120]   And so he guesses the word password as her password didn't work.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:10.880]   So he tried effing password right in second try.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:12.360]   That's actually probably pretty good.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.920]   Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:14.920]   But you're right.
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:15.920]   Absolutely.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.920]   We're going to, we're going to take a break and come back with your picks of the week
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:19.920]   gentlemen's of repair.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.240]   Meanwhile, I'll tell you about shutters stock.com.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:30.400]   Yesterday, my daughter who's working on a thing for school needed to make a poster.
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.400]   And she, I said, I could give you some images.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.800]   You know, she said, well, it's, you know, it's, it's for psychology.
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:41.120]   I said, just search for emotions on shutters stock.com.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.560]   And you can find all sorts of things.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:50.880]   Shutters stock is an amazing collection of royalty free stock photos, illustrations, vector
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.440]   arts and video.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:53.440]   Here's just happy.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.160]   See, put that on your poster.
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.160]   Happy right there.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.160]   That's happy.
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:58.680]   And it turns upside down.
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:00.760]   It's sad.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:01.760]   Happy birthday.
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:02.760]   Look at that.
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:08.200]   So if you are a blogger, if you are a video videographer, by the way, great, great video

[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   It changes every month.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.720]   So since we're in July, use MAC break seven.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:40.280]   They'll know you heard it on MAC break weekly during the month of July.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.760]   Even if you're listening in August, use MAC break seven.
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:46.960]   And we thank shutters stock for their support of MAC break weekly.
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:48.600]   You're going to love it.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.600]   All right.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:50.600]   Time for our tips of the week.
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.320]   I'm going to let you guys go, but I got in the mail.
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.800]   I got a bunch of these that came out on Monday.
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.520]   And everybody's been talking about this leap controller.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.720]   This is the one where you.
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:04.800]   So what I'm going to do while you guys are talking is this is one fresh in the box.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.800]   The first one I tried did not work.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:07.800]   It wouldn't calibrate.
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.880]   You're holding it wrong.
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:10.880]   It's weird.
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:11.880]   You put it right here.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:12.880]   I'll show you.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:15.180]   But anyway, we'll give you a demo of it, but I'll start installing it now and let Annie
[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:19.800]   Naco kick us off with his pick of the week while I do this.
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:24.320]   This is something really, really cool from Sam, Sam desk, Sand desk.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.200]   It's called the wireless media drive.
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.480]   I think it's a wireless media drive.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:29.480]   Yes.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:33.560]   What this is, is it's like when the coolest things to have, if like me, you rely on your
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:40.920]   iPad for like your, your main travel computer, what this is, is this is a Wi-Fi base station
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:45.040]   with built in 64 gigabytes of flash storage in it.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:50.640]   So essentially you can hook this up by USB to your desktop, put whatever you want on it,
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.000]   media files, documents, photos, anything.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.720]   And then from your iPad, from your iPhone, from your Android device, anything like that,
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:02.800]   there's an app that will simply let you browse all the contents and actually use them.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:09.600]   So let's say that you've just obtained a 1.1 gigabyte high definition public domain
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:12.240]   movie file from an internet source.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:15.760]   And you want to be able to watch it like in your hotel room when you travel, but you
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:18.720]   don't necessarily, but you don't have to, oh God, now I'm going to have to import it
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:22.960]   into my iTunes library, then connect up my iPad and sync it over with this.
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:24.360]   Nope, just copied over to this.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:27.400]   You'll be traveling with 64 gigabytes worth of media and stuff on it.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.040]   And then whenever you want to watch it, you can either, you can stream it directly from
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:35.320]   there and things like photos and documents, you can open them with the related device
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:36.840]   and it works fine.
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.840]   That's okay.
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:38.840]   So that's cool.
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.480]   That's already pretty cool because there's so much of the storage that I use, I have on
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.920]   my iPad and on my phones is for stuff that I'm not necessarily going to be listening
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:49.680]   to every day or watching every day, but I want it available just in case.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:53.440]   So this will take you, let you offload all that stuff onto storage, which is great when
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:56.440]   you're using devices that don't have expandable storage.
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.440]   Okay, awesome enough.
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:19:59.440]   Awesome.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:03.360]   This number two is a standard SD card slot.
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.840]   So it's like a reader.
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:05.840]   See exactly.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:09.160]   So that you put anything that will fit into an SD card into this.
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:13.160]   So even your micro SD, mini SD cards into there.
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:16.800]   And then now that will actually appear inside that same reader app.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.840]   And so now you can just pop the card out of your camera or out of any other device,
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:21.840]   pop it in there.
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:24.040]   And now your iPad can take all of those photos from there.
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:26.120]   It's a camera connection kit.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.120]   Only it works.
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.120]   That's a great thing.
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:29.120]   It actually works.
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.920]   Can also be used as a beverage coaster.
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:33.480]   Yeah, it's like, well, for like Manhattan's maybe not.
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:36.520]   It's a small, yeah, it's small for small, for small, but everything.
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:40.840]   It has a built-in battery that lasts about eight hours of access, I think.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:45.600]   But because the problem with just last week, I was in Philadelphia and I wanted to take
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:50.120]   some photos and some videos off of my glass and import them into my, import them into
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:52.400]   my iPad so I could post them.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:56.400]   And this has USB will appear to any operating system as a standard camera.
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:03.720]   But as usual, the camera connection kit that is used that's made by Apple to connect a
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:09.120]   camera to the iPad nine times out of 10, even if it's an SD card, we'll say, I'm sorry,
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.760]   this device did not compatible with it.
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:12.560]   Or I'm sorry, but it's device.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.560]   Too much power.
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:14.640]   I'm not going to let you use it.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.080]   And so it's absolutely useless.
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.640]   I said it just that way.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.640]   Exactly.
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.640]   It's not.
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.720]   I'm not going to apologize to you.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:27.240]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, the camera connection kit is supposed to let you connect the camera through
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:28.240]   you.
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:29.240]   You don't understand.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:31.080]   You don't understand what it's like to be an iPad.
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.640]   People always ask me to connect cameras.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:33.640]   I've had it.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:34.640]   I've had it.
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.680]   So so essentially this is it's not it's more angry.
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:39.240]   In other words, you're saying it's not lisping.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:40.240]   It's angry.
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:43.440]   It's it's petulant camera rejection kit.
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:47.240]   And the camera abuse camera camera argument clinic.
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:48.240]   That's not a camera.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.240]   Yes, it is.
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:50.240]   No, it is.
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.240]   It is.
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.240]   It is not an argument.
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.240]   Yes, it is.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.080]   So yes, so this is it's 99 bucks.
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:59.360]   So for for 64 gigabytes of just walking around storage that's so small and doesn't require
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:00.360]   any power.
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.760]   That's already very, very awesome.
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:06.320]   But the fact that you will have absolutely no problems taking any file that is on an SD
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:11.800]   card and introducing it to your iPhone or your iPad or again, maybe you're a multi platform
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.640]   ecumenical household and you do have Android devices.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:16.280]   Same device will work just fine.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:18.360]   There's only one real drawback to it.
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:21.040]   And that is that this is a Wi-Fi connection.
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:27.440]   So while you are connected while your iPad is connected to this, that is it's it's it's
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:28.440]   it's Wi-Fi connection.
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:33.680]   If you're if you're in the hotel room, you ordinarily will lose your connection to the
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:35.080]   internet while you're connected to this.
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.680]   So if you've got like two hour movie that you're watching, that's a problem.
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:42.680]   However, the app does have sort of a workaround so that you can use this as a pass through.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:47.080]   So that essentially this device is connected to the internet and now your iPad is connected
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:48.080]   to the device.
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:52.120]   So your iPad is connecting to the device to the internet through the device.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:56.400]   So it's not as it's not as simple as it should be, but it does work.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.280]   iPad is for about a week now.
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.720]   And it's just it really works as as well as you'd like it to.
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.720]   So good stuff.
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:08.720]   The Sandisk connect 32G wireless media drives streaming on the go.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:10.520]   They also make a flash drive version of it.
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:14.320]   That's 32 gigs and has its own like little flash drive version of it.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.320]   And that's less expensive.
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:18.080]   But same principle, it turns into a Wi-Fi base station.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:20.240]   I'll let you connect to and use all that file.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.960]   So great stuff.
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:26.400]   It seems like that be something to carry instead of your flashcard reader.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.640]   And it's no bigger than a flashcard reader.
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:30.640]   So right.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:31.640]   Right.
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:32.640]   Easy.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:33.640]   Easy win.
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:34.640]   Good deal.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:35.640]   All right.
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:36.640]   So I'm going to do a quick unboxing that we're going to get to our next tip.
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:37.640]   This is the leap motion.
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:38.640]   You've heard a lot about it.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.640]   They raised something like $40 million over the last three years.
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.640]   The idea being, could you have it over the shoulder, Chad?
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:48.160]   The idea being that it would be well, we'll see, I guess.
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.160]   I don't know.
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:50.160]   Anyway, so this.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.920]   Does that just pick that?
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:53.920]   No, this isn't from Sandisk.
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.480]   It looks the same though, doesn't it?
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:56.480]   It's more like a lozenge.
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:57.480]   It's more like a lozenge.
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:58.480]   I know.
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:23:59.480]   It's more.
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:00.480]   Yeah.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:01.480]   But it's very similar.
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:02.480]   Only yours doesn't have an SD card reader, Leo.
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:03.480]   No, it doesn't.
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:06.280]   So you have to activate it at leapmotion.com/setup.
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:07.280]   It's similar.
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.280]   It's similar.
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:13.040]   And the other thing that's interesting comes with two USB cables.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:14.040]   They're proprietary.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.040]   They're not standard.
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.040]   I don't think they're standard.
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:17.040]   Maybe they are.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.040]   What is that connection on the end?
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.040]   I've seen it before.
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:20.040]   Maybe it isn't.
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:21.040]   Maybe it is standard.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.040]   USB 3.
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.040]   That's USB 3.
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.040]   Okay.
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:25.160]   So it's a USB 3 cable.
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.840]   There's a short one and a long one.
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:32.280]   I will download the software and we will continue with the installation hoping that by the end
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:35.160]   of this show, I will have a working leap motion.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:39.560]   I'm watching the video right now and getting started with the leap motion.
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:42.920]   As you download, they play this as you download the software.
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.560]   It's playing music.
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.400]   Doo doo doo doo doo doo.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:47.400]   It does.
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.400]   Hi.
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:49.400]   You're welcome.
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:51.400]   I had to have happiness.
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:52.400]   Doo doo doo.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.400]   All right.
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.400]   You're pick of the week, Mr. Mike Algin.
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:56.400]   Okay.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:59.800]   So we were talking about fitness apps and stuff like that.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:05.160]   One of the things I've discovered living as a Nomad is that it's very difficult to sign
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.080]   up for a gym.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:08.080]   Sure.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:13.560]   And so what do you do if you want to exercise and you live in all kinds of random things
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:16.800]   or you travel too much or you just don't like gyms?
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:22.720]   There are lots of fitness apps available for iOS and most of them are not that usable.
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:25.600]   You sort of wander away after a while because they don't really work.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.440]   But my cousin introduced me to one called You Are Your Own Gym.
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:35.280]   Now this is a popular book and it's a fitness program that involves no equipment.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:37.880]   It's all body weight type exercises.
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:44.080]   And what's great about it is that it shows you exactly, it takes you through or drives
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:47.920]   you through or pushes you through all these workouts.
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:51.480]   And it tells you exactly how long to rest, exactly how many reps to do, exactly what
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:52.480]   to do.
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.400]   And it takes you through, there's a six week program.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.400]   You can save workouts.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.760]   You can customize your own workouts.
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:59.440]   So let me show this to you if we can do the overhead on this one.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.440]   It's up here.
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:02.040]   We're going to work out.
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:06.000]   So this is an example of a fairly advanced workout.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.360]   And this is just you say, okay, start the workout.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:09.360]   One rep on each side.
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:13.560]   So it's like having a personal trainer who will actually demonstrate everything.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.880]   Are you doing one arm pushups?
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:18.200]   No, like I said, this is the advanced.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:21.840]   I want to skip because the beginning one is like very, very beginning.
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:22.840]   Look at that.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:26.920]   As you can see, it's high def video that shows you exactly how to do it.
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:27.920]   Exactly what you can't do.
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:29.440]   And when you're done, you just say complete.
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:31.440]   It tells you how long to rest.
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.480]   And then it keeps track of your progress.
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.480]   It does everything you want to do.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.880]   Is this looks like high intensity circuit training sort of?
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.080]   Is it pretty high intensity?
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:40.080]   It becomes so.
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:44.600]   At the beginning level, it starts very, very slow with very basic exercises and takes you
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:48.600]   up to these levels at $2.99.
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:50.560]   And so say you've completed and--
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:55.000]   I can't try something else, but it's got pull ups, military press, and let me up.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000]   But that's just this exercise.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.720]   Is that where a young lady sits on your back and tries to be?
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:26:59.720]   Yes, it is, Leo.
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:00.720]   I can't wait.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:01.720]   I can work my way up to that.
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:02.720]   That's advanced.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:05.200]   As you can see, it comes with its own incentives.
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:06.880]   I want to do a let me up.
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:07.880]   Yes.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:08.880]   Help me.
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:09.880]   This is a $2.99.
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.240]   It's called You Are Your Own Gym.
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.240]   I like it.
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:15.680]   It's available for all iOS devices.
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:18.760]   And it's just a fantastic app for staying in shape without any equipment.
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:19.760]   That's great.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:21.760]   Thank you, Mike.
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:22.760]   You need to share.
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:23.760]   I use my kids.
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.520]   If you grab them by the ankles, you can be great triceps.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.520]   What's great is you get stronger as they grow.
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:30.520]   Exactly.
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:31.520]   You have to keep up.
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:32.520]   You have to do it every day.
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:33.520]   That's right.
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:34.520]   Or you're--
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:35.520]   And eventually they're about doing that to you.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.520]   Yes, it does.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:38.720]   Alex Lindsey, you give us your pick of the week.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:41.400]   I have one little pieces of hardware and then one software.
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:42.400]   All right.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.800]   So one of the things that I have found in my travels--
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:46.400]   I do a little bit of traveling--
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.200]   is there are two things that I really--
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:49.200]   you really want to have.
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.760]   Number one is a little square chargers that you get with your iPhone.
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:54.360]   Just throw those out.
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:55.680]   So they're just totally worthless.
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:57.040]   They work.
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.960]   They work, kind of.
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:01.880]   So you really want to get something that is 3.1 amps.
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:05.360]   And the reason you want 3.1 amps is you want to be able to hook two things in.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.600]   There's no use to use a plug.
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.640]   You can get 3.1 amps.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:10.360]   It's two different connections.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.920]   So one is for your iPad and--
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:13.760]   That's one amp.
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:15.560]   You just put your iPhone into it as well.
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:16.800]   But the point is--
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.320]   There's one, two, one, and one, three, one.
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.080]   One's 2.1 and one's one.
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:21.920]   So a total of three, one.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:22.920]   Yes.
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:23.920]   Look at this guy.
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:25.400]   So this little one doesn't cost very much.
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:26.760]   It's a box wave.
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.720]   And that goes into your lighter.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:30.160]   Yeah, that's very handy.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:31.360]   And it's two connections.
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:33.920]   And one of them is going to be a fast connection for your iPad
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.760]   or a super fast connection for your iPhone.
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:37.160]   And that's the smallest one I've found.
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.360]   I mean, I bought all of them.
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.320]   So just to try to figure it out.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.560]   I've gotten to this mode.
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:43.960]   So my picks are going to be connected to me oftentimes
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.600]   buying like six different.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.000]   And then a collab one.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.440]   That's why we have you.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:48.960]   That's good.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:49.520]   So anyway, so that--
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:50.800]   That's the best one.
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.560]   And this is PowerGen.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:56.440]   This looks a little bit like that little snap thing that
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:57.240]   changes the--
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:57.840]   Yeah.
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:59.760]   So it's also 3.1.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:00.440]   Oh, I see.
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:01.880]   What snaps off is the adapter for the--
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:02.640]   Cool about that.
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.520]   And here's what's cool about the international thing.
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:07.560]   If you pull this off, all this is a two prong
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:10.440]   that you get with every Sony product or whatever.
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:11.920]   So you can buy that anywhere.
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:12.880]   So you need to connect something.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.920]   You don't have to go find this connector.
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:15.760]   Special connector.
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:16.160]   Special connector.
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:17.400]   You literally pull that off.
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:20.080]   And I've used it now in a couple of different countries.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.640]   And a good example is finding the perfect one
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:28.960]   to work with in, for instance, South Africa is always hard
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.320]   because those are the massive ones.
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:31.560]   It's 15 bucks.
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.320]   And you can get it in black or white eyes.
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:33.600]   It's cool.
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:34.640]   15 bucks.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:36.760]   And it's great.
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:39.480]   And you're constantly plugging in two things at one time
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:39.960]   rather than one.
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:42.000]   Andy had something like this last week, which I bought,
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.440]   by the way, Andy.
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.520]   And you said it had a fold up.
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:45.560]   This also has fold up.
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.840]   It's a little bigger than the one that you mentioned.
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.120]   That one was actually something that I was going
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.800]   to make a pick of the week three or four weeks ago
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:55.960]   until I found out that the one that I had was basically
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.520]   one of those--
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.520]   I think you have the exact same one.
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.900]   I didn't want to recommend that specific name brand
[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:03.280]   because it's just one of these things that's
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:05.080]   manufactured overseas and then one of the people
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:06.440]   will import them and put a sticker on it.
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:07.440]   That's why it's 15 bucks.
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:08.280]   But yeah, I agree.
[01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:10.000]   I have one that's very handy.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.320]   It's been very-- I mean, I use it every day.
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:13.640]   And I'm really happy with it.
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:15.440]   And then my software picked--
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:16.840]   just because I've been trying to do ones that
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:17.920]   are more consumer, like these.
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:22.240]   And then I don't think that I have recommended this before.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.440]   But this is kind of like the secret app for people
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:26.120]   who do big presentations.
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.800]   So-- and I've been noticing a lot of people's surprise
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:29.880]   like they always look over your shoulder.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:31.400]   And you either see it everywhere,
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:33.160]   or people are asking you about it if you don't see it.
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.880]   And that is-- and I may have talked about it before.
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:36.880]   I can't remember.
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:37.880]   I looked through the MacPix.
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:38.880]   I couldn't find it.
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:39.880]   It's called Playback Pro.
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:40.880]   I don't think so.
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:44.240]   And it is this-- so it's a silly app.
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:47.600]   But it is what everybody uses that are doing big presentations
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:48.680]   and what a lot of people use.
[01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:51.640]   So if you're doing a-- if you want to play back video,
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:53.400]   all it does is it plays back video.
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.440]   It plays it back great.
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:56.720]   And it always works.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:58.440]   And you can build playlists and play them back.
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:59.760]   You can put transitions in there.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:03.080]   You can decide you want them to freeze or not.
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:06.440]   And the website is really nasty.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:09.480]   It's built in 1999.
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:11.720]   DT video labs is the ones that make it.
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:14.680]   And it's not a particularly pretty application.
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:16.960]   But it is-- but I just have to say,
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:19.720]   when every stage event that I go to now,
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:23.000]   when they're either using one called Lookout or Playback Pro.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.640]   And Playback Pro is, I think, it's
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:28.280]   like $300 for the base version and $600 or $700
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:31.720]   for the plus version, which is what we use.
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:35.880]   And then-- but Lookout is like $30,000.
[01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:38.280]   And so it's like a whole different--
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:40.480]   And to be honest with you, we have more trouble
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.520]   with people using Lookout than Playback Pro
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:43.760]   because Playback Pro is simple.
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:45.000]   And it just does what it does.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.200]   And it does it really well.
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.560]   You can set your ins and outs.
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:49.560]   You can set it to loop.
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:52.600]   And also, it takes over your second monitor.
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:55.000]   So you can just tell it what resolution you're sending it
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.920]   out as.
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.680]   And so if you're looking for a very professional way
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:02.360]   to play stuff for presentations or play it
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:05.440]   into your switcher or something if you're doing a podcast
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:08.760]   or a live event and you want to play stuff into the live event,
[01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:10.000]   it's just a great piece of software.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.520]   So anyway, and I said, I think it is about an Alex
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:14.720]   for the Playback Pro plus, I think.
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:15.960]   700 is an Alex.
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:16.960]   Yeah.
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:19.920]   So have you looked at Logic Pro 10 yet?
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:21.360]   Came out last week, $200.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.960]   So I haven't looked at it yet because my main computer here
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:25.360]   is still on an older operating system.
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:26.200]   I can't download it.
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:27.360]   And so I couldn't download it.
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:29.200]   I'm going to put it on another computer and by next week
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:30.200]   I'll have some opinions.
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:32.080]   I think it looks great on the surface.
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:33.280]   Yeah, I haven't been able to play with it,
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:35.120]   but I'm going to get my son to mess with it.
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:37.040]   I just-- when I was traveling, last week,
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:38.800]   I couldn't get it downloaded.
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.200]   So I'm going to download it while I'm here.
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:42.200]   Yeah, it's like 40 gigs.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:43.400]   Oh, that wasn't the problem.
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.400]   It was literally just that I just didn't have a computer
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:46.640]   that I could put it on.
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:50.600]   I keep older operating systems because some of our live events,
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:51.720]   some of the software can be.
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:54.040]   I'd like to have two versions of everything.
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:57.400]   Mr. Renee Ritchie from iMore.com, what's your pick of the week?
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:00.960]   So I too have two smaller picks, one for iOS, one for OS 10.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:04.320]   The one for iOS is called Bug Shot.
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.240]   It's Marco Armand's weekend project
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:09.960]   where he was doing a lot of bug reporting for iOS 7 apps.
[01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:13.120]   And he wanted a quick way, almost a sketch-like way to do it.
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.680]   So with this, you have a screenshot.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:20.080]   And you can very quickly just annotate a line
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:25.040]   or you can choose a box and put a box over what you want to do.
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:28.120]   And if you have any personal information or naughty bits
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:32.360]   that you want to cover, you can very quickly put a blur mask on it.
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:33.360]   And then you just share it.
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.800]   So if you see an error in iOS 7 rendering or anything
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.640]   on any app that you're either working on as a developer
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:42.040]   or are a consumer of and want to report to the developer,
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:44.840]   this lets you get in, take a screenshot, annotate it immediately
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:46.400]   and send it back out.
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:49.040]   And it's been very helpful as we were working on our iOS 7
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:49.960]   version of the iMore app.
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:52.440]   And I have a lot of friends who are developers working on it.
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:55.560]   So very quick, very small, very specific app.
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:00.240]   But if you need to do that task, it's excellent for it.
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:03.760]   It was just updated to 1.1, which adds the blur mask
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:06.160]   and fixes a few of the little bugs.
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:07.680]   Is it free?
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:10.960]   It's like 99 cents, I believe.
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:14.160]   One of the coolest parts of that app is the icon.
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:15.080]   Yes.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.960]   Because this-- you want to tell the story, Renee.
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:20.760]   So the icon is a result of a rendering bug
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:21.920]   when he was incorrectly.
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:25.560]   Because of the way that core graphics renders vector shapes,
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:26.400]   it inverted it.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:30.840]   And he decided he liked it so much he kept it as the icon.
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:31.560]   That's good.
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:32.840]   It's a bug, for sure.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:33.880]   That's great.
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:36.200]   Divine ordinance sometimes.
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:38.000]   And what's your second pick?
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.040]   The second pick is--
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:44.040]   there was a Mac app called Little Snitch.
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:45.760]   Yeah, Little Snitch is great.
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:47.760]   And it's been reborn as-- not a little snitch, I think.
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:50.440]   It's been reborn as Ember, either way, from real Mac software.
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:52.680]   So you can-- it's basically a way--
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:54.480]   Oh, Little Snapper, you're talking about it.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:55.320]   Little Snapper, yeah.
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:55.820]   Yeah.
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:57.040]   I had sketch on my brain.
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:59.200]   Yeah, Little Snapper is so cool.
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:00.560]   And this is their new thing.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:02.600]   This is the next generation, the new version.
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:03.640]   It just came out today.
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.880]   It's on the Mac App Store now.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.560]   You take all your photos.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:11.920]   It's just a super fast, super good way of doing whatever
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:13.920]   used to do with Little Snapper, but in the next generation
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:14.200]   sense.
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:16.120]   It's a screenshot tool, kind of.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:18.160]   Yeah, so it's a way to kind of take all your photos.
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.440]   It's beyond screenshots now.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:21.600]   It's just almost all the photos you want.
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:24.400]   And scrapbook them journal and put them in a place.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:28.360]   Quickly annotate them, share them, organize them, find them.
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:31.680]   And it's got that real Mac does clear.
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.720]   They do-- I found a really good software.
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:38.160]   And this is that same sort of attention
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:41.640]   to detail and user interface brought to the scrapbooking
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:43.240]   photo collection space.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:43.680]   Very nice.
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:45.400]   I've only played with it for a couple hours today,
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:46.680]   but I had a lot of fun with it.
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:49.720]   I think Don McAllister recommended Little Snapper.
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:51.120]   I was looking for a screenshot program,
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:51.960]   and he recommended that.
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:53.680]   And I'll have to try Ember.
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:56.080]   Well, both these apps-- one of the reasons I was looking
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.400]   to get them out.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:58.080]   No, I believe Ember--
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.040]   This Ember is--
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:35:59.560]   OK.
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:35:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:01.320]   And one of the things is you take screenshots,
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:03.560]   and you intend to go back and do something with them.
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:04.840]   But you forget, and you go back,
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.000]   and why did I take the screenshot?
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.080]   What was wrong with it?
[01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:09.840]   And with both a bug shot and with this,
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:11.960]   you can just quickly put enough stuff into it
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:14.520]   and deal with it immediately that you never have to go back.
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:17.320]   And especially if you're someone like a blogger or a developer
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:20.680]   who accumulates, my photo stream is almost nothing,
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:22.000]   but screenshots right now.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:22.500]   Yeah.
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:24.200]   And you try to look back a week later.
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:25.200]   You have no idea why you took them.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:27.800]   So being able to organize and catalog them rapidly
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:29.240]   is a real life saver.
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:30.560]   People-- it's $50.
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:31.600]   It's a little expensive.
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:33.400]   But people-- and people said the same thing about Little
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:35.920]   Snapper, but I got to tell you, if you were a book author,
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:39.400]   I was doing presentations for Mac Mania.
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:41.560]   If you're doing a lot of screenshots,
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.520]   it was worth every penny of it.
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:44.020]   Yeah.
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:44.520]   Really great.
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:45.720]   If you're getting paid more than--
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:47.320]   if you're getting paid a good salary
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.720]   to do this kind of stuff, your time
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:50.320]   is so much more valuable than your money
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:51.840]   that you will gladly throw.
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:55.920]   $200 for Logic-- we discussed Logic Pro 10 last week.
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:57.320]   And $50 for this.
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:59.040]   Or napkin was the same way for me.
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.000]   I use it every day.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.640]   And the amount of time it saves me
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:04.320]   is so much more than the money that it's equally valuable.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.080]   All right, here we go.
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:08.240]   It's time to try the Leap Motion.
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:09.720]   This is the software's install.
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:11.200]   It says below a few tips.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:11.960]   You plug it in.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:12.960]   It's a USB 3.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.020]   It doesn't have to have a USB 3 port.
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:17.140]   It works on USB 2.
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:19.300]   You put it somewhere in front of your thing.
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:20.540]   So now it's asking me to plug it in.
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:21.620]   Let's see.
[01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:23.700]   I'm going to plug it in to--
[01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:25.220]   are both of these ports USB 3?
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:26.500]   I can't remember on that.
[01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:26.980]   I think they are.
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:28.660]   It doesn't matter, though, supposedly.
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:31.180]   OK, firmware update in progress.
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:33.900]   You may-- OK, now it's doing something.
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:35.300]   It's doing Leap Motion.
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:36.540]   Now the phone's vault.
[01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:38.060]   Ooh.
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:39.740]   Now this one's working, which is nice.
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:41.860]   I couldn't get the other one to do this much.
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:42.960]   This is where it sees.
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:46.060]   To begin wave hand over device, you want it-- yeah.
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:49.780]   That music is great.
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:51.580]   That music is great for waving hands.
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:54.860]   OK, now look, I guess it's doing my hands.
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:56.220]   I'm powered.
[01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.980]   Oh, I see up over here.
[01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:04.540]   You can achieve what you go to sombow.com.
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:05.980]   People like you.
[01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:08.020]   Sombow.com.
[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:09.460]   OK, that's nice.
[01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:10.460]   Now what?
[01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:12.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:16.340]   There's a whole app store associated with this.
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:18.340]   What do I do now, sombow?
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:20.100]   Help me.
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:21.740]   Don't just do this for a while.
[01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:23.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:25.100]   Now, oh, wait.
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:26.020]   You skip step three.
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:27.780]   Get really, really stoned.
[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:29.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:30.940]   I press the escape button.
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:31.900]   OK, good.
[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:32.860]   OK, now we go--
[01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:35.140]   My fingers are touching the computer
[01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:36.980]   without touching it, man.
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:38.140]   There-- and so--
[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:38.620]   What does it mean?
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:40.460]   I should have signed up for this, and I haven't yet.
[01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:41.820]   So I will sign up for this.
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:43.660]   Actually, I think I have a--
[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:44.980]   I'm going to send me a log in.
[01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:47.420]   But anyway, but there are apps, there are games,
[01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:48.700]   and so forth associated with it.
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:49.620]   Yeah, here it is.
[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:50.900]   I don't show this, because I'm going
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:53.980]   to do the special media password here.
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:59.100]   Ah.
[01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:00.620]   Ah.
[01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:01.860]   This is a really cool technology,
[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:05.420]   because I think that given a couple of years,
[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:07.780]   we're all going to be using these interfaces
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:09.060]   with television, with--
[01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:11.060]   There's been a huge amount of interest in this,
[01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:15.700]   and they've raised a ton of money from some very big names.
[01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:17.060]   Yep.
[01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:20.140]   And it just came out yesterday that you could order--
[01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:20.940]   it's not very expensive.
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:23.140]   It's $80.
[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:24.420]   There you go.
[01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:25.780]   And we've all seen, I think--
[01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:28.340]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:30.580]   Oh, I'm supposed to do a sign up, sign into an existing
[01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:31.780]   account, never mind.
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:33.380]   Minority report made manifest.
[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:36.340]   Yeah, we've all seen this video, and I was just very curious
[01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:38.900]   how closely it would tie into this.
[01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:45.060]   It apparently can sit in a pretty flexible number
[01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:45.620]   of places.
[01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:47.580]   It's sitting right now in front of the keyboard for me.
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:52.020]   I just thought--
[01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:54.620]   It's a desktop sort of thing.
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:57.100]   I think I've always been compelled by this technology
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:58.500]   when it's on a big screen.
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:39:59.000]   Right.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.260]   Or you don't want to have a keyboard or a mouse
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:01.140]   or something on your lap.
[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:07.700]   As people get more used to touch interfaces,
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:09.940]   that's going to have to be a key interface.
[01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:12.940]   Pretty much anything that's supposed to be useful or handy.
[01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:15.860]   It's just so natural.
[01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:20.260]   Because everybody has a thumbprint somewhere on the screen
[01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:23.100]   that they put there right after using their iPad for two
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:23.820]   hours.
[01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:25.100]   I think we talked about it.
[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:27.820]   Like my four-year-old godson can use an iPad natively,
[01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:30.540]   and he just wants to know why everything doesn't work that way.
[01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:30.900]   Yeah.
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:31.740]   Soon will.
[01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:32.340]   I will--
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:32.740]   I will--
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:33.240]   I will--
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.940]   I'll use it a little bit next week.
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:37.440]   But there you go.
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:39.480]   You see what's involved in this installation.
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:42.120]   I mean, presumably you could put it in a variety of spots.
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.880]   You could put it up here.
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:45.740]   I'm putting it kind of below the track pad.
[01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:47.760]   I mean, if they should build it into laptops,
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:48.560]   that would be awesome.
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:49.600]   Well, and they've made deals.
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:50.640]   They've made a lot of deals.
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:54.000]   If you look at the people that they have made deals with,
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.920]   it looks like they're going places here.
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:59.000]   It does look like a cheaper way to make something like a TV
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.600]   to be interactive than making the screen--
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.440]   because you don't want to touch the screen anyway.
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:03.940]   Right.
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:04.600]   That's gross.
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:06.520]   Put it in the hot tub right in front of the big screen TV,
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.720]   and you got a Super Bowl party.
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:10.840]   So the idea is you can navigate, browse the web,
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:12.840]   flip through photos, mold 3D objects.
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:14.840]   It was actually created by a guy who did 3D design.
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:17.880]   He said, why is it so hard to do it in Blender
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:20.200]   compared to, say, actual clay?
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:22.360]   And so he wanted to make something where you could go like that.
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:24.200]   I would think that you'd be kind of interested in that.
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:27.960]   I was funny in the mid '90s, late '90s.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:30.040]   I was at SGI, and they actually had something
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:30.920]   that you put goggles on.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:31.760]   And you could--
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:31.760]   Right.
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:32.280]   --gloves on.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:32.960]   Right.
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:35.720]   And you could model.
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:38.360]   It was kind of an R&D. But a lot of people
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.800]   have been thinking about that for a long time.
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:41.520]   And it's been--
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:42.320]   it'll be interesting.
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:43.680]   What you really need at that point
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:46.880]   is you very quickly want to have some kind of sensory input.
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:48.680]   So you almost want gloves.
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:50.720]   Because you want to be able to have them--
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:52.320]   you want to feel when you're touching something.
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:53.520]   Yeah.
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:56.920]   But as part of this nostalgia for this specific task,
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:00.040]   because there's a generation of artists
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:02.480]   that they never really whacked clay.
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:06.160]   They natively learned how to build models of things digitally.
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:09.360]   And they might think, why would I want to do this when I can actually
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.400]   just have more precision and set my control points?
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:12.280]   It's dirty.
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:13.280]   It's actually--
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:14.600]   I mean, I've done a lot of modeling.
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:15.120]   That's right.
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:15.920]   I'm dead.
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:17.360]   Most of my modeling has been digitally.
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:18.360]   Not with clay.
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:19.360]   Not with clay.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.120]   I can't walk.
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:21.960]   Most of my modeling in our guys.
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:25.120]   And the problem is, in 3D, it's really--
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:26.880]   there's a lot of times when you get into something
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:29.600]   where you think you can think about what you want to create.
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:32.280]   But actually creating it with the tools that you have.
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:34.000]   Sometimes you just really want to just grab onto it,
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.480]   move it, especially organic stuff.
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:36.760]   You want direct manipulation.
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:39.360]   Yeah, you want to be able to just grab on and just play
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:40.120]   with the idea.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:43.080]   And I think that that is going to be definitely a future.
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:44.320]   And there's definitely great apps,
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:46.760]   whether it's Mudbox or ZBrush.
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.640]   I mean, those are ones where you're really paying it.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:51.160]   But really what gets in the way is the interface.
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:54.520]   Ultimately, the interface is that mirror actual reality
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:57.160]   and actual the way humans actually interact with the real world
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:59.320]   are always going to win out over the abstract ones
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:00.400]   that we're using as weird tools.
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:01.800]   At least at the start.
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:04.680]   At some point in time, the abstract tools definitely
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:09.000]   give you advantages over the--
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.040]   because there are abstract things that you have to think about.
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:12.880]   Like, for instance, when you're building--
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:16.720]   we had to build-- we built these for a big movie.
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:18.960]   I built these round things, round sauces
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:20.920]   that a whole bunch of people were sitting on in the center
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:22.400]   of Rotunda.
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:25.440]   And what you had to do is the thing
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:27.360]   is you have to get them perfectly smooth.
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:29.880]   And so using the calculations of alias--
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:32.080]   we use a program that used to design cars.
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:34.840]   And you have to create these really, really long curves.
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:36.720]   And really, the only way to do that is abstractly.
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:40.120]   You could never get that perfect without letting
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:41.720]   the computer do it for you.
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:42.240]   All right.
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:44.600]   I'm going to play something called Shim Sham,
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:46.360]   the legend of jazz hands.
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:48.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:49.920]   Jazz hands, Leo.
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:52.920]   This is the problem is I don't have any idea what I'm
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:55.480]   supposed to do.
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.480]   Nice job.
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:59.680]   Don't quit.
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:00.680]   What am I doing?
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:02.600]   I think you're just trying to select something right now.
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:04.920]   Yeah, it says nice job every time I do that.
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:08.400]   Which gesture reforments your hard drive, Leo?
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:09.400]   A single finger gesture.
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:14.440]   This is the problem I have with Connect, too, right?
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:18.240]   Is it's like, well, it's not yet quite intuitive.
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:19.600]   There's a cursor there.
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:22.440]   Yeah, I see my cursor.
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:23.520]   What am I supposed to do?
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:25.640]   Now, open your hand.
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:26.400]   Oh, you kids.
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:27.920]   You get it.
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:29.360]   Now what?
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:31.600]   I think you moved your hand when you opened it.
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:32.880]   Oh.
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:33.280]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:34.800]   Now I'm going to pick--
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:35.280]   Now you quit.
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:36.480]   Oh, this is a jazz music.
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:37.240]   I get it.
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:39.520]   So I just pick Coleman Hawkins.
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:40.800]   And now I go like this.
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:45.160]   Oh, jazz hands.
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:45.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:46.080]   See, wait a minute.
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:47.400]   My hands are doing something.
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:51.800]   I don't know what they're doing.
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:53.400]   That's exactly the user experience
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:54.880]   that every engineer hopes for us.
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.640]   I'm doing something with the app.
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:58.640]   I don't know what, but I'm so sure to--
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:44:59.840]   Welcome back to being a newborn.
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.520]   My hands are doing something like a newborn.
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:02.520]   I can't control the interface.
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:03.920]   What is going on?
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:07.120]   Anyway, so it works.
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:09.920]   The issue is, what the hell you--
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:11.680]   It's not used to being a newborn.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:12.160]   I'm not.
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:13.600]   It's like being a newborn.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:15.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:16.600]   Wow.
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:17.600]   OK.
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:19.240]   Yeah, this is a jazz program.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:20.160]   Oh, you can use your mouse.
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:21.000]   So that makes it easier.
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.000]   Let's see.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.240]   That's kind of-- let's do some Benny Goodman.
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:26.280]   OK.
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:26.920]   Start.
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:30.600]   I got to get one hand in position.
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:33.520]   Maybe I'm just overthinking it probably, right?
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:34.800]   We should get a newborn.
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:35.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:36.680]   A newborn would pick this up.
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:38.600]   My kids, even some of those two or three
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:39.720]   could probably pick this up and start by--
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:41.200]   Use the forest, Leo.
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:43.880]   Is your right hand competing with your butt down?
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:45.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:46.880]   I don't know.
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:50.200]   Maybe a pillow is trapped inside a glass box.
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:51.160]   Things are happening.
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:52.480]   But I don't understand.
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:53.600]   Try one handed.
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:55.360]   I do feel like a kid.
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:57.400]   Oh, maybe I should play against another person.
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:04.840]   Does it matter that it's not dead, like dead parallel
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:05.920]   to the screen?
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:06.800]   That's turned a little bit--
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:08.040]   supposedly it all stands down.
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:08.560]   --down all of that.
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:09.040]   Oh, really?
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:09.880]   OK.
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:11.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:13.160]   It's head ready.
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:15.520]   But you got to can't keep it there.
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:17.720]   So it's very connect-like.
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:20.000]   It's like playing a video game before you put the quarter
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:20.720]   in the old day.
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:22.520]   Things just move and you think you're controlling.
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:24.360]   All right, I give up.
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:30.520]   Anyway, there's quite a few programs in the store.
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:32.080]   You want to try molecules?
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:32.840]   How many theramans?
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:33.760]   I don't know about that.
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:36.080]   I bet theramans are like the flashlight
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:37.360]   app sort of iOS.
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:38.720]   Theramans are to this device.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:44.960]   So now I can rotate the thing by doing Zoom.
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:47.040]   OK, rotate Zoom.
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:48.960]   You're going to have leap learned of helplessness,
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:50.040]   certainly, Leo.
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:51.200]   I'm actually--
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:53.520]   I feel like a newborn.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:54.760]   How does the world work?
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:55.200]   There you go.
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:56.960]   That's my pick of the week.
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:57.600]   Enjoy it.
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:00.040]   Hey, it's only $80.
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:01.520]   It's like 10th of an Alex.
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:01.960]   There you go.
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:03.120]   Think of it that way.
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:05.720]   The temptation to say every 10 seconds--
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:07.680]   These out the droids are looking for.
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:09.320]   What I need to do--
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:10.720]   literally, you saw me open it up.
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:12.320]   And so I haven't-- here's cut the rope.
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:13.480]   Maybe I can figure out.
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:15.280]   Let's make a game where you just Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:17.400]   You just run through things and all you do is just wave over it.
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:19.040]   Open door and die.
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.480]   This does remind me of corrects.
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:20.920]   By dying, yes.
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:24.200]   OK, so play.
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:25.320]   Yes, he's hard.
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:25.680]   And then I--
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:26.840]   First you're sleeping.
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:27.480]   Well, as a new--
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:28.680]   Ding, dogs.
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:32.680]   My last guy, I shall become only more powerful, dog.
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:35.480]   So my-- so yeah, you could say--
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:36.200]   I don't know how you--
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:37.000]   Is just a finger?
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:42.040]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:43.400]   You should have that doint sound.
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:44.120]   Doint?
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:44.640]   OK.
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:45.800]   That's a leap master.
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:48.640]   Now, quickly slide your finger in the air
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:49.640]   to cut the rope.
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:53.080]   Maybe I'll use my left hand.
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:58.080]   See, there's the thing.
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:00.800]   So my finger is controlling that mouse, as you see.
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:02.480]   That's cool.
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:03.240]   And then what do I do?
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:04.440]   I point.
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:06.200]   I just leave it there.
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:06.720]   All right.
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:12.800]   I mean, you should have handed that.
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:14.440]   Oh, you're right.
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:16.000]   You're smarter than a five-year-old.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000]   Karate Tophan Leo.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.320]   You got a changed state.
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:26.000]   Anyway.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.280]   It's really a question of how long before you punch the screen,
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:30.880]   I think.
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:32.200]   Here's your gesture recognized.
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:32.880]   You've got the idea.
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:34.560]   I think I'm going to spend more time with it
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:35.080]   in some day.
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:36.640]   It will all make sense to me.
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:38.960]   But this is the problem with new UIs.
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:41.120]   I mean, this is Windows 8 at large.
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:43.600]   I mean, it's-- you know UI, people got to learn a new UI.
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:45.720]   But I do just take it home and have my kids play with it.
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:47.560]   They'll know it in five minutes.
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:48.680]   You want to-- we'll get a kid.
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:49.320]   We got a kid here.
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:51.200]   We'll have her try it.
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:53.120]   But I bet she'll get it right like that.
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:56.120]   And she'll program our VCR.
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:58.080]   I'm basically at the blinking 12 stage.
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:48:58.680]   That's what I am.
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:48:59.840]   Explaining to the geezers.
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:00.400]   Yeah.
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:01.920]   Explaining it to me.
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:03.000]   Hey, thank you for joining us.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.320]   I hope you enjoyed Mac Break Weekly.

[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:10.920]   And of course, are you still doing the talk vision thing?
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:12.920]   We're on Talk Mobile's On Break this week.
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:15.040]   And then next week, we'll be back with security
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:16.040]   and enterprise.
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:19.360]   And we're going to try to make it the least sleep-inducing
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:21.360]   security enterprise segment ever created by man.
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:22.520]   That's a good goal.

[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:27.000]   Always a pleasure.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.520]   Mr. Alex Lindsey heads off for--
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:31.280]   I'm attempting to stay home for two weeks.
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:31.800]   Home.
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:32.320]   Wow.
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:32.800]   Wow.
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:33.400]   That's the fun goal.
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:34.000]   Home.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.160]   That's exactly what you're saying.
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:36.120]   You know, I was talking about Johnny Jet, our travel expert
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:37.440]   on the radio show.
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:38.520]   And I think he's beat you.
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:40.160]   He hasn't been-- he hadn't been home.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:41.480]   He just got home this weekend.
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:43.240]   Hadn't been home for 55 days.
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:44.280]   No, I don't do that.
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:45.280]   He literally--
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:46.120]   I mean, I just-- I could.
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:46.640]   But I know--
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:47.320]   He was in Africa.
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:48.520]   He was in everywhere.
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:52.480]   Canada, he was sailing down the Danube.
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:53.640]   All in one trip.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:54.120]   No, I don't do that.
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:54.720]   It's crazy.
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:56.120]   I do lots of little trips.
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:58.880]   But I haven't been home for more than 10 days.
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:49:59.920]   That's your fair and a half.
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:00.120]   Yeah.
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:01.320]   He'll probably be home for a couple weeks.
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:01.920]   So I'm trying to--
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:02.160]   Good.
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:02.960]   Two weeks.
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:03.400]   I'm working on--
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:03.920]   This is your vacation.
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:04.480]   I lost my goal.
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:05.600]   Vacation is being home.
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:07.160]   Yeah, it's working on rather than--
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:08.680]   I love it.
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:10.200]   We thank Mr. Mike Elgin.
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:11.160]   Always a pleasure, Mike.
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:13.760]   You're hitting the road next week, Florence.
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:14.160]   Florence?
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:15.920]   I will fax you a slice of pizza.
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:16.200]   Good.
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:17.360]   And I hope you have somewhere--
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:19.040]   how do you get your places, Airbnb?
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:19.680]   Or what do you do?
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:22.280]   My wife does a lot of searching.
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:23.720]   She usually uses Airbnb.
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:25.920]   We found this one on Craigslist, if you can do that.
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:30.480]   And just looks for a good deal, gets a monthly or twice
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:31.120]   monthly rate.
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:32.800]   Does she ask about internet access?
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:33.320]   Always.
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:35.160]   And that's a minimum-- first thing she asks,
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:36.480]   it has to have good Wi-Fi.
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:37.120]   Oh, good.
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:38.880]   And that's it.
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:40.640]   And so we look for good deals.
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.640]   We tend to go to places where it's off-season.
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:44.880]   So right now, everybody flees Florence.
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:45.800]   It's too hot.
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:46.280]   It's too hot.
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:49.000]   And so we have a really, really nice--
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.200]   it's not really nice, but it's in a really good location.
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:53.640]   It's in the old part of the city.
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:55.560]   And so it's going to be--
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:56.560]   wonderful.
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:57.120]   Awesome.
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:57.800]   Looking forward to it.
[01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:58.600]   Have a great time.
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:50:59.360]   Thank you.
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:01.360]   And because you have good Wi-Fi,
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:02.520]   we hope we will have you still--
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:03.000]   Thank you.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.080]   --as a regular contributor on all of our shows.
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:05.560]   Love to do it.
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:10.280]   You can read Mike's work at the Cult of Mac, Cult of Android,
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:12.560]   the Pewter World, and of course, the best place to follow him
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:14.920]   on Google+, that's where he posts a lot.
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:15.440]   A lot of lots.
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:15.940]   Yes.
[01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:17.280]   Yep.
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:19.160]   If you haven't circled Mike yet on Google+,
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:21.520]   you're missing out on some of the best content there.
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:24.000]   Andy Inaco, from the Chicago Sun Times,
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.280]   he's currently reviewing the X-camera phone.
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:31.000]   When will we see a review of that in the print medium?
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.760]   Oh, we will see it online.
[01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:34.920]   And elsewhere tomorrow afternoon, I believe.
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:35.440]   All right.
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:37.080]   I've got lots of media to put together.
[01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:37.680]   Excellent.
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:41.320]   As usual, as I'm preparing my final draft, I'm thinking,
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:44.080]   ooh, if I finish early, maybe I can shoot some video,
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:45.840]   and then 3.30 in the mornings and be,
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:48.200]   I really don't want to shoot video.
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:49.520]   I want to go to sleep now.
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:50.600]   Flash is weak.
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:53.480]   By the way, Mike did a great auto awesome animated GIF
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:55.320]   just now of me doing the Leap Motion.
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:56.800]   You did that with--
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:59.240]   what is-- was your iPhone?
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:51:59.800]   Yeah.
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:04.120]   I use an iPhone app called Fast Camera.
[01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:06.600]   And you can set it up to take 10 shots a second or something
[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:07.000]   like that.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.480]   Google Plus will see that as--
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:08.980]   Right.
[01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:10.560]   --burst as a front-auto awesome.
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:11.040]   Exactly.
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:13.640]   Just upload between 6 and 15 or whatever it is,
[01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:15.360]   pictures that are very similar, and it'll
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:16.840]   create an animated GIF.
[01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:20.680]   And of course, you're using the Oculus, right?
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:21.360]   Or what is it called?
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:21.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:22.640]   The--
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:23.320]   All-O-Clip.
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:23.840]   All-O-Clip.
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:24.440]   Exactly.
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:25.200]   That's why it's a little shy.
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:26.600]   All these are a wonderful thing to use.
[01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:27.580]   Beautiful.
[01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:28.520]   That really came out well.
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:29.640]   I recommend that once a month.
[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:30.480]   Love the all-o-clip.
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:32.320]   That really came out well.
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:33.680]   All right.
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:35.040]   I'll plus it right now.
[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:35.880]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:36.880]   We do--
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:37.560]   We do that for--
[01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:39.040]   Apollo 12 appearance about it.
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:39.960]   It does, doesn't it?
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:43.720]   I feel like I'm in zero gravity demonstrating the leap.
[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:44.220]   Sorry.
[01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:45.220]   Go ahead.
[01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:45.720]   Mm.
[01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:51.640]   We do this show 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern Time,
[01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:53.520]   and I'm 19 under UTC on Tuesdays.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:54.960]   I hope you'll watch live.
[01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:56.200]   We love having the chatroom here.
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:59.600]   And as you can see, we refer to the chatroom a lot.
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:01.560]   If you can't, though, on-demand audio and video
[01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:05.640]   available after the fact at twi--tv/MBW
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:07.240]   for Mac break weekly.
[01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:09.120]   And that's one way you can get it,
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:09.960]   but there are lots of other ways.
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:14.840]   Anywhere you get podcasts, InstaCast Dogcatcher, Pocket,
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:18.680]   Cast, Apple's Podcasts app, and of course iTunes
[01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:19.520]   in the Zoom store.
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:21.040]   We're everywhere you want to be.
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:24.560]   If you subscribe, hint, hint, then don't just get it every week
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:25.480]   when it comes out.
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:26.280]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:28.680]   Now get back to work because break time is over.
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:31.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:34.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:37.260]   (upbeat music)
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:39.260]   You
