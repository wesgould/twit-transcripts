[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee Richie, Andy and Aco, Alex Lindsey. We're all in house.
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.640]   Well, I guess as much as you ever get in house these days, they're all on Zoom. I'm in house.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:18.240]   To talk about WWDC, we have a date, the new iOS versions, what they fixed, and why you're
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.040]   going to absolutely want to install them as soon as possible. And Apple in China looks like they're
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.040]   cooperating with the Chinese government, but they didn't have to. Should they have? It's all coming
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:41.280]   up next. On Mac Break Weekly. Podcasts you love. From people you trust. This is Twitter.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:51.280]   This is Mac Break Weekly, Episode 759, recorded Tuesday, March 30, 2021.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.800]   Colombo said it first. It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Let's find out what's going on with Apple.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.640]   Absolutely nothing. But we'll talk about it anyway with Renee Richie, YouTube.com.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.400]   Oh, that's Renee Richie. He's changed his look. He's grown some sideburns. We have the right
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.440]   lower third, but the wrong picture. I don't know what's going on here, but you know who,
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.480]   you know who that was. That was Andy and Aco, WGBH of Boston. This here is Renee Richie,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.040]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie. And over in the corner, in the in the in the bad boy spot,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:33.120]   it's Mr. Alex Lindsay from Office Hours. We're still okay. Something's going on. There we go.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.920]   No, no, that was that was a good impulse because you said bad boy. And I'm known as being
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:50.400]   through the bad boy, the maverick, the untamed horse. The truth to power voice of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.360]   There I said it.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.920]   Fungible Andy, non-fungible Andy, NFA.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.760]   Yeah, there is one big piece of news, which is that Apple has announced WWDC. And
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.960]   you know, this is, you know, it's funny. We're right at the crux as we were
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.000]   around this time a year ago. Should it be virtual? Should it be real? What should we do? And they've
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.160]   announced virtue, I think making the right choice of virtual WWDC.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.280]   I think it makes a lot of sense to get ahead of that and just say, this is what we're going to
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.320]   do until we know what's happening. It's a sane choice. I think a lot of folks, as you pointed
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.160]   out that having a virtual conference is good in many ways forever after. For instance, there's
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.600]   always been with developer conferences, not just Apple's, but everybody's. This scramble for tickets
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.800]   because there's never enough real life spaces, plus the expense, non-trivial expense of flying
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.080]   to, you know, Cupertino and getting in a hotel and all that stuff. And while some developers can do
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.320]   that, there's a giant globe of developers that can't. And so I think this is much more inclusive.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.360]   Make it stream. If you want to do live and stream, I wouldn't be against that down the road.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.000]   Mint it. The whole thing. Just make it a giant NFT for WWDC and we will be a trendy as can be.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.520]   Yeah. No, this is the great thing. It was the only fair thing to do because, believe it or not,
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.480]   I don't think they can guarantee that anybody who wants to get into WWDC will have had an
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.400]   opportunity to get a vaccine by June. This is the same way. But also, when you look at another way,
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.920]   now they will have done two of these completely remotely. They're going to get so good at running
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.480]   specifically this event remotely that I would be shocked if 2022 were anything like 2019.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.480]   I mean, there's always going to be the value in having a human component there, having
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.800]   a gathering of people and the energy that gets that creates when you put lots and lots of humans
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.160]   together for greater for worse. But I think that we're going to see an idea where, hey, we can make
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.560]   this a global event as opposed to congratulations, the 5,000 of you who get to have those really cool
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.080]   denim jackets, the rest of you will stream some of it.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.040]   That feels like democratic, right? If there are some people who have the money and the
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.760]   will to make the trip to Cupertino, they get special treatment. It feels a little undemocratic.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.720]   You, Alex, you've been arguing for virtual for a long time. For a couple of years.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.920]   I think that the thing is we've been really defining the future of events into four categories.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:34.400]   One is all physical. You just all get together, have a barbecue, or a kind of a high VIP type thing.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.280]   The second being all digital or all virtual. That's just everybody's everywhere. That's what we've
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.600]   been doing for the last year. Then the two that are really popping up are the hybrids and what
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:51.200]   we call digital first. Digital first is hybrid is there's people in there's an audience.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.560]   It's what we when we streamed an event that was what we were doing hybrid events.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.400]   There's people in the audience. People applauding in the audience. The live feeling is nice.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.920]   Even for people not live. The digital first thing. The digital first is really what we think is
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.320]   going to be the future, which is that you don't actually put the speakers very often or ever in
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.720]   the audience. You put them in a studio. You put them like what we're doing here, where everybody's
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.120]   in an individual location. The audiences can be either at their home, but they could also be
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.120]   in an auditorium or in many auditoriums. By taking the speaker out of the hybrid version,
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.600]   by putting the speaker in a place where they can really do a direct address. It means that
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:37.840]   everybody at every location, including the phone, has an equal experience. They all have an equal
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:44.400]   experience. If you look at a place with 5,000 people or 1,500 people in the room,
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.280]   you're looking at the screen. You're not looking at the person.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.440]   The person's dead at the stage, unless you're in the first 10 rows. It's really small.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.160]   Anyway, the idea is just put them on the screen. Just put them on that LED. Then you don't have to
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.800]   worry about all the meringue and everything else at the LED because there's nobody there.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:06.160]   We think that the digital first events are going to be the thing that become
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:13.760]   the new, the future, where you suddenly have, I think we're going to see events that have
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:20.800]   half a million people. There'll be 3,000 in New York and 1,000 in LA. You'll still have the
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.360]   handshaking and the hallway conversations and the dinners and all those other things.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.240]   People won't have to travel to get there. They'll just go to their local, whatever. That is,
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:37.920]   there's 200 in Chicago and 100 in Lagos and 600 in Hyderabad. All of them are going to have
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.680]   an experience of each other in their local community. Some of them will travel back and forth.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.480]   A lot of them are going to be able to also watch it at home. I think that what we've learned is that
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.920]   the market is so large when you don't make people travel. What we see in events over and over and
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:59.120]   over again is that these events are way bigger when you don't have to either have a limited number
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.720]   of people that could come, obviously, or just force people to disrupt their life to go to the
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.680]   event. More people show up. The numbers have been typically three to five times as many people
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.400]   are showing up for a lot of these events. There's also an opportunity to lower the price when you
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.920]   have that many more people. You can actually lower the price for a lot of these things
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.040]   and increase the margin because it doesn't cost you nearly the same amount as it did to
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.360]   support our physical person. It's funny because now that we've done both and we know how to do
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:33.040]   both effectively, now we can choose what makes the most sense. The one that makes you that instead
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.440]   of just need your going back to the good old days. The one that makes the least amount of sense
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.560]   is hybrid, which is what everyone keeps on talking about. It feels like the worst idea.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.400]   I don't like it because it feels a little like people in the room get the pins and jackets.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.080]   If you're online or even in an overflow room, you're basically at the kitty table.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.520]   Exactly. You're just looking up and you're left out.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.720]   No one wants to be at the kitty table.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:00.400]   The thing is that what I noticed was even if you have two people in a studio talking to each other,
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:06.080]   interacting, you immediately are put outside of it when we do fully digital events. What you end up
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.720]   with is the audience gets to be part of a conversation, but they get to stand right in the middle
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:16.160]   virtually and be spoken to from both sides. It's a much more powerful experience.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.560]   Do you feel labs Alex? What could they do to make the labs better? Because they were still
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.760]   constrained last year for labs and having to do over WebEx and things like that.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:28.880]   If you give engineers the ability to, for instance, share a screen. If they wanted to share the
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.360]   screen like this, and then you gave them the ability to circle things and talk about things.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:42.640]   Being able to do this, being able to identify things and draw different pieces of what you're
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.600]   trying to explain to them. You can actually do most of it. I will argue that it is easier to do
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.040]   the labs than an environment like that. He's doing illustrating of a screen.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.040]   Developers just want to yell about their bugs, right?
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.040]   The developer wants to be there in your face.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.560]   But he's also hands on with hardware you don't get. There are some things.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.480]   Yeah, but most of the labs, I mean, most of the labs that there are not hardware, most of the labs
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.880]   are developed. They're talking about a whiteboard. Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.320]   There's developers with the looking at software. But that's to be to see other Apple events are
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:18.400]   about hardware. Right. Well, I mean, as far as the launch events, if you're talking about that,
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.960]   I think that I think that Apple will do the same thing with everything or maybe not, maybe they'll
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:28.160]   say. Well, I guess what I would say for a launch event is eventually when they bring people back to
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.760]   Steve Jobs Theater, if it was me, I'd play them a movie and then let them go play with the hardware.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.960]   I know you said that before.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.320]   I was just like, it's just like, like, but you've advocated that even in education, right?
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.000]   You said, get the best teacher, have record the lecture.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.640]   The Lindsey Cut.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:47.120]   Or you'll never do it again. The Lindsey Cut. And then everything in person is
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.640]   well, homework and help and tutorials and stuff like that.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:57.280]   Yeah. What I mean, what I've been learning over, you know, a couple thousand hours of office hours
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.600]   is the- By the way, that was just this week. I just want to imagine.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:07.920]   Yeah. Yeah. So the is, you know, there are a couple different things when it comes to
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:14.000]   engaging people in this process. One is short, not a big, long lecture, but short movies that
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.480]   describe concepts that you don't understand and that you need to do. And then the ability to,
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.040]   you know, have some asymmetrical discussion on, you know, we use Discord inside of office hours.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.760]   We've got a thousand people in there. So at any given time, there's a couple hundred that are
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:31.520]   talking. And then that's how a lot of these MOOCs do it. They'll have a lecture, but then they'll
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:36.320]   have TAs do shorting, you know, the problem is that the lectures are horrible. So I mean,
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.920]   I want, I looked at a lot of these and the thing is it's a camera, you know, it's someone doing
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.320]   their traditional lecture, which was bad when we went to school.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:48.240]   I'm really aware of Harvard CS50, which is their number one course at Harvard 800 undergrad.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.080]   Freshman usually take it every year. It's a shared course with Harvard at MIT. It's their
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.960]   introduction to computing. And I'm aware of it, especially now, because I'm, I've been mentoring
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.720]   a high school senior who wanted to take computer science. They didn't have it as school. So he
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.360]   asked me and I said, okay, we're going to work through CS50. That's beautifully shot. It's actually
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.000]   shot in a theater. That's so that they're the ones cutting the cutting the new ground. And then they
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.880]   have TAs doing little pickups of pieces. So if you need, I need more, it's really, it strikes me.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:22.640]   And you can see it at CS50.harvard.edu, or you can EDX has it, which is Harvard's MOOC
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:28.560]   thing they set up with MIT. You can, you can see how well that works. And they've really,
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.520]   and I think Harvard, especially because, hey, they've got billions of dollars in their
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:39.200]   diamond, but they really were trying to address this issue of not having students in school
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.600]   this year. So they've taken it to another level. And now that they've done it, I see no
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:49.440]   reason not to do it that way. Yeah, no, it's great. Yeah. And I think CS50 Stanford has a couple
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:55.600]   courses that they're doing across the whole screen. Well, they're doing some other ethics
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.200]   courses and so on and so forth with hundreds of students at a time on a screen where the teachers
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.480]   can interact with any of them. And they're, you know, it's all animated. Yeah, so they do it.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.800]   CS50, they have, they'll throw up. I mean, they're 800 kids, so you only can get whatever it is,
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.160]   15 on a screen. But they'll throw that up. And it's funny. You see all the kids and some of them
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.200]   in the dorm room, some are clearly at home, some are adults. And then they raise their hands,
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.360]   which is hysterical. And then he calls on them and they'll ask and they go full screen,
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.520]   they ask a question. So you get a lot of the kind of in-person interactivity.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.800]   I think it's really interesting to see how and I know you more than anyone are solving these issues.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.320]   Yeah, I mean, I think we're going to see a lot more of, you know, we're going to go back to
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.240]   what we're a lot of people are now that they're going, some of my friends are going back to
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.840]   offices and stuff like that. And they're like, yeah, what's not as good as I remember it.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:49.360]   It's kind of like, it's kind of like, it's like, the traffic, I don't like sitting in cars and the
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.720]   traffic is kind of, you know, I think that there was a Harvard study actually that came out that said
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:59.040]   15, they talked to 1500 people and I think it's 81% would like to go to partial work at, you know,
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.560]   partially going to the office or not going to the office at all. There's only 18% that want to go
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:08.000]   back to where it was before. So I think that you're, I think we're going to see a big shift that may
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.200]   not happen immediately. People are going to, and the same thing with events, people are going to
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.160]   jump back and try to do something that they used to do. And they're going to remember that they're
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:21.200]   going to start realizing that it's not what they remember. And also, fundamentally, the ROI on
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.240]   virtual events is so much higher than the ROI that the pencil, you know, the folks that are
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.720]   penciling out the costs and the returns are going to, I think, move more and more towards digital
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.840]   first events because they just, they're, they just have a higher return, you know, on whatever,
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.680]   whatever that investment is, they're going to have a higher return. Now we turn to the semiotics.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:47.040]   I didn't get an invitation, but I do have the WWDC DC page. No invitations. No invitations. So first
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:54.160]   of all, it's a play on the Craig Fitteregge glow of the Macintosh shot from the announcement of the
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:01.520]   M1 ships. That really has become iconic. In this case, it's a young woman of an emoji. What do they
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.880]   call them? There's like three or four you can cycle between. Somehow, somehow, I think we're
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:11.520]   going to have, we're going to have yet another emoji update. Yeah, somehow, glow and behold, I
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:17.440]   love the, I love the name for WWDC 21 glow and behold, get it glow, see the glow. She's looking
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:24.800]   at a MacBook Air. She's wearing, I don't know if this is, this is, I'll refresh it, Renee, so we
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.920]   can see some other ones, but this one's wearing glasses with no temples, interestingly. They're
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.680]   all like, they're all wearing glasses. They all have no temples. They all have icons on their glasses.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.720]   Ah, of course, the icon is reflecting the calendar. Let me do a refresh and see if I can get it.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:43.920]   If I refresh, will I get a different one? Yeah, there's like three different ones. That's the same
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.920]   one. Same one, but it's cool. There's an older gentleman and a young guy with either hearing aids
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:54.560]   or headphones. Oh, is the guy from op in it? Try to do a command R maybe try apple.com and scroll
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.520]   down or do a command. Do it. Do it. Refresh. Yeah, it might be I'm doing a shift refresh,
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:03.360]   which is supposed to hard refresh, but it doesn't, it doesn't. So that's okay. I get it.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:09.840]   But they're all disembodied heads. No torches, no shoulders. No temple pieces.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.160]   Craig in there. I mean, they should have had an Easter egg with Craig.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.680]   I love the hair because it's, it's, you know, hair force one sort of, it's a little longer.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:25.520]   The icons are, you know, obviously the first icon is June 7th, the calendar icon. I see
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:30.640]   X code in there. Can you, can we parse? Oh, what's going on? Oh, can we parse? Can we get a little
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:36.000]   closer and see what, what else is going on in this in the zoom and hands? Zoom and hands.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.520]   What is that icon there? I don't know. Anybody know that?
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:44.880]   Screen captain for just this purpose. You did really? You knew we'd be doing semiotics today.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:51.920]   Oh, I wish I could have it. Yeah. Zoom. Look, zoom, enhance. So I see the calendar in X code,
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:57.920]   but see to the left of the X code there, there's three blobs. What is that shamrocks? What is that?
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:03.120]   Nothing? I don't know what that is. And then maybe it doesn't mean anything.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.800]   It's definitely not Fortnite. I'm guessing nothing from Epic.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.920]   But it was well, it was well done if it has us looking really, really closely.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.320]   It is. It's good marketing. They did the job.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.840]   No terminal in there. There's contacts. There's.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:21.120]   Yeah. Oh, yeah. 21 schedule appointments on the 7th.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.120]   Is that what that is? Is that the notifications? So there's 21 tracks.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:32.160]   There's terminal. I see the terminal to the right. I don't. Yeah. All right.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.400]   We've probably gone far enough down this rabbit hole.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.760]   It's a dev tools team having some fun.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.440]   She has no nostrils. I don't know. Does that mean anything? Don't breathe.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.520]   It's easier to wear a mask if you have no nostrils.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.280]   Her eyebrows are impeccable.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.040]   Somebody says--
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.040]   She has eyebrows. Is that the NX code utility maybe? Maybe. I don't know.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.080]   I don't know. It's resed. It's something.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.840]   That's resed. I love it. If only. If only.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.280]   One was such a failure, they're going back to MC-68000.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:06.800]   I am on Apple. I'm on developer.apple.com. Is the Apple front page have it? No.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.480]   I guess I just fire fire.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.920]   I have. I don't have to worry.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.280]   Every time I go to a different browser, I'm getting a different person.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.000]   Yeah. I'm hobbled because I'm on Linux here.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.680]   I don't think I have other browsers installed.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.960]   Because who needs more than one browser really?
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:29.520]   That's true. We have, was it, Slipkneer? We're fine.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.000]   I've got Slipkneer. I'm good. Oh, I got another one.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.280]   I got another one. Oh, he's cute. That's the kid with the hearing aids.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.720]   That's good. Yeah. That's good. He also has no temple pieces.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:45.120]   Same icons, curly hair. And he's still staring into it.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.560]   That might put hair. But it's not the case.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.200]   You're looking that close to the screen?
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.920]   If I open a new page each time, and it's got her again,
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.480]   I'm just going to keep opening tabs. It's a fun game.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.640]   There's one more. There's three. Here I got it.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.400]   Here's the one. Oh, it's me.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.480]   That's the Boomer edition, right?
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.520]   If you click on the Swift thing, you got a student version.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.040]   It's a great old one. So let me
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.520]   swivel for a little challenge.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.800]   Then I get one with a little cap.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.760]   Student cap. Also hearing aids.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.480]   Oh, I bet it goes through all the different students,
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.520]   but they have caps on. That's interesting.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.480]   Cool. What's the Swift Student Challenge Renee?
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.080]   What does that do?
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.120]   They always do these. They always had WWDC scholarships,
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.480]   and this is a new version of that.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.760]   If you get accepted, you get the jacket and the pin.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.000]   Oh, okay. So they still have jackets and pins.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.680]   Yeah. Well, if you get the Swift scholarships.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.520]   Winners will receive exclusive WWDC 21 outer wear,
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.920]   a customized pin set, and of course,
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.720]   a year membership in the Apple Developer Program.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:04.080]   For the rest of us, we'll be checking eBay shortly after the winners are announced.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.160]   They're going to be on the blockchain.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.960]   That's what people, yeah, they really should have NFTPins.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.720]   That's what they should do.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:18.800]   That is, if I hear one thing, one regret with these
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:24.400]   non-in-person events is that there are no jackets and pins.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.800]   We didn't for charity.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.160]   There was a charity last year that I contributed to.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:30.560]   I remember.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.160]   I made a set of pins for people.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.000]   So maybe that would be...
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:34.560]   Hopefully you do.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.440]   But that was not an Apple effort, right?
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.400]   That was a third part.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   No.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.600]   It's not an Apple effort.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:38.960]   Community.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.200]   I can see if you'd been to 20 WWDCs and you had the jackets and pins from all of them,
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.840]   that you'd be a little miffed that there was no 2020 or 2021 representation.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.880]   I could see that.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.920]   The collection is now worth it.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.640]   They were now 2020, so.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.600]   Right.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.920]   We skipped the year entirely.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.400]   We don't know what they're going to talk about at WWDC.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.160]   Obviously, that's when they typically will announce iOS 15, right?
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.920]   Uh, announce, uh, do they, do they announce the next version of Mac OS?
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.000]   Mac OS 12.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.520]   Will it be 12 or 11.1?
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.000]   What do you think?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.560]   What's your guess?
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.760]   It's already in the code strength.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.160]   12.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.360]   No, they've already had 11.1.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.240]   11.1 is already out.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:16.800]   Oh, that's right.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.760]   They have to do 12.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.520]   They boxed themselves in.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.880]   They went a decade with 10 and now they're going to be in another one.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.800]   Every year, it'll be in another one.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.520]   But enough of this.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.720]   Will they skip the...
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.920]   And it's lower than iOS.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.480]   That's the part.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.000]   It's like, at least they should have made it a Mac OS 16.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.080]   Like they should have had less, yeah, kept on what it was.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.080]   Your parody.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.800]   Go for parody.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.760]   I think there are pains, great.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.400]   I don't know, but I would guess there are great pains to say.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.520]   Because remember when iOS, when the iPhone came out, everybody said,
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.160]   well, it's just a mini Mac OS.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.360]   I think they're probably a great pain.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.200]   It's like, oh no, there's a difference between iOS, iPad, OS, Mac OS, TV, OS.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.960]   They're at all different.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:58.960]   Although, although trivia answer technically at all is Mac OS, excuse me,
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.320]   it is all OS 10.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.240]   iOS is OS 10 with iPhone stuff.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.240]   Mac OS is OS 10 with Mac OS.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.400]   Is it the mock kernel that makes it OS 10?
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:13.920]   It's the shared libraries, shared...
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.160]   I have to go back to my research to know exactly what was programming.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.680]   That was always one of the most brilliant things.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:26.800]   Especially since we're talking, was it last week, it was the anniversary of the first release of OS 10.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.640]   That this was such a far reaching idea that no, we're not going to keep rewriting operating
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.480]   systems for every single device we put out.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:37.120]   We are building something that we can then expand on or contract as necessary.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.400]   Oh, here's another clue, Renee.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.560]   You don't even have to look in the programming strings.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.160]   Introducing Xcode 12.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.800]   Yeah, so here you go.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.040]   Right?
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.200]   Does an Xcode follow the Mac OS?
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.240]   It's making 12 code.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.120]   Should last year have been 11 code, and this year will be 12 code.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.080]   10 code.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.200]   It's 10 code 12.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.240]   Oh.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.200]   They're so inconsistent.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:55.600]   Oh.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.320]   A12X, but iPhone 10.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.840]   Watch OS 7.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.960]   We did get an update last week to iOS.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.960]   I think it's an emergency security update.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.440]   Is that?
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.920]   Zero day in the wild.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:10.960]   Insta is great now.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.120]   It was a great Twitter where someone pointed out that one of the best things you can do for iOS
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.040]   security is restart your phone because it is so hard to persist.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.520]   Like a lot of this stuff will work, but it's so hard to persist them that if you regularly restart,
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.080]   what was it?
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.480]   They think like amateurs worry about threat mitigation, pros, reboot their machines.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.160]   You know, they're used to be...
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:30.800]   Pro's from Ruth.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.760]   You know, that that that comes from is is it's based on Omar Bradley.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.400]   He said amateurs talk about strategy professionals talk about logistics.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.360]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.600]   That's another story.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.760]   Yeah, that's a whole whole other story.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:53.120]   So 14.4.2, if you have a late model iPhone, older iPhones, which can't go to 14,
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.120]   also get the fix 12.5.2.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.080]   Safari exploit.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.360]   So it goes far back.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:22:59.520]   By...
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.280]   A webkit, sorry.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.880]   That's the problem.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.760]   It's not Safari.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:10.160]   It's WebKit and everything uses WebKit, including Chrome, Firefox, and any other browser you're using.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.160]   Plus WebKit's widely used for rendering and a lot of applications and things like that.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.000]   Yeah, that's pretty vital.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.280]   203.9 megabytes in most cases.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.920]   Yeah, does...
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.560]   Did Apple put out a security bulletin yet or sometimes they wait for a while to do that?
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.080]   I haven't seen one yet.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:30.400]   Okay.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.360]   But we know it fixes a zero day.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.800]   Do it.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.280]   Do it.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.720]   Do it.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.720]   Do it.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:47.360]   Okay, let's move on to another topic.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:54.000]   Renee Ritchie, Alex Lindsey, Andy Inaco, the whole team is here.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.400]   And you know, the bulletins are up, Leo.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.920]   Ah, the bulletins are up now.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.240]   All right.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.360]   So we were talking...
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.960]   The process of maliciously crafted web content may lead to universal cross-site scripting.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.400]   Apple is aware of the report that this issue may have been actively exploited.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.200]   Bye.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:09.920]   And they have a credit.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.400]   Sorry.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:17.120]   So that's what makes it a zero day is that not only is it discovered, but it's also in the wild.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:17.920]   At the same time.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.840]   And that's why the patch is so urgent.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:21.360]   Okay.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.160]   Okay.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:22.800]   Good to know.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.320]   Good on the right team, at least.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:29.600]   Do we know if it was a third party discovered it or was it in general?
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.320]   Yeah, it's credited.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.680]   I'll show you those.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.640]   So that's another thing.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.680]   Good on Apple.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.840]   For a long time, they resisted this idea of bug bounties.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.280]   They didn't want to get in a bidding war.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.160]   But they...
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.600]   Climate, it's Google threat analytics analysis group.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.400]   And Google, yeah.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.520]   It's pretty funny.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.960]   It's always seems to be Google bound.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.320]   They said, "Fine, see, it's bad."
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:46.800]   They're good.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.160]   They have the best.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:48.800]   They really do.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.200]   They have...
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   Well, because if Apple had been able to find them, they would have find them.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.960]   Sometimes you need an outside team that's not using the same procedures to find stuff.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.440]   Exactly right.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.080]   That's a regular effect.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:58.960]   Completely doesn't pick up.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:04.160]   But on the other hand, you don't hear a lot of Apple found a bug in Google's code.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.200]   Apple considers Google a bug in general.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.760]   Well, Google's using a bug in general.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.240]   Right.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.720]   When Google has three advantages, what is like anything Apple finds internally, they just fix.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.040]   You know, they don't credit it to like Apple.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:15.520]   Yes.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.160]   That's right.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:16.720]   That's right.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.200]   They just fix it.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.560]   But also Google's using a fork.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.080]   Like Chromium is a fork of WebKit.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:25.120]   So they might find things as part of their development process that come from the shared components.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.000]   I forgot that.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.480]   Blink, which is Google's engine, is actually just a forked WebKit.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.400]   That's really interesting.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.600]   HTML1, Leo.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.080]   It wasn't...
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:34.640]   That's right.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.280]   It wasn't tried.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.720]   It came from HTML1.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.080]   It was KDE originally.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:38.640]   That's right.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.680]   And Conqueror, yeah.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.720]   Conqueror with a K.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.000]   Wow.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.440]   You're going to be...
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.120]   I'm nominating you for our historian.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.240]   Renee Ritchie.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.200]   You're the guy with the elephant memory.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:54.480]   Apple has been talking about whether or not to come back.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:58.880]   They are encouraging staff to get vaccinated.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.240]   This is from Mark Gurman.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.680]   And offers paid time off to do that.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.640]   So that's good.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.640]   Now just get us the vaccine.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.080]   Andy, before the show, you were...
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.560]   Exactly.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.120]   You're saying...
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.160]   I can't...
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.000]   That's the problem.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.840]   It's very difficult.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.760]   It's very difficult.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.320]   In California, and this Gurman article notes it,
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:24.000]   people over 16 will be eligible in two weeks,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.640]   April 15th, according to the state.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.760]   Now whether there'll be enough
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.280]   vaccine to do it, I don't know.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.400]   But that's the theory.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.000]   And I think starting April 1st, it's people over 50.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.640]   So in theory, this is accelerating.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.080]   And you're starting on June?
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.960]   Well, I think it's going to go to adults
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.240]   and we're still having trouble getting it,
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.760]   because I think Europe is slowing down.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.680]   And we entered the third wave yesterday.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.800]   So we've got these two moving targets in front of us.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:55.200]   For those who don't know, we're one entry all of the Canadian persuasion.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.040]   Yeah, we didn't do one wave ahead of you.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:57.680]   As well as you guys.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.640]   We're one wave ahead.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.600]   We're on our fourth wave.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.360]   We're starting it.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:01.840]   Of what?
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.880]   Vaccine or COVID?
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.840]   COVID.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.880]   I can't.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.760]   I can't.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:06.640]   You know what happened?
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.200]   We just bought all the vaccines.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.560]   I took them off the market.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.520]   We got them all.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.800]   Well, Europe is trying not to send them as much anymore as well.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.280]   Okay.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:15.600]   Okay.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.600]   Will, what is the current policy from Apple?
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.840]   I know last time we talked about Tim Cooks saying,
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.120]   we do want people to come back eventually,
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.840]   but I imagine they're going to be pretty flexible.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:30.400]   Have they said?
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.080]   They definitely say they want to bring people back.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.120]   I don't know how they'd be able to bring people back at full capacity
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.800]   for anytime soon.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.640]   I mean, it's still probably at least
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.200]   four to six months away.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.200]   Hence, this urging them to get the vaccine,
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.680]   because that's the first step to getting back.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.760]   I imagine Apple, of all the companies,
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:54.720]   Apple's really big on this kind of face-to-face collaboration model.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.280]   Steve Jobs is a big supporter of that.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.720]   So I imagine they want people to be back in that beautiful campus.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.600]   I think that there's going to be, at some point,
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   there's going to be a competitive issue where there's
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.080]   just a lot of people that don't want to go to an office.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.160]   And you're going to have to allow them to work from where they want to work,
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:19.920]   because Twitter and Facebook and Microsoft and others are starting to relax that permanently.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.120]   Yeah, pretty much everybody else.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.680]   Salesforce said nobody has to come back who doesn't want to.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.480]   In fact, Salesforce has been canceling leases in San Francisco.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.120]   They have that new beautiful building in San Francisco,
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.080]   but they also had other office space leases that just cancel.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.360]   The Leaning Tower of Babel.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:34.560]   That's the...
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.800]   Don't get me started.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.960]   This could be good stuff or bad stuff.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.800]   It's good that it's convincing large corporations to rethink
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.120]   whether they need to have people come in to actually use office space.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.360]   But it also means that they can also rethink,
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.480]   "Well, gee, if we can have people do..."
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.880]   If your job can be done remotely,
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.240]   why don't we just have your job being done by an outsourcing company
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.400]   anywhere in the world instead of paying you?
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.080]   That's not going to ask for benefits.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.280]   It's not going to ask for.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.400]   So we're going to see the follow from this over the next five or ten years.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.200]   I think the issue is that there are...
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.560]   A lot of people who've thought that the problem is that there is a certain culture,
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:20.000]   that it's hard to hire people wholesale somewhere else.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.280]   That's been the challenge.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.400]   I mean, definitely if you're just pushing pixels or writing some stuff,
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.520]   it might make sense.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:30.880]   But if they can access those talent bases, most of them have already.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.000]   It's not like this is the thing that pushed them over the head.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.120]   They're most of them have teams in Chennai and so on and so forth already.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:39.120]   Right.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:39.680]   Right.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.160]   But I can see them adding more people to...
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.200]   I'm just quickly...
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.280]   I can see them saying, "Well, gee, we thought that we couldn't outsource this,
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.120]   but it turns out that I think that we can.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.800]   I think that a lot of people who made it,
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.480]   who don't know how close they came to losing their jobs three years ago,
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.800]   might lose their jobs in the next two or three years.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.760]   That's how it put it.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.120]   There's inertia too.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.760]   People exactly just go along and...
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.240]   There is a certain amount of inertia here.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:10.320]   I don't feel any urgency to get people back in the office.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:16.640]   Certainly, we're doing the same as Apple with our small 20-person team.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.840]   We're saying, "Get the vaccine."
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.000]   Well, John, a lot of people have gotten it.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.760]   I would say probably a third of them have gone out and gotten it.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.880]   That's still not enough to bring everybody back.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:32.320]   Apple is the... one of the top... actually, Apple is the number one acquirer
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:37.280]   of AI companies over the last five years.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.320]   This from global data, financial deals, database.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.160]   Apple, over five years, is acquired.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.120]   Wow, look at this.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.480]   One, two, three, four, five.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.640]   On average, it looks like about five a year.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.400]   They don't make a big...
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.760]   Apple doesn't make announcements.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.880]   I mean, in 2020, do you remember when Apple announced?
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:02.880]   They bought inductive, subverse, voices, exnor.ai and Vilnics?
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.560]   Vilinks?
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.520]   Vilinks?
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.240]   No, I don't.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.800]   The year before drive.ai, laser-like, pull-string, spectral edge,
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.720]   and lighthouse.ai, the year before that,
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.840]   a sales, so-collabs, spectral apps,
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:20.400]   lattice data in 2017, pop-up archive, RealFace.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.120]   I like that.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.080]   RealFace.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:22.880]   Shazam.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.920]   I remember when they bought Shazam.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.640]   That's the only one so far of all of these.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.220]   that I recognize.
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:35.320]   Deskonect, Sensomotoric, Regan Regan--
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.360]   "re-gain!"
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.320]   "re-gain!"
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.620]   It's like reading license plates.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.160]   Emotion, " Sulph-le jump,"
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.400]   "turry fly-by" and "ghlimps."
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.840]   "Glimps I"-- well, wait a minute, though.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.120]   That's "Glimps" with an "I."
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.520]   I don't know, is that the "Glimps I was?"
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.900]   The "Map-N-Glimps."
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.260]   I don't know.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.280]   So out of these two, I know.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.000]   Anybody recognize any the others?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.760]   Well, it's a lot.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.760]   It's a lot.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:03.400]   It's-- if you show any talent at something,
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.400]   it's a lot cheaper to buy you early than wait for you
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:05.960]   to get bigger.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.800]   That's right.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.160]   I do recognize, actually, I take it back in 2019.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.880]   They bought the patents of Lighthouse,
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.040]   which was a sponsor here.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:13.920]   Remember the Lighthouse?
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.440]   Actually, it was brilliant.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.160]   It had LIDAR in it.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.320]   And it was a security device/camera
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.800]   that you'd put in your house.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:27.120]   And it would map with the LIDAR with 3D in the house.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.960]   It did true time to flight LIDAR.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.480]   And then it would, using LIDAR and cameras,
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.680]   be able to identify people.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.600]   It was a pretty cool product, but it failed
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.160]   because it was too expensive, I think.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:44.160]   But Apple has apparently acquired the intellectual property.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.320]   I also wonder if the trouble that Google has been having
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:51.840]   for the past year, maintaining a positive environment
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.080]   for their ethical AI researchers,
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.320]   and the repercussions that they're having.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.160]   Or if it's going to mean that it's
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.320]   going to make other companies, such as Apple,
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:06.480]   a more attractive place to put in your resume or look for work.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.720]   It's not hard to find already stories about, hey,
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.600]   one researcher who started the paperwork
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.480]   on a $60,000 Google grant for research
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.160]   like months before a lot of this really blew up,
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.520]   finally got the grant and cited--
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.720]   I can't accept the grant.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.960]   I don't want to get money from Google
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.040]   given how they've been treating AI researchers.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.320]   Google is only third on the list.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.920]   Number two is Accenture, which is a consultancy,
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.240]   then Microsoft, then Google Microsoft and Facebook.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.280]   But what this list is just by company, what it doesn't say
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:42.080]   is one company might have had 5,000 employees and one, two.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.280]   You don't really know the real volume of the--
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.680]   One of those might be Instagram.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.560]   Is Instagram an AI?
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.640]   I don't know, maybe.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.040]   So the Epic--
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.400]   Apple Battle Rages 4th continues on.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:00.280]   Epic is now going after Apple in the UK.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:05.840]   This is the-- oh, I get it.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.360]   That's the goat from Fortnite with an Apple logo.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.000]   So it's the Apple colors.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.120]   There's a bite out of the goat.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.080]   You're OK.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.240]   Just like five of the Apple colors.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.560]   It's like the laziest.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.720]   Yes, lazy.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.360]   It's the goat from Fortnite.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.760]   And it's free-- UK free Fortnite is the slogan.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:30.240]   Antitrust Complain against Apple after losing their court
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.680]   battle over the same issue.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.720]   So never give up.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.320]   Never surrender.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.600]   The hard part is that the--
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.240]   over time, as you keep on losing cases,
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:46.880]   while they're not connected to other areas or other regions,
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.280]   other regions pay attention.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.640]   Like, so if they start stacking up a lot of losses
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:53.560]   in the United States and the UK and so on and so forth,
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.680]   no one wants to be that far out of step.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.760]   From a legal perspective, except maybe the EU.
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.640]   They're crazy.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.120]   But I think that, again, the hard part
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.040]   that they're going to have to get over in Antitrust
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.480]   is the definition of monopoly.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.480]   I mean, I know that they're really
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:13.360]   trying to define the iPhone as its own thing,
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.240]   but it is a phone.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.240]   Right.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:21.160]   And Samsung, both Samsung and Google
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.320]   made really did Apple a lot of favors,
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:28.720]   because by far the majority in the world of--
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.880]   phone users are Android.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.040]   And Samsung did such a good job at copying the Apple iPhone
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.840]   that, especially in the early days,
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.400]   that it's hard to say that it's not part of that ecosystem
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.520]   because they look very similar.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:40.640]   I apologize.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.440]   I am informed that was not a goat.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.080]   It's a llama.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.240]   No, the llama.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.920]   In silhouette, they look alike.
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.640]   With a bite taken out of its neck.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.440]   Yeah, I forgot.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.720]   Fortnite is llamas.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.680]   I was thinking of that goat game.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.800]   I'm titled Goat Simulator.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.520]   Goat Simulator, yeah, that's what I was thinking of.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.080]   I'm titled Goat Game.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.120]   It's Untitled Goose Game.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.640]   Now I'm confusing all my animals.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.560]   All my animals.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.960]   So yeah, the battle rage is on.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.080]   I think that it's--
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.520]   Apple is facing it on many, many fronts.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.200]   Antitrust complaints over its app store.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.960]   I think at some points, they're going
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.000]   to have to address this.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.440]   Google did what Apple did.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.320]   They decided to reduce their royalty.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:27.560]   But I think Google did it in a wider fashion of 15%.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.960]   So I think the pressure's on.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.040]   Apple did 98% of the--
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.880]   Everybody under $1 million.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.880]   Almost 98%.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.400]   Yeah, it was 98%.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.080]   Don't count.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.840]   Everybody but the Ferrari drivers.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:39.920]   Right.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.360]   That they accidentally pointed out that when they say--
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.600]   When we say that $30 billion we paid up to developers,
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.880]   we're saying we paid them to like three developers.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.560]   The rest of you got gas money and good for you.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.080]   Yeah, let me--
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.080]   I wish it was someone smarter because I'm
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.520]   watching the developer community.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.560]   And these are people who are predisposed to want the most
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.040]   from Apple.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.160]   Just go through-- and it's not just Apple developers,
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.840]   but there are some Apple developers.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.600]   Just go through the lawsuit and clown them
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.400]   on how inconsistent, illogical, and ill-prepared it is.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.160]   And I still remember the lawyer getting just dressed down
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:10.800]   by the judge.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.280]   And there's such real important change
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:13.960]   that needs to be done.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.440]   But these clowns are sucking up so much of the oxygen.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.040]   Google, by the way, did exactly what Apple did.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.320]   They also cut it to 15% for the first million dollars
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.400]   of revenue.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.240]   So I guess that really doesn't cut into your bottom line
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.200]   very significantly.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:30.120]   Same thing.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.800]   99% of developers.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.520]   It's very, very-- so, for an ace point,
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.800]   that's really, really surprising too.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.760]   Because it's not as though they got one of these 1,800 lawyers
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.880]   who will do it on contingency.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.680]   They really had a murderous row of people
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:47.040]   who are into legislators who would work in antitrust,
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.560]   putting at least the initial filing together,
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.280]   or at least getting them to agree to,
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.920]   could you take a look at this and say
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.120]   that this isn't a stupid piece of paper we wrote
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.000]   so we can put your name in the press release about,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.800]   here's the people that we've got on our legal team.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.040]   So yeah, to see them step on so many rakes in this procedure
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.200]   is very surprising.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.240]   Miguel was going through it today saying, here it says,
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.280]   the app store is not necessary to do this.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.640]   Here it says that the app store is necessary to do this.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.760]   Can't we at least come to a consensus on what the app store
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.880]   is actually doing people in your file?
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.520]   The bottom line, I think, is that they really thought
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.560]   that they were going to get groundswell,
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.320]   and they just didn't.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.320]   And I think that the whole play was not to actually--
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.840]   they don't have a very good case.
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:26.720]   Let's be clear.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.200]   The case is really bad.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:32.000]   From a pure legal perspective, we can get into whether the optics of it.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.280]   And I think that they thought that they'd embarrass Apple.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.800]   They'd push things down that developers would rise up,
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.960]   that the users would rise up, the developers probably
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.000]   not that concerned about that to rise up.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.720]   The users don't care.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.000]   And so the problem is that they're
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.920]   stuck now trying to put lipstick on a pig.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.680]   And it's going to look chaotic because there's nothing there to--
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.160]   there's no there there.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.920]   And so they played out something,
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.320]   and now they have to try to run it out.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:03.080]   But every time they lose, they're making it not only harder for them
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.880]   to win somewhere else, but in the future.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:12.360]   So this isn't like the Samsung fight,
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.280]   because Apple is making a lot of arguments
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.200]   in their defense that were just nonsense.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.240]   And that's a lot of what helped this,
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.640]   that helped that thing go for many years and many years.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:27.200]   Also the fact that there was so much rancor behind on both sides,
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.080]   primarily from Apple, keeping this going.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:34.920]   But yeah, Fortnite must be at some point thinking about,
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.280]   how can we get peace with dignity here?
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:42.080]   I mean, they need a face-saving way to quit,
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.360]   and they just haven't found it yet.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.080]   OK, Andy, you get the I quoted Nixon award
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.960]   for the first time on the show.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.400]   Thank you.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.400]   Congratulations.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.040]   Actually, we have somebody in the chat room
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.040]   who's handled his rich Nixon, probably his real name.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.400]   I don't think you'd choose that.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.560]   And Clemente Taper, for his.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:06.520]   There's another arena where every Western company
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.480]   is struggling a little bit.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.320]   And this is, of course, in China.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.160]   And when you do business in a country,
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.080]   you have to follow the laws of the country.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.520]   But do you have to follow the customs?
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.480]   So I know H&M is very big in Canada.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.680]   They're a Swedish clothing company.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.080]   I remember in Toronto, Amber always
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.560]   talking about going to H&M.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.080]   She loved H&M.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:36.920]   But apparently, H&M has decided to stop buying cotton
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:42.880]   and textiles from the Chinese province of Xinjiang.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.120]   It's a major cotton producer because of allegations
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.880]   of forced-weaker labor there.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:53.640]   So they did that thinking this would be their Swedish.
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.160]   This seems like a good idea.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.760]   Interesting to see the reaction nationwide in China.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.920]   Pretty soon, you couldn't use DD, which
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.760]   is the Uber of China, a ride-hailing service.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.720]   You couldn't get a ride to H&M.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:12.880]   They just took H&M off the destination list.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.520]   Subtle.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.020]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.880]   Isn't that wild?
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.480]   E-commerce sites, daily deals, map applications,
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:24.080]   including Apple's map, which is interesting,
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:28.400]   have all eliminated H&M from their listings.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.600]   Now, this is not a legal requirement.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:37.400]   So this is a case of Apple going along with a cultural norm
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.640]   or maybe a governmental initiative, but not a law.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:44.200]   I think this is kind of interesting.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:48.600]   And you don't want to be out front on this kind of stuff.
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.200]   Maybe you do.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.160]   Maybe this is how you maintain a good relationship with China.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.320]   It's something worth discussing.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.560]   As soon as I read this story, it made me wonder,
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:02.000]   for the first time, does Apple Maps
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.520]   rely on a data set that's controlled and provided by China?
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.520]   Maybe that's why.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.160]   Because I could imagine that they're not allowed to.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.120]   Hey, we want to send these cards with cameras down
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.320]   every street in China.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.040]   So you nailed it, eh?
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.040]   Maybe that's the reason why.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.640]   Yeah, because Baidu Maps, which is, again, Baidu
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.160]   is kind of the Google of China, immediately did it.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.480]   Maybe Apple's just using Baidu's data.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:22.360]   I bet you're right.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.680]   Because I don't think Apple would say, oh, let's get rid of this.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.960]   We've got to fix this.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.160]   Well, no, I believe that if the government said that, hey,
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.280]   we need you to do this, they would probably do it.
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.160]   I don't think that Apple has demonstrated any amount
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.560]   of spine when it comes to this topic.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.840]   But I do wish that they would at least--
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.640]   now that someone else has started reporting on this--
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.160]   The Wall Street Journal.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:49.240]   It would be nice if they made a comment or they simply said
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.360]   that, hey, this is where we get our data from.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.240]   Well, this is how Apple Maps gets its data.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.680]   So if they had an out, it would be nice for them to say, hey,
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.360]   look, our hands are by no means clean,
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.680]   but our pinky is clean on this one.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.880]   H&M has 400 stores in China.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.840]   Of course, it's a little obfuscated
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.360]   where this initiative came from.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.720]   The government's trying to make this look, I think,
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:17.080]   like a consumer boycott.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:21.160]   But it's in government-run newspapers.
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.440]   Every government runs everything, including social media,
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.760]   YBO and so forth.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.480]   H&M said on its YBO account Wednesday
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.040]   that it followed international guidelines for supply chain
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.040]   sustainability and that it was, quote,
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.000]   "committed to long-term investment and development
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:36.840]   in China."
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:41.120]   But Chinese social media users have
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.520]   been lambasting H&M, saying, you want to do business in China,
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.240]   but you don't want to buy our cotton.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.000]   Well, screw you, basically.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.080]   That's a real groundswell of AstroTurf support.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.920]   Yeah, I have a feeling it's AstroTurf,
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.960]   but we don't know.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:58.720]   Exactly.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.280]   We don't know.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.240]   But it just reminds us that Apple
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.520]   has to tread a certain line there that it's--
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.320]   I understand that there are a lot of things
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.120]   that they have to deal with if they
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:13.440]   want to be a global technological power.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.000]   And also, as much as I like to honk on about,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.760]   gee, I wish Apple would be more clear about where
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.600]   the line is with China, I keep reminding myself
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.680]   that a lot of human rights organizations have said
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.880]   that in general, it's better--
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.760]   it's maybe more positive for a company like Apple
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.760]   to stay in China and be able to provide services
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:33.160]   to some of these people who are at a time when they absolutely
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:37.320]   need some sort of service that they can use to unite or talk
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.640]   or communicate or at least exist in some sort of sphere
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.000]   of freedom than to simply pull out completely.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.600]   However, this is another one of those cases where I really
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.800]   wish Apple would give me some clarity on exactly why these things
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.040]   happen to Apple products and channels.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.920]   We should all mention that the US Customs and Border Protection
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:57.040]   has in January banned all tomato and cotton products
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:01.320]   from Xinjiang, which is 87% of China's total cotton output.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.000]   So the US government is behind a boycott.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.960]   But maybe Apple--
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.120]   you know, it's complicated.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.440]   Go ahead, Alex.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.520]   Well, Apple and other companies can
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.840]   see that this could get more ugly, I think.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.160]   And I think we're seeing a lot of companies diversifying
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.360]   their supply chains as a result.
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:23.000]   And so in both diversifying their supply chains
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   and diversifying their dependency on China,
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.480]   I think a lot of people have dived in as the next new thing.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:29.680]   And it's starting to get--
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.440]   a lot of folks are getting pretty uncomfortable
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.160]   with that situation.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:37.840]   And so I think that there's a lot of not taking a hard stance,
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.720]   but it doesn't mean that there isn't movement.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.640]   It's just that it's not sudden.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.720]   By the way, was there an Apple event today?
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.720]   No.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.480]   So we're hoping for invitations for an event on the 6th deal.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.520]   So there will not be a March Apple event.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.960]   I think we could say that with certainty at this point.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.360]   You think April 6th, is that your--
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.520]   No, we were waiting.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.960]   Everyone, when the WWC thing came out, everyone was like,
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.880]   are there going to be invitations for an April 6th event
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:02.240]   today?
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:02.740]   Nothing.
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:03.880]   And they're like, oh, maybe not.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:04.840]   Nobody do that.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:06.000]   All right.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.320]   Let's-- speaking of supply chain,
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:09.080]   I'm going to supply chain story for you coming up
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:10.160]   in just a bit.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.040]   Mac Break Weekly, Renee Richie, Alex, Lindsay, Andy,
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.640]   and I shouldn't really have to reintroduce you guys.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.880]   You've only been on this show for what is it?
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.360]   15 years, but--
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.160]   But it makes us feel like part of the group.
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:23.680]   We enjoy it.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.360]   It's what they do on a week time podcast.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.480]   So I want to copy that.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:33.280]   Intel, finally, Pat Gelsinger, finally told us
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.760]   what Intel's plans are.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.680]   There was--
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:38.160]   There was-- he's the new CEO.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.600]   Plans, plans, plans.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.360]   Woo, there's a roadmap.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.360]   There was quite a drum beat from a lot of people
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.280]   saying that Intel should stop making their own chips,
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.160]   that the mistake Intel has made was doubling down
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.280]   on the fabs, doubling down on integration,
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.560]   making, designing, doing it all the systems on a chips.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.000]   And that's what has hurt Intel.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.240]   And one of the reasons they couldn't keep up,
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:02.400]   they were stuck on a 14 nanometer process.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.640]   One of the reasons Apple abandoned them
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.600]   to move to Apple Silicon.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.320]   Well, Gelsinger has doubled.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.480]   It's gone the other direction.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.520]   And actually, I'm not sure it's a bad thing.
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.880]   Gelsinger has announced that they
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:20.040]   are going to build new fabs in the US, new $20 billion fabs
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:20.840]   in Arizona.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:24.760]   They already have fabs in Arizona and Oregon.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:30.360]   And even that they are going to go after chip production
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:35.840]   for Apple, that they want to make the M1 chip.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:38.960]   For those terrible Apple computers that can't flip around.
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.440]   Isn't that hysterical?
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.960]   So I don't look, I agree with you.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.440]   We talked last week about these Intel ads.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.440]   I agree with you.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.480]   Justin Long will never again work for Apple.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:55.160]   But that level, I think company, I could see Apple,
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.560]   if Intel made a good offer and could hit--
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:58.440]   what is it now?
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.600]   It's seven and they're going to find--
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.680]   This is a company that had never went back to Nvidia.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.920]   This is the-- I can see Apple not just being salty
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:04.800]   about the Aswing.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.920]   Oh, you thought that was good marketing?
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.640]   Oh, no, we can't trust you with that.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.800]   But that was Steve Jobs, right?
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.800]   I mean, Tim Cook is a hero.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.320]   The thing here that's scary is that he's
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.600]   being much more realistic about their capability
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:18.320]   as a foundry.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.960]   And they're only moving the 7 nanometer.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.440]   Their version of a 7 nanometer process--
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.480]   those are marketing names.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.160]   So the actual sizes don't really--
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.200]   there's no universal way for measuring sizes.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.680]   So their 7 nanometer will probably
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:32.640]   be analogous to Taiwan semiconductors 5 nanometer, which
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.440]   they rolled out last year with Apple.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:38.400]   But they're only going to get to 7 nanometer in 2022, 2023.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.080]   So that would be kind of a showstopper.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.080]   Apple's got TSMC makeup.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.760]   Apple would be a 3 nanometer by then with--
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.360]   I don't see-- they would have to demonstrate superiority
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.160]   of foundry to win Apple's business,
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.480]   not just interest in--
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.040]   On the way behind--
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.160]   On the other hand--
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:57.920]   And this was Gail Singer's point is we
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:02.320]   see a real opportunity for making chips in the United States
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:05.720]   so that countries are not dependent on China and Taiwan
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.760]   and other Asian manufacturers.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.720]   They at least have a second source.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.760]   And I'm sure, Apple-- does Apple have a second source
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.040]   for the M1 or is it all TSMC?
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.880]   Samsung-- I mean, they have in the past used Samsung as well.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.720]   But this year, Samsung's 5 nanometer process
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.240]   isn't as good as TSMCs.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:26.040]   So Apple bought all of the TSMCs.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.040]   Well, the past--
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:27.720]   And just all of it.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.320]   And by the way, Apple's not a huge buyer of chips.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:34.200]   I mean, the loss of Apple didn't kill Intel or anything.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.760]   Well, and I believe that if I'm correct,
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:40.280]   that Intel hasn't been-- had a history of producing
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:44.360]   the best version when Apple has diversified iOS hardware.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.120]   So I think that there was the Intel chips versus the Qualcomm
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:47.440]   chips.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.400]   And they had to actually slow things down
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.920]   so that everyone got even--
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:51.600]   Oh, remember that?
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:52.100]   Yeah.
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:53.200]   Those are the radios.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:53.640]   That's right.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.200]   Yeah, for the radios.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.720]   And so I don't know if it really--
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.720]   Intel doesn't have a lot of track record there.
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.720]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:03.880]   But still, I think there are going
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.360]   to be a lot of economic opportunities and incentives
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.720]   to build chip-fed plants in the United States.
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.720]   And if Intel is going to have to build new facilities--
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.360]   or excuse me, you're going to have an opportunity
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.560]   to build new facilities and have a cost a lot less
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.280]   than it would have five years ago,
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.560]   that's a good opportunity to say, well,
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.720]   let's go after a new business that we don't have covered
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:20.200]   already.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.200]   Right.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:25.120]   We can justifiably make fun of Intel's
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:27.960]   for never having these roadmaps that just always just
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.800]   have this road-closed sign posted to it
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.160]   about two months after the announcement.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:38.480]   However, they're making the four-cylinder engine
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:42.360]   that goes into almost every car, almost every piece
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.120]   of equipment, anything powered by gas.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.800]   So they don't necessarily need it.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.160]   But this is a good opportunity for them to say Apple.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.080]   Well, look, we will do what you usually do at TSMC.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.320]   We will build something to your specifications.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.760]   We will also build up-- we will build it where you want it
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.800]   to be built.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:02.360]   So that it's easiest for your designers and for your production
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:06.720]   pipeline to integrate Intel-made CPUs into your product.
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.320]   I don't know how well that's going to work,
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.480]   but it makes for a good press release.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:14.600]   It reminds me of the shot from Joe versus the volcano,
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.800]   where he goes, I know you can get the job,
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.240]   but can you do the job?
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.480]   I know you can get the job, but can you do the job?
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:23.400]   I think that they might be able to try to get the job,
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:25.120]   but I'm not sure they'll be able to pull it off.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.480]   My favorite "Abelgode" movie, good quote.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:28.320]   I haven't seen it.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:29.160]   I'm going to have to watch it.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:29.920]   So great.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:30.520]   So great.
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:34.840]   So just for people who are not as inside baseball as we all are,
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:40.680]   and most of our listeners are, Apple buys chips from other companies.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.960]   They don't make their own chips.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.600]   They might have a small foundry for--
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.520]   Well, they design them.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:45.040]   They buy them at--
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:45.540]   Right.
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:47.000]   --a source manufacturing of them.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:47.760]   They design them.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.280]   And you may have heard ARM.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.880]   They bought a license from ARM, the so-called architecture
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.640]   license, which allows them to duplicate the functionality
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:57.600]   of ARM chips.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.520]   But it doesn't mean they have to make them exactly as ARM designs them.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.800]   So ARM is also a design firm.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.880]   But Apple licensed our architecture,
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:06.920]   designs their own chips internally,
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.400]   and then goes to a company that says, make these.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:13.880]   So TSMC, the Taiwan Silicon Manufacturing Company,
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.280]   is the one that makes them right now.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.000]   But it could be other companies.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   As you point out, they bought chips in the past from Samsung
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.360]   and Intel and others.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.560]   Intel has decided we want to be a foundry.
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.840]   As much as we want to be a design company,
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.720]   they still design their own chips.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.480]   And if they're a foundry, we can sell capacity
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.320]   to other companies.
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:36.880]   So their-- Gelsinger floated the idea.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:38.320]   I don't know how serious he was.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.760]   And X86, he's including X86 in that bargain.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.720]   Such a deal.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:44.200]   I know.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.560]   You think Apple has any--
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.480]   What would it be they make like it?
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.080]   Because so by the way, that's another thing we mentioned
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.520]   after this Justin Long ad series.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.840]   That's it for an Intel Mac Pro.
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.880]   I mean, that rumor is now dead, right?
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:58.720]   Yeah, I think.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.880]   But I mean, there are other companies that might--
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.840]   like an MSI or somebody who's been eyeing,
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.240]   doing something a little bit custom
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.440]   to differentiate themselves.
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.440]   Or maybe Apple could--
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:07.280]   It might be something--
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.040]   Could have X86 compatibility layer.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.320]   Oh, Microsoft.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.960]   Microsoft might want to make a custom.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:15.240]   Well, we talked about that on Windows Weekly last week.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.800]   We'll probably talk about it again tomorrow.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:21.440]   There are only a few companies that have the same kind
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.240]   of incentive Apple does to make it all.
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:27.040]   Apple owns the whole stack operating system hardware.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:27.960]   Processors.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.320]   Microsoft is-- since they make Windows,
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.040]   the only other company really that's in a position
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.400]   is say, hey, we could own the whole stack too.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.560]   Well, Google, but they're going to go arm.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.080]   Google, like they're already going arm for their SOC work.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.280]   But the only thing with Microsoft
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.400]   is they might move to the cloud before they move to the silicon.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.560]   That's the only thing I don't know.
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:45.400]   That's what I told you.
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.040]   But their Windows becomes a service before you become
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:47.960]   a silicon dependent.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:48.280]   Happen.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:51.160]   This is the year that Microsoft's virtual desktop ships.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:54.240]   I totally think that's what Apple or Microsoft's going to do.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.600]   They don't care.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.720]   But then they're on everything.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:59.280]   But maybe Intel wants to make server chips, right?
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.080]   Maybe that's the place to be.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.240]   Every chip-- every American company
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:07.520]   who has the ability to create chip plans in the United States,
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.600]   this is a really active time because remember
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.520]   the Biden administration has basically said,
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.960]   we're going to take about a year to decide
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:18.320]   how do we address shortcomings in American manufacturing?
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.440]   How do we relieve American dependence
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.080]   on specifically Chinese manufacturing
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.560]   in these specific sectors?
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.240]   And silicon was one of these sectors.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:29.760]   The car industry was another really, really big thing
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:30.600]   that was hit by this.
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:34.880]   Some of it was due to companies laying off a lot of orders
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.440]   that they made when they decided that, oh, well, COVID
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.960]   is going to mean that we're going to have a lot less consumer
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:40.480]   action.
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.640]   So a lot of that's short is artificial.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:48.840]   But it did create this motivation that if it didn't make
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.120]   sense for us before, we're going to--
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:56.040]   maybe at the end of a year, part of the battle plan,
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.400]   so to speak, that the government is going to give us
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.000]   is that we're going to make it so economically viable for you
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.760]   to build a plant in a congressional district that
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:08.040]   needs some help that we're going to basically
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:13.880]   totally change the board to move us from being 47% of the industry,
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:17.280]   but only 18% of manufacturing to maybe bring that close
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.360]   to 30% or 40%.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:25.440]   The hard part is beyond economics, it's just talent.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:30.440]   You know, having the workforce that can actually execute this,
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:35.360]   China has 100 times what we have in that area right now.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.840]   And so that's the--
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:37.720]   it's one thing.
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.920]   And the problem is it's not something that you just
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.880]   do a three-week course on.
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.280]   But that's why Intel could reasonably say,
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.640]   we're going to do this in Arizona because it's
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:51.360]   a smaller workforce of highly, highly, highly skilled people
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.040]   that are making these.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:56.320]   You don't need a massive factory to crank out,
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.280]   as many iPhones as China cranks out.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.520]   And the interesting thing is that what we'll probably bring back
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:06.200]   to the United States is a lot of the automation that Foxtron
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.560]   is working really hard on.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:11.280]   And so as they're spending an enormous amount of money
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:14.080]   right now trying to figure out how to minimize the number of people,
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:17.600]   and as you get to less people doing this, then it comes back.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:18.800]   So it doesn't bring that many jobs.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.760]   It just brings the machines over.
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:21.760]   Robots.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.960]   Yeah, the robot's coming here.
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:23.800]   Robots over there.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:26.880]   So it's OK.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:32.240]   Consumer Reports says the iPhone 12 Pro Max is one of the best
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.800]   smartphones of 2021.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:36.360]   One of--
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.960]   And do you make the others feel bad?
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:41.400]   Let's just say that they love you all in different ways.
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.480]   That's typical of consumer reports.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:51.120]   They'll award a recommended to usually more than one model.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.320]   They say the Samsung Galaxy--
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:54.520]   I love it, but they've been so underfunded for the last--
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.400]   like they changed completely a few years ago.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.480]   They got all their funding removed.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.360]   And they don't--
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.000]   So did Macworld.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.520]   Remember, there used to be so many labs companies
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.120]   that would test everything with all this equipment.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.320]   And now I don't think we have any.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:08.640]   Consumer Union, I think, still does the best they can do.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.000]   They buy this stuff, by the way.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.720]   They don't get it from the manufacturer.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:12.600]   So that is costly.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:14.480]   They don't take ads.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:18.520]   I've been a subscriber for more than 20 years.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.360]   But I have to admit, I don't choose my smartphone
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.840]   based on their reviews.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.560]   But I bet there are a lot of people that do.
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:27.080]   Is the wire cutter, you think, eating them alive?
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.160]   Is that the problem?
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.000]   No, I just think everyone is downslash.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.320]   Even though the last few months, just the starvation
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:34.520]   in the media industry is appalling.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.040]   I know.
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:38.360]   I've lost five pounds.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:41.280]   Well, I mean, just like how everyone's downsizing, slashing,
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.440]   budget slashing staff slashing everything.
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.880]   Do you see that over the YouTube side?
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:50.800]   Or is ad revenue down for YouTubers?
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:51.640]   Well, there's two different.
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.280]   One is that mostly it's independent creators.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:56.120]   And they have a-- in good and bad ways,
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.120]   they don't have the same models that traditional journalism
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:58.440]   has.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:00.520]   They do a lot of brand deals and a lot of affiliate
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:00.520]   revenue.
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:02.080]   They don't get all their money from ads.
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:06.480]   They get probably most of their money from relationships.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.280]   But then you have the usual snake oil people who are just
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.800]   like, I want to get a faceless website
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:13.000]   that I can turn into a numba cruncher
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.680]   and then flip it to somebody else for a couple million dollars.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:17.600]   So you're the same.
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:22.280]   Best-- so really, this is where consumer reports
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.200]   is going to tumble a little bit, because they
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:27.080]   have the best iPhone and the best Android phone.
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:29.920]   Well, yeah, the best iPhone probably
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:33.760]   would be the iPhone 12, from Maxia.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:39.760]   Best Android phone, Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G.
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.920]   I have to say, Andy, I'm going to ask Andy,
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:46.760]   because you have stuck with Android for a long while.
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:49.000]   And for a long time, I was a dual phone user.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:49.720]   I carried both.
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:53.960]   I still nominally have a pixel with me at all times
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:56.520]   as for representing the Android devices.
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:59:00.200]   But increasingly, I do not feel like Android is kept up.
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:02.600]   I feel like it's really creaky.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.480]   What do you think, Andy?
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:09.040]   I think that the battle lines between iOS and Android
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.360]   are pretty much as they were.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.560]   And it's pretty much the same as macOS versus Windows.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.680]   If you want choice of hardware, you've
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:20.320]   got so much choice on the Android side, on the iPhone.
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:23.080]   Either these three or four models excite you,
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:27.200]   or fit your budget, fit your needs, or they don't.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.880]   But I think that for 90% of what people want to do--
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:32.480]   OK, let's say 80%.
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.720]   They're very much equivalent.
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:39.560]   I think that a lot of the stuff that Google does,
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:43.640]   that enhances their own services, are applied to the Android
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:46.400]   operating system and Google hardware.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:49.680]   That said, however, the reason-- right now,
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:54.040]   as speaking as a consumer, what kept me in Android
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:59.600]   definitely this year was $350 for the Pixel 4a.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.160]   There are some sensational Android phones that cost less
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.360]   than $500 in a year where I really
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:08.080]   wasn't feeling any $1,000 phone that I was looking at.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.400]   But next year, I think I've mentioned it before,
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.520]   I could very easily switch back to iPhone.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.920]   If it was, man, this camera system,
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.080]   specifically in this package, is exactly what I want.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:21.480]   And plus, I would like to have that kind of a camera
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.120]   without having to give money to Samsung,
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.440]   and having to create eight different Samsung accounts
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.000]   just to make the damn thing work.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.440]   Google has essentially not improved their camera in two
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:32.640]   years.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.480]   So that's kind of a problem.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.000]   But the damn--
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.840]   Well, they're a good camera, but it's not changed.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.640]   Well, they're even using the same sensor
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.240]   as they've been using for the past three or four or five
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:41.600]   years.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.320]   But the damn thing, the weird thing
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.680]   is that it keeps really competing very, very strongly,
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.720]   just with all these software upgrades.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.400]   And that's what Google will give you.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.840]   We'll give you wins on the software side.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.520]   That's why you bought a Pixel phone,
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.000]   and suddenly a year later, if the call comes in
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.160]   from an area code you recognize,
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.480]   but a number you don't recognize, tap a button,
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.760]   and a voice assistant will answer the call for you,
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.920]   give you a live transcript of what this other person is
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.600]   saying, so you can recognize it.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.520]   OK, this is somebody I know.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.320]   Also, they want to talk about something that's actually
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.160]   important, so I will answer it right now.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:22.280]   Whereas Apple's phone app is still where it was 10 years ago.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.160]   There's a lot of little stuff like that.
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:29.400]   But I hope that both sides are egging each other on the way
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:33.600]   they always have, because I don't think that Shlomo is
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.920]   improving because of the Google Assistant being so much better
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.560]   at so many other things.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.480]   And a lot of the hardware that Apple's making
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.880]   is also in response to how good these $400, $400, $500
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.400]   phones are.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:49.560]   I don't think we would see a sub $500 really, really great
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.680]   iPhone, if not for the fact that they're
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:55.240]   really, really super great, like phones like that.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:56.160]   Just like--
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.120]   I mentioned yesterday.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:02.720]   The mid-range Samsung phone, the S52,
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.800]   has so many features that we're rumored to get in the next
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:09.240]   iPhone next year, as been rumored for the past two or three
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:09.760]   years.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.080]   That kind of blows your mind.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.240]   Yeah, you make a good point.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.480]   I'm in a privileged position.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.200]   I can afford to buy an expensive phone.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.600]   And I kind of have to for work.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.000]   But I just feel like Android is starting to lag.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.480]   There's a lot of change.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.480]   It folds.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.000]   It's particularly great that you have the choice.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.880]   But in my experience, in every case,
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:31.760]   you have a choice.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.160]   That's nice.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.560]   I can get a folding phone.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:36.480]   But the experience isn't just not as good as it is on an
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.360]   iPhone.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:40.360]   And so I feel like--
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:40.760]   I don't know.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.800]   I just feel like Android's falling behind.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:43.480]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.400]   It could just be a personal.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.840]   It's also been a--
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.800]   I'm not joking when I say that.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:53.080]   I think that it's a rebuilding year for at least the hardware
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.720]   side of things on Google's Android.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.480]   Remember that we're still sort of real--
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:00.720]   They're mid priced and they're midfield kind of, you know?
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:01.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:05.440]   And that's the weird thing for--
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:10.440]   the weird thing is that not many people need an iPhone.
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.520]   Most people need what is a $500 mid-range phone.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:16.720]   Again, there's no bigger nerd than myself.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.760]   And yet with this, again, super budget, $350,
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.760]   like bottom of the price range phone,
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:26.200]   I really can't tell what I'm really, really missing.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:30.560]   I do have a two-year-old iPhone in my hardware library.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.360]   And I fired up and used it several times over the course
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.960]   of a week for this, that, and the other.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:38.880]   And yep, I noticed that it's a little bit more liquid
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.120]   in its responses.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.880]   I noticed that the camera app is maybe a little faster,
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.040]   little things like that.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:48.240]   But not the sort of thing that if I were a general user
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.720]   in a store looking at-- here is a--
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:51.920]   I'm at the AT&T store.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.200]   I'm at the Verizon store, wherever.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.360]   I can get-- here's-- they show me one phone for--
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.200]   I can get free with a two-year contract.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.720]   An iPhone that I can get for $500, $600, $700,
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.680]   I'm not sure that I would see enough of a difference
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:06.560]   between the two.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:08.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:11.680]   Table stakes are pretty high in the phone game right now.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:15.120]   That's why I asked you.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.080]   On the other hand, I'm just using the iPhone.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.760]   I'm tempted like hell.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.320]   I love-- I like the camera on my 4A,
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.440]   but every time that I've got my iPhone 10 out there,
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.280]   and I'm taking pictures with that, I'm like, ooh.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:32.800]   Not only that, but the photo apps that you can use alongside
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:38.520]   with it, and how easily you can edit a video with it.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.880]   Google is just now pushing out features for video editing
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:44.440]   in its photos app that it already gave to iOS a couple
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.720]   of years ago that iOS has already had like five years ago.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.240]   Of course, all your friends, except for Russell,
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.440]   are making iOS apps, Andy.
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:50.880]   They just keep teasing you every day.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:53.560]   Well, and it's ironic, both Andy and I own not
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.560]   the current generation Pixel phone,
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.400]   but the previous generation.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.880]   And I have a Pixel 4, and I didn't buy a Pixel 5
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.400]   because I felt like they spent the entire presentation
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.360]   repudiating, calling me an idiot for buying the Pixel 4,
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:05.920]   and I like it.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:06.640]   I thought it was great.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.720]   I wanted a successor to that.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:08.720]   It's cool.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.720]   It's fine.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.240]   That's great.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:10.760]   But like the thing--
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.760]   That's the stagnation.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.440]   There's nothing driving you to get the latest one.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.440]   I don't think it was stagnation.
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:19.000]   I think they had a massive problem with execution.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.400]   They had a vice president who was on a very different page
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.440]   than the product manager who was on a very different page
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.160]   than the product team.
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.400]   None of them were paying attention.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.240]   They like, find out about all these problems three minutes
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:28.880]   before you change it.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.720]   But you're talking about Rick Osterloab coming on and saying,
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.240]   I don't like the battery life on this.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.920]   But even like this cancels the silicon,
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.400]   and they start doing new silicon.
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.640]   Like, don't fire everybody and then announce
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.920]   you're making another chip.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.760]   Like, keep them employed.
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:41.880]   Well, here's a data point.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.560]   I think a stupid data point, but I'll
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.520]   bring it up because it made a lot of headlines
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:49.960]   from an Irish study from Trinity College Dublin.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:53.280]   Smartphones share our data every four and a half minutes,
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.320]   says study.
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:55.880]   It's the price.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:56.520]   It's that long.
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.480]   Yeah, I am.
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:01.760]   Yeah, because of your location data--
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.120]   I mean, you could think there's a lot of data.
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.240]   The study noted that Google handsets
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.240]   collected a notably larger volume of handset data
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:12.280]   than Apple, a megabyte being sent every 12 hours
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:16.560]   for the pixel handsets compared to 52 kilobytes every 12 hours.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.040]   Come on, go.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.000]   It's got to be constant.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.320]   And so does the carrier's got to be monitoring you constantly.
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.280]   The other thing is--
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:26.120]   They said the data potentially sent back by the handsets
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:30.600]   included the IMEI and the Wi-Fi MAC address in the hardware.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:33.040]   But potentially doesn't mean it is.
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.800]   They tell us, we'll hatch more eggs
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.400]   if we share our data constantly with them.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.360]   That data's going to them.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.560]   Isn't that doing it for the goodness?
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.960]   You're talking about Pokemon Go, of course.
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.160]   That knows everything.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.480]   I turn off everything, but they're like,
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.960]   you'll hatch eggs twice as fast if you give us location.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:46.760]   OK.
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:49.200]   And every time you're on a Wi-Fi network,
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.360]   you have to send your MAC address.
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:52.520]   That's just in the packet.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.640]   Well, Apple randomizes it.
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:55.640]   But the carrier-- remember the carrier was selling?
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:58.160]   They were selling our location data to bounty hunters.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.120]   But that's an important point that this study didn't even
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:03.200]   bring up is, yes, the Apple iPhones are sending MAC addresses.
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.760]   It's just it's different every 15 minutes.
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:08.320]   And they didn't even mention that.
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:13.600]   I mean, I have to say this is a pretty dopey study,
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.000]   but I thought I'd bring it up.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.480]   But it's important that we bring it up,
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.720]   because when you have studies that are this bad,
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.520]   it makes it hard to present the real argument with real evidence.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.080]   I agree.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.640]   And so that's a problem.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:26.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.000]   So it's not helping.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:27.960]   We'll debunk it.
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:31.240]   It's kind of a meaningless number.
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.560]   If you're using the map app, I'm
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.200]   hope it's sending data or data more than every four and a half
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.760]   minutes.
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.040]   Yeah, for turn by turn, right?
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.000]   It should be faster than that.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.400]   If you're on Wi-Fi, it sends that.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:45.360]   It has to send every time it sends a packet, it's sending data.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:49.280]   So I don't-- yes, it's meaningless.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.160]   Somebody-- I hope so.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.040]   I hope it gets his DHT.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.640]   It was like there was another article that said Instagram
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:56.160]   was the most data-hungry app based on the things that it was
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.480]   shown to be collecting when they put the app store--
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:58.960]   The label.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:07:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:07:59.760]   --label's live.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:00.260]   Yeah.
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:01.520]   It is the biggest label.
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:03.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.800]   OK.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:05.760]   Congratulations.
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:06.840]   You have the biggest label.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:12.080]   If anybody wants to go to Disneyland, it seems to me
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:12.760]   premature.
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:17.200]   But if you wanted to, you could use your Apple Watch to get in.
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:21.640]   Disney's Magic Mobile option launches on Apple devices,
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:24.200]   including the Apple Watch.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.400]   You have to have their app.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.760]   But then you can hold your Apple Watch or iPhone or others.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.440]   You could use it Pixel phone.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:33.960]   You hold it up to the access point,
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:38.080]   and you'll get all-- just like a Magic Band.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.040]   I think there's going to be a lot of opportunities with the phone
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:43.400]   and AR and Disney or all amusement parks.
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:43.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:46.560]   I've just been able to find where you're trying to go next,
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:51.320]   being able to play entirely different games or adventures
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.760]   within the Disney thing just on your phone
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.800]   or within any amusement park or any location.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.360]   But there are people that are playing there to play.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:00.120]   And you could have all kinds of little challenges
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.000]   and all kinds of things that can be done with the phone.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.800]   And so it'll be interesting to see how far they take that.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.840]   No, that's such a good point.
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.080]   I think was it today or yesterday that Google announced
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:13.080]   that they're now bringing their localized turn-by-turn
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:17.240]   directions inside airport terminals, inside malls.
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:21.320]   And I mean in the sense that if you ask, hey, where's
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.640]   the rent-a-card desk?
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:27.040]   And in AR sort of AR venue, you hold up your phone.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:29.480]   It will show-- keep turning this way, this way, this way.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:32.240]   OK, now go downstairs like this.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.880]   And that's the sort of stuff that makes--
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:38.080]   it makes you into a, wow, I've been reading all these horrible
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.280]   things about Google harvesting data.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:46.760]   But gee, my Google map not only told me where the Star Wars--
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.560]   where I can see the Millennium Falcon,
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.200]   but I also told me exactly what the length of the ride
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.280]   weight is so I can schedule things perfectly.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.480]   Well, I'm such a Google fan now.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.760]   Well, the people who are not going to be Google fans about
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.960]   that is that the AR-- that is probably going to be the number
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.400]   one use for AR soon.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.200]   It's just I want to know where I'm going inside of a venue.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:08.560]   Of course, the fight that we saw in sports a while ago may
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.840]   come into this, which is that Google doesn't owe anybody
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.000]   anything that is on the walls.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.840]   And so when you go up to do this, it could replace all of the
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:21.080]   ads, all the billboards and everything else in the airport
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:24.760]   all the way down with their own display ads.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.320]   You know, like so.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:29.480]   So they don't need to-- they can just literally--
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.960]   once they have AR and they have a 3D model of what's there,
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.400]   right now it's just curves.
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.960]   But if they have the actual data, they can just start
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.240]   adding all kinds of things into your viewport.
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:43.480]   I doubt that they would do that except for with a floaty
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:46.480]   pop-ups, because if you think about it, if I'm looking for,
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:51.320]   OK, so I need to walk towards the big ad for fruit bars.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:53.640]   And then you look up, you don't see an ad for fruit bars.
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.640]   OK, well, maybe I turned around the wrong place.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.680]   That would be so anathema to the point.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.800]   But I agree with you that if there is an easy way for them
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.400]   to put a little star saying, oh, by the way, there's a
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:04.400]   cinnabon over there.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.320]   And if you paint it with your Google page--
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.680]   with Google page.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.680]   You could also--
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:09.360]   Don't do that.
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.880]   2,000 calories free.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:12.880]   Or you could also--
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:14.360]   On this case, like--
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:17.720]   I'm just glad Cinnabon is not offering a free Cinnabon for
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:21.160]   a vet vaccine, because I would be dead.
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.360]   Cinnabon is even too big for me.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:27.400]   And I bought an entire bakery birthday cake for the 300th
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.120]   episode of mine.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.880]   And I ate the whole thing in two or three days.
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:33.440]   But even with that low bar, I will not have a cinnabon,
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:34.600]   because--
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:37.480]   I'm genuinely curious, though, does Facebook bid with Google
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:38.880]   for the airport space?
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.720]   Like, is there going to be a bunch of AR advertising
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:41.120]   companies?
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.720]   Like, who owns the kids' school?
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.440]   Amazon put a giant toilet paper on sale.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.080]   But we can't--
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:46.960]   That's all in question.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:51.640]   Now, there's a new company selling NFTs against people's
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.360]   Twitter accounts.
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.600]   And they didn't ask permission.
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:56.960]   I mean, they just do.
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:01.560]   And you really wonder what ownership is going to mean
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.160]   in a digital future.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.080]   I don't know.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:04.760]   I don't know.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.040]   I mean, does a school own the airspace for--
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:11.320]   they add space for the school?
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:11.840]   I don't know.
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:12.680]   We'll see.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:13.560]   It's like water rights.
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.080]   Like everyone assumes they own them on water.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.520]   And they don't find out in some states you don't.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:17.680]   Right.
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:21.440]   They'd have an awfully hard time blocking
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:25.280]   a phone from receiving ads from one specific ad carrier, though.
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:26.520]   That would be such a--
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:29.120]   that would be so technologically obnoxious
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.120]   that it would violate some sort of a law, I think.
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.320]   So would it look like Wreck-and-Ralph?
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:34.560]   You'll show up at your kid's school
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.560]   and you'll put on your glasses.
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.480]   There'll be 800 ads.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.200]   Like, it looked like Hong Kong in the 80s.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.200]   800 ads over your kid's school?
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.200]   Great.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:44.080]   It would have kept me awake and like two in the afternoon
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:45.000]   and then on Thursday.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:45.560]   That's for sure.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.280]   We're just not made to handle this new--
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.840]   I'm waiting for Alex to fix this.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.400]   So boomers get the vaccine.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:55.240]   Boomers also get the Apple Watch.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:13:00.480]   And a new study from PLOS 1 says that if you're wearing an Apple
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:07.920]   Watch, it can be used to diagnose your frailty.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.200]   Your frailty.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:09.640]   It's good.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.160]   I need that.
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:11.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:14.680]   Actually, this was a study with 110 participants
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:17.360]   supplied each with an iPhone and Apple Watch running
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:22.560]   some special research app called the VASK Track.
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.400]   They were followed for six months.
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:29.560]   They did something called six-minute walk tests, performed
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:32.360]   both at clinics and at home weekly.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:36.800]   That's one of the things the VASK trap app does.
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.000]   And it-- VASK.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.760]   Apparently, the six-minute walk test
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:43.720]   is the gold standard for frailty.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:49.280]   If you can walk 300 meters in six minutes, you're good.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.120]   Anything less, you're frail.
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:53.240]   And the Apple Watch actually turned out
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:57.760]   to be about 90% accurate in predicting frailty.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.360]   I think I'd come up with another word
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.160]   to say it.
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.080]   Isn't it good work?
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:03.280]   Make it like the purple ring or whatever.
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:06.000]   Don't say--
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   The watch--
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.120]   Here's your badge.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.640]   You scored 800 frailty points this week.
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:11.560]   Keep it up.
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.960]   Essentially, the data the watch is collecting
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:17.520]   matched the data the six-minute walk test predicted.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.120]   So without doing a six-minute walk test--
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.920]   in other words, just by wearing your Apple Watch,
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.640]   you're actually-- a clinician could actually use the data
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:28.480]   from the Apple Watch to get that kind of information
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.120]   without a six-minute walk test, I guess, is the point.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:33.080]   The interesting thing is that we're
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:36.360]   going to, as we start to find, where it's accurate
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.880]   and where it may not be accurate, I
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:43.040]   think that the real interesting is just the mass, the sheer scale
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:45.680]   of what we can do studies on, even if it's anonymous.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:48.560]   That's why Apple's talked a lot about anonymized data.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:52.480]   They don't need the data of who you are exactly.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.240]   What they need is, like, what does that eventually
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:55.960]   connecting that?
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.720]   And if Apple can build that trust-- and I think this
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:00.520]   is part of why Apple's building so much trust with people
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:01.920]   around privacy--
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.640]   is that if you're willing to share more personal data
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:08.040]   with Apple, you wouldn't share it with someone else,
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:12.240]   the amount of-- they start connecting your medical situation
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:15.720]   with what the watch is returning.
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:17.400]   They're going to see all kinds of things.
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:19.240]   They're going to see all kinds of things that are important,
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:23.320]   like they'll see precursors to heart attacks and strokes
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:28.320]   and a variety of-- they'll learn that you have Parkinson's,
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.200]   maybe six years before you have it,
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.720]   because there's some weird little thing
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.360]   that you do with your wrist that no one's going to notice.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:35.760]   You're not going to even notice.
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.800]   And now you can be treated earlier.
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:38.760]   You can slow it down.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:41.360]   You can-- Alzheimer's, all these things,
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.320]   there'll be little ticks that you won't--
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:44.440]   you can't see in real time.
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:48.280]   It's kind of like watching a time lapse
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:51.120]   that you'll see certain things that you can't see.
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:54.200]   Like, I did a time lapse the other day of the clouds
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.600]   outside my house.
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:56.760]   And it's fascinating.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.440]   You think of them as like they're just sitting up there.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.960]   You barely ever see them moving.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:03.200]   When you do it for-- run it for four hours,
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.320]   you just see this incredible dance of stuff going through it.
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.560]   You really see how fluid it is.
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.720]   In the same sense, you're going to see a lot of things.
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.280]   We're going to see a lot of data.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:18.600]   You're going to see things that you couldn't see in real time
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.200]   and with individuals with all their data all hidden.
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:27.880]   Weird story out of Arizona--
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:31.960]   last Wednesday, the Arizona State Senate agenda
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.040]   said the first item they were going to vote on
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:39.200]   was a bill that's been suggested in other states.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.000]   I think it failed in North Dakota
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.040]   that would allow developers in Arizona
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:47.200]   to use to bypass the Apple App Store.
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:51.600]   The bill was on the agenda and then didn't happen.
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:54.600]   And Apple's now being accused of doing some kind of backroom
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.840]   deal to prevent the vote.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.960]   I'm sure Apple would like to prevent the vote.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:04.800]   Apple has a lobbyist, Rod Dyradon, who's a former,
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:05.960]   I think, former member of Congress.
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:07.160]   Bobby's too.
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:07.800]   That's their job.
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:08.800]   Yeah.
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:09.840]   Who's getting paid?
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:10.360]   Yeah.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.080]   I mean, that's what I mean everywhere.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:12.680]   That's what I mean.
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:13.680]   That's what I mean.
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.760]   Well, the thing is, is that a lot of these laws that
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.040]   are getting passed are all written--
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.200]   they're all written by some lobbyist.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.520]   Like, do you think that the lawmakers actually wrote those?
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.920]   No, exactly.
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:23.440]   Right.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.920]   So they look exactly--
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:27.080]   I think that they found that the Arizona one and the South
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:30.000]   Dakota one looked exactly the same or almost exactly the same.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.320]   And it's somewhat else writing it than they hand them.
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.000]   So the thing is, is that they're not--
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   so they say that it just means that one lobbyist was more
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.360]   effective than the other lobbyist.
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.320]   I mean, it's not somehow--
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:44.720]   I mean, it's not any more manipulated than it was anyway.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.480]   Dave-- David, Hannah Meyer, Hanson, Basecamp, Co-founder.
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:49.200]   And a guy has been very critical of Apple.
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:53.280]   Remember that running they had with their Hay email app
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:57.720]   with Apple said, seeing how the corrupt--
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:00.120]   I mean, lobbying-- he's starting to see in corruption,
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:03.760]   obviously-- works this close and brazenly is something else.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:07.320]   But Apple can't buy all the legislators in all the states.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:10.280]   So he's lobbying for passage.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:12.640]   I just wish his Twitter account wasn't on Fast Forward
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:13.800]   when his brain's on rewind.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:16.880]   Like, he's such a smart person, but he just--
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.800]   he tweets without any--
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:19.560]   That's Twitter, man.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.640]   Just investing anything in it.
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:21.960]   That's what everybody does.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:22.440]   It's awesome.
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.360]   Actually, remember that DHH was also
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.760]   the guy who stimulated an investigation when he said
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:32.400]   that Apple card discriminated against his wife, who
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:36.480]   got a lower credit limit than he did.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.320]   That has now been fully investigated.
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.960]   And Goldman Sachs has been exonerated.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:44.560]   The FTC says, nope, we cannot find any discrimination
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:48.280]   in the Apple card credit limits.
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:53.600]   So another example of DHH tweeting with his mouth.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:56.600]   Not his brain.
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:57.120]   I like David.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:57.560]   Smart guy.
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.880]   I just wish he would guess--
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:18:59.520]   no, I like him.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:18:59.720]   Great.
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.280]   I just wish he would think.
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.840]   He would give himself a day before he composed his Twitter.
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:06.320]   But it could have been there was a backroom deal.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.840]   We just-- we don't know.
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:08.840]   But that's what people do.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.360]   But he's got a huge platform for them.
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:10.920]   We don't know.
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.040]   That's what people do on Twitter.
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:12.680]   That's what Twitter does.
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.400]   I have a firm believer that with big audience
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.800]   becomes big responsibility.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:17.000]   Yes.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.880]   Yes, that's an interesting thought.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.120]   Apple is apparently developing a new remote
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.480]   in Hallelujah for the next generation Apple TV.
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:30.360]   This story from 9 to 5 Mac, 9 to 5 sources.
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:32.600]   Tell them the model is being developed into the code
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.840]   named B519.
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:37.240]   The current remote is B439.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:40.680]   So we know there's something new in the mix.
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:41.680]   I don't think that--
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:43.880]   I actually don't think it needs any of the buttons.
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:46.640]   Like, you know, the thing is, any app now that requires me
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.400]   to use the buttons, I'm just like, oh, now I
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:49.840]   got to look down at night.
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:50.640]   You know, like with the--
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:52.240]   What would you do on screen?
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:56.080]   I literally will almost always interact everything
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.440]   from the top part of the remote, just that whole area.
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:00.040]   I know the volume rocker.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:04.120]   And I guess my system is set the way my system's set up.
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.440]   I can't really do volume.
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.240]   So that might be part of the problem.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:08.080]   No, no, I do volume.
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:09.280]   I do volume, but it's separate from--
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.640]   I can't do it from the Apple TV.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.800]   It's the go over there.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:12.880]   There's the app and turn it up.
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.280]   Surround sound and all this and stuff.
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.520]   So I don't--
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:21.080]   So anyway, so yeah, but without that,
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:22.640]   I guess you could have volume rockers.
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:25.000]   But outside of that, I don't need any--
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.240]   all the other stuff, like the menu and the play,
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.480]   when they started actually following the, I guess,
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:31.840]   the guidance, it became actually harder to use.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.800]   For a long time, most of the apps would just
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.680]   work with just clicking on the top piece
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:37.600]   and just moving your thumb around.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:40.960]   And that was-- it was working until literally like a year ago.
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:42.720]   And then they started-- they started doing something
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.040]   where you actually have to hit the buttons.
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:44.840]   Half the apps are different.
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.080]   Half the apps, the menu leaves half the apps.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.000]   The menu gives you the options for the app.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.720]   Like, there's no consistency in the control.
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:51.560]   It gets worse.
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.960]   Like the YouTube app is a good example
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:58.120]   of something that barely works on the controller,
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:00.960]   but works fine if you use the phone controller.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.920]   So if you open up your phone and run it there,
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:04.920]   it works just fine.
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:05.920]   That's Google's fault.
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:06.840]   That's YouTube's fault.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:07.720]   Yeah, no, it's something--
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:08.280]   It's a bad app.
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.120]   It's a bad app.
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:09.960]   And it's a bad app.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.120]   Like Amazon is the OpenGL app.
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.000]   They just ported it over.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000]   And it's a horrible experience.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:14.520]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:15.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:18.440]   So I hope someday we'll see a new Apple TV.
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.360]   And maybe it'll come with a new remote.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.200]   A rainbow connection.
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.560]   I hope that my biggest feature requests
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.360]   are the remote.
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:26.360]   You're not going to get your wish.
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.200]   You're not going to get your wish.
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:27.880]   No buttons.
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:28.360]   No buttons.
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:28.880]   No buttons.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:29.520]   No, no, no.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:30.120]   No, no, no.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.120]   That's just the inside.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.280]   The biggest thing I want is ultra wideband tracker.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.800]   I want one of the trackers in the remote
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:39.160]   so that I can figure out where in the couch it is.
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.040]   Like, it's just--
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.480]   You need to duct tape it down to the counter.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:46.680]   It wouldn't work then, though.
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:50.040]   Leaker, Max Wineback via everything Apple Pro.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:53.080]   To be trusted or no, Renee Ritchie.
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.400]   He's a very, very good Samsung Leaker.
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.280]   He is a mixed bag of Apple leaks.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.360]   Like, he got the color really well last year.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:02.360]   But then he had a bunch of weird stuff that didn't make any sense.
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:05.320]   So he's really, really good at Samsung.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.240]   He's got a mixed record for Apple.
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.160]   He has a video.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:09.640]   He says AirTags.
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:12.440]   He's got, apparently, some inside dope.
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:16.080]   Are 32 by 32 by 6 millimeters.
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:18.400]   It'll use the Find My Network from devices
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:22.960]   to send the UUID of the AirTag to the Apple servers for pinging.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:23.920]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.280]   He says 39 bucks.
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:28.960]   That seems about--
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.120]   To shoot for Apple.
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.240]   That's not true for Apple.
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:34.160]   That's right.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:38.360]   He does not confirm Love to Dream's previous speculation
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:41.880]   that there would be two sizes of AirTags.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:45.880]   Or maybe he's just saying, I know this size.
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:47.200]   Love to Dream has been weird lately.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.440]   He privated his account.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.840]   And then he started saying, the 23rd was just a reference
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.440]   to you going out and having a great meal.
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:55.440]   And then today, he was tweeting something else that was odd.
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:23:00.280]   Hey, at least Prosser had the kahone's to shave his eyebrows.
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:01.960]   We've all been suffering for it ever since.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:04.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:07.280]   What is the consensus on?
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.280]   Will there be an event in April?
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:10.600]   We now know there's one in June.
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:14.520]   So they could just put everything off till then.
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:18.120]   The more frequent events make it easier to give everything
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.160]   to time it needs on.
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.880]   And so I feel like there should be something.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:27.420]   I think that it makes sense to get some stuff out
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.080]   of the way before June.
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:30.840]   You want some air around some of these announcements
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:33.320]   so that they actually get attention?
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.080]   As I have mentioned before, I gave up
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:39.760]   waiting for what I really would like, which is either a Mini iMac
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:44.080]   Pro or a Mini Mac Pro rather, or a Mac Mini
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:46.080]   with more juice.
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.240]   And I just ended up buying a PC gaming machine.
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:50.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:51.240]   Let me just end it down.
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:52.240]   How did he do that?
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.760]   He said it's coming in a second now.
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:55.440]   I gave up.
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:56.280]   No, I even just--
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.960]   No, I realized with the iMac Pro.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.440]   And I realized the iMac Pro is great,
[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.360]   but I was tied to this monitor.
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:03.960]   And I wanted--
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:04.800]   I was jealous.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.440]   Lisa has this wide screen curved monitor.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.680]   I was jealous.
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:13.200]   So that's why I wanted either a Mini Mac Pro, which was rumored,
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:15.520]   and maybe will come out, but probably not
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.800]   before the end of the year.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.760]   Or improved Mac Mini.
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:21.760]   I don't have high hopes for that for a while.
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:24.600]   So I just bought a PC.
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:25.400]   You can now--
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.360]   No, if you bought it, the means the rest of us get it.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.160]   OK, good.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.680]   Congratulations.
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:32.640]   You can now join our Unreal training in office hours.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.560]   We're doing Unreal training on starting on Saturday.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:42.480]   I got an Alien where it's got a GTX 3080 and an AMD 3800.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:49.160]   And it's got a big fan of really, really, fairly noisy fan.
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:52.480]   The reviewers say, I thought I had a vacuum cleaner running
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:54.200]   when I turned the sounds like a helicopter.
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:56.560]   Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how to handle that.
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.040]   But I also-- I went a little crazy.
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:01.880]   I also got a 55-inch OLED gaming monitor.
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:02.960]   It's kind of cool.
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:03.840]   It's big.
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:06.080]   But bigger than Lisa's, which was the only really thing
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:07.480]   I cared about.
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:10.440]   I'm just impressed you managed to get that hardware.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.560]   Yeah, they shipped it.
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.560]   They shipped it.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:13.560]   It's coming Thursday.
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.920]   That's why I bought an Alienware because it wasn't any way.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:17.840]   I was going to get a 3080 in any--
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.480]   Preconfigured game frame or a Ryzen 7.
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:24.080]   So yeah, that's disappointing.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:28.320]   I was so looking forward to building a PC in 2021.
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:32.000]   But that was-- in 2020, then OK, maybe we'll wait until 2021.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.280]   And now I'm thinking, oh, damn it.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:36.840]   Maybe if I set my sights on onboard graphics,
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.880]   I'll just build a nice little Linux box for 500.
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:40.880]   Well, that's by the way.
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:41.880]   Very pie.
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:43.280]   And that's why I can't take your Unreal training.
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:45.800]   I'm suspecting is-- the first thing I'm doing
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.080]   is blowing windows off of it and putting Linux on it.
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:50.760]   Can I do Unreal training with Linux?
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:51.760]   You can.
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:54.160]   I think there's-- yeah, I should figure it out.
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:55.960]   Yeah, we're doing it.
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:59.400]   So we've got head of immersive from a Drexel University,
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.040]   Nick Joshson.
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:00.560]   Oh, cool.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.160]   And so we're going to learn how to do real digital sets.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:07.800]   So like a digital set inside of Unreal should be fun.
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:08.880]   Next four weeks.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.240]   That's really exciting.
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:11.240]   10 o'clock.
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.680]   You could come in.
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:13.680]   It's all 10 AM.
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:14.960]   No experience necessary.
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:15.960]   10 AM.
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:16.960]   No experience necessary.
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:17.480]   OK.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:17.980]   Pacific.
[01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:18.800]   I might do that.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:19.720]   Just let day.
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:21.080]   I'll send you a link.
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.640]   It's going to be in the next four Saturdays.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:23.120]   Thanks for--
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:23.880]   Oh, I could do that.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:25.480]   Well, I have a radio show at 11.
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.480]   So I'll only learn half of it.
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:29.120]   Yeah, you could come and sit for a little bit.
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:31.120]   I'll learn half of it.
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:33.120]   Just don't be thrown.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:35.240]   If when you appear as a new face,
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:38.560]   all the other guys starts shouting, one of us.
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:39.800]   One of us.
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:46.760]   I am looking forward to it.
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.120]   I thought it was coming yesterday.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.880]   So I tore out everything.
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:55.520]   The Mac, I had two cinema display monitors and an iMac.
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:57.440]   And Lisa's going to get the iMac Pro
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:00.120]   because she needed a faster iMac anyway.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:03.920]   To go with her 59-inch monitor.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:04.920]   Amazing.
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.760]   Damn, those things are nice.
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:08.800]   It's nice to have a big monitor, I think.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:17.720]   We'll see if 49 inches by 30 inches is going to work.
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:20.880]   I feel like everything's going to be like very big.
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:21.480]   But we'll see.
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:22.600]   I don't know how that'll--
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:25.280]   Again, once you go to a three monitor setup,
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.600]   it's so hard to settle for anything else.
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.560]   I have three.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.280]   So this is really one monitor that's as big as four.
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.560]   I know.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:35.520]   I'm not including the one on the laptop, the one on the iPad,
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.280]   the one on the--
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:39.080]   It's like 4 HD screens on one screen.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.400]   I think that's a good solution.
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:42.360]   I think that's a good way of doing it.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.000]   I'm trying to get down below six,
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000]   but I haven't figured that out yet.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.680]   I got six and a couple of them are quads.
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:50.880]   So they have-- so I get a couple more signals to them.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:51.880]   Wow.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:54.040]   Is that why your face is so tan?
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:54.840]   Do you have--
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:55.840]   Exactly.
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:58.840]   Do you have-- is that the equivalent of the trucker's
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:01.880]   sunburn that the video streamers--
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:05.240]   everything else is pale white, but from here to about here?
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:08.840]   I'm just totally under it all the time.
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:17.240]   So a brand new play performed at the Steve Jobs Theater
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:20.880]   is going to be appearing for the next four weeks on Apple TV.
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:25.800]   For free, you don't have to have an Apple TV+ account.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:28.680]   The 12 Angry Men and Women-- true stories
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:31.840]   of being a black man in America today,
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:33.680]   produced by the Billy Holiday Theater
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:35.880]   at the Steve Jobs Theater.
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:36.560]   That's amazing.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:40.200]   That will be really interesting to see,
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.320]   because it doesn't have a proscenium arch.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:44.280]   Does it not been there?
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:46.640]   Oh, they could build in what they can build up to build on.
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:48.000]   I'm sure they prepared for everything.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.680]   But maybe you don't want it to be a proscenium.
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:51.240]   Maybe you want it to be more flexible.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.240]   I don't know.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.240]   Maybe you want it to be flexible.
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.480]   I can't wait to see how they produce it there.
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:59.080]   There's a reason why the Steve Jobs Theater is not
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:00.680]   like inside the campus.
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:02.960]   It's not inside the ring.
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:05.840]   It's because it's publicly accessible
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:08.240]   so that if they want to use it as a venue for--
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:10.480]   not just for their own events, but also for, hey,
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:13.240]   here's a space that people we like can produce their own events.
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.680]   Billy Eilish did a concert there in 2019.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.360]   Without snooping at their devices.
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:20.040]   This is the first time a theatrical group
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:24.280]   has been allowed to use the theater as a theater.
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:25.800]   But that's kind of cool.
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.880]   I don't know if they had an audience or they just produced it,
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:29.360]   probably just produced it for video.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:29.760]   I bet.
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:38.320]   You'd be happy to hear Renee that Niantic could be developing.
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.880]   This is how 9 to 5 Mac makes this an Apple story.
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.120]   And I'm going to go along with it.
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:44.560]   It's own Apple AR Glasses competitor.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.480]   I don't know.
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:45.480]   That's--
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.480]   John Hanky.
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:47.080]   You jeez.
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:48.920]   I don't know if that's really--
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:52.840]   So they could be developing a competitor to a product
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:54.240]   that Apple might be making.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:54.840]   Right.
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:56.280]   Got it.
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:58.880]   But John Hanky, the CEO of Niantic,
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:02.880]   did kind of tweet this picture of what clearly--
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:04.080]   that's a Glasses lens.
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:06.760]   And this is the temple piece of kind of large.
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:07.440]   The text is--
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:07.880]   So why?
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.600]   Why tweet this?
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.280]   Yeah, why?
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:11.800]   Exciting to see the progress we're
[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:14.400]   making to enable new kinds of devices that
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.600]   leverage our platform.
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:19.040]   Of course, Hanky, remember, was a special guest
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:25.120]   with the Windows HoloLens keynote at Ignite.
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:25.880]   So I guess he's just--
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:27.160]   And he's been on Apple stages too.
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:28.160]   And he has been on Apple.
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:29.160]   Yeah.
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:31.640]   So he's agnostic, I guess.
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.920]   What is your theory, Renee?
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.640]   Why would he tweet this?
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:36.400]   Is it imminent?
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:36.740]   I know.
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:39.760]   I think he's been talking about AR for a long time.
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.720]   Like, clearly, all the stuff that they've been building
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:42.760]   is very AR-centric.
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:44.280]   And I think once he left Google, that
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:47.240]   was clearly real world AR experiences were clearly
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.120]   high on his product demand.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:49.480]   Yeah.
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:52.040]   With Pokemon Go and Ingress, he probably
[01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:54.800]   has more AR experience than anybody in the world, right?
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:55.300]   Yeah.
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:56.840]   And they're doing a lot of really good stuff.
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:59.600]   It's just-- this will be one of their first hardware products,
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:00.840]   if not their first hardware product.
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.440]   And the timing, it's not under a lot of--
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:03.880]   it's not like--
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:04.840]   Usually, they don't have to rush it out.
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:05.960]   --it's just like this because you're
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.760]   desperate of your stockholders are like,
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:09.320]   we demand to see action.
[01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:10.080]   I'm just curious.
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:11.600]   Is he trying to incite something?
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:12.680]   It's interesting.
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:15.680]   I think that every year--
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.160]   I mean, with the rumors, every year
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:19.440]   that you get closer to June, everyone
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:21.000]   wants to make sure that they're not
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.640]   seeing someone who followed.
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:23.640]   They copied.
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:25.440]   They want to make sure that they said, hey,
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.040]   we're working on something.
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.040]   And they don't know what year that this is going to drop.
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:31.160]   But it will drop in a June, most likely.
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:32.960]   That's the most likely time because you'd
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:34.920]   want to show developers what that is.
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.760]   And so I think that you'll see a bunch of announcements that
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:40.400]   are AR-related going up to June because they don't know.
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:42.200]   No one except Apple knows.
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:44.280]   And probably only four people at Apple know.
[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:45.560]   That's an excellent point.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:48.000]   I still think that wearable devices from Apple
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.840]   are still kind of a long ways off.
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:51.240]   But I'm prepared--
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:51.760]   I think you're right.
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:52.200]   I'm ahead.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:53.640]   It's most likely.
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:57.480]   But I think that I'm prepared at any June for Apple
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:03.560]   to surprise us by saying, here is a $2,000 AR development kit.
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:07.400]   That is a device that we just sort of subcontracted out
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:13.800]   that we ported our stack onto so that when we want people
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:18.480]   to experiment with AR to show how good our AR tools are.
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:22.200]   And our AR tools are so good that if we were to conceivably
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:25.280]   come up with our own AR or VR goggles,
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:27.480]   you would be assured that all the development you've
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.680]   put into our platform as opposed to someone else's
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:31.360]   platform was not wasted because it
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.040]   will be completely compatible.
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:36.840]   And the setup has been just so far
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:40.800]   with the rollout of basic AR, the rollout of IK chains,
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:43.120]   the rollout of LiDAR, the rollout of--
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:47.960]   and all these things are setting all the chess pieces
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:50.720]   into place for whenever that occurs.
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:53.160]   If it's 20, 20-- this year, next year, two years,
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:54.800]   or three years from now, all it means
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:57.080]   is there's just more things in the same way
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:33:02.000]   that the M1 chip was probably five, 10 years in development.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.880]   And so I think that it's going to be a really--
[01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:07.280]   but I think it worries everyone because if Apple's spending
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:11.200]   that much time on it, it means they plan to shock
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:12.760]   and awe-camping.
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.960]   And I think everyone knows that this is a big, big, big market
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:19.920]   in education, in corporate, in locations, at home.
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.320]   It's going to be-- I still think the AR will--
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.560]   once we see it really turn on, it'll
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:26.440]   end up being bigger than the phone.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:30.440]   I just think that everybody who's playing in the space,
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.680]   Google, Apple, everybody, they understand
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:35.120]   that it's going to be a few years before there's anything
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:38.760]   that's even remotely practical as a wearable of that kind.
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:40.720]   But that's good because that's OK because it's
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:43.360]   going to take a few years to build up the software
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:47.320]   and build up the knowledge in the development community
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:49.040]   to make sure that by the time we're
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:52.240]   trying to make that really, really hard sell that, yes,
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.200]   please put this thing on your face
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:56.360]   and go out in the world and expect people to treat you
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:57.200]   seriously.
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:00.120]   And there will be software and resources
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:02.480]   that will make it worth the ridicule
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:06.000]   and being laughed at by mean teenage girls.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.520]   Well, and I think that part of that
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:11.000]   is the fact that all these apps have been coming out that--
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.600]   like, again, because it sits on the iPad,
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:18.120]   because it sits on the iPhone, that developers have been--
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:21.800]   I've been doing AR tests for the last two years,
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:24.520]   shooting content, putting stuff into AR creators,
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.040]   looking at what it looks like on my phone,
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:28.680]   tracking it to my living room.
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:30.400]   I've gotten to the point now where there's a couple of us
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:33.360]   that are texting USDZs back and forth all the time.
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:35.600]   Look at this and check this out.
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.000]   So that stuff is all-- a lot of us
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.800]   are becoming aware of it.
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:41.480]   And I think it's part of--
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:44.400]   because we are doing all of that, we're realizing, oh, my gosh,
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:48.040]   this would be so much easier if I had something on my glasses
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:50.720]   and I wouldn't be holding this up for the last half hour.
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:55.960]   And so-- but it's a stunning opportunity.
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:59.920]   All developers also need something to build to target to.
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.840]   I still remember that when there were rumors
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:07.640]   that I had a pre-release iPad, like the first one,
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:10.440]   I was getting so many texts and emails
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:12.800]   from friends who were developers who were saying,
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:17.320]   I have no idea if this interface makes any sense whatsoever
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:19.160]   on a tablet.
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:23.000]   If you were to have one of these things,
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.040]   do you suppose that this code would--
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:29.200]   and that's the difficulty that you get when you can emulate it
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:31.640]   all you want, you can hold up your phone all you want.
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:33.640]   At some point, you have to experience it the way
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:35.000]   that the consumer is going to experience.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.520]   And that's not going to happen until you have some hardware,
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:40.160]   even if it's just something that is designed for developers
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:42.720]   and not intended for consumers in any way.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:44.400]   Yeah, and I think that hopefully Apple
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:47.960]   learned from Google's Glass experiment that probably
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:50.440]   a lot of strict rules about what you can and can't do
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:54.640]   with the hardware ahead of time is probably a good idea.
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:57.560]   If Google had removed the camera,
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:00.000]   that could have been an entirely different story.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.400]   The bummer is that the camera was the best part.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:03.240]   Exactly.
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.360]   That's what they're talking-- the very first thing
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:08.600]   they were talking about is that, look, I want to play
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:12.040]   with my little kid, but I'm a parent,
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.400]   and I know he's growing up.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:15.400]   I think if she's growing up, I want to be able to--
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:16.840]   and that's one of the things they said,
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.360]   well, this is what's going to make it so great,
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:21.360]   but also what made people-- that was the egg freckles moment
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:26.320]   for that Google Glass never recovered from.
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:28.760]   The problem is that a lot of first adopters
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:34.280]   are not necessarily the most socially conscious of group
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:35.360]   because they're out front.
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.360]   Because they're out front.
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:36.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:38.280]   I live right inside of that.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:42.520]   So anyway, so I walked through New York City several times
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:44.600]   to my Google Glass without fear or shame.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:45.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:46.320]   I resemble them.
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:47.840]   I'm used to it.
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.280]   It's nice to think that, oh, they're
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:51.080]   ostracizing me because of the glasses,
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.000]   not because of my appearance or personality.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:53.840]   That's a nice change.
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.480]   I suggested a photo to me yesterday of me and Alex at CES,
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:58.080]   and Alex is wearing his Google Glass.
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.800]   When he was doing his one-man camera.
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:00.680]   Oh, fun.
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:01.720]   Oh, fun.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:04.720]   And the thing is, is that it was--
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:07.440]   from a training device, the glass was just amazing
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:08.880]   because it was the first thing where
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:11.400]   you could have a reasonable field of view
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:13.720]   that you could see easily, and you could also
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:14.600]   use both hands.
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:17.240]   And so being able to show things that you're doing
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:18.480]   was unbelievable.
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:21.680]   And then some of the pictures that I did take of my kids
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.000]   from glass when we were out in the park
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.600]   or doing something else when I was playing with it,
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:27.440]   it's just amazing because it's this pure point of view.
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:30.320]   And so in the Hangout training, where we were--
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:36.120]   I was training people with another glass in Africa.
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:38.840]   The amazing connection that you could create with that
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:39.360]   was amazing.
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.200]   It's just unfortunately people did other things
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:42.320]   with the frustrated people.
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.440]   There's beautiful Alex.
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:44.960]   Oh.
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:45.560]   The torch of folder.
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:46.960]   I am with my glass.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:48.880]   We're in the glass.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:49.880]   We're in the glass.
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:51.360]   Come on.
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:51.880]   Come on.
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:51.880]   Come on.
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:52.880]   Come on.
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:53.880]   Oh, sorry.
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:54.380]   Come back.
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:55.400]   We'll get there.
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:55.880]   We'll get there.
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:56.880]   There we go with the glass.
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:58.520]   It was so great.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:00.120]   Did anybody yell at you or anything?
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:00.800]   No.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:01.880]   I remember those.
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:04.840]   You were going to your head to the bathroom.
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:07.560]   And you wisely removed them, I think.
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:08.000]   Yes.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.440]   Yeah, you get conscious of what--
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:12.160]   again, I got conscious of where I should wear them
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:16.080]   and where I shouldn't.
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:19.880]   I once had a head of security for a head of state.
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:21.520]   For a head of state, I was doing this shot.
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:24.920]   He goes, he goes, these are very cool.
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:27.680]   And he had literally the entire security team come over
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:29.960]   and put the glass on.
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:31.520]   But then he once ever, they all walked away.
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:32.440]   He goes, these are very cool.
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.800]   But you cannot wear the Google I when the president is
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:35.960]   in the room.
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:37.520]   The Google I must not.
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:38.360]   Yeah, the Google I.
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.200]   I have sore on.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.440]   I think that's the other thing that first adopters
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:45.120]   going to have to overcome the risk of pink eye.
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:50.120]   Because I learned to carry those little individual alcohol
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:51.240]   wipes with me.
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:54.080]   Because even I was in Philadelphia,
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:56.040]   I was taking pictures of Independence Hall.
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:57.160]   I said, is that Google Glass?
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:58.160]   Like, what is it like?
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:01.760]   And so not wanting to be a good ambassador to technology.
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.720]   You take the glasses off, wipe them
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:06.840]   to make sure they don't get my pink eye, let them play with it.
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:10.320]   I have so many pictures of me, of strangers.
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:10.720]   I do too.
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:11.640]   I do my pictures of this thing.
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:12.160]   Right.
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:14.240]   And then wipe them off again when I get them back.
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:15.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:18.400]   I have a ton of pictures of me going like this.
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:19.000]   Nope.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.560]   I have some whole album of pictures from Comic-Cons
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:32.520]   where, OK, there's the most famous and most wonderful
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:35.520]   artists and creators, pictures of me taken by them
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:36.440]   when I was talking to them.
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.040]   And they wanted to try my Google Glass.
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:38.560]   Yeah.
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:39.060]   Yeah.
[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:43.080]   Let's see.
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:44.120]   We didn't mention it last week.
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:46.480]   I just thought I'd throw it in that there was an update
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:48.040]   to pages numbers in keynote.
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:49.640]   You know that by now.
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:52.760]   Were they anything important in the new updates?
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:53.200]   Anything.
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:53.680]   Oh, wow.
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:54.920]   It was a week ago, Leo.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:55.240]   I know.
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:56.560]   It was a week ago.
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:58.320]   I forgot to do it last week.
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:00.360]   It was exactly a week ago.
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:02.680]   And I've used them because--
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:04.440]   I thought it was Canadian tax season
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:06.840]   because Canadian taxes are usually due April 30.
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:08.320]   They didn't give us an extension this year.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.880]   I always do them in numbers.
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:11.840]   And then I went to the site and it said,
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:14.160]   do April 30 unless you're self-employed?
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:15.560]   Then it's due June 15.
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.120]   Congratulations.
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:17.920]   But you still have to pay by April 30.
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:18.400]   Oh.
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:20.360]   And then I'm thinking, oh, so I'm supposed
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:22.800]   to massively overpay just because your penalties are
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:25.120]   supposed to do your taxes so you know what to pay.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:26.560]   You might as well send them in, right?
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:27.040]   Yes.
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:31.360]   Pages 11, numbers 11, keynote 11.
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:34.360]   It's a big number update, I don't know.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:35.960]   Rosner goes to 11.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:37.840]   The one thing I really liked about them
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:39.640]   is that one thing that's universal across the three of them
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:42.560]   is the ability to specify by number.
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:44.960]   Like, here is where I want this thing placed on this slide.
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:47.320]   Here's where I want this placed on this page.
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:49.440]   Because sometimes, thank you for giving me
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:50.480]   all these alignment tools.
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:53.280]   But if you could just let me say, make this 2.5 inches
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:57.400]   from the left-hand margin, wherever it goes, that'll do me.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:00.440]   I will know that 2.5 inches is 2.5 inches.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:13.560]   Swatch attempted to register the phrase one more thing,
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:16.560]   probably mostly because they're pissed off over the Apple
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:18.400]   Watch.
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.800]   The dispute with Swatch extends to other trademarks,
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:24.880]   including the watchmakers move to register tick different.
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:28.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:31.120]   Is this the Intel marketing company?
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:32.880]   Do they have more clients now?
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:36.000]   You know, Swatch apparently prevented Apple
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.680]   from naming the Apple Watch the eye watch,
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:42.480]   because I guess they already had that trademark.
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:48.480]   In any event, a judge in London overseas judge
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:51.840]   sided with Swiss watchmaker, Swatch Group,
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:57.200]   in a long running dispute over trademarks.
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:59.920]   The judge, in purpose, said, Swatch's attempt
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:02.320]   to register the phrase might have been an attempt
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:06.920]   to annoy Apple, but Apple can't block it from doing so.
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.880]   Because--
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.440]   And I think this judge-- actually,
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:12.560]   I'm going to give him a lot of credit.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:16.760]   He said, actually, I think the phrase originated with Colombo.
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:17.240]   Yes.
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:18.400]   Did it?
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:19.160]   Excuse me.
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:19.840]   One more thing.
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:22.720]   He would ask one last question that would, of course,
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:25.440]   incriminate the killer.
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:26.720]   He said one more ting, though.
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:28.480]   He very clearly pronounced it ting.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.560]   No, I'm going to have to-- OK, we're going to have to risk--
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:32.320]   one more ting, though.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:37.320]   We're going to have to risk take down on YouTube.
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:37.920]   Let me just see.
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:38.400]   This is for you.
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:39.240]   Let me just see.
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:40.880]   This is fair use, because we're investigating.
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:42.320]   Oh, one more thing.
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:43.760]   We're investigating.
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:44.480]   We're critiquing.
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:45.040]   We're reviewing.
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:45.880]   Funny thing.
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:48.200]   You know that day that you left your cop, pop outside?
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:49.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:50.040]   Yeah, let's try it.
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:50.040]   Turn it up.
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:50.680]   We have the biggest--
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:51.320]   Let's try it.
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:51.800]   Here we go.
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:52.200]   Here we go.
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:54.400]   We've actually got him.
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:55.240]   Wait a minute.
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:56.240]   Let me go back.
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:57.760]   Oh, listen, there's one other thing I wanted to do.
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:59.360]   One other thing.
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:00.120]   One other thing.
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:00.880]   Oh, come on, Swatch.
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:04.720]   I'm working with Dr. Murchison.
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:06.160]   I can't find him, and I was wondering
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:07.200]   whether you could help me.
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:07.920]   So that's one.
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:10.000]   Apparently, he goofed up on some expensive crime.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.760]   Let's see if he ever says--
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:12.640]   What is in Rome?
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:13.200]   Let's see.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:15.400]   Welcome anymore.
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:16.600]   Oh, there's one more thing, sir.
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:17.560]   One more thing.
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:18.600]   Yeah, there we go.
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:19.400]   One more thing.
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:20.520]   Mr. Hott is in Rome.
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:22.920]   He's going to be back in his hotel room this while.
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:24.840]   I actually really love Columbus.
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:25.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:25.840]   We got him.
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:26.000]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000]   Practice.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.400]   Let me go out the other night.
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:30.200]   Let me go back a little more here.
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:32.400]   But I wasn't busy killing my wife either.
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:34.760]   Oh, yes, you were.
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:35.640]   One other thing.
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:38.120]   And we got to practice.
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:39.320]   One other thing.
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:41.760]   Robert Culpe, three-time murderer.
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:42.320]   Oh, yeah?
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:43.360]   It's the three-timeer club.
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:44.000]   Yeah, really?
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.840]   Robert Culpe, three times now in a Colombo?
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:47.600]   You are a king.
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:49.640]   Is it all in Colombo?
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:51.120]   No, on Colombo.
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:53.160]   They would-- when they liked an actor,
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.120]   they would often bring it back of--
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:55.960]   William Shaffer.
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:56.760]   You were a Colombo.
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:57.360]   You were a Colombo.
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:57.920]   Two-time murderer.
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:58.560]   Oh, my God.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:43:59.280]   Yes.
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:01.040]   It's like-- at some point, somebody
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:02.480]   is going to like--
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:05.200]   green light my pitch for a Colombo podcast.
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:06.920]   And then I'm going to make myself and someone else
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:07.640]   very, very rich.
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:10.120]   How many episodes are there?
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:12.000]   There are-- let's see.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.720]   Now, it depends on whether you count the reboot--
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:18.360]   excuse me, the sequel series from the 1980s and 1990s.
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:19.560]   But it was always Peter Fock.
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:20.760]   I mean, you can't have--
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:26.200]   Well, no, the first pilot was not with Peter Fock.
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:28.160]   Technically, it starts with prescription murder,
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:31.640]   which was the made-for-TV pilot, which--
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:34.800]   in which you see a much more aggressive Lieutenant Colombo,
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:39.400]   he hadn't really figured out what the character was yet.
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:41.240]   So he was a much, much tougher--
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:42.600]   I like this Colombo.
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:43.800]   Let's play one more.
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:46.040]   One more thing.
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:46.480]   He does.
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.040]   He says one more thing.
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:49.840]   He says one more thing.
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:52.480]   Final episode of the-- that was the final episode
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:56.680]   of the 1970s original mystery movie series.
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:57.600]   Holy cow.
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:00.600]   You really know your Colombo.
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:03.560]   Should we do one more just to verify this?
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:05.400]   Oh, how is it difficult, man?
[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:08.040]   I mean, you're a friend of the great many people, including me.
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.520]   But--
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:10.360]   Nice cigar.
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:11.560]   It's a little green.
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:15.000]   If you ask me, my guess is that the peculiar is a complete outsider.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.600]   It was a Fourier?
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:18.240]   Well, I'm sure you're right about that, sir.
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:22.320]   And I certainly intend to investigate that possibility.
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:25.840]   But if you don't mind, I just like to poke around your institute.
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:26.840]   Anything you say about the time we--
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:28.480]   Potashol Emperor, Saddam IV.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:29.400]   I know.
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:30.320]   But I said, he--
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:33.360]   That episode features Robbie the Robot and a character,
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:36.520]   a boy genius character named Steven Spielberg.
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:38.480]   There's a one thing.
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:40.040]   Anyway, I think the judge was right.
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:41.240]   And it's four by three.
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:43.160]   Like the Snyder Cut, they hurry up on guard.
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:46.360]   Do you want to see the Shatner one?
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:46.760]   Here we go.
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:48.600]   Yes, let's watch the Shatner Cut.
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:51.600]   OK, Shatner Cut.
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.200]   I'm a strange guy.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:53.720]   Really?
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:54.960]   Yeah, I worry.
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:56.920]   I mean, little things bother me.
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:58.360]   I'm a warrior.
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:00.800]   I mean, little insignificant details.
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:02.160]   I was my appetite, I can't eat.
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:04.240]   See, one of the things about Peter Fock is he
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:07.280]   was one of the great actors of his era.
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:10.000]   So he's slumming a little bit on TV.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.680]   But he's bringing this incredible talent
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:17.560]   to this kind of trivial show.
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:19.920]   Allsp-- well, it didn't become trivial with him.
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:21.400]   And he actually brought in--
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:22.840]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:25.240]   He was such a well-respected actor
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:27.800]   that he brought in a lot of people who maybe would not
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:30.600]   necessarily have been doing like a guest
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:32.160]   on a interested TV show.
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:33.720]   John Cassavetti's, for instance,
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:36.640]   was there were really great friends.
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:38.520]   He'd acted in a bunch of friends with these movies.
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:40.160]   So he played a murderer.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.720]   I think-- come on, kill somebody.
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:42.800]   One good time for a couple of years.
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:44.280]   Not everybody had to be a heart-throb.
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:46.240]   It was more like the BBC where they cast an actor.
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:47.280]   It was not a heart-throb.
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:48.640]   It was an everything.
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:52.920]   An early "Fock" Cassavetti's movie that was very weird.
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:53.920]   Shot.
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:54.760]   I hope the CW doesn't remake it.
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:55.800]   What was the name of that?
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:57.440]   It was Mikey and Nicky.
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:58.280]   Do you remember that?
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:46:59.800]   Oh, you ever see that?
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:00.280]   Yep.
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:03.680]   Very odd movie.
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:07.520]   He made a bunch of really nice, weird movies.
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:08.960]   He's got a real-- most of it takes place--
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:09.960]   He's a Nicky.
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:13.160]   Yeah, Mikey and Nicky is mostly a takes place in an apartment.
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:15.000]   It's like not-- it was a cheap movie.
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.120]   It was an expensive movie.
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:17.800]   Why make life difficult for yourself?
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:19.760]   Not just-- but brilliant actors.
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:20.560]   And that's the thing.
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:22.800]   And you see "Fock" just even those little clips.
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:24.760]   You go, wow, that guy could act.
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:25.480]   That guy really--
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:27.800]   Don't know what it's on.
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:31.640]   It's my favorite Donald Pleasance role of all time
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:33.640]   was "Any Old Port in a Storm," which
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:36.120]   is I think one of the best--
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:38.600]   actually, a really great movie in and of itself.
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:40.680]   Just the way that it balances, the way they get
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:41.880]   into the characters.
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:44.120]   And anyway, sorry.
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:45.760]   Yes, I'm a Columbia fan in that.
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:48.480]   You ever have these topics where you have the shot clock,
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:50.160]   you put into your little corner of your eye,
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:53.360]   say, OK, stop talking after this not a time,
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:54.320]   because you'll know what you do.
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.280]   You've got to do that podcast.
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:56.120]   That's the thing.
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:56.560]   Exactly.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:57.960]   I'm not volunteering.
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:00.080]   I know, I know, but I'm saying this.
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:02.040]   I'm just saying, it's not--
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:07.960]   it'd be hard to work in a tech angle for a Columbia podcast.
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:11.000]   You guys, you should prepare your picks,
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:15.400]   because our picks of the week are next.
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:16.880]   I'm going to start the picks of the week.
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:17.240]   Let's see.
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:18.760]   Last week, I started with you, Alex.
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:21.320]   I think I'll start with Andy Inako, your pick of the week
[01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:22.560]   this week.
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:24.320]   Very timely pick of the week.
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:26.360]   We started the show by my complaining about not being
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:29.920]   able to get-- not being eligible for the vaccine yet.
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:33.520]   A developer put this really cool project on GitHub called
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:38.840]   CVS, S-E-E-V-S. The launch is the lab.
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:41.080]   It puts this little thing in your menu bar
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:43.200]   with a colored dot next to it.
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:45.320]   You configure it by saying, here's
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:49.040]   the state and the towns that I might be able to go to to be
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:49.960]   vaccinated.
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:52.840]   And it will check every 15 minutes.
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:54.760]   And when you see that dot turn green,
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:57.160]   that means that there are appointments available at the CVS
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:00.840]   and that's in that place that you designated in the preferences.
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.320]   It's absolutely free.
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:04.560]   Like I said, it's just one dude who decided to just bang this
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:06.400]   out, because it would be a cool thing to have.
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:08.000]   And it seems to work.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.200]   I know people who have had this work.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:13.360]   I'm looking at right now, and the dot is red.
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:15.840]   In my case, I believe that means that's working just fine.
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:19.880]   It's saying, sorry, Andy, you may languish in ill health
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:24.000]   and danger for as long as society deems appropriate.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.480]   And it's just a cool thing.
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:27.640]   It helps you to gamify things a little bit.
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:29.800]   It makes you feel as though you have a little bit of control
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:31.120]   when you probably really don't.
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:33.280]   So is this what you're using to--
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:37.600]   I love it that it's called S-E-E-V-S.
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:40.840]   And to be absolutely accurate, it won't
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:43.720]   do the state-run facilities.
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:47.080]   Other places where you can get immunized,
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:50.360]   this guy found a JSON or whatever,
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:53.160]   where he can access the database for CVS locations.
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:54.280]   But it's something.
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:57.880]   And any success?
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:58.600]   Not yet for me.
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:49:59.800]   No.
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:03.880]   It doesn't open for me, probably, for at least another week.
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:06.520]   Again, a little bit too young, a little bit too healthy.
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:07.800]   Too young, too healthy.
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:09.800]   Who would have ever thought?
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:10.480]   I know.
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:11.680]   Well, too young.
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:14.440]   I mean, I haven't said-- look how young I am in my thinking.
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:18.080]   I still got some dark patches here, right over here,
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:18.720]   in my side.
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:19.240]   Yeah.
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:21.840]   That's why I keep saying my eyebrows haven't changed yet.
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.840]   There you go.
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:24.920]   That means I'm still--
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:27.200]   you got some amount of saunty stuff going on there.
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:28.600]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:30.600]   I'm a great Latin lover.
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:32.080]   Armando Sante.
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:35.400]   Alex Lindsey, pick of the week, my friend.
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:36.720]   Color.
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:37.200]   Color.
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:38.040]   Color.
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:38.560]   Color.
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:41.880]   So one of the things that, as you start doing video,
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:43.520]   that we've been talking about a lot recently,
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:46.360]   is being able to make sure that when you're doing records,
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:48.120]   that you can get things to the same color.
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:49.920]   And so one of the things that we use a lot of,
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:52.200]   I thought, would be useful to talk about all these charts.
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:54.080]   These are x-right, makes these charts,
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:56.480]   and they make all different sizes.
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:58.320]   There's a bunch of-- there's a little one.
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:00.360]   These are-- this is the little passport.
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:02.080]   This is the video color checker.
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:03.680]   That's really cool.
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:05.560]   And what's kind of cool is if you're using something
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:11.160]   like Resolve from Blackmagic, you can actually hold this up.
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:12.760]   This is kind of a cool-- I don't have a way
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:13.640]   to show this at the moment.
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:17.960]   But you can take this image, just have someone go like,
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:21.120]   oh, don't cover it up, but go like this, and corner pin this.
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:24.120]   And Blackmagic will actually know what that is.
[01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:26.720]   And it will actually automatically get you really close
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:29.640]   to a color correction live.
[01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:32.640]   And so-- or not live, but I mean, in a quick way.
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:36.320]   So anyway, it's-- having these charts, a lot of them
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:39.680]   are somewhere in the vicinity of everything from $150
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:40.800]   to $300.
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:42.840]   Now, we have bigger charts that are--
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:47.120]   demand charts that are $800 to $2,000 that we use for video.
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:48.840]   But these are great.
[01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:52.760]   This little passport is a great thing to-- I keep in my bag.
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:54.760]   If I'm going to take a photo and I want to color correct it
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:57.640]   later, I just take this real quickly and take a photo with this
[01:51:57.640 --> 01:51:59.640]   and then go ahead and take the photo that I'm taking there.
[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:02.400]   If I need to color correct it back to something,
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:05.800]   because once you have that grid of colors in here,
[01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:08.160]   you can use those as a-- it really gives you
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:10.880]   enough reference points to get everything that you need.
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:12.440]   So again, these ones are made by--
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:13.960]   I mean, there's a couple different manufacturers,
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:17.480]   the ones that I use are DSC Chroma-Demont charts,
[01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:20.000]   which I'm not showing right now, and the X-rite charts are
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.600]   the ones that a lot of us are sending out in kits.
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:24.640]   And this is the one I keep in my bag.
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:26.800]   They make lots of different sizes of them.
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:28.600]   And they're-- and it really-- especially
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:30.360]   if you want to color correct a--
[01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:33.920]   if you're doing a shoot, you really
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:36.960]   want to have these in the kit.
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:39.000]   It just really makes it a lot easier to get started.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.600]   It gets you to-- you throw them into your-- again,
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:43.280]   Resolve probably does it better than anyone else,
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:45.720]   but you can throw it in and use that as a way
[01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:46.880]   to reference that back.
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:47.800]   So these are standard--
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:49.880]   Pantone standard and Resolve knows them
[01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:51.120]   and knows what they're supposed to be.
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:52.080]   Yeah, they're actually drop down.
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:53.040]   Like, which one are you using?
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:53.880]   I'm using this one.
[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:56.160]   And then it gives you a little corner pin.
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:58.080]   And you just literally put the-- to the corners
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:52:58.880]   of where the colors are.
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:00.200]   And it's sampling all the--
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:00.680]   That's what this--
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:02.400]   --couple X's that it's going to sample all of those.
[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:05.000]   And then what it does is it uses that as a matrix.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.840]   And it changes the color on the image
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:09.080]   based on where it knows.
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:09.880]   Wow, that's really great.
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:11.240]   And have to get those colors to a place.
[01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:12.640]   Could you do it with stills, too?
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:14.880]   I mean, is there a way to do it with--
[01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:15.640]   Absolutely.
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:16.120]   Really?
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:16.880]   OK.
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:19.280]   Instead of a gray card, this might be a good--
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:20.720]   It's going to give you a lot more resolution
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:21.360]   than a gray card.
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:23.960]   The gray card does one piece, but what the gray card doesn't
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:26.000]   measure is--
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:26.640]   It's only doing--
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:27.520]   It's only doing black.
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:30.160]   --white and blacks can be all over the place.
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:31.480]   And your gray is still correct.
[01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:33.760]   And so having all of those different colors
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:36.160]   is what you really need to have the resolution to color
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:37.520]   correct an image.
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:41.280]   It's funny, because when you-- in the old days, when you were
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:46.000]   working with pros in the old days, they'd always have--
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.440]   you go in a TV studio, and there's this is on there
[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:51.440]   and on a C stand, and have the color chart.
[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:52.960]   In fact, they just leave it there all the time.
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:55.200]   The camera's always pointed at, probably did.
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:55.800]   So this is the big--
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:56.560]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:53:57.060]   That's it.
[01:53:57.060 --> 01:53:57.880]   This is the big one.
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:53:59.160]   That's the big one.
[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:00.560]   That's the big one.
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:02.080]   And we'll put a link in this.
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:03.160]   I didn't put the link in--
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:04.160]   A tech TV.
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:04.640]   --the C-V-S-C labs.
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:07.440]   They would put that on a C stand and leave the cameras.
[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:08.080]   I don't know why.
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:09.560]   Leave the cameras pointing at it with it.
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:12.000]   Yeah, so what you're doing is you--
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.800]   these colors that you see around here in a vectorscope
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:18.880]   will actually go through the targets in the vectors.
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:21.200]   That's what that vectorscope-- when you look at it,
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:23.240]   these colors will actually go through it.
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:25.080]   And so you can color correct all your cameras.
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:28.440]   You leave it up here because you're probably tweaking
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:31.440]   the camera while this is sitting in front of the camera.
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:34.360]   You're tweaking all the colors in the camera.
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:40.160]   And then what I do with this is that I have the camera that I
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:43.000]   decided looks the way I wanted to look on the inside.
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.760]   And then I use a transition to cut this--
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:47.240]   cut right along these.
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:49.440]   And then I can sit there and tweak the second camera
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:50.960]   until I don't see a line.
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:54.160]   And then those cameras are totally lined up.
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:55.000]   Awesome.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.360]   So this is the bigger one.
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:00.120]   This is the DSC Labs Chroma DaVon chart.
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:03.000]   I think this one is like $1,300 or $50.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.000]   What?
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000]   And then--
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:09.560]   Yeah, and then these-- this is the X-rite, which is--
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:12.160]   I think this one's-- I want to say $150 or $200.
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:14.800]   But the reason you're paying so much is that it's
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:18.000]   a lot harder to print colors perfectly accurate
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:21.160]   than it is to just print something and we're close.
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:23.520]   Have we ever color corrected these cameras, John?
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:25.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:26.400]   I can always bring this in.
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:27.320]   We can have a little lab.
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:28.920]   Once-- once confidence, I'll come in.
[01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:30.360]   I don't think we've ever--
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:31.560]   It looks good.
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:32.680]   Yeah, it looks good on you, Ron.
[01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:35.760]   We just kind of go, eh, turn that night.
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:36.880]   Leo's a little pink today.
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:37.920]   Just turn a little bit more.
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:38.400]   There you go.
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:39.600]   It's good.
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:40.480]   Isn't that funny?
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:43.000]   I think that's probably-- I bet you Mark has Brownlee
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.080]   uses those.
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:47.920]   But I bet you, in general, modern video production,
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:50.200]   people are sloppy and they just do it and nobody cares.
[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:50.720]   And it's fine.
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:52.520]   I use this for every-- before every shoot,
[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:53.720]   I have this in front of my big face.
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:54.520]   Oh, you do.
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:55.080]   There it is.
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:56.560]   Oh, maybe I'm wrong.
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:55:58.400]   This is the past that you can fold it.
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:55:59.400]   Yeah, that's a little passport.
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:01.640]   You've got like three sections of it
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:02.520]   so I can do all the--
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:03.920]   Oh, you do all about it.
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:07.680]   What do you use this the Japanese flag for?
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:07.960]   I don't know.
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:08.760]   I use this on it.
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:10.880]   And if I ever need to, I can just
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:12.880]   remap the gray little balance in the color.
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:16.640]   What you do is-- if you open up that focus chart,
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:19.760]   what you do is you take-- typically,
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:21.960]   you take the focus chart--
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:22.960]   I can find it.
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:26.320]   Every time you're on Alex, it turns into a mini office hour.
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:27.240]   A little loud there, right?
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:28.240]   Yeah.
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:31.280]   Well, because this is office hours, you go by.
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:33.120]   By the way, I apologize.
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:37.200]   Burke says, Anthony and I have come in and adjusted the cameras.
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:38.600]   You just don't know it.
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:40.960]   OK, sorry.
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:45.720]   The focus chart is-- so when you put big lenses on cameras,
[01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:48.400]   the back focus is different than the front focus.
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:50.480]   It's not-- when you're adding them,
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:52.280]   you don't worry about it when you're taking pictures,
[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:54.680]   because you don't have to have it--
[01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:57.040]   you don't have to have the front focus and the back focus
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:00.880]   change when you're using a zoom.
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:03.400]   But the problem is, is that when you take an external video
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:06.600]   lens and you attach it, that back focus is really important.
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:09.000]   So what you do is you set that focus chart out 10 feet
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.200]   in front of the camera, and then you set the actual zoom
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:18.040]   to-- or the focus to 10 feet, and then you focus it in
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:18.840]   with the back focus.
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:20.880]   And then you check it, zoomed all the way in,
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:22.400]   check it zoomed all the way out.
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:24.840]   And so that's what that one's for, is to do that.
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:26.600]   Although that one's really small to do that with,
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:27.520]   it would be hard.
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:29.240]   We usually use bigger ones to do that.
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:33.040]   But that's how you use that to focus in your back focus.
[01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:33.680]   The--
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:34.480]   Or we do.
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:34.840]   We do.
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:35.840]   I don't know what else to do.
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:37.000]   The historical thing is tech TV.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.040]   There was a shader.
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:40.520]   There was a guy whose job was--
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:41.640]   But you kind of have to--
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:43.160]   Well, you don't have to.
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:46.600]   But when your environment doesn't change very often,
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:48.880]   so yours is easier because you have one center point
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:52.280]   that you can get all the cameras shaded to, or exposed to.
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:55.120]   Well, these are consumer-- these are consumer camcorders
[01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:55.680]   from using it.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:57.680]   It's not like--
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:58.080]   It's not like--
[01:57:58.080 --> 01:57:58.960]   It would be hard to do those.
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:00.640]   I'm just saying you can get away with it, though,
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:03.040]   without shading.
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:04.360]   I won't buy it like my--
[01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:05.280]   They had a booth.
[01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:05.840]   This webcam.
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:08.640]   The guy had a dedicated booth that he would sit in,
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:10.480]   I guess, because he had to control the light.
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:11.640]   And that's his--
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:12.800]   Like that was his job.
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:13.800]   That's how expensive it was.
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:14.800]   Oh, yeah, we hire shaders.
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:16.320]   We hire shaders all the time.
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:17.320]   It's a music.
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:18.000]   For our larger shows.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.040]   But now, the ATEM Mini that I have sitting on my desk
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:22.000]   shades this camera.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:22.520]   Really?
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:23.120]   You know, like it's--
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:23.760]   Yeah, that's what I was--
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:25.240]   That's when I changed the color.
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:26.160]   You know, when I go in here--
[01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:26.320]   You were doing that.
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:28.560]   You said my gamma's off, and you fixed it.
[01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:31.040]   And I just fixed it, because it's-- so I can go in here,
[01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:33.840]   and I can go to a camera, and I can go, well,
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:37.200]   I want to bring my exposure down, or I want to bring it up.
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:39.720]   But that's all happening in an interface on my--
[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:42.400]   We could do that in a tricaster, not probably as well,
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:43.800]   but we can do it.
[01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:45.200]   But I can just do it with it.
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:45.640]   Did I show you?
[01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:46.960]   We have to have matching cameras.
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:49.840]   I have to show you, because Burke has finished my ATEM Mini.
[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:50.680]   Oh, look at that.
[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:51.320]   Portable kit.
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:52.240]   How are you?
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:55.280]   Now, this-- hey, stop that.
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:56.760]   They're making me green.
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:59:03.400]   This was an orange pelican case, but Burke said he had to paint it
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:04.560]   because I don't know.
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:06.840]   Hey, now they're making me purple.
[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:09.040]   Now, you're never going to get it back to the way it was.
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:10.040]   I bet.
[01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:11.560]   No.
[01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:14.080]   Quick, we need one of those color cards.
[01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:14.920]   So what's in here?
[01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:15.720]   This is really cool.
[01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:17.960]   He says, open and close it carefully.
[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:21.840]   So I don't want to break anything.
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:24.040]   But inside-- look at that.
[01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:24.920]   Oh, there you go.
[01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:27.080]   There's an ATEM Mini, the original.
[01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:27.560]   Little monitor.
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:28.560]   Look at that.
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:29.440]   Isn't that cool?
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:29.920]   Isn't that cool?
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:30.520]   And on the back--
[01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:31.280]   Is that a free world?
[01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:33.120]   Is that a little free world monitor?
[01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:33.600]   I think so.
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:34.120]   It's good.
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:34.120]   It's good.
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:34.620]   It's great.
[01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:35.480]   You got an expensive one.
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:36.800]   I gave him a black magic one.
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:37.920]   He said it doesn't fit.
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:41.080]   And then in the back, he has all the HDMI ports.
[01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:45.560]   And I guess he's done something that's glued down.
[01:59:45.560 --> 01:59:48.520]   Burke used the glue gun heavily on this project.
[01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:50.800]   Those pelican cases make great cyber attacks.
[01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:52.960]   So he had to cut it open to do that and all that.
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:53.960]   But look at that.
[01:59:53.960 --> 01:59:57.600]   Now I've got a switcher I can just carry around with me.
[01:59:57.600 --> 01:59:59.480]   Pretty cool.
[01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:00.160]   It's all ready to go.
[02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:02.600]   Yeah, feel world.
[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:03.080]   It's great.
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:04.080]   Yeah.
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:05.080]   Isn't that nice?
[02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:05.580]   Yeah.
[02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:08.280]   Have you done any streams with it yet?
[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:09.040]   No, I just got it.
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:12.480]   It was on my desk just before the show, right before the show.
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:13.960]   You used that like an excuse.
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:14.960]   I mean, like that.
[02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:15.960]   I got to go shoot.
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:16.960]   Yeah.
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:19.080]   I got to go out and shoot some stuff.
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:20.080]   It's nice.
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:21.400]   He says, please be careful.
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:24.520]   I love Burke is famous for his handwritten notes.
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:26.160]   Please be careful closing the case.
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:31.080]   I decided to just finish this instead of fix a couple of very poorly designed things
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:35.520]   about the-- we got the product from a YouTube channel.
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:36.520]   Right.
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:37.840]   The cable management, the weight balance.
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:38.840]   Use it.
[02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:39.840]   I will fix it.
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:40.840]   Love Burke.
[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:41.840]   Aw.
[02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:43.920]   Burke, thank you.
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:51.040]   The idea was to have something in case of fire, to be honest with you.
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:53.920]   We've had a little bit of a problem with the wildfires, as you might remember.
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:56.120]   So I have a go bag.
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:00:57.040]   This is it.
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:00:58.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:01.760]   In case of emergency.
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:05.240]   Thank you, Alex, for our little mini office hours.
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:06.240]   Renee Richie.
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:08.800]   You're pick of the week.
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:11.280]   So mine is-- it was just updated today.
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:14.840]   It's not a brand new app, but it's an important app, especially today.
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:16.480]   And that's Apple's developer app.
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:19.240]   It's available on the iPhone, the iPad, the Mac.
[02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:20.800]   It's everywhere.
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:24.280]   It's what is going to give us all the loadout and all the WWE sessions.
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:25.280]   First, the fake ones.
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:29.360]   They sort of announce with all the weird names, like a half emoji, half joke.
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:31.200]   But over time, it'll give us all the sessions.
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:32.880]   It'll give us all the videos.
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:36.760]   And it's been updated with a new discover feature now.
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:41.080]   And of course, people who are a little bit of interior baseball aficionados know that
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:47.480]   former guest on this show, former awesome Imorian, Serenity Caldwell, is now doing a
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:49.120]   lot of the work on that app.
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:50.120]   Oh, good.
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:51.120]   That's the last place I can read her.
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:54.880]   And it makes me happy every day to be able to do that.
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:58.800]   And they put a lot of effort into making this better.
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:01:59.960]   And it's a dog food.
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:02.920]   It runs in catalysts on the Mac.
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:08.040]   So it's one of the apps that they use to test their own technology.
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:10.880]   And you can go in there and look at older videos of the sessions.
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:16.040]   You can look at the ones Alex was talking about where they start to commingle ARKit and
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:20.320]   local map data so you can drop a kaiju on your street if you want to.
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:22.320]   Not an effective one yet.
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:23.680]   But we're getting there.
[02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:24.680]   And just everything.
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:29.120]   I'm rewatching a lot of the stuff going into WWDC 2021.
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:33.760]   And then I'm going to really enjoy watching all the new stuff that's coming out.
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:37.400]   So I got to remind myself, I should put this on the front page of my iPhone.
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:43.840]   Instead of wasting three hours looking at TikTok, I could go to the developer app and
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:47.120]   learn something, right?
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:48.400]   It's got to discover tabs.
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:54.600]   So just like the TikTok app, you can browse through different convert py torch models to
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:55.600]   core ML.
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:57.680]   I've been needing to do that.
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:00.560]   I've been in fixed hitches in the commit phase.
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:04.040]   This is for real developers.
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:06.520]   Tailor your metal apps for Apple M1.
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:09.240]   There's the best of last year's WWDC.
[02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:11.920]   There's that widget code along which I've mentioned before.
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:17.240]   And there's the, if I wonder if I refresh this, if I'll get a different, no.
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:20.560]   I only get the same one.
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:21.560]   You can browse.
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:23.200]   You could, very nice.
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:28.920]   It's free, although you have to be a $99 a year developer, right?
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:29.920]   Or can you use it without being able to?
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:30.920]   You get a lot of stuff anyways.
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:31.920]   Just the developer.
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:33.400]   Like there's not much that's locked out.
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:34.400]   Oh, that's nice.
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:35.480]   That's even better.
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:40.680]   Because I think there are a lot of kids who would love to learn how to write apps for
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:42.120]   the iPhone.
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:45.080]   Maybe don't have the $99 buck wherewithal.
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:51.720]   There's a guy who writes apps for Macintosh named Brent Simmons, who really is a legend.
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:52.880]   Yay.
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:54.720]   He's a legend.
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:04:00.240]   And he created many moons ago, the best RSS reader for the Macintosh.
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:02.120]   Sold it, bought it back.
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:05.440]   It's now back being updated.
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:08.320]   It's got a team of volunteers working on it.
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:14.080]   It's called Net Newswire version six just came out.
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:15.080]   And it's great.
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:16.080]   And you know what?
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:17.080]   It's funny.
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:20.600]   Google killed Google Reader, but RSS never died.
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:24.160]   Still most sites offer an RSS feed.
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:30.280]   Certainly all podcasts still use RSS unless they're Spotify exclusives, I guess.
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:34.960]   But I'm just glad Brent's still writing and still creating great stuff.
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:37.600]   And Net Newswire has always been one of the Mac classics.
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:39.400]   iOS as well.
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:40.400]   There is coming.
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:41.400]   So that's good.
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:44.320]   It's just such a great tool.
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:49.400]   You're right that RSS isn't as ubiquitous as it might have been like when Net Newswire
[02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:50.720]   was first released.
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:55.120]   But the ability to simply bookmark everything into this one app and at least have to click
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:59.360]   on this one window that will have at the very minimum the headlines of all these sites
[02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:04.760]   that you're trying to follow without having to open multiple tabs with multiple URLs.
[02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:07.800]   And it's just such a beautifully made app.
[02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:08.800]   It's a work of art.
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:13.520]   And it's all the legacy is so president every click you make.
[02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:14.520]   Yeah.
[02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:17.160]   So I'm just glad he's still making great code.
[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:18.560]   It's free.
[02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:19.560]   That's the other good thing.
[02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:20.560]   It's free.
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:25.800]   Well, we've had a fun time, but I'm afraid I have to wrap this puppy up.
[02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:29.080]   No Mac event, no Apple event next week, probably.
[02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:32.200]   No, no invitations went out.
[02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:36.600]   But maybe sometime in April will be something we can dream.
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:38.040]   We can dream.
[02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:39.040]   That's Alex Lindsey.
[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:41.680]   Now his office hours go on.
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:43.520]   I tuned in last night.
[02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:45.240]   You were doing it at like 7 p.m.
[02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:46.240]   You're like always.
[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:47.480]   We just do Monday.
[02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:49.600]   We do Monday nights.
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:56.760]   So we're going to talk a lot about streaming next Monday night with some pretty heavy hitters.
[02:05:56.760 --> 02:05:59.920]   So it would be worth coming to check that out if you're interested in learning more
[02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:01.600]   about streaming.
[02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:05.320]   But yeah, Monday nights are the only night we do now.
[02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:07.640]   And then, but otherwise we would every morning seven days a week.
[02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:12.200]   So we started up at, we kind of opened the pre-show at six, but really the show starts
[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:13.200]   at seven.
[02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:14.360]   Saturday is the long day.
[02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:16.440]   It usually runs until the afternoon.
[02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:18.320]   And we're going to try cooking together this week.
[02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:19.320]   Oh, fun.
[02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:21.920]   So in addition to all the other things, we're going to try to do collaborative cooking.
[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:26.520]   We've been doing some work with Madeleine Smithberg.
[02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:30.880]   She used to be a producer at The Daily Show and she's doing her own cooking stuff to
[02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:33.960]   Mad in the Kitchen is what it's called.
[02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:37.520]   And so we're going to be helping with some of the production to use it as a training
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:38.520]   operation.
[02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:39.520]   Nice.
[02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:43.320]   But to get ready for that, we're going to try like what does it take to cook collaboratively
[02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:46.920]   on Zoom, you know, because a lot of us have a lot of gear.
[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:52.360]   So we can, we can, like what happens when all of us have multi-camera, you know, systems
[02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:55.000]   and can attach to the zoom?
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:56.000]   What does it look like?
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:00.680]   Just, you know, so, you got to get mirrors on the ceiling over your stove.
[02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:01.680]   Then I like rigging.
[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:02.680]   Rigging.
[02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:04.120]   There'll be lots of rig.
[02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:10.200]   We have, you know, it's probably the hardest playing group when it comes to audio visual.
[02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:16.640]   I mean, people are, you know, almost everybody has a radio class mic and the kits are pretty
[02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:17.640]   getting pretty cool.
[02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:20.720]   So anyway, so we're now starting to really stretch out an experiment.
[02:07:20.720 --> 02:07:22.400]   It's a pretty great thing.
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:26.800]   Go to youtube.com/alexlindsay and you can see the recorded stuff, but there's a lot
[02:07:26.800 --> 02:07:28.920]   of stuff that's never recorded.
[02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:31.440]   So that means you'll need the zoom invite.
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:38.600]   That's in the comments or you could just go to bit.ly/the office hours capital T capital
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:46.040]   O capital H. I tried to get them to put a mirror on the ceiling at tech TV because I thought,
[02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:47.040]   well, that's what we should have.
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:52.120]   And then the camera can shoot into the mirror like they used to do on cooking shows and you
[02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:55.320]   could have a top down view and they said, no, no, no, it's a terrible idea.
[02:07:55.320 --> 02:07:56.320]   They shake.
[02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:57.320]   It's awful.
[02:07:57.320 --> 02:07:58.320]   You got to dampen them the building.
[02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:00.440]   You know, we just we're not going to do it.
[02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:02.760]   Nowadays you just put a camera up there.
[02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:03.760]   It's rig it.
[02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:04.760]   It's rig it.
[02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:06.760]   Well, I'm for the cooking show, I'm going to do all iPhones.
[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:08.560]   But I have a bunch of test iPhones that I have later.
[02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:11.400]   I'm not not new ones, but I'm just like old phones that I use for testing.
[02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:13.240]   You're going to put it on your head like Kenji?
[02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:16.880]   No, I'm not going to put it on my head, but I'm going to, but I am going to, I have, I
[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:19.640]   have three iPhones that I'm going to run into an ATEM switcher.
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:20.640]   Oh my God.
[02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:22.200]   And then and then tie it into the phone.
[02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:24.160]   How do you get the HDMI out of the iPhones?
[02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:28.920]   In film, film, a pro has a, you have a little setting, you can say clean output and it just
[02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:29.920]   does a 1080p output.
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:33.080]   That's that's how I get into HDMI will do it.
[02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:34.080]   It's lightning to HDMI.
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:36.600]   Yeah, and always get the Apple adapter.
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:38.040]   I've tried a whole bunch of cables.
[02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:39.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:40.040]   Not a good idea.
[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:46.040]   So lightning HDMI, Filmic Pro clean output, and then you can use your iPhone as a good
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:47.040]   camera.
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:48.040]   It's a good camera.
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:49.040]   Oh yeah.
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:50.040]   Yeah.
[02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:51.040]   Looks great.
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:52.040]   Wow.
[02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:53.040]   That's nice.
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:54.040]   I'll use it for my ATEM.
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:55.040]   Yeah.
[02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:56.040]   Yeah.
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:57.040]   It's you could, you can have a bunch of phones and time all in.
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:09:00.760]   And the cool thing about Filmic is there's a Filmic remote that you can actually control
[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:06.760]   the zoom and focus and everything else on the other cameras from the, so I can have
[02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:10.280]   like an iPad, it's like a little shader, you know, and do all the things I want with
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:11.280]   the little iPhones.
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:13.800]   Anyway, so that's my experiment for Saturday.
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:18.560]   I'm wondering if Tech TV thought I wanted a mirror on the ceiling for other reasons.
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:20.840]   That's why they wouldn't do it.
[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:21.840]   Renee?
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:23.400]   Yeah, to check my hair.
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:27.800]   Renee Richie is at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:30.120]   What do you got coming up?
[02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:35.480]   I just did a YouTube short for the WWDC and now I'm going to concentrate on more of that
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:36.480]   coverage.
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:40.120]   And this Wednesday or Thursday is going to be one year as an indie, which is going to
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:41.120]   be weird.
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:42.320]   I have to do something fun for that.
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:43.320]   One year.
[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:44.320]   Happy anniversary.
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:45.320]   Thank you.
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:46.720]   Should we, that's awesome.
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:49.400]   Seems like you're an institution already.
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:51.120]   I was surprised it was just one year.
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:52.320]   I feel like we should make you a 20.
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:54.120]   It was a long year.
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:55.640]   Yeah, yeah, that's true.
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:56.640]   True.
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:09:57.640]   2020 was a decade.
[02:09:57.640 --> 02:09:58.640]   It was.
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:09:59.640]   Congratulations.
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:00.640]   March again.
[02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:03.240]   You picked an interesting year to launch a YouTube channel.
[02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:05.240]   Yeah, well, I mean, good year actually.
[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:07.880]   Like in the first day of March because I thought there'd be an Apple event, I didn't
[02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:10.840]   want to, I gave them 30 days notice so they wouldn't take in case they needed help for
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:14.760]   the event and then all of this happened while I was, while I was quitting.
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:15.760]   That's a good point.
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:19.640]   I bet the lack of travel to San Francisco really help your business plan though.
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:21.640]   That's a rolling expense.
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:24.640]   You could put it into more cameras and more light.
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:25.640]   That's a good point.
[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:28.720]   Yeah, the expenses were down, but views were down because you know those hands on videos,
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:29.720]   you're getting busters.
[02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:31.280]   So it's always something.
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:33.240]   Mr Renee, that's Renee Richie.
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:38.360]   Mr. Andy and Ico is on WGBH Boston on Thursday.
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:40.800]   I'm guessing Friday the speed of 1230.
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:43.240]   I'll give you again Friday.
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:44.440]   Awesome.
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:52.440]   And of course, IHNA TKO on the Twitter and that's on echo.com says website and we'll
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:56.080]   be looking forward to the Colombo podcast any day now.
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:57.080]   Exactly.
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:10:58.880]   We want to get you want to sell tires.
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:00.000]   You want to sell candy.
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.840]   You want to sell sensible shoes or cigars.
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:04.880]   This is probably a good advice for you.
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:05.880]   Or raincoats.
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:07.600]   Let's not forget raincoats.
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:09.440]   Rumpled raincoats.
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:15.640]   We do Mac break weekly every Tuesday, 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern time 1800 UTC live streams
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:19.640]   of everything we do available at our website, Twitter.tv/live.
[02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:20.720]   That's audio and video.
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:22.160]   You can take your pick.
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:25.560]   But if you are watching or listening live, chat with us.
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:31.640]   They're live as well, mostly at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:32.640]   That's wide open.
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:36.280]   It's community run and it's really a lot of fun.
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:41.160]   After the fact, you can get copies of the show on demand audio or video from our website
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:43.960]   twit.tv/mbw.
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:47.960]   There's a Mac break weekly YouTube channel where everything lives.
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:49.800]   It's video obviously.
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:53.320]   And there's also, of course, the best way which is to get a podcast app and subscribe.
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:54.640]   So you'll get it automatically.
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:55.640]   Do us a favor.
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:57.360]   If you subscribe, review.
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:01.800]   Many apps have reviews and it really helps us if you give us a nice five star review and
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:05.000]   tell everybody how great Mac break weekly is.
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:09.000]   If you are not listening live or watching live but you want to comment, we have two
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:10.200]   ways to do that.
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:14.040]   There's a forum, the twit community at www.twit.community.
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:16.400]   It's a great forum.
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:19.560]   And if I do say so myself, I'm in there all the time.
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:27.920]   And we also have a Mastodon instance that's the Federated Twitter clone at twit.social.
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:29.960]   Membership in both of those is free.
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:32.880]   I do require approval to keep spammers out.
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:34.920]   But I'll approve you within 24 hours.
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:35.920]   I promise.
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:38.480]   Just say Leo sent me.
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:39.920]   Thanks everybody for joining us.
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:43.920]   Now it's time to get back to work because I'm sorry to say break time is over.
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:47.880]   Hey, if you like tech news but you also like hearing about it from the people who are
[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:50.200]   actually writing the stories.
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:51.200]   Well I've got a show for you.
[02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:56.480]   It's called Tech News Weekly and it's me Jason Howell along with my co-host Micah Sargent.
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:00.840]   Every week we invite the people making and breaking the biggest tech news stories from
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:04.920]   around the web onto this show to talk to us about it.
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:05.920]   It's a lot of fun.
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:06.920]   You should check it out.
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:10.760]   Tech News Weekly can be found at twit.tv/tnw every Thursday.
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:11.160]   We'll see you there.
[02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:14.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:13:14.500 --> 02:13:17.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:21.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:24.820]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
