[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   We're going to have new podcasts this month.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Oh, you always have new podcasts.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   We're going to have lots of...
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   We have to ask you how you do the NAB coverage and the Mac Break coverage,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   because we want to kind of do that at CES this year.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I talked to Dana about that a little bit yesterday, and we're going to talk about it.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   You know, a lot of it is we really build a streamlined kind of production flow.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   That's what we do.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Because you're doing so many of them that you can't...
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   There's a lot of things you can't do if you're trying to do that many, because we'll shoot 20...
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I don't want to do that many. I'd like to do five a day.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Oh, yeah, we should do 25 in a day.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   No, we do five a day, and we're doing pretty much wall-to-wall coverage.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   It's a Wednesday night party scene in Showstoppers, Thursday night party scene,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   and PEPCOM Friday all day, Saturday all day, Sunday all day.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   We should do four-day.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   It's only five a day.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Well, I think we might contract with you here, because it's like...
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   That's like five a day is like...
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   You can do that in your sleep, couldn't you?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Also, here the great...
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And they're not co-of the celestial waste of bandwidth, Andy.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Hi.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I'm getting a high definition.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yeah, good.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Your definition is good.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I looked at mine.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   But your audio cut up.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I'm not sure.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   It could be the fact that...
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Hang on.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Yes, it turns out that I'm using Skype.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   That's our problem.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   No, we're using another week's potential having the message sponsor.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I don't think they're sponsoring anybody.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   You know what?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   We're actually gonna use...
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   We're using for...
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   We have a new show that comes out of Austin, the NSFW show with Brian Brushwood.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And this...
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Get this, talk about weird, but it works really well.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   We gave him a sling box.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Ooh.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And we're using a sling catcher at this end.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Sling box is the thing you hook up to your cable and you know, you put in your television, you know, hutch.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And you put your cable into it and your ethernet into it and you can put your DVD or DVR or whatever.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And then it gives you internet access to all of those.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And it's tuned to give you...
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   You know, there's a lot of latency, but that's fine because it's not a two-way show in this case.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Okay.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   But it's tuned to give you high quality 720p video.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   So he...
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It wouldn't work if you were taking calls with us because there's too much latency.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Right.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   But because we're just taking his show and passing it on.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And passing it on.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   It's got high quality.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   It's very high quality.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And we use a sling catcher here and it's high def coming to us and then we can put it out.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   So we might do that with CES as well.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   That's interesting.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   That's very interesting.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Credit Colleen, I would not have thought of using a consumer product like that, but she thought,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   you know, it's tuned for internet, high bandwidth, high quality.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   They must have a, you know, some secret sauce and they do.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Evidently.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Etchoo says that I was a bit wonky in my appearance on NSFW last week.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   He says, "I like the classy Leo."
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Well, it's NSFW.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   It's NSFW.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   But if you prefer the classic Leo, I can do that.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Now, gentlemen, our first story of the week.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Ahhh.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   It's awesome Charles Grootman press here.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   That's awesome.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   How about those new I9s?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   You want to talk about the I9 really?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   You're coming soon.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Really? The I9?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   You're coming soon.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Possibly January 3rd.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   What is, is that the six core?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   That's six cores.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Golf town, which means that we would get 24 virtual cores instead of 16 in a Mac Pro, which would be awesome.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   So do you have the I7, a hyper threaded four quad?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Yeah, that's 16.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Those are 16s.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And I have two of those.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   And I have two of those.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And I have two of those.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   And I have two of those.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And I have two of those.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And I have two of those.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And I have two of those.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And I have two of those.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And I have two of those.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And I have two of those.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Is it noticeably fat?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Now it's really, so it's an eight core, hyper threaded.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And it's four dual core chips.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   If you have a--
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   It's crazy.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   That's crazy talk.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   But I got to tell you.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   It's insane.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   It is--
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   It's like a pancake.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's like stacked up like--
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Oh, no.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   It's not a pancake.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   It's a hot plate, Leo.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   The real issue we're running into is 32-bit apps versus 64-bit apps.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   You want to go all 64 with it?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It's a memory issue.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   You know, we run out of memory.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   So we were trying to run really big 3D renders and so on and so forth.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   We were just talking about that this morning.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   We were--
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   We need to render something at 6,000K-- you know, or 6,000K?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   You know, 6K wide.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And with lots of good stuff turned on.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And we're not sure if we can do it on the max side.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   We're going to have to reboot it into Windows and render it--
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Render the same application in Windows 7 because that application is 64-bit.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   So you're just now accommodating this and now all of a sudden Intel says, "Okay."
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   By the way, this was a little nip-slip by a Polish website, PC Lab.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   So, you know, I don't know.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Take it with a grain of salt.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   It says that it will be codenamed "Golftown."
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   These are six core Xeon chips.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   The new chips, according to PC Lab, are nearly 50% faster than the previous quad core-- it
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   says Xenon in this story, which makes me even more suspect.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   They mean Xenon during parallel tests and use up to-- you know, we'll see.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Well, the thing is, in the last core, Apple got them first.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   You know, in the last--
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Yeah, Apple seems to be-- I guess they're one of Intel's best customers.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   So they got them first.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And so if they're-- it looks like they're getting ready to release something.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And if they're going to release something, there's a good chance that we're going to get them.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And what's really interesting is for Apple to not be at Macworld because they don't want
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   to release stuff, but it sounds like they're warming up to release it or near CES.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Well, if PC Lab is not Fibben--
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Right.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   --and they really did get these results-- by the way, they took the page down immediately
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   at the request of Intel, they say.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Of course, that would be the case, and they'll never get another pre-release chip again.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   If it's the case, if it's not just made up, I don't know this site, so I don't know how credible this is.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   But apparently somebody, you know, snapped a picture of the page or cashed it or something.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And the chip will, according to sources, be featured in future Mac Pro models that could arrive
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   as early as first quarter of 2010.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   It'll be, as you said, the i9.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   6-core dual socket.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   32 nanometer chips, 12 megabytes of L3 cache if paired with another chip.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   The processors will offer 12 physical, 6 by 2, and then hyperthread it to get 24 logic
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   threads.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   [SCREAMS]
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And it's so much fun.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   If you get i-stat menu, which, by the way, if you don't have i-stat menu, I'm just going to
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   give you a bonus pick.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   There is no machine that I will work on that doesn't have i-stat menu because it shows me my--
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   I use menu meters, but i-stat menu shows me my chip action, it shows me my network action,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   it shows me everything is all sitting there right in front of me so I can know when something's going crazy.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I mostly know when Firefox is using up all my CPU power for no apparent reason, usually
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   because Flash is running it.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   To use i-stat server too, that's kind of fun.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Then you can see on your iPhone how your Mac is doing.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   I haven't used that.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I haven't used that server.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   These guys at i-stat, these guys are good.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Yeah, and so the-- but what's great is if you work with an application that knows what
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   you really get tuned to is what applications know how to use all those processors.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   You turn on-- there's a Adobe's media compressor knows how to use all of them, but oddly enough,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Apple's compressor doesn't.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Really?
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   It doesn't use them all.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   You can't set it to-- I thought you could set it to use more cores.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   I think you can.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   When it first started, I think it's now doing much better in the last update.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Don't you tell it how many cores you want to use?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Yeah, the-- well with QMaster.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   But what was funny, Cinema 4D uses every little ounce of every processor that's like a little
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   processor that's left there.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   And then you have some of them that you see picking up one or two little processors and
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   that's all they're using.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And so you know, well, they have--
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   You're wimpy, wimpy, wimpy.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   But it's fun to watch it.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   I know the 16-- I know the 8-core or 16-core depending on how you want to talk about it
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   is considerably faster.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   So what apps need to have this kind of-- well, I mean, you're really going to notice it when
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   you're doing things that are CPU intensive.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   So for us, 3D is the big thing that 3D and compression are the big things that affect us
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   a lot when it comes to using up all those cores.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And another thing to remember is that there are other things that impact that.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   So you've got to make sure if you're going to be using a lot of CPU power, like for instance,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   with compression, you need to be then rendering in and out of raids, preferably two different
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   raids, one raid to the other raid because that's going to give you the most throughput.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Then you're going to have the processors being able to get to that data as fast as they
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   need to.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.600]   And then what you start running into is this 32- and 64-bit wall, where the 32-bit wall,
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.000]   which is that you suddenly start running out of RAM.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   When you get good at using all of that up, you suddenly need more RAM.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   But it's really a lot of these really heavy CPU-- some of the compositors and 3D applications
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   are the ones that-- that's where we hit the RAM wall, typically.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   You have hit the RAM wall.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Please back off.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Yeah, well, and that's where we go, oh, we really need these to be 64-bit, which is
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   available on a lot of the applications on the PC side and just haven't quite made it over
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   to that.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Excellent.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   So we're starting to see a real gulf and performance between-- we're starting to see
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   a two-class citizenship starting to unfold because it used to be that the Mac Pros, the
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   difference between a Mac Pro and an iMac or even a PowerBook was oftentimes a difference
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   of-- so you need--
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Thank you.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   --tower, do you need-- well, do you need extra slots?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Well, it seems as though most people will be extremely well served by an i7 iMac.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Even a MacBook is more than powerful enough for most people's needs.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Are we looking at a situation where now Apple has to just make the Mac Pro so ungodly deep
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   thought-like in performance to justify its existence in the-- in the line up?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.100]   I think it's continuing just to-- I think that the Mac Pro is just continuing, fortunately
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.000]   for us, to develop along with the technology.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   We're not talking about a redesign of the Mac Pro.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   What we're really talking about is Intel making an upgrade to the chip set.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Apple has been making some upgrades.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   I mean, the design of the machine hasn't changed for, I don't know, five or six years, eight
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   years, something like that.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   The only thing that's really changed is how we put those chips in.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   We have been changing bus speeds, which makes a big difference.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   But a lot of that stuff has been minor tweaks to the system.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   And a lot of us were afraid that as Apple moved towards an iPhone reality that they were
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   moved more and more away from the Us Pro's.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   And we had this conversation on the show.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   I was the nattering Nelly saying, "Oh, they're all a consumer company.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   They dropped the word computer from the net."
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Right.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   And so that was a real concern.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And it's great to see-- but what we're really looking at here when we look at this acceleration
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   is Intel, not so much Apple.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   I mean, Apple might make some-- they're making progress.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And these are great machines.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   We had a guy in freelancing for us over the last month.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   And he said the Mac Pro was one of the best PCs he's used.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   I mean, it's a really, really well-built machine because he was using it primarily for some
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   PC applications that aren't on the Mac for one of our projects.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   And so the-- and he said it was just-- he went out and bought a Mac with no intention of
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   putting OS10 on it.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   It was literally only about putting a PC software on it.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   It runs extremely fast on that side.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   So it's a great well-built machine that is benefiting a great deal from Intel continuing
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   to innovate and build better chips.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And I think that that's fortunate.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   I think there's a huge difference now.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   I remember a time when I wasn't sure if the desktop was really worth it.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I was really happy with my laptop existence.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   But after we finished the last sprint over Thanksgiving weekend,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   I brought one of those 16 Prox up to my house.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   I was like, "If I'm going to do work, I need a full machine.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   I can't do this anymore."
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   I think, though, to answer your query or your supposition, Andy, I think this is just what happens.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   You've been around long enough to know that processors get faster.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   I don't think it's Apple saying, "Well, we've got to keep the Mac Pro a monster just so we
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   have the product lines equal."
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   I think it's just what happens.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   What I think is happening for sure is that Intel -- I think this really comes from Intel.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   - Apple pickles it, of course.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   - Yeah.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Apple -- Oh.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Well, in fact, their second story is the cell processor is going bye-bye.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   - Yeah.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   - And I was the one who said, "Oh, my God.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Apple's leaving PowerPC at the wrong time.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Cell is the hottest thing out there.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   It's the future of chips.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   It has multi-core.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   It had eight cores with a ninth controller.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   It's brilliant.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Of course, PS3 used it.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   I mean, IBM, which makes it said -- this is the last one.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   - Boy, did they pick the right one.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   - Well, and the question is whether IBM would have --
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   - Maybe if Apple had -- I think we talked about that a little bit last week.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   - We did talk about this.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   - I think we talked about this a little bit.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   - Oh, okay.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   - But I think that Intel's doing a lot of great stuff.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   I do think I will say that we have a ton -- not a ton.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   - Well, we might have a ton.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   It might be actually that much weight now.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   We have a bunch of --
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   - A metric ton.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   - Yeah, we have about five or six of the iMacs that we do production on at the office.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   We do the internal podcast, so the non-client work is typically done on iMacs because it's
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   a little lighter.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   So all the Mac brakes and everything else, those are all edited and put together on iMacs,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   and they work great.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   And every person that I've talked to who got the new 27-inch iMac, the new i7s -- I've
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   talked to a couple of people with i7s -- and they just said it's just one of the best machines
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   they've ever had.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   - Yeah, I was very impressed with it.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   - And I'm looking at getting that -- right now I have a 30-inch monitor.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   I'm looking at swapping that out for the iMac and sending that one back to the office so
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   that I have -- I'm actually going to use the iMac as my PC so that I can switch the monitor.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   - When you say that, you mean you're going to run Windows on it.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   - You're going to run Windows on it.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   - For the Windows -- there's a couple of Windows applications that I have to --
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   - That is disgusting.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   - I have a 3D scanner wrong with it.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   - I have this 3D scanner that only runs a 3D scanner.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   - You have to -- I have to hook it into something.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   - I'm surrounded by PCs.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   I have two Macs here and like 12 PCs.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   - Right.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   - So there are uses for the idea of having it just having the PC that doesn't have to ever
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   really lift anything heavy, just having it sitting in the background.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   And being able to switch up to it is --
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   - I'm hoping that that works because I'm not sure if it's going to work because of the
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   logic that's required to go back and forth between the monitor.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   - In any event, I think Intel is saying we are -- in order to skunk AMD and any potential
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   competition, we want to have a range of chips that go from the 24 core or 24 threads to
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   two threads, even to the Atom processor, which is really a very slow chip, and make sure
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   that every -- you know, the scale processors, which are going in portable devices, we want
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   to own it all.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   - This is what Apple is doing with the iPod.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   I mean, you know, it's the same thing.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   They're really, you know, owning that entire landscape.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   - That's clearly a good market strategy.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   And Apple's just taking advantage of it saying, well, if they're going to make it this way,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   this is good because it does answer that problem, that product differentiation problem.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   And there's -- I think now, Andy, there's a pretty -- like, don't you think there's a
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   pretty uniform, almost linear scaling, which is -- it has been from time to time in the
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   -- and not in other times, where, you know, we should do this, a graph of dollar for power
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   in the Mac line.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   And I think it's starting at 990 -- or actually the Mac Mini at 800, 700, 800 bucks, 999 for
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   the MacBook to the Mac Pro.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   I think that's probably -- I would -- we'll have to graph it.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   I bet you it's fairly linear.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   You want to do that, Andy?
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   You got some spare time?
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   - Well, I got a pen, and I don't have a ruler, but I got something like this.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   - Oh, yeah, he's a ruler, yeah.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.080]   - Oh, also, also, also, that's -- it's been a long time since that's been a really relevant
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:02.440]   sort of a metric, because you talk about different architectures, you're talking about different
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.520]   loadouts, you're talking about -- even when you're trying to compare how fast is -- how
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.680]   fast does something run under emulation on a Mac versus how fast would that be as a regular
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.680]   PC application?
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.720]   And I have to start worrying about, well, how good are the drivers that Apple gives you
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:22.520]   for bootcamp compared with the ones that you will get from the maker of your PC?
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.520]   - Right.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.400]   - And also, you don't want to encourage that kind of behavior.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:30.000]   I don't want people who -- the most boring people in every car lot are the ones who want
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.440]   to know how many CCs and what's the compression of this and what's the torque of that.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.880]   I want to know, is there a cup holder within reach?
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.360]   - You know, you're saying it's at USB port.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.640]   - People no longer think about power, they think about application.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.640]   That makes sense.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.640]   - I think --
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.760]   - I mean, the most important feature is now going to be the screen.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.560]   The second most important feature is going to be how many bounces do you get when you
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.200]   try to launch an application?
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.000]   And given that so many people are now -- the difference between the upper case and the lower
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.120]   case users is now so tight these days that everybody's writing a video editing app that
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.400]   has to be able to run under whatever sort of overhead is available, whether it's on a
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.000]   notebook or on a desktop machine.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   - It's true.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   That's one of the things that Adam doesn't do very well is run Hulu full-scale.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.840]   I mean, something that amazes me is that I can use Final Cut Express on pretty much any
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:22.280]   Mac that I own up to three years old, whereas on the PC side of things, there's always the
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.840]   case of is this -- how useful is this going to be?
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.120]   What kind of caveats do I have to put into place when I recommend this?
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.280]   When my next columns is going to be about really good cheap PCs, I'm looking for PCs
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.960]   that are not netbooks, but cost 500 bucks, ideally less than that.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.520]   And for five or six hundred bucks, you can get a very, very, very good machine.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.600]   But even if you were to spend seven or eight hundred dollars, the test has to be, how long
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.760]   will it take me to edit video on this thing?
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:53.600]   Because there's such a difference in performance within $150 that that's the most complicated
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.200]   part of the decision.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.680]   With a Mac, you can basically say, go into the Apple Store, get whatever you like, chances
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.200]   are excellent that whatever you're doing inside the house and many of the things that
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.480]   you're going to do professionally, no matter what you walk out of that store with, it'll
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.240]   do it just fine.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:12.040]   A story that I think is our Tiger Woods story in the tech community.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.040]   What happened to the Crunchpad?
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.600]   We'll talk about that in a minute.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.000]   It's just a weird story.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Weird.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.560]   I just hope there isn't video floating around in Arrington passed out on the bathroom floor
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.800]   in Las Vegas eating a cheeseburger.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.360]   Because if that's the reason why this thing went bad.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:38.280]   No, it's his model, supermodel wife, I believe.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:44.920]   But first, selflessly using the one working Crunchpad prototype to burn them.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.920]   B-thins sense.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.240]   That's what's wrong with all about the safety.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.240]   Unfortunately, that was the only prototype they had.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.400]   Yeah, I admit I was having an affair with Mike.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.240]   It's all coming out now.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:59.840]   But but first, let's hear from Gota meeting the folks at Citrix who do such a great product.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.160]   I want to tell you about it, Gota meeting is actually one of their series of products
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.280]   that use their brilliant remote technology in the background.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.080]   By the way, it works with Mac and Windows.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.680]   They invented remote access on Windows.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.480]   Their Gota meeting technology also works on a Mac.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.040]   Really brilliant the way it works.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.840]   I want you to try it yourself actually.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.840]   Just go to gotomeeting.com/macbreak.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.680]   You can sign up for an account and download it.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.560]   Within two minutes, you'll be ready to have a meeting.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:32.320]   Anytime you want to avoid that costly business travel, you want to confer with somebody,
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.400]   you want to collaborate on something, you want to train, you're ready.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.240]   You just say, "Hey, I'll tell you what, let me show you."
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.680]   With a guy on the phone and she's going to say, "What?"
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.000]   You say, "I want to show you.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Go to gotomeeting.com.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Okay.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   In front of your computer, yeah.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Go to gotomeeting.com."
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.840]   All right, you see that button says, "Join a meeting, yeah?
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.840]   Press that button.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.840]   Okay."
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.840]   It says, "What's the meeting number?"
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.640]   You give him or her the meeting number?
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.000]   He enters it.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.320]   It downloads a very small, a few hundred K-8 file and now she sees your screen.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.560]   You can share it with her.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.160]   She can show you her screen.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.600]   I'll show you mine if you'll show me yours.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.600]   It is remarkable.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.600]   We'll save you money.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.600]   We'll save you time.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.600]   We'll make your meetings more engaging.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.480]   I want you to try it absolutely free.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.840]   For sales presentations, product demos, training sessions, collaboration, replace your business
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.320]   trips, save your company lots of money and be more effective.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.320]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.320]   We thank you for their support.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.840]   Mac Break Weekly.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.000]   All right.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.160]   It's very much like Tiger Woods where you know something happened, but you don't know
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.000]   what happened.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.320]   I'm not known for defending Mr. Aaron.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.120]   Let's give a synopsis though.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.120]   Go ahead.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.720]   Because if it's exactly as things have been stated, I have never had more sympathy in
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.360]   my life for anybody as I have for Aaron.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.360]   He really got.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:23:00.320]   So Mike Harrington a year ago said, "Look, we need a tablet and we're not going to wait
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.720]   for Apple to do one.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:08.480]   We're going to do using open source and community and put some money into it and get some partners.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.480]   We think we could design a tablet.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.000]   We're going to call it the Crunchpad after Tech Crunch, which is Harrington's very famous,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.040]   very successful blog about Web 2.0.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.800]   We intend to sell it.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.800]   This isn't just an exercise.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   We're going to make something new to sell.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.320]   So they made prototypes.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.400]   They enlisted a partner.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:33.960]   And in fact, according to Mike's post on Tech Crunch about this whole thing, the partner
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:38.320]   and Tech Crunch set up a house in Silicon Valley.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.640]   Engineers came out.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.640]   They worked together.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.760]   I mean, it sounded like one of these perfect kind of development projects.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.920]   Yeah, like a real skunk work sort of thing.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.200]   Like when the Mac was designed.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:54.680]   However, it was going to be revealed.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.920]   It was going to be unveiled.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:06.640]   The working Crunchpad was going to be revealed on November 20th, 10 days ago.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:15.200]   And the two days before, Mike gets an email.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.640]   This is just weird.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:24.520]   From the company that is building the Crunchpad.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.840]   And they say, I'm going to find the email so I can read it to you because it's just
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:28.840]   bizarre.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.520]   It was November 17th, three days before the release.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:42.040]   The CEO of our partner on the project, Chandra, Ratha Krishnan, sent an email to Mike with a
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.680]   subject, no good news.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.880]   Mike looks at it and thinks, oh boy, another delay.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:53.320]   Through the screen, which has been giving us trouble, it's a 12 inch capacitance screen.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.960]   The email starts off with no good news to update.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.320]   Updated hardware still on its way.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.320]   So that's a timing issue.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.440]   Friday will be a challenge now.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.800]   Mike says, but the email went on.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.680]   Bizarrely, we were being notified that we were no longer involved with the project.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:14.400]   Our project, Chandra said, that based on pressure from his shareholders, he decided to move
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.680]   forward and sell the device directly through his company, Fusion Garage, without our involvement.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.680]   Huh?
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:25.600]   Mike says, this is like the first act of a Jackie Chan movie.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.600]   It's bizarre.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.800]   Where's Uncle's Noodle Stang?
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.360]   It's burned down by triad drug lords and he's explained well, we have a new brand.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.360]   We have a new business partner.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.520]   We've been informed that we no longer have a stake in the Crunchpad.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.520]   Goodbye.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.520]   Thank you.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.280]   This is the equivalent, he says, of Foxconn who built the iPhone, notifying Apple a couple
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.280]   of days before launch.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:49.160]   We'll move ahead and sell the iPhone without your help, Apple.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.160]   What happened?
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.440]   So I think that he says, by the way, that lawsuits are in process.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.440]   We're going to sue the hell out of them.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.440]   They can't sell it.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.640]   It's our product.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.000]   We work together on it.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.360]   They can't sell it unilaterally.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.560]   But he says the Crunchpad is dead.
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.480]   See, that's the line that really surprised me.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:13.320]   As opposed to saying we've invested a year and a half on multiple prototypes getting
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.640]   closer and closer to a final product, we felt as though we were simply days away from
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:23.000]   at least having the big media unveil of actually handing people working, functioning Crunchpads
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.840]   to show off how awesome it is.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.920]   Is he really going to bail bail?
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.120]   As opposed to saying, obviously, there's going to be lots of lawsuits.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.880]   Obviously we're going to have to do some things work out, but we haven't abandoned the project
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.880]   yet.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.480]   I mean, there are a lot of CEOs that I know that, you know, if they're in that sort of
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.640]   situation, it would have been okay to hell with them.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.560]   We have a couple of functioning things right now.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.720]   We're going to hold our own media event today.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.400]   Why would we fight this?
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.880]   To make sure that we send the message that we are the Crunchpad, we own it, we own the
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.320]   trademarks and that we are moving forward with it.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.960]   Even if we're just saying we don't have, obviously we've been set back six or seven
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.720]   months, but this is definitely going forward.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:04.760]   It's the idea of moving this into the dead zone that really makes me wonder what we don't
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.760]   know yet.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:12.480]   Merlin Mann's Twitter tweet on this is sad to announce the LunaPod project is now dead.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:19.040]   My mass produced $7 rocket to the moon was undermined by suppliers, lawyers and reality.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.960]   What happened?
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.080]   I think that as someone who tried to develop, I wanted to do this.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.360]   I went down the path with a Korean company.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.360]   I remember.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.200]   It will remain unnamed.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.600]   It wasn't anybody's fault.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.720]   It was just that there's, here's the problem with a pad, within any of these notepads, is
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.960]   that one, you know you can't charge too much because if you get anywhere near what you
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.800]   know Apple's going to do, you're going to get crushed.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.080]   They had a $300 price point, but to do that they had to put an atom in it.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.240]   Well, a $300 price point is complicated.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.240]   It takes a lot of work.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.760]   It's going to put a lot of stress on the project because we were trying to hit a $250
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.480]   $249 price point, $279 price point somewhere in there.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.800]   Same kind of area.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.120]   We were trying to release last summer thinking that this is just something that wants to
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.880]   happen.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.920]   Being afraid that Apple's going to release at any minute, we miscalculated how long it
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:17.120]   was going to take Apple to get to the, you know, get everything going.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.280]   So getting that working is complicated.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.880]   Once someone pulls out, the problem we end up with is half of it's their ideas, half
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.360]   of it's your ideas, how do you unstrip it?
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.640]   If you don't have it released before Apple releases, it's going to be very, it's going
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.840]   to be, it's just a more uphill battle.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.040]   And finding someone else who will even think about trying to do one of these pads for less
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:44.000]   than $300 or less than $500, to be honest with you, after I did all the part calculations
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.600]   and everything else, less than $500 to me is kind of unworkable.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:55.560]   Touch pads are just much more complicated than little use capacity.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.880]   Yeah, networks and touch pads are different.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.800]   I have a theory.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.200]   Having worked with Mike a little bit.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.240]   And there's two possibilities here.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.760]   I mean, it's possible that it went down exactly as he says.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:15.160]   And I do know that Mike, one of the things about Mike is he has a tendency to say throw
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.160]   up all his cards and say, okay, I'm out of here.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:23.200]   So to answer the question, you know, you're right, Andy, obviously, most companies would
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.600]   say, well, no, we're going to pursue this.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.600]   We made this thing.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.800]   We're going to make it.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:32.200]   But I, but knowing Mike as I, as I do, I don't know him real well, but I know that he's
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.440]   the kind of guy who'd say screw it and walk away.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.200]   So that's one possibility.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.840]   The other kind of possibility that I know people are thinking is maybe this whole thing
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.600]   was kind of a hoax.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   Maybe there wasn't maybe it wasn't that real to begin with that.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:51.160]   That if is, then this would have been, I think the son of what if that were true is to be
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.000]   more of a suicide by cop situation where someone wanted their credibility to be shot, but they
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   didn't want to kill themselves.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   I don't know.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.640]   I mean, if if it's if there never was a functioning crunch pad, if there were never was a fire.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.640]   People have seen it.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:09.640]   I'm saying, yeah, I really do believe that this was going to be an ongoing project and
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.240]   a real for real project.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.440]   Well, but I'm saying Alex might be right that they realized it couldn't be made.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.560]   Well, I mean, you know, I don't know.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.720]   I mean, you know, I think you know, you know, Mike better than I do.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.680]   It just seems like a lot of that that's not the right way to end it.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.040]   And I don't think it's even a logical way for even for somebody who's trying to cover
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   anything for clicks.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.040]   I don't know.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.040]   But I also think the other.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.880]   But when he get more clicks by saying, here's how the project fell apart.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.560]   Here's our landmark every Tuesday.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.120]   We're going to have another 2000 words of analysis on how things fell apart.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:45.200]   Also, we're going to get we're going to release more documents on how to develop this yourself.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.240]   Well, I mean, I think it more clicks, but I don't think he thinks that way.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.240]   He gets clicks the old fashioned way by sensationalism.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.760]   Well, I think that also though, I think that what could have happened that might be true
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:00.400]   is that that company realized that there was no margin in doing this thing and they wanted
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.100]   control over the sales and they didn't want to share the sales with anyone or share or
[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:08.080]   share much less or if any at all, because they were concerned that they weren't going
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.080]   to make any money on it.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.400]   But they didn't have the rights to it.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.720]   I mean, it wasn't really there.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.200]   Well, I think it depends on we don't know.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.200]   We haven't seen the contracts.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.200]   We don't know what the contracts were.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.400]   We don't know where the rights sat.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.520]   You know, it's you know, here's what here's what Mike says.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:24.720]   He says, we jointly own the crunch pad product intellectual property and we solely own the
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.640]   crunch pad trademark.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.360]   So it's legally impossible for them to simply build and sell the device without our agreement.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:35.240]   He says, you know, and you could take this completely face value.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.240]   I don't see any reason why not.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.840]   He says, we're still completely perplexed as to what happened.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.640]   It's a bizarre turn of events.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.360]   I think that it's obvious that there are a lot of things that aren't being mentioned,
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.240]   but it's not necessarily because he's hiding stuff, but because diplomatically and legally,
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.080]   there's going to be a lot of things that he can't.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.040]   You can't just simply say you blank blanking blank.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:01.120]   Because he's acted like a blanking blank and didn't regard the blank blank, you don't
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.600]   want to actually come out and say that, especially when you're still kind of mad that things
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.120]   didn't go well.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.160]   That's what it sounds like to me.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:13.120]   I mean, when I was yesterday was the day the death by thousand errands yesterday.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.760]   And on a day like that, I'm keeping in touch with the headlines.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.880]   I'm reading headlines, but I'm not really reading the actual story.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.920]   So I knew about this at around, you know, 11 o'clock noon, whenever the story broke,
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.600]   but took me several hours to actually find out the details.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.960]   And in that time, as I'm driving to the post office, I'm driving to appointments, I'm thinking,
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:35.200]   now I've come up now I'm down to 23 reasons why he might that this project might be dead.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.040]   I certainly didn't think because of legal stuff and someone really not behaving correctly.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:45.320]   It really did sound as though though, if someone's misbehaving, it does sound he did make it sound
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:50.720]   as though this is bizarre behavior of a partner who was telling who was saying things that
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.720]   were not exactly true misleading about the status of the product.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:58.440]   And we're looking for was looking for a way to say, yeah, I can either tell you right
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:03.640]   now my my business partner that all the promises I made about the the our ability to make and
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.160]   ship this are absolute lies.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:08.200]   I've been lying to you for months and months and months to cover up that we're not doing
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.200]   our job right.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:15.400]   Or I can simply say that there are these mythological stock mythological business partners that
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.960]   are telling me to do something kind of silly.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.480]   But the thing is, is in a corporation, I mean, the person talking to him could have been
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.360]   totally telling him exactly the job in a corporation.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:28.640]   The CEO has, you know, it depends on what I don't know what country they're in or what
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.640]   they're doing.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.240]   But typically you've got you've got the shareholders, you've got the you know, you've got the board
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.720]   of directors, you've got all kinds of things and those kinds of power struggles.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:40.080]   I mean, Steve Jobs got kicked out of app of his own company right through a power struggle.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.360]   So what happens is you have people thinking, this is a bad idea.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.360]   This is a bad idea.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.360]   This is a bad idea.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.920]   And literally when it comes up to getting ready to release, they come in and just say,
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.080]   this is the way it's going to be, this is how you're going to do it.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.520]   And the CEO doesn't have the power to do anything about that.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.800]   You know, and it's well, that's kind of what Mike's saying is this new shareholders,
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.280]   we're getting involved in this and this.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.360]   So it's what happens is someone, someone invested in this is always the danger of taking
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.960]   on venture capital.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.400]   It's always the dangers of taking on investors is they get, you know, there's a lot of little
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.240]   details in those contracts.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:11.600]   And what happens is they get controlling interest and it doesn't matter what the CEO
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.600]   thinks.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.000]   And so they can come in and they can come in with what Chandra is saying.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   And as follow up email, he says, I had another round of discussion with my shareholders.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.760]   The shareholders are not willing to move from their position as they believe their stand
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.760]   is justified.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.760]   On the other hand, there isn't an alternative offer on the table from Crunchpad.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.360]   And Mike's response is we don't have a counter offer because what you're proposing is illegal.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.880]   So we don't have an offer.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:39.000]   And his point and his, and I think the one thing for him to publicly drag them out and
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.520]   to say this is, you know, we're not going to go, we're not going to move forward, actually
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.640]   gives him some leverage that it might move forward.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.640]   Maybe that's what's going on.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:50.840]   Because the thing is that if you, if you tell them, okay, well now, now all that money
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.440]   you just spent is wasted for shareholders.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.440]   Yeah, we won't let you, we're going to lock you in.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.440]   You're going to do that.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.440]   We're not going to let you go forward.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.440]   We're not going to go forward.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.440]   We're not going to, we're not going to, I think there is no counter offer.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.080]   And Mike's a lawyer and Mike's a good lawyer.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.800]   You know, so that, that may be what's happening here.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.080]   We're just all speculating, but that, that could be possibly, you know, what's going
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.080]   on there.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.240]   And in that case, I mean, it would make sense.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.240]   I mean, I've, I've done that.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.760]   Like, no, that may be, that may the best be the smartest thing to do.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.760]   I don't like it.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.760]   Okay.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.760]   See, someone, someone puts me into a corner and I just go, well, I'm not going to move
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.760]   forward.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.760]   Right.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.760]   You know, and that's the easiest way.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.760]   And I'm usually willing to, there is a risk, but I'm usually, I mean, sometimes when you
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.760]   do that, then that's it.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.760]   And you got to be willing to.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.360]   And he doesn't have, he doesn't have a lot to, I mean, he has his reputation.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.920]   He's not his business, but it's not, it's not his core business.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.960]   It's not like, you know, everyone will talk about this for a while when the, if, if he's
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:42.760]   getting a lot of attention, he'll, you know, he can turn this over and be fine with it,
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.640]   especially if it is happening exactly the way he's saying it.
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.640]   He'll turn it over.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.640]   He'll be fine.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.640]   They'll be screwed.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.800]   You know, and so he's got a lot of leverage here, especially if he says we're not going
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.240]   to move forward.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.240]   That's my two cents.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.440]   Uh, just, I, you know what?
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.440]   It's like the Tigerwood story.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.160]   It's just a great story to chew on.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.760]   And who knows what really happened.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.000]   I'm going to give, I think Mike gets a benefit of the doubt.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.800]   We've now explained how everything that he says can be absolutely true.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.080]   And it's a reasonable strategy.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.080]   So let's just give him the benefit of that on this one.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.080]   Absolutely.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.080]   Well, it's saying mixed a whole lot of sense.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.080]   Yep.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.600]   And I only say that because I've been through, I've been through every problem that you could
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.600]   have in a company.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.120]   Well, and the other reason that you might really want to not go forward is because Apple's
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.960]   going to presumably announce at some point.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.200]   If you drag this out, if you drag this out, then you're dead.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.200]   Head to head.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   Right.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.720]   Beating Apple to the punch was, was I think part of the game.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:32.600]   You know, you go, you, you come in, you release something as an also ran two months after the,
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.800]   the iPad or whatever they want to call it.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.800]   They want to call it.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.800]   I might call it tablet Mac.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.800]   Did you see this?
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.800]   They've taken the trademark for tablet Mac for Maxion.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.800]   Maxion Tron.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.760]   Maxion Tron made that you, you probably saw it at Mac world.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.720]   If they take a Mac, they take it apart.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:50.280]   They put a wackum tablet based, a pen based screen on it.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.720]   It make, make a tablet Mac.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.520]   They call it the tablet Mac.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:59.560]   Apparently, sometime this year, Apple recovered the trademark from Maxion Tron and now owns
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.640]   the trademark to tablet Mac.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.360]   I doubt they'd name it tablet Mac.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.360]   Right.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.280]   But they want to make sure that they can, no one can, no one can.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.280]   What else can I buy?
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.280]   Computer.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.680]   But I mean, that, that, that is the biggest problem.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:15.360]   The biggest problem that these companies are going to face in competing with an Apple tablet
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.920]   is that price point.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:21.400]   The only way that they can really compete with a well made tablet is to make a cheap
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.960]   tablet that kind of works.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:28.440]   I was looking at, there's this new notebook computer called the little LITL, which is like
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.400]   a designed to be like an ease.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.880]   It's a, they call it a web computer and it folds up like it.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880]   It looks like a regular laptop.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.960]   It's actually almost as big as a regular laptop.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.000]   But the, one of the selling points of it is that you can actually fold the screen all
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.320]   the way back and stand it up like an easel.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.760]   And so when you're watching like Hulu videos and stuff, and I'm looking at this and okay,
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.800]   well the keyboard looks pretty cheap and, oh, okay.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.880]   So that doesn't look like it's extremely well made and, oh, it doesn't run any operating
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.320]   system that I'm familiar with.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.960]   So it runs all of its own apps.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:38:01.840]   Well, I bet it's, it must be like $150, you know, $200 and it's something like a $700, $800.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:06.200]   You can buy like an Intel Core Duo Windows machine for that amount of money.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.240]   And someone is expecting me to pay that for what is essentially a Fisher price computer
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.320]   with a couple of interesting little design style floors.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.760]   And the thing is, is when you look at user experience, I mean, on these tablets and these
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:21.640]   phones and everything else, the user experience is so important because you don't have a keyboard.
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.280]   You don't have a way to get around it.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.880]   It has to, it has to work well.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.600]   And that's going to be, that's always the big challenge.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.960]   And when you start talking about screens that are larger than the iPhone, it gets expensive.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.880]   You start making them touch sensitive and it gets a lot more expensive.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:39.400]   You start packaging them into something reasonably sturdy and good looking and it gets really
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.560]   expensive.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.920]   And then, and then you, then you have to deal with the operating system.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.760]   How are we going to make this all work?
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:50.040]   And you know, I don't think Linux is really, Linux by itself anyway is the, is the operating
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.520]   system you would use if you're not Apple?
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.520]   That's a real problem.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.160]   The problem is, is that it's not, it's just not going to, it's, it's not going to yield
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.480]   the kind of experience that you want.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.840]   You're going to have to design this entire world, but you have to, you have to design
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.840]   this entire world that's going to, that's going to do all of this stuff and it's going
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:04.840]   to do it well.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:10.080]   And, and it's, it's, it is a, it, for us, what happened was, is it along with some back
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:16.160]   and forths with the, the company that we were talking to, it, it just, it was like, this
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.160]   isn't our core business.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.400]   What we were interested in, we didn't care about making any money on the hardware.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:23.840]   All we were interested in is the, is the software media, media distribution, you know,
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.720]   and, and so I think that's the real opportunity.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.080]   And I decided at the end that we were happy to let Apple do that.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.960]   You know, let Apple do what they do well and then we'll figure out how to put media on
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.960]   it.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.960]   Right.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:34.960]   You know, and that's, we stick with our core business.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.560]   And that, that's, that's another good point that when people are buying a tablet, they
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:43.080]   don't necessarily, they don't really want a laptop computer that's been basically ripped
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.080]   in half.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.280]   It's, you can't, you can't design a motorcycle by just taking a car and removing two of the
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.280]   wheels.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.600]   You have to design something that's built to be operated as a two wheel device.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.600]   You have to start thinking, well, we can't really have a steering wheel and a comfortable
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.600]   seat.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.400]   We have to have something that will be operated by people leaning in and out.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.040]   We have to have a whole new control mechanism.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.960]   We can't have too much instrumentation.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:06.360]   And those, the same decisions that have to go into making a tablet computer, you have
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:10.320]   to design a computer that's designed specifically for the experience of standing there like
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:14.080]   the Statue of Liberty and tapping things with your finger or sitting on the couch and piloting
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.480]   your internet, internet experience that way.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.640]   So you can do it dirt cheap and people will say, well, you know, it's, it does do that
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.240]   much, but it's 250 bucks and it's a great book reader.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.560]   Or you can do it what Apple might be doing, which is to say we're going to charge five
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.520]   six, seven hundred dollars, but it will be a, it'll be a motorcycle experience, not a
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.360]   car experience, not a half of a car experience.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.000]   And I really think it's going to be $6.99 or $7.99 from the, from the numbers that you're
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   right.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.120]   I think $7.99 is the number from the, from all the work that we did in figuring out what
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.320]   the price point needed to be and, and to have anything business wise makes sense.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:46.920]   You know, I really think $7.99 is going to be, and it's going to be a great tablet, you
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.040]   know, and, and, uh, uh, but I think that that's the price point.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.400]   And I think people will tell you why it has to be able to buy it.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:57.000]   Someone thought people were crazy to spend $600 on an iPhone.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.160]   You just have to read the tea leaves.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.400]   It's not too hard to figure out that it has to be that price.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.760]   Because that's how Apple's pricing, you know, it has to fit into the product line.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.160]   You've always said that, Andy.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:09.760]   I do, I, I do have to say that, remember that, that price didn't stick for more than a couple
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.760]   of months.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:14.000]   I'm wondering if they would have, if the iPhone would have been the utter phenomenon that's
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.720]   become had they stuck to that $600 price point.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.760]   Well, I think it may, I think it'll, it might be a different thing.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.680]   If we can start underwriting it with, uh, cell coverage, I mean, you know, then, then,
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.080]   then we're talking about it coming down.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:29.600]   If they didn't start, if AT&T didn't start underwriting it, um, you know, we'd still,
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.560]   we still have $500 or $600 phones.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.560]   I see that.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.320]   That's another thing that I'm a little bit worried about that it's one thing for me to
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:40.280]   spend $700 for a device that is not going to replace my notebook.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.960]   It's just going to be something that is as use, more useful in certain situations.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.960]   I can maybe swallow that, but I'm not sure if I can swallow another 30, 40 bucks a month
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:51.040]   for data, for a data plan that's mandatory on a device like that.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.440]   If that is indeed the way that they choose to do it.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.400]   I, if I, if I could, if I could have a shared data plan between a hypothetical Apple tablet
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.400]   and my iPhone.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.400]   Okay.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:06.120]   I can deal with that, but I'm already spending, you know, the, the, if I were to add up all
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:09.280]   the different ways that I'm spent, I'm paying for internet coverage as it is.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.880]   I believe that I am at my limit of how much I'm willing to spend just to get a dial tone,
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.880]   so to speak.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:22.880]   I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I don't know how many I have to admit that I spend too much on data
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:30.520]   because I have my EBDO modem and, and then I have my iPhone and, and all the family iPhones
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:31.520]   and the other EBDOS.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.600]   Is it a Mac OS product?
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.320]   Is it a, it's an iPhone OS product?
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.120]   I think it's an iPhone OS product.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.120]   That's, that's my guess.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.120]   I think it's an iPhone.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.120]   I think it's an iPhone.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.120]   I think it was 10.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.120]   Sorry.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.120]   You think OS 10.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:45.120]   Well, iPhone is OS 10.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.440]   There's a pretty clear distinction between OS 10.
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.760]   Yeah, but, but, but, but I mean, they, they, they'd be nuts if they threw away the equity
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:53.480]   that they already had with the iPhone, with the iPhone development system and the iPhone
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.480]   operating system.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.920]   So it will be more like an iPhone than my guess.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:01.400]   Well, I don't know if it will be more like an iPhone, but I do think that I, I don't think
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:07.040]   that they'll be setting up a whole new system of developer boot camps to teach you how to
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.040]   create this.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.560]   How about, how, how about it?
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.120]   It's the development language is pink.
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.120]   Right.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.080]   It's definitely, I definitely think it's going to be, but I think that's, that's, that's
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:20.760]   the flavor is most likely going to be an iPhone flavor rather than a desktop flavor.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.760]   You know, so.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:26.220]   And it needs to, it needs to inherit so much equity from, from the iPhone from the touch
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.220]   operating system.
[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.920]   One thing it also needs to, I think it also needs to be able to be distributed, be able
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.680]   to distribute the content over iTunes.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.280]   I mean, that's, that's an important piece that makes this the killer app as well is
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.600]   that iTunes is so easy to use.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.520]   I mean, that's why we have a hundred thousand applications on there as much as anything
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.400]   else is that they're easy to find.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.040]   You know, they're easy to, I don't know if they're easy to find now, but they're easy
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.280]   to download and they're easy to install.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.280]   And we don't think about it.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.240]   You know, and I, so I think that that, you know, I, I do think what we're going to see
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:57.880]   at WWDC and I, and I do think we'll see the tablet before WWDC because I think we want
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.880]   to talk about it.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:43:59.880]   WWDC.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.880]   I mean, I think we're going to talk about developing for it.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.000]   And I think there's going to be a lot of things on how to take your iPhone app and up,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.200]   you know, up convert it to easily to the, to the tablet, which I bet you won't be very
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.560]   hard.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.720]   Let's move on.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:14.720]   Why?
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.720]   Because I say so.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.160]   How about, how about the whack them or walk them?
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.720]   You know, I think it's walk them.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.280]   I think, you know, somebody in the chatroom said they want to pronounce it.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.280]   Walk them.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:27.960]   But I've always said because there are only a few of us, a handful of us actually saying
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:32.920]   these words out loud, that I get to determine how everything's pronounced.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.600]   I feel no, I feel as though the manufacturer gets to determine how something is pronounced
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.840]   by spelling it properly on the product.
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.960]   Flip makes a video camera called the flip.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:47.440]   I know it's not called the minnow because if it were the minnow would be M-I-N-N-O,
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.440]   not M-I-N-O.
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.040]   It is the minnow deal with it flip.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.040]   That's my point.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.040]   Exactly.
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.740]   It's the minnow.
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.560]   They say we want to call it the minnow.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.560]   No, sorry.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:01.360]   It's spelled, mine, oh, and, and Andy, you're a print journalist.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:04.480]   So you don't have to worry about it, but the minute you come on this show and you start
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:08.480]   talking or going to radio show, you get to determine and, and, and you know, that's the
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.480]   power.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:10.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.480]   I'm going to go back.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:12.480]   I'm going to go back.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.480]   It's wack.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   It's wack.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.480]   It's more fun to say wack.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.080]   It is a, the, the, this gets back into the bouquet versus.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.760]   Oh, don't go this focus.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:23.360]   No, but, but the, but the, but it's a Japanese term, which is, which is wack.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.440]   Is it Japanese to know wack?
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.360]   Oh, wack home.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.360]   Wack home.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:32.000]   Oh, so from now on, I will say wack home.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.200]   I am using the wack home tablet.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.520]   Are you sure this wasn't just a trick to get you to say something and sort of erases
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.520]   Japanese accent?
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:43.120]   You, you've figured me out and you figured me out.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.120]   We got to do that.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.120]   I look after you here.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   You figured me out.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.000]   We're slowly moving from one.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.760]   We're slowly moving to a friend.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.760]   Everybody who I know.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.760]   For these, we've got Japanese from Star Wars episode one.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:54.760]   Today.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.760]   It is a perfect Japanese.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:01.480]   Oh, and, and, and last, last show I think we covered, uh, Appalachian American.
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.640]   I didn't say ah, so or anything like that.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.640]   I didn't, I didn't do the obvious transpose L's and ours.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.640]   I just said, la.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.040]   Oh, it takes, it takes work.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:13.240]   I mean, there's, there's a hundred and what 180, 180 countries.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.440]   There's just many people to upset.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.440]   Don't, don't worry.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.040]   Guatemala will get to you soon.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.040]   Yes.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.960]   Trinidad for your Portugal two weeks from today.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.880]   I'm, I was, I was not imitating a Japanese person.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.080]   I was imitating Mr.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:27.080]   Sulu.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:28.080]   Okay.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.080]   I was just doing Sulu.
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.920]   Actually, you do a better Sulu than I do.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:32.920]   Thank you very much.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.720]   It's pretty throws him a softball and he will not play.
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:35.720]   He will not play.
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.720]   He will not play.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.720]   I tried.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.720]   It wasn't really softballed more a snare.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:40.720]   I don't care.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.720]   That's because you think I'm your monkey boy.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:49.000]   You tried to dress that balloon up as a, I mean, tried to dress that bullet up as a balloon.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   It wasn't a balloon.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.080]   It was a snare.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.320]   It's a trap.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.720]   And he didn't fall for it.
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:47:04.160]   So there are now several sites for folks whose applications have been rejected by, by Apple.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.160]   They were, they collate the, the sites.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:10.280]   And it's usually started by some developer.
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.960]   I thought developers are better sulking that those, those vampires on Twilight.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:15.960]   That's good.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:18.200]   They're not as cute though.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.200]   This is the new one.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:23.360]   It's called apprejections.com.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:27.500]   Send app rejection news to @redglassapps on Twitter.
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:31.920]   If your iPhone app has been rejected by Apple in an unusual or unfair way, please write
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:36.000]   about it in your blog news, et cetera, and send us something.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.320]   It's like, by the way, that copy was written.
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.320]   It is.
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.360]   It just kind of begs to have your application has been denied for any reason.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:48.640]   Don't take it sitting down.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.160]   So there's quite a few in here.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.160]   It's interesting.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:52.160]   Rejected snake charge.
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:56.960]   And by the way, Apple said we'll never accept it.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:02.040]   It pretends to recharge the battery by shaking the phone and that the Apple reviewer on the
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.880]   phone told me, quote, please don't ever resubmit this application.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.760]   You will never accept it.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.160]   Spend your time and energy on other applications.
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.160]   Why would it?
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.160]   Was it just being?
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.160]   It's a joke app.
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:14.520]   You shake the phone and they'll charge it.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:18.440]   But Apple apparently believes that its users are too stupid and have to be protected against
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:19.440]   such apps.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:26.360]   I bought this app and I shake the phone all day and it doesn't charge.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.200]   But I'm getting good boss at muscles.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.080]   Now see, I didn't make it the Appalachian voice.
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.080]   You had to put it there.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.080]   I didn't do it.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.080]   That's not an Appalachian.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.080]   Oh, okay.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.280]   I don't even know what that is.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.280]   That's right.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:39.280]   You don't.
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.280]   Let's see.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:46.680]   Oh, they rejected grand tour 3D for a joke about money.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.080]   The concern was with a statement about the cost of my app and the description as it might
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.600]   cause confusion in foreign markets.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:49:04.920]   The statement was costs $149,999,995.01 less than the Voyager probe.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:09.120]   I thought that's funny, but you know, Apple doesn't like that.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:14.480]   Well, you know, as soon as those Voyager probes leave the lot, that's like 30% of its value
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.480]   gone right there.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:21.280]   So when they on mileage, I mean, Blue Book, I don't think it could be more than 1,300 now.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:26.760]   And once you launch them, the appreciation, the minute you get them out the door.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:32.320]   I mean, once you get them into out into technically outer space, they're only worth 10% of what
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.320]   it was worth.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.320]   10%.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.000]   And the Carter administration and those guys, those would be the first person I would believe
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.440]   would roll back an odometer.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.880]   It's the first president who knew how.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:43.880]   Let's put it that way.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.880]   I'm saying, but I'd be where.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:46.880]   Fire beware.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:47.880]   Let's see.
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:54.520]   Let me take a break, come back and talk more about the Macintosh and another stories.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:55.760]   I'm sure we have more stories.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.200]   I pray we have more stories.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.200]   You are?
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.200]   Okay.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.520]   The story that excites Alex the most in just a moment before we do that though, I want
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.280]   to tell you about what excites me a lot.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.280]   An awful lot.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.160]   It's my Ford Sync.
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:11.960]   I, the more I use this, I do.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:16.640]   And I run into other Ford owners now, you know, and of course it tracks attention because
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.000]   my Mustang is so red red.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.960]   And today, by the way, World AIDS Day, and so it's a project red Mustang.
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:28.400]   So I'm going to give a donation to Project Red to in honor of my Mustang.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.800]   I'm going to send them a picture of my red car.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.400]   Say, this is my project red car.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:38.040]   So I just thought I'd do that $500 to just to project red.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:41.880]   And you can, by the way, if you're going to a Starbucks, this is not a Starbucks ad.
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:42.880]   It's a Ford ad.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.400]   But if you're going to a Starbucks, they're given a nickel for every latte.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.400]   I'm going.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:48.400]   I always need an excuse.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:54.360]   And if you're on Twitter, if you use the hashtag red, your tweet will be red.
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:59.400]   So why don't you do that with this hashtag pound sync my ride podcast dot.
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.720]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.520]   Just pound sync my ride podcast.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:09.000]   So that way you get in the drawing that Ford's giving away 15 nano's and 15 zoons.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.880]   And every day, and all you have to do is send tweet with that pound sync my ride podcast
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.400]   and you'll automatically be entered.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.240]   Isn't that nice?
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.240]   The Ford sync stuff.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:24.640]   So when I was saying I run into Ford owners with my bright red car and they say, like
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.360]   and I say, oh, it's 2010 Ford really.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.120]   This is the Mustang, the classic.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.120]   It's back, baby.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:33.120]   It's just the styling and interior everything.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:38.120]   But the thing that puts me over the top is I've got this classic car with the most state
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:41.960]   of the art modern hands free I've ever seen.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.800]   I mean, this thing is incredible.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.800]   Sync is so much fun.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:45.800]   It's like a spaceship.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:46.800]   Yeah, it's like kit.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.440]   It's like the night rider.
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:51.360]   You get in there and you could talk to the cook, talk to your car.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.120]   You get in my audio book.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.120]   I'm listening to audio book.
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:52:03.000]   I just say press the button, it goes dong and I say play Lucifer's hammer and I'm almost
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   done.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   It's so good.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.080]   And it starts playing.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.480]   I can go to the next track.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:08.560]   I can go to previous tracks.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.640]   I can say play similar.
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.280]   It has some very useful features as well.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.320]   You know, you can get turn by turn navigation.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.320]   This is kind of cool.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.480]   You don't have to buy a GPS system.
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:21.320]   If your car has Ford sync, you get turn by turn navigation.
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:23.920]   You say destination and you tell it where you want to go.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.560]   You can even it's got points of interest as well.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:29.360]   So you can say this would be fun.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:33.320]   Navigation, dong, Starbucks and it'll take it in your Starbucks.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.760]   I love that.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.640]   You can it'll also reroute for traffic problems.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.040]   It gets to know your roots.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.920]   It has information play me the you know, I want the football scores.
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:48.080]   I want to if it's got fantasy sports as well.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:51.440]   So if you have a fantasy team, you can get the latest for your fantasy league.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.920]   You know, people who are really in the fantasy league.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:56.240]   There must be because why would you build that into a system?
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:59.440]   If that's that somebody would buy a car just because it would tell you how your fantasy
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.440]   league is doing.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:01.440]   Wow.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.440]   It must be right.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.440]   I mean, why else would you not understand how that works?
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.440]   I don't know.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.440]   It's incredible.
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.440]   Look, find out more.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:09.760]   Go to Sync My Ride podcast.com tweet to win a nano or zoom.
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.240]   All the details are on that webpage.
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:12.240]   Just put pounds.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:17.040]   Say I'm listening to Mac break weekly and I want to win pound, sing my ride podcast
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.040]   or anything.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:19.040]   You know, it doesn't matter what you say.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:22.680]   It's like to say pound, sync my ride podcast and do next time you're near a Ford Lincoln
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:27.160]   or Mercury dealer head on in there and take a look at sync.
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:31.680]   They will be very happy to see you and you give the tour and you say Leo sent me and
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.560]   they will give you an incredible deal.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:34.560]   No, they won't.
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:36.920]   I'll give you the Leo deal.
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:41.880]   He was basically list plus a thousand.
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.560]   All right.
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:47.720]   Moving along to the story that Alex is so very interested in.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:48.720]   What story would that be?
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.480]   This is a long time coming.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.480]   And it's still a room.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:53.480]   Crosby stills in that.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.480]   Oh, he's so good.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:54:00.640]   Anyway, so the this is a rumor about this is from Boyd.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:06.680]   The Boyd Genius report is that Apple's IDVD getting refreshed to support the iTunes LP
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.680]   creation.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.400]   So, oh, that would be great.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.520]   Something I've been talking, you know, anytime I get it, get an ear at Apple, which is,
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:18.240]   you know, less and less common because I complain about stuff all the time.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.560]   But one of the things I've always said is that they should turn, you know, DVDs are
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:30.560]   kind of the past and they should really turn IDVD or DVD studio pro, in my opinion.
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.480]   The big one is DVD studio pro to build interactive titles.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.680]   And to me, it was interactive quick times.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:41.920]   But as you start looking at these iTunes LP creation, you know, both the LP and then
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:48.200]   the movie extras and so on and so forth, IDVD and DVD studio pro are perfectly designed.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.440]   To build this kind of stuff.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.760]   You give them some templates.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.320]   You have them instead of output a DVD.
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:54.800]   They output all the files that are necessary.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.560]   You know, it is just it would be perfect.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:01.160]   And so I'm hoping that both IDVD and DVD studio pro are going to allow us to develop
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:04.760]   because right now it's going to be a little, you know, it's a little bit of work to develop.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.440]   We're looking at it very heavily.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:10.680]   We're planning to, as soon as Apple lets people like us, which I'm hoping is going
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:15.040]   to happen next year, let people like us produce that kind of stuff for our podcast,
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:19.200]   for Mac break and so on and so forth, being able to add all these extras, we're absolutely
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.720]   going to take advantage of that.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:25.920]   And, you know, right now, Apple has only opened it to indie companies.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:28.720]   But I think that I think what's going to end up happening is podcasters are eventually
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.720]   sometime next year.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.560]   God, this is going to put a lot of work on our plate.
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:32.560]   But it's going to be exciting.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.000]   But you're right to be able to put the images in there.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.320]   You know, we, of course, there was the AAC enhanced feature which used to do, but it was
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.320]   so much work.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:45.520]   We actually have killed the AAC versions of all our shows because we couldn't keep up
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:46.520]   with the enhanced stuff.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:50.680]   I'd have to hire an entire new staff person or two to do that.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:51.680]   It's a lot of work.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:53.960]   And we're going to do it because we're really excited about the idea.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:54.960]   You're going to put chapters.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:55.960]   You're not going to do it.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.480]   But why don't you do AAC enhanced?
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.200]   We do do some AAC enhanced.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.000]   With chapters and images.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.840]   The problem was is mostly that the iPhone didn't really support it very heavily.
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:07.880]   You know, see, that's my big problem is that in order for this to work, you have to
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:11.360]   be using iTunes and you have to have an iPod or an, you know, and it doesn't bother me
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:12.360]   at all.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:15.240]   Well, it bothers me a little bit because I don't want to build that.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:18.960]   I don't want to build a Apple only version of my shows.
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.320]   I want to have that as an option.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:24.520]   I think that there's, I think there's a lot of business opportunities that are available
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.520]   when you start adding interactivity.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:28.160]   And I have to say it's going to put the pressure on.
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.160]   I agree with you.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.160]   And I think it's just another way for Apple to tie people into iTunes.
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:38.920]   You know, you're already seeing YouTube, you know, getting ahead by adding some interactivity
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:39.920]   to what they're doing.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.920]   We'd have to look at it.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:45.040]   But my initial reaction is I just wouldn't want to do it because I don't want to create
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:48.600]   this kind of Apple requirement for anything that I do.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:49.920]   Well, we do it in this show.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:52.840]   Given that we do Mac shows, I figure I'm pretty safe.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:53.840]   I don't know.
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:54.840]   I don't think so.
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:56.400]   We have a lot of Windows users listening to the show.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.400]   Well, and I'll give them a version.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.400]   I'll be nice.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.400]   Is there any way to look at iTunes LP on a...
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.400]   You're on a TV video.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:05.120]   I mean, you know, you could look at it on iTunes on it.
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:10.320]   If your Windows listener just send Alex a Sazy self-estram self-on-loaf, he will send
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:14.440]   you a copy of printouts of all the different bonus materials that we're going to be going
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:15.960]   out for Mac Mini.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:17.120]   That would be the other way to do it.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:20.080]   Because Alex has all this free time on his hands and all this staff that can generate
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.080]   all this content for him.
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:22.320]   So it's no problem for Alex.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:25.320]   I have a tendency to only build, you know, we got into...
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.840]   We used to build a couple of different versions and now we've had a tendency to just kind
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:28.840]   of...
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:29.840]   I've cut back.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:34.160]   But our cut back is usually we only produce AAC so that we always left ourselves open
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:38.320]   to being able to add the interactivity back into it.
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:40.320]   Well, the good news is you can...
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:42.160]   The difference here is you can make...
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:45.800]   With enhanced AAC you had to have an AAC compatible player and a lot of players aren't.
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:50.440]   But with the Apple IP format, LP format, you still would be able to play it.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:51.880]   You just wouldn't get all the additional features.
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.560]   So it isn't such a lockout.
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:55.560]   It's kind of an enhancement.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.560]   So that in my...
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.600]   Now, what can you do?
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.000]   You can add images.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   There's images, there's extra...
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   I mean, it depends on...
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.680]   The LP is, I think, a fairly basic thing.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:09.520]   But I think that there's also the extras for the DVDs that are available.
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.920]   And you know, it's a lot of different little...
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:16.240]   I have someone at the office I have to admit going through all the options that we have
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.240]   because we're really...
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:23.200]   As soon as we saw that they were opening this up, we had guys start to look at what...
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.400]   How far can we stretch this?
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:27.600]   I think it's a very exciting development.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:31.480]   Okay, it's going to put me on the spot.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:35.440]   What we're going to do is that we'll do it first.
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:38.680]   And if we can figure out how to make it actually work.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:40.320]   So there is a tool currently.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:41.320]   The Apple is just...
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:42.760]   This is an internal tool that Apple only.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.040]   Well, Apple produced like this is how you produce it.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:46.400]   This is how you produce the content.
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:49.360]   So there's like a command line way to do this?
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:53.200]   Yeah, well, I'm not sure yet because as I said, I saw it and I have to admit that being
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.520]   in my position, I went...
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:59.240]   I saw it, I went to the page at Apple that showed how to do it.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:03.800]   And then I sent it to someone at the office and said, "Okay, figure out how to do this."
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:06.320]   So that's what you're saying is you have people.
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:08.080]   I had my people look at the thing.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:12.600]   I haven't dug into it too deeply myself yet.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:13.600]   But I'm going to.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:14.760]   No, I'm excited.
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:16.680]   And does this mean a...
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.080]   This would mean a...
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:20.880]   This would be for iLife 010?
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:21.880]   What do you say that?
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:22.880]   Well, 10.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:23.880]   10.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:24.880]   I like...
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:30.000]   If the rumor is true, then that looks like it's going to be in the next iLife update.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.360]   What are we going to call that?
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:33.560]   iLife 10, I guess.
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:35.800]   No, because that's confusing with OS 10.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:36.800]   iLife.
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:37.800]   Who will it be iLife X?
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.400]   And then what is it in 2011?
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.400]   iLife XI?
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.400]   XI.
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:42.400]   There's already...
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:45.120]   What are we going to do?
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.120]   These are problems.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:49.880]   I hope people at Apple are thinking, "Coupertino, wake up!"
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:53.080]   You know, they never think about things like marketing or packaging or naming or...
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:54.080]   I've never got it.
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.080]   They've already figured out what you're saying.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:56.080]   They already know.
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:58.920]   So, yeah, I think that they're thinking of something here.
[00:59:58.920 --> 00:59:59.920]   But you know, Apple put up...
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:11.080]   So, if you go to apple.com/itunes/lp-and-extras, there's iTunes, LP and iTunes extras for developers.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:15.120]   I mean, you can probably just search for LP and extras or whatever.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.120]   But it's really great.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:20.240]   What they've lined up here is templates that you can use to build that stuff out.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:25.240]   They've also lined up best practices, a development guide, asset delivery, testing...
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.480]   Do you have to use AAC?
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.480]   I believe you do.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.480]   Is it kind of an extension of the enhanced format?
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.120]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.880]   I said, "Ask me in a week."
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:36.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.880]   I'm very curious.
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.880]   We'll talk more about it because we're going to be doing some tests for probably going to
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.560]   be a tool that Apple's got internally, right?
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.680]   Well, has given to the record labels.
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:45.840]   Well, and I think that it's...
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.640]   I don't know if it's as tool as much as a guideline of how you package all the stuff
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:50.640]   out.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.280]   I think it's more of a folder structure than anything else.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.720]   I don't think that there's a tool.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:58.000]   I think that there's actually a...
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.880]   Well, there might be a tune...
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.440]   Oh, okay.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:08.040]   So there's a thing called "Tune Kit" at the bottom, which looks like it's JavaScript.
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.240]   Oh, so this is new, actually.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.200]   They have distributed these tools now.
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.200]   Yeah.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.200]   Okay.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.200]   I'm seeing it on the website.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.120]   And I said, "I'd love to say that I knew more about it right now."
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.120]   Automatic.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.120]   We just got into it.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:25.440]   Electronic submission of your next iTunes LP or X-ray is scheduled for the first quarter
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.440]   of 2010.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.440]   Right.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.920]   No, that'll work.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:32.080]   Until then, the submission process is manual and limited.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.080]   Right.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.200]   Please contact your label or studio rep.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.200]   Well, okay.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.480]   Well, you got to remember this is not for normal people.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.680]   When Apple released this is just the stuff that they put up.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.040]   When Apple released this, it was only available to the big four.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.040]   Right.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:50.480]   And so they have now made it more, they're slowly making it available to more people.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.320]   Because I don't know, I mean, obviously they went to the trouble of making it happen.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:59.400]   And I think it's important that they do this because they have to find ways to continue
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:04.720]   to distinguish iTunes from other things.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.360]   But you can see that there's extra examples.
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:11.960]   I mean, really what you're now looking at is iTunes being able to have iTunes become
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.960]   a DVD experience.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:13.960]   That was one of the problems.
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.920]   It was one of the problems with downloading a movie is, yeah, I can download the movie,
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:17.920]   but I don't get any of the extras.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.960]   I don't get any of the behind the scenes.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:25.680]   I mean, that's why the only reason I buy DVDs, Blu-ray or regular DVDs is so that I can
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:26.680]   get the extras.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.640]   If it doesn't have the extras, I might as well just rent it.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.680]   So it's done in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.880]   That's very interesting.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.160]   And the software they offer is JavaScript.
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.480]   I just downloaded it.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:39.480]   Very interesting.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.560]   So it's, I think it's, and the instructions look pretty good.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.040]   And as I said, I just kind of looked at it and said, well, this is something we want
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.040]   to do.
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:49.480]   So we don't even know when we're going to be allowed to, but we want to be like day
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.200]   one that they make it available to us.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.640]   We want to be publishing.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.600]   And Holger's telling me in the chat room, there's a website that offers free iTunes
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.280]   LP content.
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.000]   It's iTunesLP.net.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:11.280]   So you can get iTunes extras and LP from, I guess, independent bands.
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.200]   We're actually individuals who have created these for commercial songs.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.200]   That's kind of neat.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.040]   So does it allow you just to link into it?
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.040]   Is that how it works?
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.040]   Maybe not.
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:26.440]   If your band has an iTunes LP, you'd like to see, okay, so right now there are, yeah,
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.920]   no, these are all independent.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.600]   These are community iTunes LPs, and there aren't very many of them.
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:34.040]   There's six or five.
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:38.240]   And you can have iTunes 9 compatible or Appetivi compatible.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.240]   Very interesting.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.760]   Now, what's Apple's plans for this?
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:45.080]   I always thought that the whole point of iTunes LP was to help sell more content as
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:48.240]   entire albums as opposed to individual tracks.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:54.520]   So are they just making very, very easy to use tools so that every label and every distributor
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.800]   can produce their own custom content?
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:02.200]   Or is the idea of being having an open content for bundling premium content with digital
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:09.520]   files so that even if I come across some of that public domain stuff that you often
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.240]   find on BitTorrent, like if I wanted to repackage that with some cover art and some
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.400]   minor notes, for like opinions, would that be something that anybody could do?
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:23.640]   Apparently at this iTunes LP.net, you can distribute the assets and the music.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:28.000]   And if you put it in the right folder, that's okay.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.800]   That's a very interesting business plan.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:37.120]   I shall look forward to their career with considerable interest.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.720]   I think we have a SciStar of 2010.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.120]   Speaking of SciStar, they've got a new business model.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.120]   You don't sell any of this.
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.120]   [laughter]
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:05:03.120]   The
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:05.240]   successful hackintosh community.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:10.400]   If they were to innocently put together PCs that have just, you know, weapons to work.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:14.480]   Where the big bullet items or the sort of bullet items that you never see like Dell
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:20.360]   advertised, the Wi-Fi uses the Intel chipset.
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:23.200]   For which there are already drivers in Mac OS.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:27.520]   The Nvidia graphics card that we've put in here is the same graphics chip found in
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:30.280]   the Mac Mini WinkWink Nudge Nudge.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:35.200]   And just to be the most blatantly hackintoshable PC on the planet, it would still be, it would
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:39.880]   still be the sort of thing where you'd want to do this as a side business to your regular
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.680]   job at Best Buy or whatever it is that you have your real job at.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.680]   Don't give up your day job.
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.680]   You don't want to buy property.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.680]   You don't want to hire staff.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:50.560]   But you could get away with that for a long time before you would get annoyed enough.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:56.680]   You know, a very small amount of money for legal expenses just to say, just to pay some
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:02.800]   lawyer to say, what words and phrases can we not put into any of our advertising and
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:08.520]   just make it so difficult to sue them to prove that you're building PCs with the intention
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:13.800]   of people not installing Linux on them, but installing Mac OS X that I think they could
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.800]   have gotten away with that for a long, long time.
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:20.320]   Well, and you saw the analysts who said after looking at all the books and everything as
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:24.240]   far as he can tell they've sold, are you ready for this?
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.240]   768.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:29.080]   The size star computers.
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:32.680]   It's not, it's not been a, but you know why?
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:35.200]   Because everybody can hackintosh existing hardware.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.920]   So you don't have to buy it from size star.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:41.120]   So size start could have a model, which is well with sell you a Mac ready, OS X ready
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:42.120]   computer.
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.240]   They do have this rebel EFI.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.680]   And apparently, I mean, is Apple going to stop them from selling that?
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.680]   I don't think they can because that.
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:51.720]   I have to EFI.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:55.160]   You start to think about different ways that you can make your life simpler.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:59.960]   And if they simply said that we are going to build PCs that are really, really easy
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:08.400]   to modify, really, really easy to develop an EFI booter so that they can run Mac OS X.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.640]   If all of that's all they ever did, I think that they could sell, that could be one of
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:17.880]   the very, very significant manufacturer of PC, PC hardware.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:21.520]   Why would they want to invite themselves the legal hurt and also the technical hurt of
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:27.160]   having to develop their own bootloader, their own hackintosh system and support it and also
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.160]   defend it in a court of law?
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:32.120]   I mean, I would be.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.120]   I don't know.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:37.400]   They don't currently charge for rebel EFI is entirely software.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:43.520]   It doesn't involve, you know, any hardware requirement, no, no size start or computer
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.520]   required.
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:47.160]   It does not contain any OS 10 code.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.160]   It's just EFI.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.160]   Right.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.160]   Well, it's based on open source.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:56.760]   An open source bootloader, most of these get X operating system running on Y hardware
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.560]   usually starts with a version of this bootloader.
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:04.320]   It's the basic template that people use to get these projects up and going.
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:10.880]   So I'm just thinking, if it's that simple to get a community behind this effort, why
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:13.040]   would you even invite that kind of problem?
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:18.120]   Even if it's a 5% hassle, why invite a 5% problem, especially given that you're well,
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:21.280]   they've already demonstrated that they have about as much common sense as the average
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:23.760]   kid with a skateboard and a YouTube camera.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:28.200]   But I just don't see why they would want to invite that kind of pain.
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:35.760]   Is illegal is RFI or EFI rebel EFI illegal and size star gives it away and it is, but
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.760]   you can download it from anywhere that tells you how to hack and tauting.
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:41.080]   Obviously, that doesn't make it illegal.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.080]   That doesn't make it legal.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:45.760]   That just makes it extremely unattractive for anybody to sue you.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:50.800]   There was a time when I really had to look into this because I was trying to understand
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:53.080]   what could and could not be done by a copyright part.
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:56.920]   We partly because I was trying to get protection for some of my own creations, but also because
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.960]   I just wanted to understand the mechanism.
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:04.560]   And every expert I talked to said that the argument that you want to win is not an argument
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:09.560]   between you as a defendant and a judge or a jury in a civil trial, but the argument between
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:13.560]   the potential, the person who's potentially thinking about suing you and his lawyer,
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:18.800]   you want to create a situation where the lawyer says, we could sue, we would win, then the
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.440]   judge would say, okay, how much money has this person made off of this product?
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.760]   They would say, well, no, actually he hasn't made a damn penny off of it.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.600]   And then that would mean that not only are damages going to be very difficult to assess,
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:34.440]   but also that it would be very difficult to get that money out of you as the infringer,
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.320]   which is not necessarily the right way to do business.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:40.920]   But here's an interesting twist to all of that.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:47.440]   RMF just sent me from our chatroom a link to the developer of the open source bootloader,
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:49.720]   open source boot 132.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.880]   He's pissed off at SciStar because he says, you stole my code.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.880]   It's open source code, but you didn't credit it.
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:58.240]   So SciStar is violating his license too, he says.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.920]   And they seem like such sensible people.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:06.120]   Obviously, they're dotting all their eyes and crossing all their tees.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.120]   Oh, man.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:12.480]   That's another one of those books that I really want to read when all the dust is settled
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:17.840]   and find out exactly what was going on behind the scenes at SciStar, who was really riding
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:21.120]   the checks for this, what their actual goals were.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:26.200]   Were they trying to become like another gateway in the sense that they would not ever be a
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:30.680]   big market mover, but they would be a real presence with real offices and cars for the
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.080]   company logo on it.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.960]   Or was it just we have we feel as though we have a 14 month window in which we can make
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.480]   a lot of money before we shut down, but we will get to keep the money.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:45.080]   I think that's I think it's a fascinating business, business case that a lot of people
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.080]   could learn a lot of things from.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:51.720]   According to the unofficial Apple web log today, SciStar and Apple have reached partial settlement.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.640]   Lauren Hirsch writing in TUAW says details are sketchy.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:11:00.800]   It appears that in return for paying Apple unspecified damages on its copyright claims,
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.800]   most of which were ruled in Apple's favor.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:07.320]   We talked about this last week in a summary judgment motion last month.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:13.160]   Apple will drop its remaining claims against SciStar, including those for trademark violation.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:17.760]   Apple also agreed not to execute on those damages until all appeals have been exhausted.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:21.920]   So basically, SciStar is saying, all right, we'll pay off, but can we continue to continue
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:25.080]   in court?
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:31.120]   SciStar apparently completely concedes copyright violation by arguing that whatever the court
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.840]   decides to do with the permanent injunction, barring sales of its computers with OS 10
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:38.520]   preinstalled, that it not extend that injunction to Rebel EFI.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:43.100]   Of course, the guy who wrote the open source code, the Rebel EFI is based on.
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:48.200]   I have something else to say about that.
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:53.080]   It sounds like a big win for Apple, not just to shut down SciStar, but also to have it demonstrated
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:59.200]   exactly what will happen to you if you try to sell software not made by Apple that runs
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.200]   Apple software without their permission.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.840]   Well, I think that was the point.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:03.840]   I don't think Apple was going to.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.080]   I don't think Apple was worried about these guys.
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.480]   I think they were making sure that everyone got that there's a big stick here for anyone
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.120]   who goes down in this pack.
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:14.400]   And Mac Rumor says that the settlement is $2.7 million, although it's not been disclosed.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.120]   But that would be significant.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.440]   A significant for a little company trying to sell.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.560]   For a company that sells 768 computers.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.520]   That's a big, big amount of money.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:23.520]   You talk about it.
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:27.800]   Does anybody have you seen any of these actually in the field?
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:30.720]   Because that has to be one hell of a collectible now.
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:36.360]   Anybody in our audience have a SciStar?
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.360]   Send us pictures.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:40.040]   It didn't happen.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.840]   I don't know how you kind of it's a beige box.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.400]   Does it have a SciStar logo?
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:44.400]   I don't know.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.360]   And you feel you totally weren't for real because they never actually shipped any t-shirts
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.360]   or hats.
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:50.360]   Yeah, you got it.
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:51.360]   You got a t-shirt.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.360]   That's that's legitimacy.
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.440]   I bet the crunch pad has a t-shirt.
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:58.400]   According to the rumor anyway.
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:01.200]   Now this is a joke.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.440]   This has to be a joke.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:06.680]   $3, $3, $7, $500 in...
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:07.680]   $1.337.
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.680]   That's interesting.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:09.680]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.760]   And this is not true.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.760]   In damages.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:17.160]   Plus additional damages and attorney fees amounting to another $1.337.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:22.880]   Yeah, I heard they wanted administrative costs of $420,000.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:27.960]   I think this is interesting.
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:31.640]   It turns out it spells leets with two zeros at the end.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.880]   Yeah, that had the zeros to make it worth anything.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:37.080]   You think Apple's lawyers have a sense of humor?
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.080]   No.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.080]   No.
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:42.000]   Oh, Leo, we do enjoy our laughter here.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.280]   What a glorious gift.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.080]   That's pretty funny.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:50.120]   Well, CNET has a review of a SciStar.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.040]   I think they're the only ones who ever had one.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.520]   768 computers total they sold.
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.280]   At least according to one analysis.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:58.040]   At least they shipped some of them.
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:03.040]   They shipped at least we know it wasn't just like a greenback scam or anything like that.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.040]   Yeah, at least they did.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:08.040]   It wasn't a tablet that we never had to see.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.200]   I think Mike Harrington, somebody in the chatroom suggested this.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:14.840]   Should have a t-shirt that said, "I spent $4 million on all I got with this lousy t-shirt
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.440]   with a picture of a crunchpan on it."
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:17.440]   That'd be cute.
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.440]   For Mike.
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.440]   Did he spend his own money or did he?
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.440]   No, well, it's kind of his money.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.440]   It's kind of his money.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.440]   But it was a partnership.
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:25.440]   But yeah, they put money in it.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:26.440]   They had a house.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:27.440]   They had 13 developers.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:28.440]   But maybe that's the question.
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:33.400]   Well, maybe that's Chonner's contention as well.
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:34.680]   I put all the money up.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.000]   I don't know.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   No idea.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:45.640]   But I think that L was beating him with a club and he ran out the door.
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:47.520]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.080]   You think?
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:52.440]   When I saw the Tiger Woods news, when they gave the con put it out.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.440]   You saw that right away.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:56.440]   As soon as I saw that I was like, "Who will she kiss?"
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:57.440]   He's already damaged.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:58.440]   He's injured.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:14:59.440]   Why would you?
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:00.440]   He crashes.
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:04.200]   She starts beating in the window saying, "This is what happens, Larry.
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.200]   This is what happens."
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.720]   Car is not on fire.
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.800]   There's no reason to break the window.
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:09.800]   There's other doors.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.800]   She chased him with a golf club.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:11.800]   She was.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:12.800]   And he has injuries.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:16.120]   And so he doesn't want to talk because he doesn't want to press charges.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:17.760]   Or I don't know.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:18.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:19.760]   Does that what happened?
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:20.760]   I don't know what happened.
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.480]   But I was like, as soon as I saw that I was like, "Oh, she was pissed.
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:23.880]   This is all anybody could talk about."
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:28.760]   I'm trying to but a FUCO point on that story about two paragraphs into the first E-Online
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:29.760]   alert.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.160]   No, you don't have that gene, I guess.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.160]   I do.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.160]   It's just this.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.760]   Sometimes you find yourself thinking, "I know a lot of personal information about people
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:42.600]   that I will never meet and don't care anything about."
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:43.600]   Right.
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:44.600]   I feel as though.
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:48.360]   I know that as I look around here, I've got a couple of empty soda cans.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:51.360]   I could be spending that time clearing the empty soda cans away from my desk.
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:54.280]   And I think that's what I should be doing instead.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.880]   I suppose I really can't.
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:56.880]   Echo Golfer.
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:58.600]   Echo Golfer Tiger.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:02.160]   Love seeing you on the highlight reel every single week.
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:03.560]   Whatever you want.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:08.800]   That's what I felt about when David Letterman got his little kerfuffle.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.200]   Because I'm like, "You know what?
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:13.040]   David Letterman, he's not my dad.
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:17.400]   If he's been having a fair cheating on his girlfriend, that really doesn't affect me."
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.400]   Not my business.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.440]   Because you're a good person.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.440]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:23.440]   You're a better man than I am.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.680]   You're a better man than I am.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:27.680]   You're doing.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.680]   Uh-oh.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:29.680]   Are you going to Larry?
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:30.680]   We've got video.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.680]   See what happens?
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:34.480]   See what happens, Larry?
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.920]   I'm not going to play the rest.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:45.280]   There's some video, exclusive TMZ copyrighted video of what actually happened that night.
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.760]   See what happens?
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.760]   Alright.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:48.760]   I can't play it.
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:49.760]   I can't play it.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:50.760]   This what happens when you're ****.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:51.760]   Oh.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.440]   Oh, just a little too far.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:57.640]   It just went a little, little too far.
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:58.640]   We can bloop that.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.440]   Can't bloop it live.
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:01.600]   We can bloop it.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:05.680]   That's the advantage of listening to it live.
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:09.240]   That's what happens, Larry.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.240]   We're going to take a break.
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.240]   Come back with your picks of the week.
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:14.160]   So everybody ready with your picks?
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.960]   No screwing around this time.
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:20.120]   But the first I want to mention are goodfriends@audible.com.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:25.200]   You know, it's just a coinky dink, but audible goes so well with Fort Sink.
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:26.840]   It's just a coinky dink.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:31.200]   But every time I get in the car, my book picks up where I left off.
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.200]   I mean, it's just great.
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.200]   It's like my car.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.920]   I mean, okay, I admit I'm, you know, a little fantasy here, but it's like my car's reading
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:37.920]   to me.
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:38.920]   This is hello.
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:39.920]   Leah, we missed you.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.880]   Wanna go for a ride?
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:42.880]   Okay.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.840]   Let's start where we left off.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:47.240]   And then it starts reading me my book.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:50.600]   Anyway, I get all my audio books from audible.com.
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:56.160]   They really are the best source of audio books anywhere and just incredible selection.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:59.320]   65,000 total titles.
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:00.400]   Many to choose from.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.760]   Many of which we have recommended on all of our shows.
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:04.640]   We've been doing this for three years now.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.440]   I've long ago run out of recommendations.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.360]   I'm still reading Andy's recommendations.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:11.360]   And so I'm praying.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:14.240]   I'm hoping that Mr. Naco has won for us today.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.240]   I do indeed.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.360]   Is there a big Lebowski book on that?
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:23.440]   I'm not sure if it's a little bit, if it's a little Bowski, but sometimes with audible,
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:28.160]   they're books that are just classics and you're reading them and thinking, I hope this is
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:30.080]   available on audible and it's not.
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:33.840]   But then you check back a year later or two years later and there's a new edition that
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.160]   suddenly appeared.
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:39.600]   This book made a big splash when it was first published a few years ago.
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:42.400]   It is by Robert Evans, the producers, producers.
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.400]   I love this.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.720]   Oh, this is so cool.
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:50.400]   It seems as though the late 60s and early to mid to late 70s were built with this producer
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.400]   in mind.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:55.040]   So it's his autobiography memoir of his heyday.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:01.880]   The kid stays in the picture and Robert Evans has this sort of orange spray tan sort of
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:07.120]   Hollywood old guy with a facelift sort of voice that you can tell that he's I've had
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.800]   to open the up of the house today.
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:14.720]   I had Chris Kristofferson and Linda Evans today and we played chess today while I'm
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:17.280]   enjoying sipping.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:21.640]   All these stories about producing some of the biggest hits of the 70s, but basically
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:27.440]   of enjoying the fact that he was at that time possibly the most powerful man in Hollywood
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:32.920]   that everybody wanted to get close to, that everybody wanted him to take a meeting with.
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:37.800]   And it just shows you will always be this image in your mind of how Hollywood really
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:41.760]   works and how deals are transacted and how these people behave when they're supposed
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:46.600]   to be guarding these tens of millions of dollars that they're spending on these productions.
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:51.600]   And the kid stays in the picture, especially narrated by Robert Evans absolutely lives
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:55.640]   up to every stereotype you have of Hollywood in the 70s.
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:59.520]   This is the natural successor to another of your recommendations, which I just finished
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:04.680]   called Easy Riot Erasing, Raging Bull, exactly, in which he is painted really as a complete,
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:08.440]   you know, doped out nutball.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:13.240]   But see, and the great thing is that this is written, what Robert Evans is still fairly
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:17.160]   successful, still fairly rich, he's still a support of his friends.
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:19.960]   This isn't one of those, I need to make a mortgage payment.
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:23.880]   So what's the worst thing out of my history that I can then sort of turn into a 200 page
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:29.840]   book and use that really awful revelation to get as many bookings on Pocktails as possible.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:30.840]   This isn't one of those things.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:36.680]   This is a guy who now really can't get a movie made is still part of that culture and wants
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:38.440]   to have a big project going.
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:41.000]   So he just wrote down every cool story he could think of.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   I'd love to read this.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.800]   I mean, he's this guy who produced The Godfather Chinatown, a love story, Rosemary's
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:46.800]   Baby.
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.960]   I mean, this is the guy, you know, good friends with Jack Nicholson, another golf club guy
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.520]   who'd like to take golf clubs to cars.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:53.920]   So we have a theme.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.400]   There's a theme.
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:21:02.600]   So I mean, it's just he basically he navigates a picture of the slow rise to the top.
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:08.400]   He started off as a as a attractive young actor man, being cast as a bull fighter in
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:14.040]   a really bad movie and turned that into becoming a minor producer and then becoming the producer.
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:19.320]   And this sort of takes you into what happens when the when the studio system basically collapses
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:24.060]   and the ability of having big power producers, helping a project also collapse and start
[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:28.120]   the Hollywood started to be taken over by the corporations that own the film companies
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:30.200]   instead of the film companies themselves.
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:33.600]   So it gets a little bit bittersweet at the end, but it never turns into a and then as
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:38.820]   the cardiac needle pierce my breastbone and I felt my life force emanating out of me.
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:39.820]   No, it's nothing like that.
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:43.380]   It's just mostly being drunk and getting high and having sex with lots of different
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:47.160]   people in lots of different ways and lots of different situations and burning a lot
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:51.300]   of other people's money, including the film goers money while that happens.
[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:52.300]   And it's a trip.
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:53.300]   It's a really great ride.
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:54.300]   I can't wait to read it.
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:55.300]   Fun fun book.
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:22:00.220]   And of course, very famously, Coppola did not thank Robert Evans when he won his Oscar
[01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:05.660]   for the Godfather that he kind of blames Robert Evans for a lot of the problems with the movie.
[01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:08.420]   I would, I just love to hear Evans's side of that.
[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:10.420]   So I guess I'll have to read the book.
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:11.420]   Yes.
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:12.420]   Yes.
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:13.420]   And good recommendation.
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:14.660]   Everything in Hollywood is fascinating to listen to.
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:15.660]   I agree.
[01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:19.540]   I mean, it is drama and I've been on, I mean, I've just been on enough movie sets and working
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:20.540]   on enough movies.
[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:21.540]   You know, it's real.
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.060]   A lot of this stuff is you just, you can't make it up.
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:28.420]   It's better than the movie that, how the movies get made is oftentimes better than the actual
[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:29.420]   movie themselves.
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:32.980]   In fact, the ones that are bad, bad movies tend to be better movie.
[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:34.940]   If you made a movie about the movie, it'd be better.
[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:35.940]   Yeah.
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:36.940]   A movie about the movie.
[01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:40.620]   That's Gene Siskel's master.
[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:43.900]   First question you would ask about every movie he ever had a review.
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:48.500]   Is this movie not as entertaining as just filming lunch between all these actors on the
[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:49.500]   set?
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:50.500]   That's right.
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:51.500]   That was his thing, wasn't it?
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:52.500]   That's right.
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:59.300]   Did you read Roger Ebert's very interesting blog post this week about the story behind
[01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:05.660]   the latter days at the movies and, oh my God, what a mess.
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:06.660]   Oh, really?
[01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:07.660]   Yeah.
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:08.660]   I know you're a friend and fan of his.
[01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:10.780]   Yeah, I am both.
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:18.100]   And yeah, it was a bad scene in that this is something that Roger, I'm not speaking for
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:22.100]   Roger, I'm speaking as to someone who's read the blog post and has been a fan of the show
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:29.020]   that obviously when his health problems needed long time replacements, it caused the producers,
[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.980]   excuse me, the owners of the show to try to reinvent it.
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:36.060]   And unfortunately, they did in the worst way imaginable by saying, you know what, entertainment
[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:37.700]   tonight gets the cubic ratings?
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:42.540]   We'll take the most prestigious and respected TV movie critic show and we'll put more zaz
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:43.540]   into it.
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:44.540]   Yeah.
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:46.260]   You know, we'll have like, oh, God, it was terrible.
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:50.860]   We'll have them stand behind desks like on the view and we'll have them sort of do snappy,
[01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:52.660]   punchy little little boat.
[01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:56.580]   And we'll get one of those 20 year old reviewers with spiky hair because they're, they're
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:57.580]   not.
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:58.580]   We've been there.
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:23:59.580]   We've all been.
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:01.460]   And Harry Knowles on the on the same show.
[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:02.460]   I was like, huh?
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:06.380]   And Roger was obviously just kind of just kind of closing his eyes and just waiting to
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:07.380]   get to that.
[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:11.900]   So no, no, because if someone was sitting across the aisle from Roger Ebert, Roger selected
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:13.100]   and proved him personally.
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:16.100]   He has so much, he has so much respect for so many different opinions.
[01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:20.100]   I have an absolute also he's, he has a lot of respect for his own opinions.
[01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:21.100]   So I know that.
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:25.940]   And I guess what I was surprised at was is that Harry Knowles is actually, I love his
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:29.820]   any cool news is the, is the website and and he's got great stuff.
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:30.820]   It was just hard.
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:32.500]   Never had written a movie review in his life.
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.220]   Well, no, no, that's all he does.
[01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:35.780]   Oh, like that was all he does.
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:38.700]   But, but he, but the thing was is that it was live.
[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:44.460]   He was just a little, a little bit of a bull in a china shop, you know, you know, on the,
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:49.580]   on the show, but it was, but obviously that was also experience issue too.
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:53.620]   And, but I thought when I look back, when I looked at it, I felt like as someone who's
[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:56.540]   been on the show and had Leo look at me like, oh, he's, he going to finish.
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:57.540]   Yeah.
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:24:58.540]   Is it, is it?
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:24:59.540]   Is it done?
[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:02.180]   Yeah, I recognize that look.
[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:05.980]   I've gotten that look on air.
[01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:06.980]   I wasn't getting right now.
[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:10.420]   I was thinking somebody else that Ebert mentions that was that had never written a movie review
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:12.420]   in his life that they brought in some hipster from Hollywood.
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:15.460]   I don't know the name, but yeah, they're, they're, they're two, they brought in two.
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:17.220]   I can't, I won't get the names.
[01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:18.220]   I won't get the names right.
[01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:24.580]   I even mentioned them, one of whom was, he refers to us, he was a good sport about it.
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:30.740]   He tried his best, but I, that under, I believe that the impression I got is that from, from
[01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:35.460]   Rogers description is that he just was sort of on, he was not in a situation which he
[01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:36.460]   could succeed.
[01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:41.260]   The other one was just one of those guys who when they interview, there are three levels
[01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:45.940]   of people who interview Hollywood celebrities for, for, for, as, as reporters quote unquote,
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:49.100]   they're the ones who want to get something interesting and new and different instead
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.020]   of the same five can responses.
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:54.780]   Then they're, they're, they're, they're the ones who do want to get this, the one of the
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:58.340]   five can responses because they know that that will make the, the PR person happy and
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:00.540]   they'll get them another interview with George Clooney.
[01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:03.820]   And then they're the ones who, yeah, if they're going to get interview and they're going
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:07.020]   to get right about it for their, for the newspaper, but what they really want is that
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:09.540]   picture of them standing next to George Clooney.
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:13.140]   And they had this guy who just was such a bozo.
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:16.740]   Not only did he seem like a complete airhead on the show, but he'd go to a site and stuff
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:19.260]   and he'd say, but here's me sitting next to this celebrity.
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:21.100]   Here's me sitting next to this celebrity.
[01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:24.260]   And his expression is always, I'm standing next to this celebrity.
[01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:29.380]   And the celebrity was like, do I tip you to get my car?
[01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:36.100]   That's actually the last photo I ever took with a, with a, with a, with a, with anyone
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:40.180]   like that was when I'm Mike and I can't think of his last name, or at least singer for Jesus
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:45.860]   Jones. And there's a picture of me looking like, hey, I'm next to a, a next to the rock
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:50.500]   star, you know, and, and there's, you know, and, and it was, and I saw that photo and
[01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:52.940]   I was like, whoops, I will never take another photo like that.
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:55.940]   I just never, I just, I was done.
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:59.180]   You know, it looks like such a, it looks like such an ass.
[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.180]   Yeah.
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:01.180]   All right.
[01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:04.820]   Uh, this wasn't long ad, but there was stuff in the middle that had nothing to do with
[01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:05.820]   it.
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:06.820]   Oh, I'll throw one more thing in the middle.
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:10.260]   Roger Ebert's Twitter handle is Ebert Chicago and well worth following.
[01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:11.260]   Yeah.
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:12.260]   And absolute, check out his blog too.
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:14.500]   He is a mega prolific blogger.
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:15.500]   Love his blog.
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:16.500]   Yeah.
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:20.860]   And not only that, but the, the, the comments on his blog are usual people.
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:25.940]   He sets a tone that says we, I really, really want to hear your comments and your amplifications,
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.620]   behave everybody.
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.300]   And this will be a fun experience for everybody.
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:32.820]   And he has some of the, sometimes the responses he gets to his blog posts are just as good
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:33.980]   as the blog posts he leaves.
[01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:35.820]   And that's one hell of an endorsement.
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:36.820]   Yep.
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:37.820]   Yep.
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:38.820]   I'm with you on that.
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:39.820]   Roger Ebert.com.
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:44.140]   So, uh, audible.com/macbreak just to wrap it up.
[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:46.820]   So how many people did we put into this ad?
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:47.820]   Let's see.
[01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:48.820]   Roger Ebert.
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:49.820]   We said we, okay.
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:51.500]   We were, we were talking about the movies.
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.700]   I mean, I think that that's, you know, audible is always like a, as an opportunity for
[01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:55.700]   a rat hole.
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:56.700]   It is.
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:58.580]   It's, it's, it's an ad about life.
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:27:59.580]   Yes.
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:01.420]   And everything in it.
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:05.020]   Sometimes it takes about as long as an entire life.
[01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:10.340]   Audible.com/macbreak and we do invite you to sign up for your, uh, their gold account
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:11.340]   one book a month.
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:14.940]   You get the first one free and this, I think a good choice would be the, the kid stays
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:17.220]   in the picture with Robert Evans, but we have lots of picks.
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:23.020]   If you listen to back to a previous episodes, lots of great picks.
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:28.540]   Now it is time speaking of picks for your pick, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:31.620]   So, so I, I took it easy on everyone for a while.
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:32.620]   I've been putting out free.
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:33.620]   Yeah.
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:34.940]   You haven't had an expensive one in a long time.
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:36.620]   And I'm going to return the favor now.
[01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:39.420]   I know it's, I mean, I've been building up how many Alex sees.
[01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:41.060]   Oh, this is a couple of Alex's.
[01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:42.060]   Oh, maybe.
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:44.260]   Will I want to buy it or should I, uh, yet?
[01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:45.940]   Well, Colleen would want to buy it.
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:46.940]   Okay.
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:47.940]   Good.
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:50.740]   So, uh, so what I'm going to recommend it's by a J.A.
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:53.740]   You know, it's going to be, we have some, is that a J or Asia?
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:54.740]   How do they?
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:55.740]   It's a J.A.
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:56.740]   A.J.
[01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:57.740]   We have some a J.A.
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:58.740]   stuff in our pronunciation and dictionary.
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:28:59.740]   It's not a Asia.
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:00.740]   Although I like to say Asia because I hate saying a J.A.
[01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:01.740]   A J is.
[01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:03.980]   I'm trying to be like some guy named Alfred George Alfred.
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:06.420]   You know, it was, it's initials from somebody.
[01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:10.580]   You know, and so the, uh, anyway, so it's called the key pro.
[01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:11.580]   Okay.
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:16.500]   And there is a reason that it, that it is, um, that I'm talking about it on a Mac show.
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:17.940]   Uh, because it's a video component.
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:19.420]   It's $4,000.
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:20.420]   So it's not.
[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:21.420]   Yeah, it's not.
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:24.180]   This isn't like a cheap little, um, device, but it is a great little.
[01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:25.820]   And it's something none of you need.
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:30.780]   Uh, no, there's a lot of people who, who do video production on this, on this, uh,
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:31.860]   yeah, that listen to us.
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:32.860]   Yeah.
[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:33.860]   So Colleen's listening.
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:34.860]   Sure.
[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:39.260]   If you are, um, if here's the, this is, this is the Kona related.
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.260]   It's not a cone.
[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:41.260]   They do the Kona cards.
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:42.260]   They do the Kona cards.
[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:44.840]   Um, they have this thing that came out in NAB and we saw it and we covered it in Mac
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:45.840]   break.
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.380]   Um, and we were just excited about having it.
[01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:49.420]   And finally they sent us a test unit.
[01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:50.580]   So we've had it for the last couple of weeks.
[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:51.580]   I don't think I'm going to send it back.
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:53.580]   I think I'm going to have sent them a check instead of the unit.
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.580]   That's always a good sign.
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:55.580]   Yeah.
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:58.500]   So, so it's, uh, you know, we took it out, we took it out on a couple shoots and, um,
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:29:59.580]   so here's what it does.
[01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:03.860]   It's a recorder, like a tape recorder that you'd have on there, except it records to
[01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:04.860]   drive.
[01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:06.820]   So it has a little drive, but it acts like a cassette.
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:10.180]   So the drive pops out like a cassette and it just becomes a firewire 800 drive.
[01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:11.180]   Oh, the key is K-I.
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:12.180]   K-I, not K-E-1.
[01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:13.180]   Yeah.
[01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:17.100]   But if you go to aja.com and click on the acquire button or whatever, it'll be there.
[01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:22.980]   So here's what it does is it records Apple ProRes 422 HQ straight to the, straight to
[01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:25.140]   a drive, which you can pop out like a cassette.
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:28.540]   So that little piece that you see on the top of there, um, that's a drive.
[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:33.540]   It also will take, um, the, uh, the express card is two express card slots.
[01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:40.580]   Um, the, you can pop that drive out and it just becomes an 800, uh, 800, uh, a bus powered,
[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:44.100]   a firewire 800 drive that you can plug into your computer and transfer the files off.
[01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:47.260]   You can have a couple of those and swap them out if you're doing a long recording.
[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:51.580]   Um, it, otherwise it runs kind of like a solid state, you know, it's, it's a cassette deck.
[01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:55.980]   And so the thing about this is, is that, is that, you know, we, we used to, the problem
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:31:02.420]   with like X to E X cams, uh, uh, or, and a lot of other things is you got to get really
[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:03.620]   low quality from the camera.
[01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:04.500]   The camera is cute.
[01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:09.260]   Um, but, but you know, when you're, when you're recording at really low bandwidth, um,
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:14.060]   uh, it's not as, uh, uh, you, you, especially when you're keen or you really want to do
[01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:17.980]   any kind of color correction, you want, you want the, the Apple ProRes, which is just the
[01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:20.700]   best format out there to do production in, in my opinion.
[01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:25.620]   And so, um, you want that Apple, that, that, uh, Apple ProRes, uh, and we like, we, we
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:30.580]   hope to see a key pro someday of four, four, four, four, four, four, four, but, um, uh,
[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:34.660]   but we, uh, um, but right now it's the four two two.
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:39.660]   So you have Apple ProRes, uh, uh, hq four two two, it's, it records natively to that.
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.020]   So this is really a Mac product.
[01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:43.380]   This is something you're going to use and necessarily use on your PC.
[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:49.900]   Um, and it's just a, you know, we used to take a computer to the two remote remote recordings
[01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:53.420]   so that we would get the high quality pieces and we, we just went to do a shoot.
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:54.420]   We took that.
[01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:55.420]   We hooked it to the camera.
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:56.420]   It worked phenomenal.
[01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:58.900]   So could I use a cheesy HDMI camera?
[01:31:58.900 --> 01:31:59.900]   What could I get?
[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:00.900]   It does HDMI input.
[01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:01.900]   It does SDI input.
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:05.700]   So this would be a way to use those you've been talking before about those, how these
[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:07.340]   HDMI out cameras.
[01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:08.340]   Yeah.
[01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:09.340]   For four, what is it?
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:10.340]   Four two two.
[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:11.340]   Four two two.
[01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:12.340]   Straight out of the HDMI port.
[01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:13.340]   You could do it straight into this camera.
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:14.340]   You could put it right into this recorder.
[01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:15.340]   We have it right into this recorder.
[01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:19.620]   What we have done is we've recorded it from a 70 of Canon 70 straight into this.
[01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:20.820]   Oh, you're kidding.
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:21.820]   Yeah.
[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:24.220]   And so why would I want to do that instead of recording to the flash?
[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:26.220]   Well, because it's going to be much higher quality.
[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:27.220]   You're going to, because the better it's better.
[01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:28.220]   It's better quality.
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:32.620]   What's coming out of these little cameras like the little HP 20, HP 30, HP 40 is uncompressed.
[01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:38.980]   So it's 122, about 120 to 128 megabytes a second.
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:40.420]   That's what's coming out of the back of that camera.
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:43.900]   And it hasn't been ruined by the compression that gets it down to three and a half megs
[01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:46.060]   a second by the time it hits the tape.
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:49.220]   So, so what this does is it keeps it.
[01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:53.100]   And I think that the, I believe Apple Pro was HQ is about 30 megs a second.
[01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:55.820]   So it's still, it's a much higher bandwidth.
[01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:58.660]   We've keyed it other than it being 422.
[01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:02.740]   We record a lot of stuff at 444.
[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:06.540]   But other than mean 422, it is very, very keyable.
[01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:09.340]   Apple ProRes really actually works fairly well in that area.
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:16.540]   And the 4.4, what they call APR 4 by 4, which is Apple ProRes 4444 keys really well as a,
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:18.820]   as a point, we just did a home movie in that.
[01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:26.500]   And so the, so that is, it does the, it does a very, very useful piece there.
[01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:27.660]   And what are you, what are you playing with?
[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:28.660]   I'm playing with my pick.
[01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:29.660]   You're playing with your pick.
[01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:30.660]   Yeah.
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:31.660]   So anyway, it's just a good argument please.
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:33.780]   I know we're going along, if you're not doing production, this isn't really.
[01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:36.780]   But if you're looking at a great way to do this, where you're going to get much higher
[01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:40.060]   quality video than what you're getting out of your camera.
[01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:43.820]   And, and you can be recording long, one of the other things we get into is we record
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:47.100]   a long event and we're sitting there trying to figure out how to get all the memory into
[01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:48.100]   that camera.
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:51.580]   And so we record straight to a hard drive at a very high quality.
[01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:54.740]   It's a, it is the best product in the market for what it does.
[01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:55.740]   Wow.
[01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:56.740]   So anyway, that's calling.
[01:33:56.740 --> 01:33:59.700]   Do you want, do you want one of these calling?
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:00.700]   She's not talking.
[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:01.900]   She's not talking.
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:02.900]   I think she does.
[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:03.900]   She wants one.
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:05.420]   She knows that she wants one.
[01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:06.420]   I want one.
[01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:08.420]   Yeah, it's, it's great.
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:09.420]   Great, great.
[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:14.420]   And I, and I, I was hesitant to, we, as I said, we covered it at NAB for Mac break.
[01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:17.100]   And I was hesitant to say anything about it until we really got our hands on it.
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:18.980]   And we finally, it's, it was back ordered for a while.
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:21.580]   And it was just really hard to get a hold of everyone knows that it's a good product.
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:24.900]   And we finally got a test unit in and as I said, I'm, I think I'm going to send those
[01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:25.900]   tests.
[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:28.300]   So basically you don't have to digitize because it's on the, it's on a hard drive.
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:30.260]   You, you just pull it off.
[01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:31.460]   Express, press, press, press, press.
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:32.460]   Right.
[01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:33.700]   And you just, you literally pull it out.
[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:34.700]   You're ready to go.
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:35.860]   You import it straight into final cut boom.
[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:36.860]   It's already an Apple ProRes.
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:37.860]   You're not rendering.
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:38.860]   You're not.
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:39.860]   Yeah.
[01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:40.860]   Yeah.
[01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:41.860]   It's good stuff.
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:45.420]   Colleen, can you see video from this, the, the, this call that I'm making to you?
[01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:47.900]   Supposedly you can.
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:49.300]   She can.
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:50.300]   So this is my pick.
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:51.300]   Oh, okay.
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:52.300]   By the way, this was free.
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:53.820]   You know about fring, right?
[01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:54.820]   Fring.
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:55.820]   Fring.
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:35:06.220]   Fring is a iPhone app that allows you to use Skype, use Twitter, use, you know, it's
[01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:14.340]   a ton of different Yahoo, Google talk, all of the, all of the, you know, VoIP solutions.
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:15.740]   But here's what's new in fring.
[01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:23.260]   It does video one way video, but I am now on Skype with Colleen and she's seeing video
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:24.260]   from my phone.
[01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:27.140]   And the reason it does one way video is because the iPhone stupidly has the camera on the
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:28.300]   wrong side.
[01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:31.140]   So if she were sending me video, I'd be, I wouldn't be looking at it.
[01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:33.780]   I, I wouldn't, you know, unless I was saying to you, you know, this, you need to do a
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:35.540]   hardware thing that periscopes around.
[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:36.540]   That's what you need.
[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:37.540]   You need to do a little periscope.
[01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:38.980]   I mean, with a mirror is in it.
[01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:43.740]   But you know what we might be using this for, wouldn't this be cool is remotes.
[01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:44.740]   It's free.
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:45.740]   Yeah.
[01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:50.020]   Well, that's why I only.
[01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:53.980]   So what does a, what does a video look like Colleen?
[01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:56.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:58.420]   No, I'm, I'm speaking to you.
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:00.740]   She says, she's watching the, I'll call her back.
[01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:01.740]   She's watching the video.
[01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:02.740]   She says the video is fine.
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:03.740]   She's watching the TV.
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:07.460]   Let me call you on the, on the, on the fring via Skype.
[01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:09.500]   Actually, this is calling.
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:11.580]   I think this is calling her a Google talk.
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:19.220]   Anyway, so if you have, if you have an account with one of the many different, yeah, you'd
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:23.980]   be seeing, you'd be seeing Alex, not me because I'm, I could see if I do this, then I can't
[01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:24.980]   see.
[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:30.820]   It's one way because the iPhone is poorly designed for this kind of thing because I think Apple
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:33.460]   never thought they would be doing this.
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:38.180]   Fring is a good way to get a variety of white providers on one application on your phone.
[01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:40.300]   So you don't have to have Skype and all the others.
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:42.020]   It's kind of a gateway to all of these.
[01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:45.100]   It's been around for a long time.
[01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:46.100]   FRING.
[01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:49.620]   I, you know, I haven't been able to see a call.
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:53.820]   So I don't know how well it works, but I have used Fring on the past on other phones.
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:37:00.660]   And it's a very clever way of getting MSN messenger and Google talk and Yahoo and, and Skype onto
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:02.620]   your iPhone all at once.
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:07.140]   And I would love if somebody would call me and then we can see what their video looks
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:08.140]   like.
[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:09.980]   That, that's the solution.
[01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:12.380]   I mean, why don't you call, call the chief twit.
[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:15.340]   Oh, but you have to have no shoot.
[01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:16.580]   You have to have.
[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:19.580]   Oh, I could call that.
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:21.740]   What was I thinking?
[01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:22.740]   That's a great idea.
[01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:24.940]   She's a lot smarter than I am.
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:26.740]   She's a lot smarter than all of us.
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:32.420]   So I, I would call Twit Live line four with a video call.
[01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:33.420]   All right.
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:34.980]   Line one, two, three.
[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:36.980]   This is so complicated.
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:37.980]   Four.
[01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:40.580]   Yes, yes, I know.
[01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:41.580]   There it is.
[01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:43.340]   Answer with video.
[01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:45.540]   No, because I can't see video.
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:46.540]   Okay.
[01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:47.540]   Oh, here it comes.
[01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:48.540]   All right.
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:49.540]   So let's see.
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:50.540]   This is the video.
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:51.940]   Go to full screen.
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:52.940]   It's thinking about it.
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:53.940]   It's thinking about it.
[01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:57.260]   It says Leo LePort can't see you yet because Leo's got an iPhone.
[01:37:57.260 --> 01:37:58.260]   Yeah.
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:37:59.420]   Now I can hear myself back.
[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:00.420]   That's not good.
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:01.420]   Let's turn that down.
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:03.820]   Who says the starting video?
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:04.820]   We'll see.
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:06.460]   We'll see.
[01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:07.460]   It's thinking about it.
[01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:10.620]   It's thinking it's going through the Skype bowels.
[01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:12.740]   Yeah, that's what's going on.
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:14.740]   What's this?
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:17.540]   Anyway, what a great pick.
[01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:18.540]   What now?
[01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:19.540]   What do you think?
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:23.100]   You know, if this works before I try that was great.
[01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:25.460]   Now I think why did I just download that?
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:26.460]   Yeah.
[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:28.100]   One of these days is going to work.
[01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:30.260]   I always just sit here waiting for whatever.
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:31.620]   Why don't you do a pick?
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:35.540]   And anyway, worth taking a look at FRING.
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:36.540]   It's free in the app store.
[01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:40.780]   Now ladies and gentlemen, a better pick from Andy in ICON.
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:44.260]   Well, this is an iPhone case.
[01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:47.140]   It was made from the finger bones of two dead apostles.
[01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:48.500]   Now it's a little bit pricey.
[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:49.500]   Whoa.
[01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:53.500]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:59.460]   Recently IFixit.com added new Fixit guides to their massive library, which reminded me
[01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:05.180]   that I really should use IFixit as a pick.
[01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:06.180]   They do sell parts.
[01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:07.660]   They do sell repairs.
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:14.140]   They do sell, you know, if you take a, if you were to do to a design and manufacturing
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:19.740]   defect, your power, your Macbook stops working spontaneously after you happen to drop it
[01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:21.180]   onto a tile floor.
[01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:24.660]   And those idiots to the genius bar insist that it's not covered by warranty because of
[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:28.660]   the design defect that did not allow it to survive that.
[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:34.900]   IFixit has repairs available that will, instead of having, requiring you to purchase
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:38.860]   an entire part assembly, they might be able to sell you just the one part that's failed,
[01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:43.740]   that you can then swap out and repair yourself or you can send it in and they'll fix it for
[01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:44.740]   you.
[01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:48.260]   But even if you never send them any money, they have such a, they've done, they've done
[01:39:48.260 --> 01:39:51.420]   such a solid for all Mac users everywhere.
[01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:57.860]   They have produced extremely well illustrated, extremely well written repair guides for just
[01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:02.820]   about every model of Mac that you can think of and just about every different type of
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:04.860]   repair that you want to do.
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:09.700]   And the way that these unibody Macbooks are designed, even swapping out a hardware, even
[01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:13.500]   swapping out like a very simple part that used to be a very, very simple way to, it used
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:17.060]   to be very, very simple to get access to a logic board or get access to a certain part.
[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:18.460]   Now it's a little bit more complicated.
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:22.860]   Even the simple stuff, my, the first step of any hardware repair that I perform is heading
[01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:27.020]   over to IFixit.com, seeing if they have a guide available, then downloading it and printing
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:29.220]   it so I haven't handy.
[01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:33.860]   They truly do walk you through every single part of the procedure step by step by step
[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:36.660]   until you feel as though you've done the repair yourself.
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:40.580]   It fills you with a very genuine sense of confidence that you can replace this screen
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:47.140]   or replace this trackpad or do any other simple or complex repair with a very high degree
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:48.780]   of success.
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:54.500]   And the production values on these, on these guides are, this is truly commercial quality
[01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:55.500]   stuff.
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:59.860]   It's not, hey, we just, I got up my iPhone and put this on a picnic table and sort of
[01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:05.460]   remember to occasionally take pictures of this is good studio lighting, clear writing, effective
[01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:06.460]   communication.
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:07.660]   What's the URL again?
[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:09.660]   IFixit.com, IFixit.com.
[01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:12.100]   Here's the key, here's the key.
[01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:14.940]   I was just making sure you really follow the directions.
[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:19.380]   It is, you know, they're giving you complex, complex pieces.
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:22.580]   I actually followed theirs to change the hard drive in my laptop.
[01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:23.580]   Yeah.
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:24.580]   And their instructions were correct.
[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:27.100]   My implementation of their instructions were incorrect.
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:31.120]   And, and there was a, there was a review that it said, you know, you will hear a little
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:32.120]   popping.
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:33.120]   That's just the rubber coming apart.
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.980]   In my, in my case, the popping was louder than I expected.
[01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:40.740]   And it turned out to be, yeah, it was the, the spot welds.
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:43.140]   And last thing you really want to hear is a rubber coming apart anyway.
[01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:44.140]   But it is a great sight.
[01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:45.140]   The IFixit.
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:46.140]   Look, I fix it.
[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:47.780]   Look, look, look.
[01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:48.780]   So I, I was wrong.
[01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:50.380]   It's one way video the other way.
[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:56.940]   So it doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't, unless I'm completely misunderstanding this,
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:42:02.460]   it is now getting video, but it's video, it's, it's, it's very confusing.
[01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:10.100]   This is video coming from the guy I'm calling as opposed to video from me, but I thought
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:11.100]   it was video from me.
[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:12.100]   So I'm very confused.
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:14.740]   Well, if it isn't, somebody should do that.
[01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:16.620]   There should be an app for that.
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:22.660]   But it's pretty, it's, unless I must be really a, a moron because it, it, it, I don't understand.
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:26.260]   Look, see, it's, there's no video coming through here, but I thought the whole idea was you
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:35.860]   can make video calls from your iPhone or your, or Android or your Nokia phone.
[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:40.300]   But apparently you can receive video calls.
[01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:45.700]   So you can call somebody and you can see them, which you couldn't see that, you couldn't
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:46.700]   do that before.
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:50.020]   So that's something, not exactly what I thought it was.
[01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:52.100]   See now, it's pretty live by the way.
[01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:54.940]   Watch when I, when I, watch, when I switch, it's almost instant.
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:56.780]   See, I'm switching boom.
[01:42:56.780 --> 01:42:58.500]   So that's pretty good.
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:42:59.500]   Okay.
[01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:00.500]   Okay.
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:01.500]   It's free.
[01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:02.500]   It's free.
[01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:03.500]   It's useless.
[01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:04.500]   What are you complaining about?
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:05.500]   It's free.
[01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:06.500]   Okay.
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:07.500]   Here's the, here's the demo.
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:08.500]   We had a look at thing.
[01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:09.500]   We didn't have no check.
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:10.500]   Look, here's the demo.
[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:11.500]   See, he's got something going on here.
[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:12.500]   I'm confused.
[01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:13.500]   It's doing the exact opposite.
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:14.500]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:15.500]   Who's he?
[01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:16.500]   Nice.
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:23.500]   He's, I don't understand.
[01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:32.420]   Is it me or is it?
[01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:33.420]   Okay.
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:34.420]   He's, okay.
[01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:37.420]   So it is what, it's doing it right.
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:38.420]   Yeah.
[01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:41.860]   So it's less, a little less interesting because I thought it was going to be video from you
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:44.260]   because that's why they said the cameras on the other side.
[01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:48.260]   What they're saying is that we're not doing it because the camera's on the other side.
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:49.260]   Right.
[01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:51.180]   Because then you'd have to do that and nobody wants to look at that.
[01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:54.180]   But you can, I can at least call somebody and see them, but that's pretty good.
[01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:55.180]   Yeah.
[01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:56.180]   There's no good to us.
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:57.180]   I can stand demo.
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:58.180]   Yeah.
[01:43:58.180 --> 01:43:59.180]   Sorry.
[01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:00.180]   Oh, well.
[01:44:00.180 --> 01:44:01.180]   Oh, sorry.
[01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:03.820]   So it seems cooler than one of the people asked.
[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:05.540]   So, but you're saying that it only receives video.
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:06.540]   It doesn't actually send it.
[01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:07.540]   I'm out.
[01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:09.140]   That's exactly what it does.
[01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:10.140]   But it's free.
[01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:11.140]   It's free.
[01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:12.980]   Did I mention that it was free?
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:13.980]   It's free.
[01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:18.700]   I'll bring a better pick next week.
[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:19.700]   Sorry.
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:20.700]   I'm sorry.
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:21.700]   I fix it.
[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:22.700]   We didn't mean to harsh.
[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:23.700]   I fix it.
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:24.700]   Dot com.
[01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:25.700]   I fix it.
[01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:26.700]   Go there.
[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:27.700]   See, that's good misdirection.
[01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:28.700]   I fix it.
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:32.940]   Again, I think it's more of the lesser apostles like Joshua.
[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:37.740]   It had more of a more of a aromatheon quality about it.
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:39.500]   This fella and she's using the stuff right.
[01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:40.500]   But still it's the bone.
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:42.980]   It's an apostle and there are only 12 of them.
[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:44.900]   And that's making more apostles.
[01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:49.140]   So I mean, if you want a finger bone of an apostle, but I pop you guys, really, this
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:55.740]   is the only, you know, the chat room says, and I think I agree, the picks this week suck.
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:56.740]   I like my pick.
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:57.740]   All right.
[01:44:57.740 --> 01:44:58.740]   I get those more expensive.
[01:44:58.740 --> 01:45:02.580]   It's not free guys to fix all of your computers for free.
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:03.580]   Okay.
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:04.580]   It was free.
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:05.580]   Oh, that sucks.
[01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:06.580]   Oh, isn't this horrible?
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:07.980]   Isn't my life terrible?
[01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:09.980]   Oh, random view.
[01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:11.980]   I'm not hurt.
[01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:12.980]   I'm not hurt.
[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:13.980]   I'm not hurt.
[01:45:13.980 --> 01:45:14.980]   I'm a professional.
[01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:15.980]   You're hurt.
[01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:16.980]   I'm not hurt.
[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:17.980]   I think you're hurting right now.
[01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:18.980]   It's okay.
[01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:19.980]   Let it out.
[01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:21.980]   I don't know if I want to do any more things.
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:23.980]   You big stupid boy.
[01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:24.980]   You big stupid boy.
[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:26.500]   And we do for your kids.
[01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:29.980]   And this is the thanks we get.
[01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:30.980]   This is why we can't have a life.
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:31.980]   Be in a big circuit.
[01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:32.980]   That's the problem.
[01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:34.980]   And it's watching.
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:36.860]   Santa is watching.
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:40.980]   And because before the show began, I gave out my cell phone number.
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:45.460]   And I received 400 texts to the same effect.
[01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:49.220]   I guess somebody wants a pair of sensible brown slacks for Christmas.
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:51.060]   You're not getting the Wii.
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:52.300]   You're not getting the new controller.
[01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:55.620]   You're not getting the new, the last edition of the Lego Millennium Falcon.
[01:45:55.620 --> 01:46:00.580]   You're just getting sensible brown slacks you could wear for school or church.
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:03.140]   Hey, I guess that's what you want.
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:04.140]   Fine.
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:09.100]   My friends, thank you so much for putting up with us for the last five hours of your
[01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:10.100]   life.
[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:12.340]   Because you'll never get back.
[01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:14.700]   We'll edit it down.
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:15.700]   We'll make it a little shorter.
[01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:17.460]   No, no, you will sit there.
[01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:21.300]   You will listen to all five hours and we will not let you listen to another one until you
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:25.140]   pass a simple online quiz demonstrating that you've listened to.
[01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:28.020]   You'll get people to push you around.
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:29.020]   Push you around.
[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:30.660]   They tell you they do.
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:35.460]   Maybe and if you're really nice, maybe we'll do an iTunes LP version of the show.
[01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:36.460]   Not.
[01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:37.700]   All right.
[01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:39.540]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:46:39.540 --> 01:46:40.540]   Thank you, Alex Lindsey.
[01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:45.140]   He is at the Pixel Core, Pixel Core.tv for the podcast, Pixel Core.com for that great
[01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:51.700]   guild of multimedia artists and must visit for anybody who wants to be involved.
[01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:52.980]   Lots of cool stuff for January.
[01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:53.980]   Stay tuned.
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:55.980]   We're doing our test, but January should be very good.
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:58.340]   Stay tuned for the cool stuff.
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:02.860]   And of course, Andy Anaka, who is a columnist, tech reporter for the Chicago Sun Times and
[01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:09.020]   his own website is www.cwob.com, the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[01:47:09.020 --> 01:47:12.540]   Sir, I thank you for being here.
[01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:14.740]   All of you, I apologize for what happened.
[01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:16.540]   And we'll see you next time now.
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:17.540]   Get back to work.
[01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:18.700]   Break time's over.
[01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:28.700]   [MUSIC]
