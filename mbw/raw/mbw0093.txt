[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.200]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 93, the morning after the day before,
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.200]   or the day after the night before the morning of,
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.200]   or whatever it is, with me, the folks who are still suffering
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.200]   from the morning after the night before.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200]   Starting with Mr. Scott Born.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.200]   Hello, Scott.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.200]   Hey, howdy, howdy there.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.200]   I bet you did a bunch of Apple Phone Show stuff.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200]   We did Apple Phone Show stuff.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200]   Andy Naka was kind enough to pipe in after being on with you.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.200]   We did a round table on our opinions about it.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.200]   And we honed from girls gone geeked at stuff.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.200]   And we were just sad that we couldn't get anything to show on our new show
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.200]   Unboxed Sessions because there was nothing to unbox.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.200]   You will?
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.200]   July 11th.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.200]   You'll have something to unbox.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   I got snookered Leo.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.200]   Yeah, you know.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   Well, we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.200]   Let me introduce the rest of the panel.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   Also here, Andy Naka from the Chicago Sun Times and the class.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.200]   I'm sorry, Celestia waste of bandwidth.com.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   C-W-O-P.com.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   Hello.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200]   Andy was with us on Monday.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.200]   We did our live coverage with John Moltz and Andy of the Apple keynote.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.200]   The Steve note, as they say.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   Alex Lindsey is also here from Pixel Core, Pixel Core.TV at Pixel Core.com.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.200]   Hi, Alex.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.200]   Maguannani.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   Maguannani Mahamaho.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.200]   Hi, Nani.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.200]   Hi, Nani Hainahoho.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   Let's get a Marine Cadincadinc.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   What is Mahamani?
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   Maguannani.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   It's a good morning in Shona.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   Mahamani is a guy I know in Brooklyn.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   Mahamani!
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   Maguannani.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   If Merlin, man, we're only here.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   Merlin is not here.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.200]   He is walking the baby.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   We've been doing this show at 11 in the morning, Pacific time for weeks now, but Merlin forgot.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.200]   So, I don't know why.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   But we'll get him in next week.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   I think Merlin is getting shy now that his show, You Look Nice Today, is in the top 25 on iTunes.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   I think he's too big for us.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.200]   Did you see that in the top 25 on iTunes?
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   One big.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   One big?
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   It deserves to.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   It's a very funny show.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   So, even though he's not here, I'm going to give him the plug.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   You look nice today.com.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   So, I'm not much news to talk about this week.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   What the heck happened?
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200]   What?
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   Anything?
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.360]   The 3G iPhone, you know, it's great because we are, as with most Steve announcements, there's
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.200]   the initial blush as you're in the reality distortion feel.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   Everybody's all excited and flushed.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.960]   Oh, and then, reality comes back.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.240]   It slowly seeps back in.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.840]   And now we're starting to have some, yeah, but moments.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.600]   So let me go through what we learned for those who missed the keynote.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.960]   What we learned on Monday, Steve Jobs speaking to the World Wide Developers Conference.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.920]   First of all, 6 million iPhones already sold.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.920]   So they're well on their way to the 10 million goal.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.200]   So it's, I think it's an unqualified success.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.880]   But one of the things that's been keeping it out of international markets is the lack
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.880]   of 3G.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.680]   So yes, indeed.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.160]   Steve Jobs did what AT&T said he would do and announced a 3G iPhone.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.760]   Some of the things the iPhone includes, yes, it includes GPS with tracking, which is kind
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.800]   of neat.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.480]   It is a much better battery life, it sounds like Steve was claiming, I think, 10 hours
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.320]   talk time, seven hours if you watch movies, 24 hours for music only.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.680]   He didn't mention what it would be after you turned on the GPS.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.680]   We'll see.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.680]   Five hours.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.680]   Oh, yes.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.680]   That now the figure that we're getting.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.960]   Well, that's what I'm hearing.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.440]   Five hours for either GPS or 3G.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.600]   Now, if you turn on your 3G, Wi-Fi and GPS and Bluetooth, you get about five minutes,
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   10 minutes.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.360]   Yeah, you get time to make a call to 911.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.880]   But that's like any phone.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.680]   They've done something to definitely improve the battery life.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.440]   Yeah, but notice that like, you know, he had this triumphant slide up with that big
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.560]   masterful table about, oh, you can talk for 81 hours, you can listen to every single watch
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.040]   up as every episode of money Python back to back to back between a charge, all this
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.120]   like stuff, every single feature, then he made that slide disappear.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.760]   Then he introduced GPS.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.080]   And mentioned GPS.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.920]   They will be the, this, the phone will be out June July 11th.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.920]   You will have to act.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.440]   Oh, I'll get to the negatives in a second.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.000]   I'll start with only the positives.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.120]   Applications, yes, including monkey ball, super monkey ball for 10 bucks.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.600]   A Pangea will have a couple of games, Chrome, Magnan, Rally and Enigma, which was one of
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.200]   my picks on Mac break, a few weeks ago, $10.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.720]   There will be many free apps, including eBay apps, news apps.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.800]   The iPhone store will roll out with iPhone 2.0.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.680]   It'll be free upgrade to the iPhone store for iPhone users, $10 upgrade for iPod touch
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.680]   owners.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.760]   And of course, free if you buy a new iPhone.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.520]   What other positives can we talk about before we get to what's missing?
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.880]   Did we mention free hardware upgrades for people who bought their phones recently?
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.080]   If you bought after May, May 27th is at the date, I think that was the cutoff.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.960]   You'll get, you bought an iPhone after May 27th.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.120]   By the way, I think it would be hard to do because they were out of stock for most people.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.760]   Oddly enough, there weren't that many available.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.160]   But you would get a free upgrade, which is I think the only fair thing to do.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.320]   It's clear that AT&T is now subsidizing the phone because this is one of my say, the big
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:27.520]   story, $199 for 8 gigs, and believably low price for the same phone that was $600 just
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.920]   a year ago this time.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.920]   Don't remind me.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.560]   Yeah, because we all bought it.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.880]   $99 for the 16 gig, which I think most people will probably opt for, $100 for another 8 gigs,
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.880]   that's probably worth it.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.360]   You know, the only thing should do, instead of that $100 credit, what they should have
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.720]   given, like everyone who bought the phone at the original $599 price gets like a one-of-a-kind,
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.880]   limited edition gold skin.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.520]   So everybody knows that, no, I paid $599.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.960]   Didn't really feel it because that's kind of that's kind of league that I fly in.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.920]   Now, some of you had to wait for the price to drop, but not me.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.920]   Nope, not me.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.920]   I didn't use my Apple Store credit, so I still have my $100 credit from when they dropped
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.920]   the price the first time.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.000]   So this phone's only going to cost me $199 with the 16 gigs.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.040]   Yeah, I think we have to point out that the increase in the data price will actually make
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:23.120]   this phone, if you work everything at the basic level, $40 more expensive than the currently
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.560]   shipping phone.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.000]   And what you're getting for $40, which is like, I don't know, I haven't done the math
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.760]   at all, or 80 a month.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.440]   You're getting 3G, you're getting GPS, you're getting exchange.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.720]   So I mean, I think it's a fair trade off, although it's a little, you know, inarticulate,
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.520]   let's say, to say that this phone's actually long-term cheaper, but the buy-in being cheaper
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.880]   will be big for people because it's easier to pony up $199 at one time than $399 for
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.880]   some.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.440]   Well, let's get to the negatives.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.240]   You started us on the negatives.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.120]   Well, I don't know that that's a negative.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.120]   Attention negatives.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.120]   You will have to.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.120]   The big, big part of the story is you will have to activate it when you buy it, which
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.880]   really has the store at the store, whether it's 18 tier Apple, that pretty much eliminates
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.120]   unlocked phones, I think.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.800]   They'd also eliminate people complaining because it wouldn't work when they tried to
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.160]   do it through iTunes.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.160]   Right.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.160]   You will, you will not be able to use the Go plan, the Go phone plan, that's the pay
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.480]   as you go play from AT&T.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.800]   You will have to sign up for a contract for two years.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.640]   Now if you already have an existing contract, I think it's two years pro-rated, so it's
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.640]   like another one year.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.840]   So I have a two-year contract.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.880]   Doesn't that have two years to my contract?
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.560]   We don't know this for sure.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.600]   We haven't heard that definitively from AT&T.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   Okay.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.040]   Ours Technica had a very good article.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.840]   I guess they talked to AT&T about what its deal was and found out a few very interesting
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.840]   things.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.920]   AT&T certainly is subsidizing the phone.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.800]   That's why it's so cheap.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:57.040]   That's why you have to activate it because and Apple is no longer paying or receiving
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.520]   the monthly payments, the cut of the monthly fee.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.840]   Do you think underlines how much Apple wants to make sure that it owns this market?
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.480]   Yeah, you're giving up a lot, aren't they?
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.280]   In fact, we had speculated that they might leave AT&T behind.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.440]   In fact, it's quite the opposite.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.280]   AT&T got the sweet part of this deal.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.880]   I'm wondering if all the unlocked phones didn't cause AT&T's lawyers to call Apple's lawyers
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:25.200]   and say, "deals off, dudes," because you weren't protecting our rights as you had promised.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.200]   Right.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.200]   I think that's...
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:33.000]   But the one thing is, the conspiracy theorists of which there are millions assume that you
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.760]   have to go to the Apple Store or the AT&T store to activate, to avoid unlocking.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.560]   I don't know if that's true because why would Apple care at that point?
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.480]   They're not getting any more revenue.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.880]   They sell the phone, they get the same price they get if you go through AT&T or not.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.040]   I don't know that that's the reason.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.440]   I think it could just be that part of the original deal was AT&T was going to bear the
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.000]   brunt of that activation.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.080]   They set up the system, not an Apple that everybody connected to through iTunes.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.640]   Maybe AT&T also said, "Yeah, we're not going to do that again because it costs us too much
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.640]   money.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.440]   You're going to have to do it in the store like we always do."
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.440]   Clearly, this is...
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.080]   In general, this is a deal for AT&T all around.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.760]   I think that they get the privilege of subsidizing the phone, but they guarantee a lock in two
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.760]   years.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.760]   Now, it also made it possible for worldwide sales because you couldn't sell a phone that
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.960]   wasn't 3G in any other market.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.280]   And Jobs said that they'd be in 70 countries by the end of the year.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.240]   This will roll out July 11th and 22 countries.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.560]   They have deals with every country, every major country seems except China, where the
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.360]   most unlocked iPhones are.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.360]   Right.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.360]   It's a...
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.200]   As well as the most unlocked copies of Microsoft Windows.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.200]   You still can get unlocked.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.120]   I mean, they have pay-as-you-go plans in other countries.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.520]   I think France requires some unlocked phones.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.280]   Australia, I think, will have unlocked phones.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.280]   New Zealand will.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.280]   So there will be sources of unlocked phones.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.520]   It just won't be the US.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.120]   And there'll be 800 bucks on subsidized.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.120]   Right.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.000]   So you pay for the privilege.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.160]   Now, what do you think that...
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:08.480]   You think that as eBay has certainly been flooded by people giving up their 1.0 phones,
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.760]   trying to get ready for 2.0, you think that that's going to be...
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.800]   You can go to a flea market now and for 50 bucks buy an unlocked 1.0 iPhone.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.800]   Reflect 50 bucks on this.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   I haven't noticed.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.160]   I think there have been a lot of people emailing me saying, "When do you think my old iPhone
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.160]   is worth?"
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.040]   And telling me, "I think I ought to be able to get 200 for it."
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.040]   I'm like, "Ee-e-e."
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.880]   No, because the new one's 200.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.000]   It might actually be more of an evangelism opportunity.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.960]   Because you keep hearing about people saying, "Oh, no, my wife's going to get my phone."
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.600]   Or, "I'm going to get my sister."
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.960]   Just this morning, I had...
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.600]   I'm absolutely certain that she wasn't fishing, but a really good friend mentioned, "Oh, well,
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.680]   this has really gotten me excited about the new iPhone.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.440]   I should probably buy one next month."
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.320]   Andy, who I know owns at least two of them of 1.0, and who's definitely getting the 2.0
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.480]   and won't have any need for the 1.0 hardware anymore.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.480]   You will be able to take the sim out of your old iPhone.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.320]   In fact, the new iPhone comes with a sim removal tool.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.240]   Basically, expensive paperclip.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.160]   So you will be able to take the old sim out of your old iPhone and put it in the new
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:10.040]   one, but in order to activate this phone, you have to buy the extra 3G plan, right?
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.040]   You have to buy the $30.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.040]   Yes, that's mandatory.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.000]   Why would you move the sim?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.840]   Why would you keep your number to keep your account?
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.480]   Otherwise, you have to get a new AT&T account.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.480]   Okay.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.480]   So I'm going to buy...
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.120]   I already passed on my iPhone to Dane.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.120]   So now, if I buy...
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.120]   And I think I will.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.480]   If I buy the new 3G iPhone, I'll have to get a second AT&T line.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.840]   Or I can disable Dane's phone.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:40.120]   If I do that, this podcast will suddenly sound like this.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.120]   Exactly.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.480]   So I won't be doing that.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.480]   If you...
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.480]   Okay.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.480]   Now, the other thing that's...
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.960]   I think good news for most people is you have your choice of AT&T plans.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.680]   You buy the $30 3G data plan, which is...
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.840]   Yeah, 10 bucks more expensive, but now you can choose any other phone plan, right?
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.680]   Actually, isn't the 3G data plan offered with the iPhone package cheaper than a lot
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.320]   of their other 3G data plans?
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.320]   Because...
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.560]   I do have to double check that because the last time I looked into the data plans for
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.960]   3G, it was something like 50 or 60 bucks a month.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:12.960]   So...
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.960]   What is your lack, Barry?
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.960]   I mean, just when I was...
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.040]   As Andy not go American consumer, when I was saying, "Okay, how much is this going
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.280]   to affect my household budget?"
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.280]   Because I'm definitely...
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.400]   I knew I was going to be buying a 3G iPhone and making sure that, again, as a freelance
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.840]   journalist in a collapsing market, that you make sure you know where that extra $30, $40
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.840]   is going to come from.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:36.640]   So I'll leave an impression that that's actually kind of a price cut on 3G service for AT&T.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:43.160]   Well, for instance, when I go up to my Seattle home, it's 50 bucks for any kind of data
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.720]   plan up there from just about anybody.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:50.360]   Verizon wanted 50 bucks minimum for their data plan when I tried to sign up up there.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:55.340]   And according to some research that Liana Li, who has done from Girls Gone Geek, she
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:14:01.660]   says that T-Mobile at 30 a month is the only one that's that cheap as far as she knows.
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:06.060]   I mean, what I'm trying to figure out is I'm trying to divine what the actual whole monthly
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.060]   cost is going to be.
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.060]   I mean, I'm seeing all these like, "This is the data plan and this is the new plan here."
[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.940]   And somebody said, "1,200 bucks for the two-year deal."
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:13.940]   1,200 total.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:20.300]   But you know, when they make that calculation, you see that calculation all the time.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.300]   That's the same for any smartphone.
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.900]   I mean, I don't think it's that much, but it's certainly not much more.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.980]   I think $30 is not unfair for un...
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.980]   It's all you can eat, right?
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.460]   Yeah, I went for my trip to my...
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.660]   Except for it doesn't include all you can eat text messages.
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.580]   Does not include SMS at all?
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.580]   Or does it include...
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.140]   $30 you can do $30 right for unlimited?
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.220]   Is that right for the SMS?
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.220]   No, it's an extra $10 for unlimited SMS.
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.860]   So it'll be 40 for the basic plan plus that.
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.900]   So if you use Twitter, you should probably spend the extra $10.
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.500]   Justine will definitely want to spend the extra $10.
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.340]   Yeah, I have to tell you.
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.260]   And by the way, there is a $45 plan as well.
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.460]   That's for corporate use.
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:15:00.580]   And you will be required to sign up for that plan if you need to do certain things.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.580]   Such as?
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:06.260]   I haven't given a lot of details, but I think it has to do with accessing some of the enterprise
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.700]   features over the data network.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.860]   Okay.
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.220]   That was one of the things that I think was a big story.
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.580]   I thought it was a huge story for people even without the iPhone.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:23.780]   Because Apple pitched it as giving exchange-like services to home users, mobile me.
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.300]   I think mobile me sounds fantastic.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.700]   Yeah, but the name is so terrible.
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.700]   It's a terrible name.
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.700]   Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.700]   Let's finish our iPhone discussion.
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.700]   We'll get to mobile me.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:37.980]   But I think what you're seeing is Apple continuing to go after this business market
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:43.340]   for sure, going after RIM, and also offering these kinds of business-class services to
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.260]   home users is very interesting.
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.780]   I also think that I think when we look at the GPS, and one of the interesting details that
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:57.780]   came up was talking about how Apple is protecting the touring type of GPS usage of the iPhone.
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.380]   I don't know if you saw that.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.620]   That was people were looking at the fine print of the agreement with the developing for the
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.620]   iPhone.
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:10.340]   And it looks like Apple wants to hang on to or at least have some level of control over
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:17.560]   the TomTom, like a direct competitor to Garmin, TomTom, so on and so forth.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.860]   Yeah, TomTom said right after the announcement, "Oh, we'll make an application.
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.420]   We're working on this.
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.420]   It's so funny.
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.380]   This is very similar to what was the company.
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.780]   As soon as they heard the SDK said, "We'll do a flash."
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:29.780]   Was it a doe?
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.780]   Bang, no.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:31.780]   I've never heard of it.
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.780]   We'll do a flash.
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:33.780]   And then they looked at the agreement.
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:38.460]   So according to Electronista, which is a gadget, kind of a very cool gadget site, they looked
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:45.540]   at the new SDK, section 337 of the license agreement says, "Applications may not be designed
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:49.740]   or marketed for real-time route guidance.
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.500]   Automatic or autonomous control of vehicle."
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.100]   I can understand that.
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.820]   You can't use your iPhone to drive your car aircraft.
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.260]   That could be bad press.
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.100]   That could be very bad press.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.500]   Now, so that's for legal reasons and dispatch or fleet management or emergency or lifesaving
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.500]   purposes.
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.500]   The last three are clearly, "We don't want to assume any liability."
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:14.980]   But that first one, "Real-time route guidance," that's what turn-by-turn directions is.
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:19.140]   Apple does not include turn-by-turn directions so far as far as we know, right?
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.940]   There's two potential reasons for that.
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.700]   One of them could be legal once again.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:29.380]   I mean, there are a lot of lawsuits hitting the car GPS companies over people either being
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:34.860]   heard or killed while using those devices or suing because it took them to the Hell's
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.060]   Angels headquarters instead of the Ritz Carlton.
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.460]   But why not let Tom Tom do it?
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.180]   Let them assume the liability.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.900]   Well, and that's a certain possibility.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:50.740]   But the other thing might be is that the overhead to support that is pretty significant.
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.020]   And once again, we're looking at that battery life issue.
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.300]   I think it's a business decision.
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.340]   I think Apple has.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.580]   There's so much business.
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.580]   They want to do it.
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.620]   They want to do a deal with Garmin or Tom Tummer, but jealousy.
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.620]   They want to do it themselves.
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.260]   I mean, it would do it themselves.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.700]   It's such the killer app to do that better than the way it's being done right now.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.700]   And I just think that there's so many opportunities there.
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.500]   I don't know about that.
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:16.940]   If Apple right now has the ability to take 30% of the retail price of Tom Tom navigation,
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:23.380]   the worldwide standard in street level turn-by-turn navigation, who would deliver what, like,
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:27.460]   five, six, seven, eight years worth of experience and know how to that sort of an application.
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:32.340]   I don't think any company that tries to get that kind of an application off the floor
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.940]   would do one-tenth of business that Tom Tom.
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.900]   Oh, Andy, you're talking about Apple.
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.340]   Apple never, you know, you could have said the same thing about cell phones.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.860]   How, in fact, I did.
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.940]   Oh, they'll never get in the cell phone business.
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.180]   That's a killer market.
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.060]   Apple's an arrogant this way.
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.620]   It's a different thing.
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:52.180]   They're arrogant, but they also like know what numbers, what numbers are black, what numbers
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.180]   are red.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.780]   It just doesn't make financial sense.
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.860]   It makes financial sense for them to create a platform that not only allows them to sell
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:03.180]   hardware, but also to, again, put their hand in the till of every piece of software and
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.980]   every piece of accessory that sold for the piece of hardware.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:11.980]   I just don't see them saying, "Let's create this really complicated application from the
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:19.700]   ground up and compete with the people who are probably very, very happy to port what
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.940]   they already have into the iPhone market."
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.620]   And your point's taken.
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.660]   And I think that one possibility there is also, though, that they get to be the kingmaker.
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.980]   So by closing off all the gaps, they make the decision about who's going to be.
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.980]   Who's going to get to do it?
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.020]   It's not going to be Tom Tom and Garmin.
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:36.220]   And it's going to be one of them.
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.860]   That's too bad.
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:44.620]   What's interesting, though, is we're starting to, I've seen my first crack in the acceptability
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:45.700]   of the App Store.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.100]   I was really, really pleased to see a note from somebody saying that a sling player is
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.540]   going to be coming to the iPhone.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:56.540]   Really, really surprised when I found out that it is not a sanctioned app.
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:01.700]   It does require a jail broke phone, or at least the version that they have right now
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.100]   requires a jail broke phone.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.380]   And who's going to jail break your phone now?
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.380]   Exactly.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.420]   That totally remains to be seen.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.380]   But let's assume that the clever people who did it the first time are going to figure
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.180]   out a way around it the second time.
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.180]   But would you do it?
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:18.980]   I mean, if you now can get apps, would you jail break your phone?
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:26.020]   Again, right now there's much less legitimacy to a jail broke phone than there was a year
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.020]   ago.
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:33.380]   Right now, and particularly now that Apple has said that we know that you can't run background
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.180]   processes on the iPhone, but we're going to give you developers a way that you can sort
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.100]   of get background process functionality.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.980]   So there are a lot of apps that are now, now that the legitimacy of a jail broke phone
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.420]   is a lot less than it used to be.
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.180]   However, all that has to happen is for Adobe to say, you know what?
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:55.380]   We really see a reason to have a palm top version of Photoshop Express.
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.940]   That really gives you an intimate level of control over the collecting, collecting photographic
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:04.420]   data in the field, tag, geo tagging it, modifying it and then setting it onto another place.
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.820]   The vision we have for this app, for this, for all of our real estate customers, for
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.740]   all of our medical customers, for all these customers, cannot be realized with the SDK.
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:15.020]   So we are officially in the jail broke iPhone business.
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:19.060]   That if only one or two of those companies get on board with that, then suddenly that's
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.740]   the civil war for iPhones.
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:24.460]   There will be two different up two different styles of users out there, depending on what
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.060]   apps they want to use.
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:31.180]   I've been talking with some engineers from AT&T as well as some other folks that say
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:36.740]   this iPhone will be not near the cakewalk to jailbreak as the previous one.
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.580]   I think you can almost count on that.
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.700]   Apple Apple's probably looking at this and saying, let's see what we can do.
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:46.140]   And they're clearly trying to lock it down by making you activated, for instance.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.100]   You certainly won't have unlocked phones anymore.
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.900]   I mean, there's a lot of things that I'd like to use, but the jailbreaking is just more
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.380]   work than I think that nine.
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:58.020]   I think even if people do it, I think it's always going to be still this two or three
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.220]   percent of the population jailbreaking their phones.
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.580]   For me, there's tons of apps that I've seen go by that I'd love to put on there, but it's
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.900]   just too much work from jail.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.700]   Really, and fix it every single time Apple runs an update.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.580]   I'm not worried about the trouble because they've really got it down where you just go to a
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:13.580]   web page.
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.100]   It's a free download.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.660]   It's a one button install.
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.300]   But I'm worried about messing up with my phone.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:26.260]   And now, what happens is there's a risk reward ratio and the reward is going down because
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.100]   you've got third party apps and the risk is probably going up.
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.940]   I think that at some point, the line crosses and people just say, I'm not going to take
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.500]   the chance because there's too little to gain here.
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.500]   Right.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.060]   Well, most of the jailbreaking was happening.
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:45.060]   If you look at it, I mean, in conjunction with unlocking, to go to places like China,
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.260]   where the phone wasn't available.
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:52.140]   You look at 70 countries of availability and a lot of the jailbreaking as part of unlocking
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.140]   is unnecessary.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.140]   They can get the phone.
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.900]   That's all they really wanted in the first place.
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.180]   Let's talk about things that were missing.
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.900]   Still no cut and paste.
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.660]   Still no to do list.
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.820]   I mean, cut and paste.
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.540]   But wait a minute, there's 5,000 people down there and maybe it's a new list.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.540]   All right.
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.540]   I admit.
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.540]   They're sitting there to change all that Leo.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.540]   That's what I understand.
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.060]   Can you write an application?
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.980]   Well, let me ask you this.
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:16.980]   Can you write it?
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:21.780]   Do you think you could write an application to handle MMS?
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.780]   I don't know.
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:23.780]   It depends really.
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:27.060]   I've talked to three of you that say, let's say, absolutely you can.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.820]   The question is, does the SDK allow it?
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.060]   They say yes.
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.060]   That's the thing.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.940]   You have to parse your lawyers have to parse the agreement and say, hmm.
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:40.060]   I think there's, I think we don't, I think we're at the stage where, you know, we once
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:44.780]   again, you know, we don't know what the phone's going to look like probably by the end of
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.660]   July because we haven't seen what these 5,000 people who just spent a bunch of money to
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.740]   be down here have to say.
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.180]   And some of the things that Apple didn't choose to put in there.
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:58.620]   I mean, we don't chide Microsoft, for instance, for saying, you know, you shipped me a computer
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.740]   that didn't do Photoshop on it.
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.780]   Yeah, but try shipping a computer that doesn't do cut and paste.
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.420]   Well, you know what I'm talking about though.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.100]   The point is that I think that the developers will add some of these features.
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.620]   And yeah, it would have been great for Apple to put them in, but it's too early to say
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.220]   what we will and won't have.
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:16.220]   Okay.
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.220]   Once that happens.
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.220]   Okay.
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.620]   Yeah, but still, I mean, some things are fundamental again.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.620]   Yeah.
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.860]   Less level resources like cut and paste.
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:27.660]   I would like to see, especially now that we're now that we're getting third party apps,
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.620]   a system wide search that simply says, I need it.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:34.020]   I know that I need, I have something related to people that I'm talking to at CBS.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.700]   Just show me everything related to CBS as opposed to having to be in the right space
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.420]   in order to make that search, search practical.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:45.980]   There's something we haven't officially seen 2.0, everything that's going to be there yet.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:49.220]   But yeah, I mean, there's still a lot of small button things.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.140]   I'll give you something that no one can fix.
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.820]   The camera is still crappy.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.820]   Absolutely.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.820]   Well, it's not crappy.
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.820]   It's just not as good as a Nokia 95.
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:59.420]   I mean, you're going to see more and more phones.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.860]   And in fact, if you're going to compete with the iPhone, the first thing you do is make
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.380]   sure you have a three, four, five megapixel camera in your.
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.140]   That I'm disappointed in.
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:10.100]   I do expect we'll see some apps from the developers that will give you some more control over
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.100]   the camera.
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.420]   But I'm disappointed they didn't bump it up to three or four megapixels.
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.420]   That would have been a real option.
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.420]   I don't know.
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:21.260]   I think that I think all three or four megapixels would do is prove that the image, the lens
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:25.100]   or whatever that's in there is all it looks good, but it looks like crap.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.900]   I mean, you know, the green.
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.900]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.500]   So I mean, the thing is that making it bigger, I don't know, would necessarily make it any
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.300]   better mine, at least maybe I put it in my pocket the wrong way or whatever, it just
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.460]   are kind of foggy or whatever.
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.820]   You know, it's awful.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.500]   But you know, that's just a little, that's a kit you buy from there, a variety of different
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.900]   people who make these.
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.620]   It's just a kit with a lens in this.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.100]   I mean, it's not a big thing.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.100]   I agree.
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.100]   They should have done it.
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.580]   I don't know why they didn't.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.260]   And there are things at the hardware level that you're going to always say it should
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.740]   have had, but you know, that's why they make other cell phones.
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.180]   If this one doesn't have what people need, they should buy the other one.
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.740]   Still no video, although that at least is easy to add.
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.740]   That's just software.
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:02.980]   You just take a lot of pictures fast.
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.180]   Well, we got that on a jailbroken phone.
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.180]   Right.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.380]   We know it's physically capable of doing it.
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.380]   Right.
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.460]   What else is missing?
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:11.460]   Do you feel?
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.780]   According for forward facing camera, a lot of people were sort of clamoring for video
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:15.780]   conference.
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.780]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.980]   In fact, we talked about that as a rumor that there would be a camera pointing at you so
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:24.060]   that you could do, you know, as we do now with Skype, I would, I mean, that seems like
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.060]   a simple thing.
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:28.620]   Well, but it's, it's actually, well, that's, that's, you'd have to have a, you'd have
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.620]   to have a mount for it.
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.580]   You'd have to have, you'd have to make the face big kind of ugly in order to accommodate
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.580]   it.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.780]   And also there's a question of how many people would actually use this.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:39.300]   I really think it's more of a question of how come we don't have iChat for the iPhone
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.300]   yet.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.900]   I think that's the bigger point right there.
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:42.900]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.700]   I mean, it is, it is simple enough that it's going to be easy for people to write.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:50.420]   I mean, if, if you think that if, if I wonder if there should be a betting pool on how many
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.820]   chat clients there's going to be in the app store when it opens, I'm betting more than
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:54.820]   15.
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:59.660]   Apple's providing this kind of weird, uh, push proxying so that if you, they still require
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:03.580]   that you close when the phone rings or another application launches, but they can say, but
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.780]   they can save data on their end and push it back.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:09.860]   So, that only that, only that, but can also push things like badge notifications so that
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:14.340]   if you do, if you wanted to do like an iPhone version of iChat, your app could actually
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.580]   help date its icons.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.340]   Oh, by the way, you have two pending chats.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.620]   Uh, so that's all we need.
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:24.180]   I mean, yeah, the fact, and as Steve pointed out in his keynote, you know, this idea of
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.900]   multitasking doesn't work so well.
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.780]   It's better to just do one thing at a time.
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.780]   Yeah.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.780]   It's good.
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:30.780]   It's good that he made that point.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:35.420]   I've been a long time Windows mobile user and you do get very intimate with that little
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:40.020]   menu application that shows you every piece of running code and lets you close down processes
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.580]   manually because otherwise it really is a nightmare.
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:46.580]   I mean, so long as there's a benefit to this limitation, then I don't think anybody's
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.620]   going to care only like weenies like me who are like, Oh, well, really, if it were a real
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:53.780]   operating system, you'd be able to have multiple processes.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.940]   This just demonstrates this is just a cut down mobile edition of a West Ed.
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.300]   You know what else I'm really mad about?
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.300]   I don't know if anybody really cares, but the lack of a to DP Bluetooth, the ability
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.100]   to put stereo Bluetooth headphones on.
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.420]   Is that something that is that something that could be fixed by the developers?
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.260]   I think it's so I think it's not the developers.
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:14.420]   I think it's firmware, but I think in firmware Apple could fix it.
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.700]   So it could be the 2.0 would fix it.
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:17.700]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:18.700]   Isn't that the larger problem?
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:22.260]   I just want I want a better Bluetooth stack full stop.
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.940]   I want the ability to talk to GPS devices.
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.780]   I want the ability to push files on there.
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:31.020]   I know Apple would never allow that, but so many solutions that I could make for myself
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.580]   if it just had a full Bluetooth stack.
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.220]   Yeah, no, I agree with you.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.300]   Well, the Shash is sending me a note saying the Bluetooth is locked.
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.660]   I don't know where he gets that fact.
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.940]   And if that's true, then we can't depend on developers.
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:44.420]   And that is another place where they should have done a little bit more, but maybe they're
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.940]   saving the, you know, maybe they got together with Steve and said, all right, what are we
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:48.940]   going to do for 3.0?
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:53.060]   I think it's also it's a fun thing, isn't it?
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.640]   I mean, traditionally, this is the kind of thing the phone company demands, certainly
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.460]   Verizon's famous for locking down their Bluetooth.
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.220]   It may be something AT&T is saying, we don't want too many Bluetooth applications.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.260]   You know, there's something I would give to look at that contract.
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:11.060]   Well, but the other thing though is that I mean, when I'm in Africa, you know, the Bluetooth,
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.740]   a lot of the Bluetooth phones there are wide open.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.740]   Right.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.900]   And it's amazing the kind of viruses and all kinds of other stuff that.
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.220]   Oh, there's a lot of stability issues that come from things getting pushed in and, you
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.020]   know, moved around and stuff like that when it's wide open.
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.720]   So there may be just some like we're going to slowly get there and protect the phone.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.160]   Well, here's my big concern.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.200]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.680]   We've got GPS now, which I was a little worried about.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.680]   We got it.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.680]   We got all this stuff.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.440]   I'm keeping my 1.0 phones around because, you know, if this turns out to be like the
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:45.840]   N95 solution where everything crashes because you got all this stuff, I'm going back to
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.600]   1.0 because it still works.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.640]   It's pretty clear Steve is opting for security and stability over functionality.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.600]   That's what business wants.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.620]   And, you know, I think this is this is an Apple product unlike many Apple products we've
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:02.220]   seen in the past that is really in many ways aimed at the business user.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.860]   Although putting a camera on it kind of makes for a lot of it.
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:11.260]   But you can disable that through the stuff that happens at the enterprise level.
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:14.500]   Yeah, they have this new enterprise feature where you can turn stuff on and off.
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.220]   So that's one of the things you could turn off.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.220]   Yep.
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.580]   You can turn off the camera, which, you know, most companies are going to make happen.
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.760]   And you can do the remote erase, which is a really big deal.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.440]   I'm kind of surprised it doesn't have voice dialing.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.880]   Do you think that they might adopt any of the stuff that Microsoft is talking about doing
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:39.760]   where it's not DRM, but digital, what do they call it, manners management?
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.840]   I like that of whatever it is I wanted.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.400]   If they have manners, well, Microsoft's been talking, there's been stuff floating up the
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.020]   Microsoft playing with this idea that when you walk into a theater, for instance, the
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:53.800]   theater tells the phones, you know, if they're based in this, that there's legal issues with
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.800]   that.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.320]   Well, it switches it and turn them off and just switches them to vibrate.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.320]   You know, the answer.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.420]   I think there's legal issues.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:04.180]   The first time a parent doesn't get a call from his kid who's dying dying in the street
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.180]   or something.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.780]   Boy, you got a problem there.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:07.780]   Yeah.
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:08.780]   Okay.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.180]   But the kids dying in the street, you may as well watch the rest of Iron Man.
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.980]   He's less dead.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.940]   Well, you certainly want to stay through the credits to see that fine.
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:16.940]   Exactly.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:17.940]   You're going to hear about that later on.
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:18.940]   You know what?
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.180]   There was really no reason for me to rush out.
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.180]   What was I thinking?
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.180]   What was it?
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.300]   It would be a cool thing if it weren't opt in sort of thing.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:30.300]   If I had to switch every one of the defects of the iPhone OS is that when you press the
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:35.780]   silent button on the side of it is that your alarms don't go silent.
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.980]   And I thought, of course, I found this out watching Indiana Jones 4.
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.780]   I got an alert at 8 p.m.
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.060]   Reminding me that I need to give somebody their medication.
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.180]   Silence should be silent.
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.180]   That's bad.
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:50.540]   So if they were a preference saying, look, if there is a signal being broadcast of this
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:55.140]   standard saying, make no noise whatsoever, obey that signal, if I had that ability to
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:58.460]   make sure that for the rest of the life of this phone, I would never have that sort of
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:59.460]   embarrassment again.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.620]   Boy, would I flip that switch?
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:03.100]   Boy, I think that would be an okay thing.
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.260]   I also think, though, the opt in may be coming from when we talk about enterprise.
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:10.460]   I can definitely see a coming from production.
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:13.300]   I can definitely see a shoot for instance, saying that nobody working on a shoot can
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.740]   use any phones that don't have this because it means that basically when you walk onto
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:20.460]   the stage area where we're shooting the next Star Wars or Indiana Jones or whatever, you
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.460]   can't take a photo.
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:24.220]   It's those kind of things where--
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.220]   Wow.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.220]   That's an interesting-- so Microsoft's talking about doing that.
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.860]   Well, clubs will be mandating that too, by the way.
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:31.860]   Yeah.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:32.860]   So the things that--
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:33.860]   Oh, it's the--
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:34.860]   But anything like--
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:36.660]   Well, you got a crappy 2 megapixel phone?
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.420]   No, we can't let those kind of pictures out.
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.540]   We only have signs all over it that say you can't use your phone in these areas.
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.580]   We don't want to use your phone when you're on the bikes or in the-- obviously in the
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:46.580]   locker area.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.580]   Yeah.
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.580]   But you could theoretically say, no, Jim won't do it.
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:54.140]   But I could definitely see a company, especially if it's dealing with what it considers security,
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:58.380]   not-- you know, basically if it had the option of picking phones that it's going to buy
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:05.700]   for its employees, basically saying, well, they don't-- they don't work in certain ways
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.180]   when they're in the building to maintain security.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.660]   Now, is there a reason Apple wouldn't actually just come out with a cameraless edition or
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:17.780]   even just the same iPhone as to accept that it comes with a different back plate that
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.420]   has no cutout for the phone?
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:23.100]   Because other people I've been talking to have been-- it's not enough that I can simply
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.620]   disable the camera.
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:29.020]   If I have a phone that has any sort of a lens in it, I'm leaving that.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.260]   I can't-- I can't carry that inside the facility.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.460]   That's true in a lot of facilities.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.140]   Certainly government facilities, a lot of businesses, Jim's--
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:39.500]   I'm guessing if the United States Army wanted four million iPhones without fun--
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.500]   Is that funny?
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.500]   I'm guessing that they would do that for them.
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.300]   There's two things we haven't mentioned.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.620]   One of the best history stories to make this happen for us.
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:52.900]   Ford-facing camera, full Bluetooth stack, one of you can make this happen.
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.620]   Just order just a million, just one million.
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.620]   That's all it takes.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.420]   There's two things we haven't mentioned.
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.380]   There's no more recessed headphone jack.
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.380]   Yay!
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.500]   Does that mean I can use any headphone now?
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:07.460]   You can't accept that you still need the old style one, I think, if you want to do the
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:08.460]   mic thing.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.460]   Right.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.740]   And then the plastic back, what does everybody think about that?
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:14.220]   Because now everybody's going to say, "Oh, it's going to break.
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:17.980]   It's going to plastic back," disregarding the fact that almost every cell phone made
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:18.980]   has one.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.140]   But it allegedly will give you better reception.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.140]   I think that's the reason.
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:23.220]   I think 3G required.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:27.380]   I'm actually really excited to see the plastic back because I think that it will greatly
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.860]   reduce-- I mean greatly improve the reception quality.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:31.860]   And I know that's--
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:32.860]   That's important.
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.860]   That's a better sound quality.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.180]   We won't know till we hear, but that's been a complaint from a lot of you.
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:39.860]   But will the plastic back exacerbate the GSM noise?
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.940]   You can't go to Mushworths.
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:42.940]   I'm sure.
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:50.220]   And is anybody going to buy a white one?
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.860]   Yeah, that's a question.
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.820]   And you only get white if you buy the 16 gig.
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.860]   Yes, you have to-- Now, but see, this is so funny.
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.860]   This is like Apple doing what they do.
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.580]   The MacBook, you pay extra for the black one.
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.420]   But I'm not going to pay extra for a white one.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.420]   Now you got to pay extra for the white one.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.340]   Well, I guess if you get a 16 gig of your choice, I don't think-- although I have a
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.220]   feeling the blacks are going to run out of stock very quickly because I don't think anybody
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.220]   wants white.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:18.700]   You may get a white one just because you have no choice.
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.500]   I think you're also going to see the typical thing, which is that almost everybody that
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:27.380]   I've talked to that has an iPhone is going to get a new iPhone, which is like 80%.
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.780]   Are already saying that, of course, they're going to get the 16 gig.
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:34.020]   The thing is that the 199 is a great price, but I think that you're going to see most
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.020]   299.
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.820]   Once you're going to go down that path, once you're going to pay for the data plan, they're
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:38.940]   going to buy the 16 gig.
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.700]   I don't think they're-- I think in the-- when they released the first one, when it was 4
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.060]   gig and 8 gig, no one bought.
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:45.660]   I mean, there were plenty of 4 gigs.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.340]   It was the 8 gigs that every once in a while would run out.
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:49.340]   100 bucks is nothing.
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:50.820]   It's all about the monthly cost.
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:51.980]   299 is a great deal.
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:55.900]   I got an entire vest made of 599 iPhones.
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:56.900]   Come on.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:04.620]   Let's take a break when we come back, talk about MobileMe, Apple's rebranded, redesigned.mac,
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.180]   with crappy name, but some interesting new features.
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.100]   But before we do that, I want to mention something which has a great name and great
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:11.100]   features.
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.660]   You know what I'm talking about, ladies and gentlemen, it's the Drobo from Data Robotics
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:16.500]   Drobo.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.100]   You will bow down before Drobo.
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.820]   Hey, you, I am Drobo.
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:26.220]   Drobo is a USB hard drive that is so much more.
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.980]   Most of all, data redundancy built in.
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:35.020]   So you can just take any 4 SATA drives you've got lying around or go out and buy 4.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:37.420]   And it adds up the total sum of all the drives.
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:42.740]   Unlike RAID 5, you don't have to go with the lowest drive size, the lowest common denominator.
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:47.860]   It is-- then it becomes this great USB backup device, great for time machine.
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:52.460]   Somebody asked me the other day if it would work with Airport Express using Apple, the
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.300]   Apple disk, the iDisk thing.
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.700]   And yes, of course it will.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:56.860]   I see a USB drive.
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:00.180]   With Drobo, share it also becomes a network attached storage device.
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:04.180]   I got to tell you a cool story about that.
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:08.900]   The Drobo people actually hired us to do some video form.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:09.900]   Yeah, good.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.100]   And they came in and we did the video.
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.100]   Okay.
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:17.180]   And then the guy opened up his laptop because we said, you know, we're going to move the
[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:18.180]   files.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.900]   We'll put the files on a hard drive and bring it over to you.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.020]   And then I said, no, no, put it on the Drobo.
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.380]   And then let's see if it works and the guy opened up his Mac.
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:27.460]   He's not from our company.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.340]   This is on our network.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:35.740]   And the Drobo share popped up the Drobo right on his-- there was no configuring, no-- so
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.220]   I was really impressed by that.
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:41.420]   I mean, you know, if we were like on a Windows network, we'd have had to call IT to give
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:43.180]   us an IP number or something.
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:47.500]   But it was just like it saw it instantly and he was able to move the files across.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.700]   And we're feeling pretty droovy over here at Pedango Productions.
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.500]   Droovy's a new word.
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.180]   It's after you get everything on your Drobo.
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.460]   You feel very droovy.
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:58.620]   This is-- I like this too.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.260]   And this lives living up to this promise smaller than a bread box and easier to use than a
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.020]   toaster.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.500]   It could store all your stuff.
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.020]   The data redundancy is very cool.
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.540]   If a drive fails, drives fail, you pull it out, you put a new one.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:13.220]   Drobo automatically rebuilds itself and you're good to go.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.380]   You never lose a bit.
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.380]   Drive gets full.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.380]   The orange light comes on in the front of the Drobo.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.620]   The lights are very informative, very useful.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.700]   You just pull it out, put a new one in, rebuilds itself.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.060]   Now you've got more space.
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:29.700]   Up to 16 terabytes if you buy these new-- are there really four terabyte drives?
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.700]   Unbelievable.
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.780]   And somebody-- there are two just four of them.
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:33.780]   Someday.
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:34.780]   Someday.
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:35.780]   Someday.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:39.260]   I guess 16 terabytes is the theoretical limit.
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.900]   I just said mine, I set my Drobo's up to do four terabytes.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:43.900]   And then--
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.380]   Four one terabyte drives in there.
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:46.380]   And I asked them.
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.060]   They were in the office last week.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:52.020]   And I asked them, you guys are all getting visits from Drobo.
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.340]   Do you want them to come up and visit you to Leo?
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.740]   I like to be lonely up here.
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:56.940]   So I have a Drobo.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:57.860]   I don't need any visits.
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.060]   I love my Drobo.
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:03.460]   Well, the one question that I had was, what happens if you get the two terabyte drives
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:04.100]   and now you can--
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.340]   Abe, you set it up at four.
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.980]   What will happen is it'll be a second volume.
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:07.820]   So you have another--
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.260]   Oh, that's clever.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.940]   So you'd have to set up another volume to two--
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.660]   you have two three gig volumes.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.460]   It's very smart.
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:15.380]   I have to say, oh, yeah.
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.540]   We should mention what about a third--
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.260]   a quarter to a third is redundancy.
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.380]   That's for the backup.
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:20.460]   So if you put four terabytes--
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.260]   If you have four terabytes, you have three free.
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:22.860]   You have three free.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.460]   You have three free.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.140]   Yeah.
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.020]   And it's automatically protected.
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:26.540]   No, you know what?
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.380]   It's funny.
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.740]   They said, well, come up.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:29.500]   We'll bring a Drobo.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.340]   We'll show you how to do it.
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.700]   And I said, no.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.740]   If somebody has to show me how to do it, that's not a good product.
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.580]   Just do it myself.
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:37.380]   I'll send it to me.
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.300]   I'll do it myself.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:39.380]   You don't need any help.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.380]   You turn it on.
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.100]   You put the drives in.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:41.620]   You plug it in.
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:42.540]   It's it.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:43.540]   I think it's the big--
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:46.780]   Five instruction lines on the thing, and it's in the help.
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:47.900]   It's just some system.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:48.780]   Dr. some system, guys.
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.460]   And they're like, oh, well, that's just rate five.
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.460]   I can just do rate--
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:51.460]   It's not.
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:51.960]   It's not.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.380]   Number one is not.
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:53.700]   But number two is, there's a lot of people
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:54.900]   that don't want to deal with rate five.
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.300]   They don't want to know about it.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.220]   They just want to plug something in
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.900]   and know that it has that redundancy in it.
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.060]   This is very, very sophisticated, very smart.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.100]   And do you know that they're changing their motto?
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.500]   No, what's their new motto?
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.100]   It's so easy.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.340]   Scott can do it.
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.180]   All right, we got to deal for you $50 off.
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.660]   Now, this is-- you know, you can get a mail-in rebate
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.580]   for $50 off from some other shows.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.500]   This is the only show where you get $50 off at the time
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:21.380]   of order if you go to drobo.com/macbreak.
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.740]   DROBO.com/macbreak.
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:27.060]   $50 off instantly.
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.620]   No mail-in, nothing.
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.220]   If you use our name, drobo.com/macbreak.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:35.140]   We thank Drobo for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:39.180]   Oh, by the way, offer good through August 31, 2008.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.820]   That's the only legal disclaimer I have to do.
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.260]   So let's talk about mobile me.
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.460]   Are you ready to get mobile with me?
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:48.300]   I guess appleboughtme.com.
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.660]   Andy was looking at the who is on it.
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.060]   And what was it?
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.380]   It was some snapper, something like that.
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.940]   It was, as a matter of fact, I'm cycling through my god,
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:58.740]   deck now, come on.
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:40:58.940]   Come on.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:40:59.540]   I think it was snapper.
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.020]   If you go to me.com, you can go to the internet archive
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:02.500]   and find it.
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.220]   It was one of the names that a company had registered.
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.620]   The idea was build your own social network and make money.
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.700]   I guess it wasn't making any money for them
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:11.780]   until they sold to Apple.
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.580]   Snapville.com, I think it was.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.820]   Snapville.
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.300]   As a matter of fact, it was so--
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:17.780]   That's chattering.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:19.300]   See, thanks to Kimchere.
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.820]   As a matter of fact, if you look through the Google cache,
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.340]   you find out that at some point, they had done a search
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:28.020]   and replace on all the text on their front page,
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:31.700]   replacing Snapville to me or mobile me.
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:35.580]   Making me wonder exactly, did they buy their resources?
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:36.620]   Did they buy their bandwidth?
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.580]   Did they buy some technology?
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.900]   Or did they just simply, oh, this is a nice service.
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.940]   Let's make it into mobile me.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.660]   How much do you think they paid for me?
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:47.260]   M-E-D-I bet you they just got the name, M-E-D-com.
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:47.580]   How much--
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:51.100]   Tonya, my friend Mark of Anir, he's cleaning up right now.
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:54.340]   He's sitting on solid gold toilet seats right now.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.140]   What did he sell?
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:59.100]   I know I have a friend whose initials are M-E-D-com.
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.100]   Oh, Mark of Anir.
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.140]   So I'm like this.
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:03.980]   See, if he'd only been smart enough to register that domain
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:08.020]   back in 1992 or something, before anybody knew these things--
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:13.020]   Dain, who's sitting in the other office, owns hey, he-y.com.
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.140]   Well, any three-letter domain is valuable.
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.060]   Oh, yeah, he's sitting on a gold mine there.
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:22.780]   I registered F64.com in 1994, which was the name
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:24.260]   of Ansel Adams' camera club.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.180]   Ooh.
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.540]   And I still own it.
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.340]   And have you received any bids for that?
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:32.020]   Oh, yeah, there's a bag company by the same name,
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:33.020]   but I don't want to get rid of it
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:37.780]   because it was the first ever photo website gallery online.
[00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.820]   I think for prosperity sake, I need to--
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:42.780]   Posterity not prosperity.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:43.780]   Posterity.
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.780]   You've got enough prosperity.
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:46.980]   I wanted to keep it.
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:49.860]   But Leonard Nimoy was my first exhibit, by the way.
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:50.420]   Really?
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:51.700]   He's a photographer?
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.220]   He's a very well-known photographer.
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.420]   He does nothing but nudes.
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:57.660]   And we did a 1995 exhibit of his work.
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.900]   Now, what were the two most search for terms in 1995
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.460]   online, Star Trek and sex?
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:03.860]   So what do you think happened to my server
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.980]   when we opened up that exhibition?
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:06.500]   Yeah.
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.780]   It flames came out of it.
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.100]   Of course, they were using Alta Vista at the time.
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:10.860]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:13.460]   And we were using Sun's Park Ultra's to serve it.
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.340]   Wow.
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.340]   Yeah, that's--
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.420]   Anyway, I like the features of Mobile Me.
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:20.260]   So the idea-- we haven't used it yet.
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.180]   This rolls out roughly the same time for him.
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.020]   They said it in July.
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.980]   If you have a .Mac account, which I do--
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.540]   I suppose we probably all do-- it automatically upgrades.
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:30.540]   It'll be the same--
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.140]   Not only that, but you get to keep your handle.
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:32.860]   So that's good.
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.100]   Oh, good.
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.180]   Yeah, they didn't make that perfectly clear at first.
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.700]   And I'm glad they clarified that,
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.860]   because I was thinking everybody was going to rush to get
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:41.980]   Leo Laporte at me.com.
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:43.420]   So I'll be at me.com.
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:44.220]   I kind of like that.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:46.060]   I wish I had Leo at me.com.
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:49.300]   You can keep your .Mac address.
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.740]   That's Mac.com.
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.380]   Yeah, you can keep that one.
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.980]   I don't know that I want to be at me.
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:54.620]   I mean, come on.
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:55.540]   It's such a stupid name.
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.820]   What was Talbotubby's taking or something?
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.460]   Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:00.420]   It's all about me.
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.300]   It's all about me.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.780]   The features, which I think going to end up
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:06.380]   being the killer app.
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.100]   I wish Merlin were with us on this call.
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:09.740]   He's walking the baby right now.
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:13.060]   But to me, the idea of being able to automatically
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:17.020]   instantly synchronize my calendar, my address book,
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:22.300]   pictures, documents through me, through mobile me,
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:25.540]   to any Mac, to my iPhone, I think that's a killer.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:26.540]   I think that's just fantastic.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.220]   If it works, it's great.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.620]   Sync is always a walkie, isn't it?
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:34.060]   Well, you know, Julio Zepata from Night Ritter,
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.540]   he's always quoted in Night Ritter.
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:36.380]   - Julio's good.
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:37.180]   I know Julio very well.
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.940]   - He's a, he covered me like, I don't know,
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:41.780]   12 years ago for the first time we've stayed in touch.
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:44.380]   He works at the St. Paul newspaper.
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:45.780]   He wrote a post on there.
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:46.620]   - He's a listener.
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.460]   - Hi, Julio.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:50.140]   He wrote a post on Twitter that just made me spit up.
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:52.260]   He said, you know, he heard about,
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.220]   he kind of gave a hint of this before anybody.
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.380]   So I want to give him props.
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:56.860]   He scooped everybody on this.
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.260]   And he said something of, you know,
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.300]   there's some kind of new dot-mat coming.
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:02.060]   And then he put it in parentheses,
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:03.580]   "Oh God, let this be true."
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:04.740]   (laughs)
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:06.060]   Well, we've been saying this for a while.
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:08.620]   Me, Dot-Mac has just never lived up to its potential.
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:09.660]   Now it's finally his.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:13.380]   And by the way, 20 gigs for the same price, not 10.
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.620]   And very affordable, if you want to upgrade to 40 gigs or more,
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:17.660]   it's pretty affordable.
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:19.180]   - Now, I wonder how they're going to work it for those
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.820]   of us that already have upgraded our stores.
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.540]   - I presume you just keep it.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:25.340]   - Yeah, is it cheaper to upgrade now?
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:26.180]   No, it's the same.
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:27.020]   - I don't know.
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:27.860]   - Yeah.
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.140]   I think it's cheaper than going forward.
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:29.980]   What was it for?
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:30.900]   - You're always working, you're always working
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:31.900]   the angles of the port.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:32.740]   - Really?
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.060]   - Trying to rub those two quarters together
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:35.900]   until they melt aren't you?
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:36.860]   - Yeah, I got no money.
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:38.260]   That's why I'm not like you, Scott.
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:39.100]   I'm not.
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:39.940]   - I'm doing this for a plus.
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:40.780]   - I'll put it.
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.500]   - If I had your money, I'd throw mine away.
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.500]   - I just did a back envelope calculation
[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:48.020]   on what it's going to cost me per year to do this.
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.020]   And I went.
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.600]   (laughs)
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.500]   (laughs)
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:53.620]   So we thank Drobo.
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.900]   (laughs)
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.220]   And Audible and all those folks are keeping me alive.
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:00.180]   69 bucks right now to get Dot-Mac on Amazon.com.
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.620]   I don't know if it's any cheaper anywhere else,
[00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.340]   but boy, if you get 20 gigs,
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.180]   you get all that sinking.
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:06.580]   Anybody with a Mac's going to want this.
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:09.860]   I think it's very smart for Apple for Apple to do this.
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:12.740]   - Now, how different is the promise though,
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:14.780]   from what we've been promised with Dot-Mac?
[00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.460]   - Yeah, you never know, do you?
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:17.300]   - I've been happy.
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:18.140]   I mean, I have to admit,
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:18.980]   I'm probably one of the few people
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:20.060]   that have been happy with my Dot-Mac account.
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.060]   I mean, it does what I use it.
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:22.220]   I've been a member since day one.
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.060]   - Me too.
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:26.700]   So I haven't had that much problem with it.
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.900]   - Do you use all the sync features, Alex?
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:32.580]   - No, I just use the upload stuff really quickly.
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.300]   And I have used the sync feature a couple of times,
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:36.420]   but it's not on a constant basis.
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.220]   - I sync every machine.
[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:39.060]   - Yeah.
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.860]   - And I have a lot of Macs.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:44.260]   - Well, I do like the public folder.
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.260]   In fact, that's the way most people move stuff
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.940]   around our office to me through my public folder.
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.340]   And that works well.
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.740]   And Dot-Mac mail works reasonably well,
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.300]   but I have not had such luck with the sinking.
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:59.540]   - Yeah, I mean, for me,
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.940]   it's been a collection of individual features
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.140]   that taken all as a group,
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.220]   justify the annual expense.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.420]   What I've been hoping for is that
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.260]   there's a really good one line, one sentence description
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:15.180]   of the role that the service is going to provide in my life.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:18.220]   And I mean, my first question when I heard you mobile me
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:20.580]   is mobile a verb or a noun,
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:23.580]   because that does change things, isn't it?
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:25.260]   (laughing)
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.460]   Okay, you better explain that.
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:30.460]   Well, I mean, am I going to be mobile,
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.820]   or is it me only a mobile version of me?
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.220]   - We will mobilize you.
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:35.060]   - Yes.
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:37.620]   - Why don't we steal hooks through my shoulder braids
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:39.540]   and dangling from an Alexander Calder exhibit
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:41.420]   outside of the Deli Plaza in Chicago?
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:42.260]   - No.
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.100]   - I wouldn't pay 100 bucks a year for that.
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:43.940]   - No.
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:45.260]   - I'd pay 100 bucks a year to watch someone else do that.
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.780]   - No, your nipples may be, but not the shoulder blades.
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:48.620]   - There you go.
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:52.420]   - So I think the sink right now works fairly well.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:55.180]   So I think we can count on the sink working pretty well.
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:56.420]   It's going to sink mail,
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:00.180]   which I guess you get if you get IMAP,
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.780]   anyway, and I thought MAC is IMAP,
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:02.980]   so I don't think that's much of a change,
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.740]   but I do think that sinking the calendar
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:09.580]   and the address book to your phone,
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:11.620]   to me, that's a selling point for the iPhone,
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:12.460]   to be honest with you,
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.380]   having live updates to my iPhone.
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.060]   - It's interesting that it kind of reduces,
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.940]   and this is something that I was thinking about on Monday
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:18.780]   when I first heard about it,
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:20.220]   that this is, for the first time,
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:24.060]   it reduces the importance of iTunes just a little bit,
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:27.020]   because one of the most important features of iTunes
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.340]   is to keep your calendars, keep your address book,
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.980]   keep all that sort of stuff up to date.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:32.860]   If I can push information to my iPhone
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.100]   just from this nice little web-based console
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.940]   and have one less running application to worry about,
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:40.100]   maybe that's actually a really good thing.
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:45.380]   - So we're saying thumbs up all round for mobile me,
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:46.500]   except for the name.
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:47.900]   - Well, I mean, it seems to me,
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:49.420]   I think the worst case scenario
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.220]   is that it's simply a lateral move.
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.500]   It's .Mac, it won't be any worse than it was before.
[00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.020]   It may not be better, but it'll be different,
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.420]   and that's enough for a lot of people.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.420]   - I think it's a selling point for the iPhone.
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:01.540]   I mean, I think this to me makes me want to buy the iPhone.
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.980]   I have some of those capabilities now in my BlackBerry
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.420]   with Google Calendar syncs automatically.
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:09.540]   I remember the Milk to-do lists sync automatically.
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:12.220]   I mean, I've cobbled together that kind of integration
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:16.380]   on my BlackBerry, but if it's all through .Mac or mobile me,
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:17.580]   I think that's a good solution.
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:19.420]   It makes me want the iPhone more.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.020]   - I do think it sells the iPhone,
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:25.060]   and I do think it's definitely something that's exciting,
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:28.260]   not even in the iteration that was promised,
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:30.700]   but what they might do with it going forward.
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:33.820]   For instance, I was particularly interested.
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.660]   They didn't talk about it a lot during the keynote,
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:38.860]   but there was some talk about iPhone being available.
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.940]   You know, look at your iPhone, pictures and stuff.
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:43.220]   Can we extend this further?
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.060]   Can we, you know, those of us who use aperture,
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.500]   can we take it down that road?
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:49.180]   I mean, there's a lot of potential here,
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:50.380]   if this thing really works,
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:53.340]   to start moving us towards this idea
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.180]   that you are no longer tethered to a machine,
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:59.140]   which makes the iPhone as a platform more valuable,
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:02.020]   because that's the thing that's in your pocket all the time.
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:05.860]   And I like what that says could happen.
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:06.700]   It just matters to you.
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:07.780]   - You know what's really interesting here is
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:10.460]   that this is exactly what Microsoft has been saying,
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.700]   with its mesh, but they've been promising.
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:14.420]   They don't really have the capability,
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:17.580]   but this is where Microsoft wanted to be.
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:19.820]   Everybody's watching Microsoft and Google battle
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:21.900]   over this cloud computing stuff.
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.500]   Meanwhile, Apple's sitting over in the corner
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.940]   very quietly working this out
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:27.980]   and delivering July 11th.
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.420]   I think in a way, this is a shocker.
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:33.540]   This is akin to a Nintendo beating PlayStation 3
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:36.060]   and Xbox 360 in the gaming market.
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:39.020]   This is the guy who was kind of sitting back saying,
[00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:42.140]   "Yeah, oh, by the way, we have it now."
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:43.620]   I'm fair, I think this may be
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:46.740]   the most important announcement that Steve made.
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:49.460]   Let's get to one subject that is getting some attention.
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:53.660]   How many of you watched the keynote video afterwards?
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:54.500]   - I did.
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.380]   - Was anybody there?
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:57.700]   Alex, did you go?
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:58.540]   - No.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:50:59.380]   - None of us got it.
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:02.020]   - We had Chris Breen from the Apple phone show inside
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:06.660]   and I had my crew was outside and I was like Andy.
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:10.060]   I was sitting behind my Star Trek style console
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:10.900]   of computers.
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:12.060]   - Yeah.
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:12.900]   - That's what we are.
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:14.100]   - Star Wars style.
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.260]   - I apologize.
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:16.100]   I apologize.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.500]   - Heaven for Fendi, Star Trek.
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.740]   So, but in a very serious notes,
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:21.700]   Steve did not look healthy.
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:23.380]   - There's a lot of talk about that.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.660]   Steve was very thin looking.
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:26.820]   - And they say he was the bug,
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:27.980]   but they won't say what it was.
[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.100]   - They say he's on antibiotics for a bug.
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:33.260]   - But they described it as a conventional illness, I think.
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.220]   - Remember that he had cancer.
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:37.020]   - Yee.
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.860]   - Well, you never had cancer.
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:40.860]   - Well, my point exactly.
[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:41.700]   - Exactly.
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:42.780]   - You have cancer.
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.620]   - There was a bit of a scare,
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:46.700]   what was it, two or three years ago?
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.140]   What kind of cancer did he have?
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.140]   Was it pancreatic?
[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.660]   - It was pancreatic.
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:53.100]   - Did they say he was in remission, Scott?
[00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:54.500]   - Yes.
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:55.540]   - But as you point out,
[00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:57.940]   remission merely means it's not active.
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:00.020]   - Yeah, you know, there are two kinds of people,
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:02.540]   those who have cancer and who are still alive
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:05.100]   and those who eventually die from it.
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.140]   - Do you think he's ill?
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:13.140]   - I don't think there's any reason to believe that
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:17.340]   because he looked kind of squishy up there on stage
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:18.420]   that his cancer's come back,
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:22.380]   I think that's a huge leap in typical of the internets.
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:23.220]   We don't need to see him.
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:25.020]   - And me, because I brought it up.
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:27.380]   But I mean, here's a guy who has been seriously ill
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:29.740]   in the past, there was a serious concern about it.
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:33.380]   He is supposedly fine now, but he's on stage
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:35.380]   and he's not looking good, he's looking peaky,
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:36.500]   he's looking very thin.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.540]   Now he's a vegetarian, he has a very strict diet,
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:42.900]   his wife is a very strict vegetarian, a vegan.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.220]   It could be just that he's exercising a lot
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.580]   and eating healthily.
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:49.900]   - And here comes my argument for many visits
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.260]   to Kentucky Fried Chicken and Donald's on a regular basis.
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.580]   - No one would accuse you of wasting away sky.
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:59.540]   - I am definitely on the side of looking healthy
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:02.660]   compared to Steve Jobs and he's a little guy.
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:06.100]   I met him at the iMac announcement
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:10.380]   and you always see him big on the stage.
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.500]   And I met him and I was like,
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:12.340]   who's this puny?
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:14.780]   Oh, he's not always been that little.
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:16.380]   I mean, I would say he's normal size.
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.420]   - Well, I mean, he's short as well.
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:21.020]   - I'm getting, he's not a large stature person.
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.060]   - I played volleyball with him about 10 years ago
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:25.180]   and he's a strong competitor.
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:26.020]   Let's put it that way.
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:27.660]   - I'm not surprised to hear that.
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:30.580]   - Yeah, he works hard and plays hard
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:32.460]   and didn't like what allows the job.
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:34.780]   Apparently I was doing on my pickups, but,
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:37.860]   but at that time he was hailing hardy.
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:40.820]   This is before the cancer scare, he was hailing hardy.
[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:42.700]   I would not call him hailing hardy today,
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:44.420]   but maybe it's just the flu.
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:45.980]   Here's why it's a big deal.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.460]   - The ego so goes apple.
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:49.780]   - That's why it's in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:51.820]   People are, and I have to think that,
[00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:54.220]   the stock price took a tumble the minute he walked on stage.
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.740]   I have to think that that might have been
[00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:56.740]   some of the reason people were.
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:58.220]   - Well, let me tell you, it wouldn't have mattered
[00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:00.060]   what they said the stock price was gonna help.
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:01.580]   - Sell on the news, buy on the rumor,
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:02.500]   sell on the news and that's it.
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.900]   - That's the way it always works.
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.580]   So I mean, that didn't surprise me at all,
[00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:08.980]   but I don't think that you can tie it to his health.
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:13.980]   And there would be some significant potential litigation
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:16.780]   if he literally does have cancer again
[00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:17.700]   and they withheld that.
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:20.980]   I know given the trouble that Apple has had with--
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:22.580]   - They'd have to tell people, huh?
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.420]   - They would tell people.
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:24.420]   - 'Cause they're a publicly held company.
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:25.940]   - Well, they couldn't say it was a common bug.
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:27.740]   They couldn't say it was a fucking snake.
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:28.820]   They could say nothing.
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:30.700]   They could say nothing and get away with it maybe,
[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:34.460]   but they definitely couldn't say it was nothing out loud
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:36.100]   and then it turned out to be something.
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.340]   - He really wanted to be there.
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.620]   He really wanted to make this announcement.
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.500]   He was feeling ill.
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:41.580]   He went on stage anyway.
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:44.420]   He's now according to Apple on the mend.
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:48.900]   No matter what, I think we all wish Steve Jobs very well.
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:52.460]   If you're an Apple lover, you have a lot to thank Steve Jobs for.
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:54.220]   There's no question about that.
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:55.900]   And if there's any concern, frankly, it's for me,
[00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:57.060]   it's not about the market.
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.500]   It's about Steve.
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.380]   I want him to be healthy.
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:01.220]   - Yeah.
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:03.300]   - You don't want to wish that on anybody.
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.460]   It's a tough road to ho.
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:09.060]   And I certainly hope it isn't back for him.
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:11.380]   And if it is, I think the company needs
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:13.140]   to do the right thing and disclose.
[00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:15.540]   I do want to point out they did not disclose
[00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.340]   four years ago when he had pancreatic acid.
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:20.060]   They didn't disclose it after the surgery.
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.740]   - Yeah, but they also...
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:22.740]   Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:25.540]   - Well, they disclosed, I mean, it wasn't like,
[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:27.100]   you know, there wasn't a year between
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:28.860]   when he was diagnosed when it disclosed.
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:31.020]   I mean, there's a window there that's reasonable.
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:31.860]   - Okay.
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:32.860]   - Also, I think they didn't,
[00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:35.780]   they also released like an email that Steve
[00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:37.180]   sent all employees.
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:38.180]   Essentially saying that,
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:40.780]   I think all of you probably Google the name of this cancer
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.220]   and got the really, really bad one.
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:44.460]   There's a good one, there's a bad one.
[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:46.100]   I have the good one to get.
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:48.340]   So don't worry too much about it.
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.180]   - Yeah.
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:51.500]   - Well, and I think Alex is on to something here.
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:54.220]   It's one thing to say no comment.
[00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:55.340]   It's another thing to say,
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:57.460]   he's absolutely fine and he's not.
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:00.420]   There's, you know, if I'm a board member at Apple,
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:02.860]   I got some Sarbanes, Octa concerns about
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:04.420]   just about every word that's uttered
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:05.980]   because I'm the one that goes to jail
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:09.260]   if there's any kind of, you know, hooky poops.
[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:11.980]   So I mean, it might be that we do here
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:14.180]   in fact that he has cancer six weeks from now,
[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:16.100]   but that timeline would be reasonable.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:18.060]   If we're still talking about this a year from now,
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:19.780]   I think it's just, you know, fodder.
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:20.820]   - So I don't wish him ill
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:22.660]   and I don't certainly want to be sensationalistic.
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:24.660]   And frankly, it was the Drudge report that brought this up
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:26.140]   but I did talk to a lot of people.
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.700]   I have not yet seen the video.
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:30.700]   - Well, if it's a Drudge report, then I completely don't believe.
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:32.500]   - But well, I talked to a lot of people
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.460]   who looked at the video and said, boy, he did not look good.
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:37.660]   - Well, you would have had to do with that Leo.
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:40.140]   - He did, it's not that he didn't look good.
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:44.380]   It's just that now don't, I'm not saying this is a judgment
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.260]   or anything, he looked like a vegan.
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:50.380]   - Yeah, he looked like, look, as four big heavy guys
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:53.300]   who are eating meat eaters, I think we can safely say,
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:54.940]   there's gonna be, and when I say,
[00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:56.460]   I actually mean that as a compliment,
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:00.540]   meaning a certain very, very slim, very, very God appearance,
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:02.580]   but nonetheless does not make you think
[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:04.420]   this person's gonna be dead in a week.
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:07.060]   - I'm so glad it wasn't me who made that.
[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:10.980]   Again, look at looking out, but healthy again.
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:13.100]   This is guys who's not putting fats away for the winner.
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:15.940]   - We were all thinking that, that's all I can say.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.220]   We were all thinking that.
[00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:18.660]   - I'm guessing he's not gonna meet us
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:20.100]   at the house at prime rib after.
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.740]   - And with a certain amount of jealousy, I might have.
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:25.020]   No, the weekend I spent with him about 10 years ago,
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.180]   he hadn't come to App, back to Apple yet.
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:29.500]   We talked about, his wife was very interested
[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:31.780]   in starting a vegan, a line of vegan foods.
[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:34.660]   I think she did, she was a very strict vegan
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:38.900]   and I noticed that he was working his way toward that,
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:41.340]   hadn't yet become a perfect vegan,
[00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:42.860]   but working his way towards.
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:44.500]   - I think he'd still play volleyball back then.
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:48.900]   - Yeah, he wasn't a skinny little run.
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.220]   - I'll tell you that.
[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:51.460]   - The next big apple of that,
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:53.180]   you're gonna be approached by like three, again,
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:55.180]   got looking people say, "Hey, Scott,
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:56.660]   "we are not gonna press upon you,
[00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:58.620]   "how in good shape we all are."
[00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:00.460]   This is only worth about 10 minutes, Scott.
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:02.260]   - The vegan association of America
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:04.620]   is on line four for you, Scott.
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:05.940]   - Well, I didn't bring this up.
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:07.180]   - Oh yeah, Andy and I.
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:10.660]   - Andy and I come, only with the love.
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:11.500]   Let me just put it this way,
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:13.140]   if the four of us got an elevator,
[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:14.620]   one of us would have to get out.
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:15.940]   (laughs)
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:18.500]   - Ah, listen, I am president of the horizontal challenge
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:22.780]   to Mack Lumbers of America and a bunch of big,
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:26.140]   heavy sick guys here talking about how skinny jobs is.
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:27.340]   That can't be healthy.
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:28.180]   That can't be healthy.
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:29.820]   - Hey, listen, I had a tomato last week,
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:30.740]   I could be a vegan.
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:31.660]   - That can't be healthy.
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:33.340]   - There was a tomato on one of my cheeseburgers,
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:34.180]   I'm sure of it.
[00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:36.380]   - Now you're in trouble because of that E. Coli.
[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:37.980]   - Well, now I'm just back to my normal food,
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:39.460]   I don't have to be vegan anymore.
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:40.300]   (laughs)
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.020]   - There you go, maybe it was just a bad tomato.
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:43.100]   He got the E. Coli.
[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:44.740]   - He got the E. Coli.
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:46.700]   - Output has exceeded input for the past week
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:48.780]   and a half or per parole season, that's all it is.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.300]   (laughs)
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:51.340]   - It could very easily be,
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:52.860]   is on the mend, he's taking antibiotics,
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:53.940]   could actually be what it was.
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:56.700]   He ate two minutes, too many vegetables.
[00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:59.100]   So let's take a break before we get to our picks of the day.
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:00.860]   Actually, before we take a break,
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:02.020]   we didn't cover any other news.
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:03.300]   Of course, there are other news,
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:06.860]   but the big story has to be the 3G iPhone.
[00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:09.780]   Let's go around the table and just see
[00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:12.300]   which of you are going to pay good money for it.
[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:13.700]   And I'll start in saying,
[00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:15.580]   yeah, I'm gonna be in line July 11th.
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:17.340]   By the way, it's gonna be a long line
[00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:19.180]   'cause it takes an estimated 11 to 12 minutes
[00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:20.380]   to activate the darn thing.
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:23.180]   So either go early or come late.
[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:25.660]   And that's the second question.
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:28.220]   So question one, will you buy question two?
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:30.660]   Will there be sufficient supplies?
[00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:33.220]   Should I wait in line or can I go next day
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:34.420]   and get one?
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:36.540]   Andy, you probably get one in the mail, right?
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:38.460]   You won't have to buy it.
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:40.620]   Let's say you weren't gonna get a review unit.
[00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:43.660]   - If I weren't gonna get a review unit, my position,
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:47.260]   well, what's, well, I don't mean to be bragging or anything,
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:49.020]   but if I weren't gonna get a review unit,
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:52.100]   then if I weren't scheduled to finish a second edition
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:55.180]   of my iPhone fully loaded book in the next month.
[00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:57.900]   - On a normal circumstances,
[00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.500]   the fact that it has 3G,
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.980]   I would be willing to wait for 3G.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.820]   - Maybe it wouldn't be an immediate thing.
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:06.420]   The fact that it has GPS,
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.540]   that's another device that I would conceivably not have
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:10.740]   to carry around with me.
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.980]   And the number of times I've been in some sort of city
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:16.500]   needing a desperate answer to, where am I?
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:19.980]   That's better than you're vaguely in this eight block area
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:22.820]   judging from this Wi-Fi hotspot we found three years ago.
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.260]   That would be make it worth for me.
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:28.620]   I don't know that there's any product Apple could do
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:30.860]   that would be worth camping out an Apple store
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.660]   for eight or nine or 10 hours and then waiting
[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:34.460]   in a long line like that.
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.380]   Because I'm very sure that they're gonna have
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.540]   really good supply.
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:40.780]   If you don't get one on Friday night,
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.620]   you will be able to get one Monday or Tuesday.
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:44.420]   You might have to call a couple of different places
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:46.740]   before you get it, but I have no doubt in my mind
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.180]   that the first wave of people who want to get a 3G iPhone
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:50.460]   will be able to buy one.
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:51.300]   - Good news.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:54.380]   We know Scott's answer.
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.780]   Let's go to Alex Lindsay.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:56.620]   - Wait a minute.
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:58.580]   - All right, Scott, will you buy one?
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:00.380]   - No, I'll buy three 'cause that's the limit.
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:01.420]   - Yeah, and in fact, I--
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:03.380]   - And I won't stand the line, Greg will.
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.740]   - And bear.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:08.260]   And I had already put my order in with you,
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.860]   but I'll get in line 'cause I like the communal aspect
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:11.780]   of that.
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:12.620]   - Well, you didn't--
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:14.380]   - There won't be a line up there where you go, is there?
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:15.220]   - Oh, there was a line.
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:17.420]   I waited six hours in line for iPhone 1, yeah.
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:18.780]   It was fun.
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.620]   - Yeah, it's a fun community thing.
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:22.100]   - I would do it again, absolutely.
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:23.900]   - Just about getting the hardware then no.
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.340]   If it's a chance to spend six or seven hours,
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:29.460]   having fun and a little stock atmosphere with less nudity.
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:32.020]   I mean, it was fun watching these things
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.300]   'cause no matter what city it's in it,
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.620]   hey, there's Sean.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:35.620]   Hey, look, there's Bob.
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:36.460]   - Exactly.
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:37.460]   - Lisa King, I don't leave.
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.300]   Hey, Lisa.
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.500]   - I'm here in Petaluma and there's two guys from Google
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:42.340]   in the line with me.
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:43.580]   I guess they were just passing through.
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:44.980]   We had a nice conversation.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:46.980]   They were fans of the show and one of the guys
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.340]   had stayed up late last the night before
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:51.780]   getting Google Reader to look good on the iPhone.
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:53.620]   It's great, you meet the neatest people.
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:55.740]   I met a little kid who had saved his allowance
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:57.460]   and was, you know, he was like a ninth grader.
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.780]   He saved his allowance, was in line to buy the iPhone.
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:00.900]   It was really great.
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:03.780]   Like living in that sitcom planet where anytime
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:05.500]   there's a group of more than 11 people,
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:06.980]   inevitably there'll be two people there
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:08.180]   who happen to know each other.
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:09.020]   - Exactly.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:13.300]   - We live in the sitcom world, don't we, Andy and that guy?
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:14.780]   - So, Scott, you're gonna buy three
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:15.580]   and how about the lines?
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.060]   You think there will be lines?
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:18.660]   - I'm guessing at least in the big,
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.740]   like, you know, the big flagship store here
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:22.220]   in San Francisco, there probably will be.
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:24.940]   I would guess there probably won't be as lines
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:25.780]   at some of the other places.
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:28.500]   I know I'm not going to AT&T given how they handled it
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.580]   last time versus Apple.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.020]   Apple made this thing look like it was a dream.
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:35.900]   But I mean, the one thing I will say is I'm gonna buy them,
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:38.940]   but I'm gonna reserve judgment on how much I'll end up using it
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:42.420]   to see if it performs up to a spec and if it, you know,
[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:44.940]   if it actually lasts long enough with the battery
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:47.820]   and I'm keeping my iPhone one just as a backup.
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:49.660]   - And how about supply?
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:53.820]   - I think they'd be crazy not to have a whole bunch of them
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:56.220]   unless somebody in the marketing department said,
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.860]   yeah, it'd be a great idea if we sold out.
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:00.260]   Just you kind of build the buzz.
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:03.260]   I mean, that's what Harley Davidson does that all the time.
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:05.980]   That's why you pay more than retail for Harley Davidson motorcycle.
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:08.060]   They know how many they think they're gonna sell,
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:10.740]   they make 10% less and then they trickle in some,
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:12.500]   the end and you pay a lot of money.
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.540]   - Alex Lindsay, you got to buy one?
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.900]   - Yeah, I'm planning to stand in line with Greg
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.020]   for the last hour.
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.100]   (laughing)
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:22.340]   - Hey, if you only buy one,
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:23.180]   what about that?
[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:24.460]   - If you're only buying one, Alex,
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:27.140]   can you get one for me too and I'll pay you back?
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:28.780]   - Sure, all right.
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:31.300]   - But how can you activate it for him as well?
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.580]   - Oh, you're right, I have to come.
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:34.620]   'Cause it's gonna be my second AT&T line
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:36.900]   so I guess I have to go to AT&T and do it.
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.020]   - No, no, I'm definitely gonna get one.
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:41.900]   I mean, for me, the big thing, the 3G is great
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:43.740]   and it had to happen.
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:48.100]   But for me, I'm so excited to have a good GPS.
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.220]   I use, I travel a lot and it's--
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:52.900]   - You may not have a good GPS.
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:54.580]   You may not have turn by turn.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:57.140]   - No, I mean, I don't need turn by turn.
[01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:58.700]   I really, what I need is just a map.
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:03:59.860]   I need to-- - This is the thing
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:02.260]   are you gonna sell the Tom Tom?
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:04.140]   - Yeah, I mean, I have to admit nowadays
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.940]   that my older Tom Tom isn't,
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:07.380]   and maybe I just haven't updated it.
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:10.100]   It's not as good as what you get with the cars.
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:12.580]   You know, some of the new Garmin stuff that they ship
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:15.420]   that comes with like the Hertz or whatever
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:17.140]   is actually really good.
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:20.820]   And so I've been in the habit of just using the one
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:21.660]   that comes with the car.
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:22.860]   - I'm keeping my dash express,
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:25.940]   but I could see down the road
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:29.380]   some really slick kind of social location features
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:30.220]   built into this thing.
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.060]   And there's a lot of incentive.
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:33.980]   That's what Android's gonna have you know from Google.
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:37.060]   And location-based information is very powerful.
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:41.220]   - I think there's a huge market for location-based GPS.
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:44.780]   Where, what I mean, that's kind of--
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:47.780]   - It's all location-based.
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:50.620]   But I think that there's a huge market for building tours.
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.260]   You know, like I'm going on this tour in July
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:56.100]   with my dad and my son, my older son
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.260]   through Civil War battlefields.
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.060]   And it'd be great if you could design this thing
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:01.020]   where you could hear the stuff and you get there
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:01.940]   and tell us where to turn.
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.340]   And that's not gonna happen immediately.
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:05.780]   But I think that being able to download that from iTunes
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:07.660]   saying, you know, I wanna take the Route 66 tour,
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:09.060]   I wanna take the wine country tour,
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:10.300]   I wanna take the whatever.
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:14.420]   And it gives you, you know, it is GPS activated,
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:19.060]   you know, audio, both directions, but also context.
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:21.300]   I think it's gonna be a big, big deal.
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:22.140]   And I think that the only one
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:23.540]   that can make it really work is Apple
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:25.300]   because they're the only ones with all the pieces.
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.220]   - There's features in this dash express that I'm using.
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:30.300]   It's really, you know, social for instance.
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:34.420]   You, it will, it knows who else has a dash
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:36.460]   and it can tell you how long it's gonna take you
[01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:39.500]   to get from point A to point B based on other dash users.
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.100]   It gets traffic information that way.
[01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:42.620]   It's got a lot of social networking features.
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:43.460]   I think it really--
[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.660]   - It's like a little thrill when you're driving around
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:47.380]   and you go back like on that little stretch
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.700]   of like local highway that gets to your house
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:51.740]   and you see that one little dotted green line.
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.420]   So you know what, I left that green line.
[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:56.420]   The fact that I drive this route every single day
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.620]   means that that is my dotted green line
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:00.060]   that other dash users are relying on.
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:01.700]   - So you have a dash Andy?
[01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:03.340]   - No, I had, again, had one for about 10 days
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:04.900]   so I could test it out and send it back.
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:05.740]   I was done with it.
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:07.780]   I'm actually curious to see what this, you know,
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:10.300]   what this is gonna do to companies like Dash
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.940]   that now it makes sense for, Dash is really cool.
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:14.660]   If you have one in your car, after about a week,
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:16.300]   you realize how really great it is
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:19.300]   when you have an internet enabled car navigator.
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:22.500]   But now that will inspire the open source community
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:25.740]   to say, hey, let's create our own open source version of this.
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:26.980]   Let's create an open source.
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:29.220]   - Dash is based on open moku.
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:30.580]   Dash is open source.
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:31.420]   So--
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.260]   - Right.
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:33.620]   - But I'm interested to see what the closed source community,
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:35.660]   what, in other words, Apple does,
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.020]   looking at these features and saying,
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:38.580]   what can we do that's even better?
[01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:40.820]   And when you have, you know, the problem with Dash is
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:42.020]   there are only a few people have it
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:44.860]   with when you have several million people with iPhones,
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:47.380]   that information is gonna become very rich.
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:49.740]   I'm very excited.
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:52.620]   And you think that they'll be an open source GPS?
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:55.580]   - No, not GPS, but I'm saying this idea that now you're
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:57.660]   gonna have these Google devices that are--
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:58.500]   - Right.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.180]   - That are easy to program and have GPS.
[01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:02.180]   Now you're gonna have iPhones that add,
[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:04.140]   not only add to that, but also add to that,
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:06.860]   the really good GPS form factor,
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:09.380]   that it's not just this tiny little phone screen.
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:11.140]   It actually looks like what you would buy
[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:12.660]   from Garmin or TomTom.
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:14.540]   I think that we're not too far away from,
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:17.420]   it's such an obviously good idea to have an open,
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:20.420]   basically a free open pool of traffic information
[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:21.980]   and advisory information.
[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:23.740]   I mean, Dash does a lot of good things,
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.260]   but he can't do something like saying,
[01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:28.740]   oh, I just passed by a speed trap here in 995,
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.980]   just be able to simply, without even looking at the dash,
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:33.060]   express, just tap a button and just register that
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:34.660]   as a speed trap for other people to know about.
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:36.700]   - Dash does, I mean, Dash has just added that feature,
[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:37.540]   by the way, speed traps.
[01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:39.180]   - Oh, okay, cool.
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.620]   But that's something you can subscribe to
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:42.180]   as opposed to something that, okay,
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:43.500]   we're gonna have to drop a topic.
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.180]   But it seems like an obvious thing for someone
[01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:46.780]   for an open source project.
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:47.780]   - Oh, yeah, I agree.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:50.340]   - And I'm just, how the shapes up.
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:53.820]   - Putting GPS in everything is gonna be really empowering.
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.140]   - Well, actually, actually, that's, I'm sorry,
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:56.620]   that was actually the point I wanted to make,
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.660]   that you're not paying really,
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:00.700]   you're absolutely not paying extra for this feature
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.300]   in the iPhone, you're already getting $100 price cut off
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.900]   of what you would have bought,
[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:07.660]   a $100, $200 price cut after what you would have bought
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:08.540]   last year.
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:11.220]   And right now, you are essentially getting free GPS
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:12.540]   in the iPhone, and for that,
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:15.100]   and given that we also happen to know that,
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.820]   excuse me, at this early stage,
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:19.260]   we know that the GPS is very, very conservative
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:20.900]   in how it uses the battery.
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:22.060]   I mean, if we talk to developers
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:23.500]   and you look at the developer's specs,
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.900]   it's actually very sophisticated.
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:28.300]   A developer can say, I need to know where this phone is,
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:30.620]   but I don't need to know within a few feet,
[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:32.820]   so don't fire up the GPS if you don't have to.
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:35.540]   It can, they always can figure out what solution it needs
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:38.420]   to employ in order to get the location information.
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:41.180]   And it only fires up the GPS if it absolutely has to.
[01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:43.740]   So maybe it won't be a real battery drain.
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:44.580]   - Well, I also get it.
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:45.620]   - It might be completely free.
[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.740]   - I think this hybrid model also provides the opportunity
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:52.820]   of what we used to call on set at LPS local positioning,
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:54.740]   which is that you could theoretically have
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:57.980]   a couple different Wi-Fi accounts
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:59.860]   and the phone could switch back and forth.
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:00.860]   And the reason that that's important
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:03.500]   is because the accuracy could be pinpoint
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:06.140]   if you have pieces up, so if you're a museum
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:07.580]   that wants to give tours.
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:12.260]   Or whatever, and you could be using the same type of software
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:13.940]   to tighten that a lot.
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:16.820]   - So we'll see Alex, if it'll have the kind of features
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:18.060]   you want, but I think down the road,
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.540]   that certainly is selling point.
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:22.300]   - I definitely don't think it's gonna have a day one.
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.500]   I just, I think that the trajectory is pretty exciting.
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.740]   - Yeah, for me, the selling point's mobile me.
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:30.300]   I mean, just to me, the killer app has always been sinking.
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:33.620]   That's what, to me, made the palm a success
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:35.500]   with a Scion wasn't.
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.820]   It's why I use a BlackBerry now.
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:39.660]   And one of the reasons why I use a BlackBerry,
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:42.540]   so the iPhone, I think that mobile me, in a way,
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:43.380]   is a selling point.
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:46.020]   I hope there are plenty of phones in stock
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:48.100]   because I'm not gonna wait, maybe I will wait in line.
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.900]   I did have fun, but it was kind of embarrassing
[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:53.020]   after waiting line for iPhone one to find out
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.980]   that a couple of guys just walked in an hour later
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:57.220]   and picked one up.
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:59.780]   - Yeah, but then you would have missed your community.
[01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:00.620]   (laughing)
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:01.700]   - Yeah, I got enough of that.
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.060]   Maybe I'll just walk in later.
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:04.180]   (laughing)
[01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:05.020]   All right, we're gonna take a break.
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:07.180]   Ready with your picks, boys and girls?
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:09.300]   There are no girls, but if there were girls,
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:11.380]   boys and girls, but first it's time to talk about
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:14.660]   our great sponsor, Audible.com.
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:17.180]   I don't have to tell you what a great place Audible.com
[01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:18.020]   is.
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.940]   It's a place I go to get my audio books.
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:21.300]   I love 'em.
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.980]   I've listened to hundreds of audio books at Audible.com.
[01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:27.780]   In fact, I took all of the books I've listened to,
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:30.300]   put 'em on an iPod with Audible's permission
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:31.540]   and gave 'em to Ros Savage.
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:32.700]   She's rowing across the Pacific,
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:34.620]   and she's already halfway through all the books.
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:35.740]   She's gonna be 10 years to read.
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:37.060]   It's really depressing.
[01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:37.900]   It's a great way.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.220]   If you're stuck rowing across the Pacific
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:42.180]   or in your car on a long commute,
[01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:44.860]   Audible makes that time well spent
[01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:46.420]   by giving you a chance to catch up on books
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:47.500]   you've always wanted to read,
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:49.540]   read new books that everybody's talking about,
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:50.940]   and not just books.
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:53.300]   I mean, you can also listen to podcasts.
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:56.140]   There's a variety of programming, old radio shows.
[01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:57.100]   It's just a wonderful thing.
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:58.500]   All right, show of hands here.
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.140]   Who has an Audible pick this weekend?
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:01.540]   Do you have one?
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:02.540]   - Yes, I do.
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:04.140]   This is actually a book that I started reading
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.860]   a few weeks ago and was delighted to find
[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:08.900]   that it is available, unabridged on Audible.
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:11.020]   It's one of those, it's an on fiction book,
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:14.020]   and it's one of those ideas that you listen to.
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.420]   You hear the concept and you just find yourself,
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:18.260]   I gotta track down this book.
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:22.060]   It's a book called The Places In Between by Rory Stewart.
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:27.060]   He, in 2001, he decided to walk across
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:29.980]   Iran, Pakistan, India, and Nepal.
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:31.420]   - Wow. - On foot.
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.860]   He had some diplomatic experience.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:36.780]   He had a lot of experience in ground.
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:38.740]   So it's not like he was just some college kid
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:39.780]   just doing stupid things.
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:42.100]   He was a traveler and he really wanted to know more
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:43.060]   about the area.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:46.060]   And of course, when it came time to cross Afghanistan,
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.500]   controlled by the Taliban, that was the one stretch
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:49.540]   that he was not able to walk.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:52.660]   His passport was yanked, Elvis paperwork
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:53.860]   just would not work out.
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:57.020]   And so after the Taliban fell, he decided to go back
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:58.860]   and complete that section of the walk.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.860]   And this story is the story of him
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:04.060]   walking across Afghanistan immediately after
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.100]   it had been freed by the Taliban.
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:08.060]   And yes, he works.
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:11.460]   He can be, there are lots of stories of being met
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:14.700]   at a hotel by people who are clearly former secret police
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.740]   who want to advise him, quote unquote,
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.380]   on the best place to proceed.
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:21.300]   But mostly it's a question of him just at ground level,
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:24.100]   at walking pace, going through Valley after Valley,
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.540]   village after village, meeting local people
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.140]   who are willing to tell them their experiences
[01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:30.500]   and guide him through various places.
[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:33.900]   It is definitely the most granular story
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:37.940]   about what happened in Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:39.860]   than you ever, you'll ever encounter.
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:43.100]   And it's just one of those great stories.
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:44.380]   - He reads it himself and it's by,
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:46.940]   it's the original provider's recorded books.
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:49.140]   One of the things that I like about Audible,
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:51.220]   I'm a big fan of recorded books.
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:53.260]   They're the books, they're a book on tape company.
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:55.020]   And they always had the best readers.
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:57.820]   Audible now is stocking up on books
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.500]   from other recorded book companies,
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:02.340]   micro-recorded books, Blackstone audio, books on tape.
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:04.740]   And so you really get the best.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.500]   This is unabridged, red by Rory.
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.020]   He sounds like a great book Andy.
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:10.780]   I'm gonna put this on my list right away.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:11.740]   And that's our Audible pick.
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:14.020]   Now here's how you can get it for free.
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:17.180]   All you gotta do is go to audible.com/macbreak
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:18.420]   just that simple.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:21.060]   And you can sign up today if you're not an Audible member.
[01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:23.860]   If you are in the US, chances are good.
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:25.540]   In some other countries you'll probably be able to do this
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:26.780]   as well, but certainly in the US
[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:28.860]   you go to audible.com/macbreak, sign up,
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:30.860]   you get a credit, a tour to a free book,
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:32.460]   and this can be your book.
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.500]   For Rory Stewart, the places in between
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:35.660]   are Audible pick of the week.
[01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:36.860]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:39.540]   And we thank Audible for one year now.
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.060]   They've been with us one year of great,
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:43.740]   a great relationship with a great company.
[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:45.580]   I'm actually flying out to Newark
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:48.420]   to meet with them in a couple of weeks.
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:50.020]   So I'll give you a report June 23rd.
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:51.740]   I'm gonna be in Newark.
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:53.340]   Just to see the, I just wanted to see it.
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:54.780]   I wanted to talk to the guys in Doncats.
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:56.100]   I know the president of Audible,
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:57.860]   but to meet some of the other guys.
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:59.620]   And I'm just so grateful for what they've done for us.
[01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:02.020]   Audible.com/macbreak,
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:04.420]   you could show your gratitude by signing up.
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:07.340]   Today, all right, time ladies and gentlemen,
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:11.140]   for our Mac break pickers of the week.
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:13.900]   Let's start with the kind of the king of the picks,
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:17.700]   because we in fact use a price unit based on his picks.
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:18.700]   (laughing)
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:21.380]   You know who I'm talking about, Mr. Alex Lindsey
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:22.500]   of the Pixel Core.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.100]   What's your pick this week, Alex?
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:26.260]   So I am going to, there's been an update
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:28.580]   to one of my favorite little apps.
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:30.100]   And so I'm gonna recommend it.
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:32.340]   Have you guys used iStat menu?
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:33.340]   Yes, Alex.
[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:34.340]   Yes.
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:35.180]   So there's a new version.
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:37.180]   It doesn't really, I don't even know what it added,
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.020]   but I updated it very quickly.
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:41.420]   They've been keeping it up to date, which is really nice.
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:42.620]   They have to do a lot, don't they?
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:43.620]   Yeah.
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:44.980]   Yeah, so, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:50.140]   It's 1.3 and it just got released last week.
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:54.380]   And there is a lot of new little things,
[01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:58.620]   calendars, interface update, some extras.
[01:14:58.620 --> 01:14:59.940]   So it's worth it.
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:01.780]   I mean, I think it's free, isn't the menu.
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:02.940]   It's worth it free.
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:04.540]   Yes, it's zero, Alex's.
[01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:06.260]   Here's the thing is is that I feel,
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:08.500]   I have to admit that I feel a little naked
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.460]   using a machine that doesn't have it,
[01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:12.700]   because I look up there all the time to see
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:15.060]   if something magically is pegging my CPU,
[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:17.820]   how, you know, what kind of, especially,
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:18.860]   there is a network.
[01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:21.820]   So it's telling me how much data is going up and down.
[01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:23.380]   So I know if something's downloading something
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:27.020]   really quickly or if I'm in a slow network or a fast network,
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:30.380]   you know, getting all of those things is really useful.
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:35.060]   And every computer that I use has the I-STAT menu installed.
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:37.860]   And I'd highly, highly suggest it.
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:40.380]   So anyway, that's my pick for the week.
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:43.260]   I agree, I-STAT menus.
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:45.980]   And then there's an application you could use as well.
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:49.300]   The big one, the big brother is I-STAT.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:50.300]   Pro, I guess.
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:52.020]   Oh, yeah, I-STAT Pro is what I use.
[01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:53.660]   Is that free as well?
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:54.500]   It is.
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:55.340]   I don't know.
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:56.180]   It is.
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:59.140]   They ask for a donation, but they don't require it.
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:15:59.980]   Yeah, and it's-
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:00.820]   I agree with it.
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:02.020]   That's a great program.
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:03.460]   Thank you, Alex Lindsay.
[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:05.900]   Now it is time for another pick, Mr. Scott Bourne.
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:07.220]   What have you got for us?
[01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:09.100]   Another zero-alix pick, actually.
[01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:09.940]   Loving it.
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:10.780]   Whoa!
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:12.020]   (laughing)
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:12.940]   How about this?
[01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:13.780]   Yes.
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:15.980]   I'm sure everybody else but me knows about this,
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:18.940]   'cause that's sort of the way the timeline works in my life.
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:20.980]   Everyone says, "Oh yeah, I've been using that for three years,
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:24.300]   but I just found this website called Awesome Highlighter."
[01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:25.900]   I don't know it.
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:29.860]   Oh my God, it is so cool.
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:33.820]   You just go to their website and you type in a URL.
[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:34.660]   Oh yeah, I see it.
[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:36.980]   And then you go to that URL and you select some text
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:38.900]   and you hit a button and it gives you a URL
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:40.620]   that is the text you selected.
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.900]   Wow, how does it do it?
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:44.820]   I don't know, it's a secret.
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:46.420]   And it's free.
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:47.420]   It really works.
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:48.940]   How do I know?
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:50.420]   And here's the thing that's cool is like, you know,
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:52.180]   when it sends somebody an email, it's like,
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:54.780]   here's this long-ass story on the New York Times
[01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:57.220]   or the LA Times or wherever,
[01:16:57.220 --> 01:17:00.100]   instead of having to, you know, it's on page three,
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:02.820]   about halfway down kind of thing, you just use this deal.
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:05.700]   And so you can send them a link
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:07.780]   and then they see what you highlighted.
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.500]   Yeah, you try it out, it's free.
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:12.300]   It says, "Insert a web address or just try it."
[01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:14.540]   There's also Firefox add-on and Bookmarklets
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:16.700]   so you don't even have to go to the web page.
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:17.540]   Yeah, that's correct.
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:18.380]   I like that.
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:19.780]   It's zero, Alexes.
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:22.820]   It's one of those things where I'm like, okay, you know,
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:25.780]   me and my first thought is, what's the business model?
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:27.060]   But--
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:29.260]   You know, if you're asking that about what 2.0 sites
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:31.180]   you're gonna be waiting a long time for the answer.
[01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:35.340]   None of these guys have any business model at all.
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:37.740]   Do they eat?
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:39.500]   Do they need a place to live?
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.420]   You know, this one is probably fairly inexpensive
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:45.540]   but there's some that use huge amounts of bandwidth.
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:46.820]   And I just don't understand how they hope
[01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:47.740]   to make money out of it.
[01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:51.340]   I mean, I'm looking at things like, what is that?
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:52.340]   What is that great?
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:59.460]   From the guys who do comic book maker, Plask, stick it?
[01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:03.580]   What is that little stick 'em?
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:05.940]   Not stick 'em, that's what we're using for the video.
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:09.300]   They, you know, the little heart, come on guys.
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.980]   Come on.
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:12.980]   Things are yellow, things you know of it,
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:13.820]   I'll prayer my say.
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.300]   (laughing)
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:17.500]   You know what I'm talking about?
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:18.940]   Oh, for 200.
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:22.300]   The chat room, come on, chat room, chat room.
[01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:24.780]   No, nothing, I must be, it mustn't be giving you very,
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:26.460]   Skitch, thank you.
[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:28.300]   About 80 people in the stick 'em chat room saying,
[01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:31.820]   "Skitch, so Skitch is free, it's got storage,
[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:33.340]   it's got uploads, it's drawing program,
[01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:35.740]   I don't understand how Plask makes money.
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:37.260]   They're giving this thing away.
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:40.500]   Ever underestimate the power of two or three 23 year olds
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:41.820]   who are living in one apartment
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:43.460]   so far support themselves on Raman noodles.
[01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:44.460]   I think that's it, Skitch.
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:47.220]   I do wanna note, I do wanna note there's a particular
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:50.340]   connection to Mac break weekly from the awesome highlighter.
[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:51.180]   Oh yes, and what is that?
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:54.940]   You'll note, you'll note the heavy use of the color yellow.
[01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:55.780]   Yes.
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:59.140]   Hence a direct connection to the yellow submarine iPod.
[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:00.820]   (laughing)
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:01.900]   Okay, that's a stretch.
[01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:03.620]   (laughing)
[01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:05.380]   Well, that was actually Shash's idea,
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:06.340]   but I thought it was cute.
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:07.420]   Hey, I'm gonna mention a site,
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:08.940]   as long as you're doing a site, Scott Bourne,
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:10.100]   I'm gonna do a site too.
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:13.060]   This is a site that I found on the Twitter.
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:14.380]   The Twitter is so great.
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:18.020]   The Twitter is a good way to find out about Web 2.0
[01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:19.740]   'cause it's all these Web 2.0 types.
[01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:25.660]   And I think this comes to me from Factory Joe on Twitter.
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:29.580]   'Cause Joe Messina, he was one of the guys
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:32.540]   who started Flock, he's a really good Web 2.0 guy.
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:35.660]   280slides.com.
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:38.660]   Here's another site where you go,
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:41.580]   okay guys, please explain to me what's the business model?
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:44.020]   Although I guess the business model could be,
[01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:46.580]   give you a pro version,
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:51.140]   but right now it's free, go to 280slides.com.
[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:54.940]   And it will load this incredibly age-axi page
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:58.940]   that is basically keynote for free.
[01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:01.060]   You can make presentations,
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:03.260]   you can give presentations,
[01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:06.820]   you can share presentations online.
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:08.860]   Just go to 280slides.com and click the log in
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:10.300]   and you'll see what I'm talking about.
[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:12.580]   This thing is kind of hard to believe.
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:15.340]   I don't know how they do this stuff on the Web.
[01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:18.620]   You've got a lot of different fonts that you can use.
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:21.020]   You've got a bunch of themes you can choose from
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:25.340]   and the whole thing is for free.
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:29.220]   So that's my pick just because software doesn't have
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.580]   to sit on your computer anymore.
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:34.140]   You can, more and more,
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:38.660]   we're seeing people able to do this stuff online.
[01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:41.420]   280slides.com.
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:45.060]   Just, this is again, just like what you said, Scott,
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:46.980]   this is, you know, you wonder how do these guys
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:48.380]   intend to make a living out of this?
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:50.380]   Although I could see you charging for a business version
[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:51.380]   of this very easily.
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:55.980]   - Well, you know, I'm old and I actually have to pay rent
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:57.420]   and stuff, so I don't know.
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:59.020]   Maybe if you're young, you don't need to.
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.620]   - Yeah, you might have it right there, yeah.
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:04.580]   All right, I guess there's only one person left
[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:07.100]   that's the fabulous, the lovely, the talented vegan,
[01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:08.460]   Andy Inatko.
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:10.780]   (laughing)
[01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:13.900]   - I see, I, if all the vegans were kind enough
[01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:17.180]   to like release all these carbon units back into the air,
[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:18.700]   I'm willing to restore the balance.
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:21.620]   I, well, I'll have all of the scrambled eggs
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:24.580]   with sausage and leftover kiln bossy
[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:28.300]   just to make sure that the zero sum of, you know,
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.380]   equation remains constant.
[01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:32.460]   - Keeping the carbon balance for us all,
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.860]   Mr. Andy Inatko.
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:34.700]   - Exactly.
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:38.100]   - I came across this really great utility.
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:41.460]   Where's this, is this like our first like all free,
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.620]   - It would be, it would be if yours is free,
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:45.100]   you're, you gotta keep it going.
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.540]   - Another pressure's on you, Andy.
[01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:51.220]   - Another, well, well, if you want to send me 10 bucks,
[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:53.020]   'cause it's a really great trick.
[01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:54.380]   - No, no, no.
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:56.500]   - I'm freelance journalist in a collapsing market.
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.300]   (laughing)
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:01.060]   Anyway, now I did not set this up
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:02.340]   for the purpose of good demonstration.
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:04.020]   It just so happens that Safari decided
[01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:06.580]   to act all petulant on me right now.
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:09.340]   I've got like about 20, 30, 40 windows open
[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:11.540]   and I have like one of my other picks like,
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:14.260]   what, what, what, I have this pick in one window there.
[01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:16.100]   I had my audible pick in another window there.
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:19.700]   But something, it decided that it's life is way, way too hard.
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:21.140]   It cannot deal with reality.
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:23.380]   And so I can't really tap between windows,
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:26.140]   which only goes to demonstrate why this utility
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:28.780]   called Fluid is so wonderful.
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:32.020]   Fluid is a very, very simple free application.
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:33.580]   You download it from Fluid app.
[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:35.180]   - Fluid, yeah, baby.
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:36.620]   - You've downloaded and I'll,
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:39.020]   it just gives you a little dialog box.
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:39.860]   (coughing)
[01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:42.140]   Excuse me, asking you for URL.
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:44.180]   So I type in a URL for Google Reader
[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:46.180]   and it will create an application
[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:48.380]   that creates a site specific browser
[01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:50.100]   just for Google Reader.
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:52.500]   It's an application with every single bell and whistle
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:55.180]   that a regular Mac application has.
[01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:57.380]   And only it's just a, I get a nice plain window
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:59.900]   that has the Google Reader application inside it.
[01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:01.740]   And every time that I'm in Google Reader
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:03.540]   and I click a link that would take me outside
[01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:04.740]   and it doesn't open a new window,
[01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:06.100]   it simply goes back to Safari,
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:07.580]   whatever my default browser is,
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:09.180]   and opens that in another window.
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:11.940]   And so what that means is that now,
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:13.900]   if, imagine this is my mail application
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:15.540]   or imagine that it's another application
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:17.180]   that I need, web application that I need
[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:18.740]   to have access to all the time,
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:21.860]   the fact that another website is screwing up Safari
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:25.100]   will not remove my access to Google Mail or Google Reader.
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:27.620]   So the other way around, oftentimes you get
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:29.460]   those really awful dialog box like,
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.500]   a script on this web page is causing,
[01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:33.180]   you know, this causing Safari to run slowly.
[01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:35.380]   You likely to terminate that and it's always Google Reader.
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:38.180]   Now Google Reader will not impact the performance
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.100]   of the rest of your Safari experience.
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:43.420]   You can, you know, it's an application
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:46.420]   so it'll be in your dock, it'll have a dock badge,
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:47.980]   it'll have dock notifications.
[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:51.580]   You can also have also really slick little tricks
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:53.900]   built into it so that you can actually make it
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:56.140]   into a menu blit so that anytime you want to click
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:59.340]   into your mail, you can simply click on this menu bar icon
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:00.740]   next to your next to your power reading
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:02.700]   or next to your clock and it'll open up
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:03.940]   your Google Mail.
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:06.260]   It'll even do cool things like if you've,
[01:24:06.260 --> 01:24:09.260]   if you're using it as a site specific browser
[01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:11.140]   for like dig.com or delicious,
[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:15.380]   it does this really slick trick.
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:16.420]   There's actually a picture of it,
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:19.740]   there's a screencast of it on the Fluid app web page
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:22.900]   where it can actually create a cover flow like preview
[01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:25.020]   of all the links that lead off of the page
[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:26.340]   you're looking at right now.
[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:27.740]   So you can actually use it to,
[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:29.820]   well what's happening on dig.com right now?
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:30.860]   You can just go flip, flip, flip,
[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:32.460]   ooh, that looks interesting, click on that
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:34.540]   and suddenly you're taking to that page in Safari.
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:37.820]   But really the killer app is just the ability to create
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:40.180]   an application that does nothing but Google Reader,
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:43.060]   it does nothing but Twitter, it does nothing but these tools
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:46.220]   that you would or narrowly use as a standalone application
[01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:47.740]   but they happen to be web pages.
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:50.700]   It's slick, it's simple, it's efficient, it's free,
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:51.860]   you should download it.
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:54.900]   I use it with Google Calendar 'cause then it's Google Calendar
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:58.340]   kind of is like iCal and I use it with Remember the Milk,
[01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:00.140]   my to-do list and it really, it does,
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:02.340]   it turns a web page into a desktop app
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:03.900]   which is very cool.
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:07.060]   By the way, Cracker Grease points out in the stick amp
[01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:11.260]   chatroom that Safari developer for has this built into it.
[01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:13.460]   This is something they're gonna add to Safari.
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:15.900]   But for now, if you're using Safari three earlier,
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:17.420]   this is a really good, and it's,
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:19.780]   what it underscores is how Smart Apple was
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:21.300]   making exposing WebKit.
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:23.660]   So it's very easy to write applications like this.
[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:24.940]   Yeah, it's a really good idea.
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:28.020]   FluidApp.com, yes ladies and gentlemen,
[01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:32.780]   for the first time ever, every single pick in our arsenal
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:34.780]   was absolutely free.
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:37.660]   Amazing, amazing.
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:40.220]   Yes, we did it.
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:42.060]   They said it couldn't be done.
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:44.060]   This is the show that costs you nothing.
[01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:48.940]   Hey, I wanna give a little shout out to Viro.
[01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:51.140]   Remember Andy that that was the way we were able to,
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:53.580]   at least until he got caught. (laughs)
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:55.780]   Watch the keynote on Monday.
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:59.860]   I found out who Viro is, and he's an old friend.
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:02.940]   Richard Zamora is a journalist.
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:05.220]   He writes for Rolling Stone, Mexico,
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:09.180]   Richard Zamora Lopez, and that's why he was speaking in Spanish.
[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:12.100]   Apple, he said, "Apple politely came over and said,
[01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:13.740]   "turn off your camera."
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:16.580]   So he did what any good journalist would do.
[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:20.100]   He taped the light, put a piece of tape over the light
[01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:23.060]   so they wouldn't know the camera was on and continued.
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:25.220]   I don't know why it stopped, but he,
[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:26.060]   that was really great.
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:26.900]   We really appreciate it.
[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:31.180]   So Ricardo Zamora Lopez of the Rolling Stone, Mexico,
[01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:34.260]   thank you for giving us a window into Steve's keynote.
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:37.420]   And yes, it does confirm that Apple was actively going
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:40.140]   around turning people's cameras in.
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:41.540]   They do that every time.
[01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:42.380]   Yeah.
[01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:43.940]   You can't stop it though.
[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:45.620]   I mean, how would you be able to stop it?
[01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:47.460]   You can't tell if somebody's just got his laptop open
[01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:49.060]   and streaming audio.
[01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:50.420]   I kinda wonder why they even bother.
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:53.460]   I mean, I can see why they don't want to have their own
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:56.500]   bandwidth get clobbered by everyone going to QuickTime.com
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:58.700]   at once, but if someone wants to screw up their own
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:01.180]   connections, you know, why bother?
[01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:04.500]   And I think I was talking, we were talking here
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:09.500]   and just Dean Esaric and Craig Siversen were sitting here
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:12.100]   and we were listening to a feed.
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:13.460]   You know, somebody's laptop was open
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:14.300]   and we were listening to that.
[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:19.300]   And we agreed, we'd pay $10 or $10 to just get a good feed.
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:24.060]   You know, you just get, you know, somebody to do it
[01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:25.500]   and let people subscribe to it.
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.420]   And you can, I bet you get 50 to 100,000 people
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:29.220]   that would just sit there and pay their 10 bucks
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:30.220]   so they can watch the thing.
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:32.460]   I'm just baffled that Apple doesn't broadcast it to begin
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:34.900]   with is clearly a desire to man for it.
[01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:35.900]   Well, there's a big expense to it.
[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:37.500]   I mean, to do it for free, but I'm just saying
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.220]   if you charge 10 bucks for it, it's probably not constant.
[01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:43.980]   You know, if they use stick AM, they could do it for free.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:45.740]   They're probably being lobbied by the airlines
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:47.260]   not to do it.
[01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:48.900]   Oh, maybe.
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:51.340]   Well, everyone is saying we lose too many passengers
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:52.500]   and people fly out.
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.140]   Yeah.
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:56.540]   That's actually an interesting idea.
[01:27:56.540 --> 01:28:00.340]   Anyway, thank you everybody for being here.
[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:01.740]   We really appreciate it.
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:04.700]   Thank you, Andy, for joining me on Monday for our live coverage
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.580]   and to John Moltz.
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:08.020]   And I'm sorry, Alex, we didn't get to you.
[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:08.900]   I just didn't see on Skype.
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:10.180]   I don't know if it was you were invisible
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:12.020]   or you didn't launch Skype 'cause--
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:14.740]   You know what, we came up and then it sounded like
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:17.340]   there was a conflict with who could be on when.
[01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:18.420]   No, no, I was looking for you.
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:19.260]   I kept looking for you.
[01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:20.580]   No, it was just my misunderstanding.
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:23.060]   I don't live on Skype or I chat very often.
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:24.980]   So it's just like come up and look around and then I--
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:27.340]   Yeah, I apologize 'cause Chris Breen, Justine, you,
[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:28.180]   we're all sitting around.
[01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:30.180]   We would love to have got you on.
[01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:31.020]   You had a good lunch.
[01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:32.340]   Good.
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:34.060]   And next time we'll do it.
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:36.180]   This is something, you know, we got 10,000 viewers.
[01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:37.620]   It's something we're gonna do from now on.
[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:40.380]   Any time there's a keynote, it saves me having to go down
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:42.260]   to San Francisco or to Cupertino.
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:45.340]   I just sit here on my butt and let you guys do the work.
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:47.100]   But it was a lot of fun covering it.
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:51.100]   We did have some audio difficulties, you know,
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:53.100]   kind of trying to get these streams and feeds going.
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:54.580]   We'll work those out.
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:55.420]   But it worked very well.
[01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:58.220]   I'm gonna bring a vegan pizza to your house next time.
[01:28:58.220 --> 01:28:59.100]   Would you just come up?
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:28:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:00.780]   From now on, you all just come up here.
[01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:01.780]   We'll just come in.
[01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:02.980]   And we'll just all sit and talk.
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:04.380]   And it really is, it's kind of, you know,
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:06.980]   meta coverage like Comedy Central covering the elections
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:11.820]   by watching CNN, or Mystery Science Theater 3000.
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:14.700]   In fact, next time if Apple ever does broadcast the keynote,
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:16.420]   I'll just put little silhouettes of us.
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:18.780]   We'll be the fat ones in the front row just going,
[01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:20.340]   "Yeah, Steve, he looks kind of skinny.
[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:21.580]   That can't be healthy.
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:22.620]   That can't be good.
[01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:24.500]   He's not eating enough meat."
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:25.340]   It'll be--
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:26.180]   Other ice?
[01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:27.020]   No, it's climate change, man.
[01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:28.460]   Another ice age is coming.
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:29.820]   It'll be fun.
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:30.980]   It'll be fun, I think.
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:32.340]   We'll have a good time.
[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:34.380]   Thank you for all of you who watched it.
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:36.620]   Our peak was 10,000 before the--
[01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:39.580]   inadvertently, I turned off the server.
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:43.100]   That was not stick games going down.
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:44.300]   This did by Matt.
[01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:49.500]   It was just a little problem we had with the server URL changing.
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:51.780]   But-- and we kept it running, by the way,
[01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:54.940]   for rerunning for about 24 hours afterwards.
[01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:57.220]   So all in all, I think several hundred thousand people
[01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:58.020]   watched that coverage.
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:29:59.980]   So that was pretty exciting.
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:02.500]   If you do like Mac Break Weekly, you want to watch us do it live.
[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:06.620]   We do it live at 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time,

[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:26.380]   I figure now Kevin Rose is going to beat me on Twitter
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:28.900]   any minute now, so might as well have another account
[01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:30.660]   that I can try to beat him with.
[01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:31.980]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:35.180]   You may now-- P. Mac Break is officially broken.
