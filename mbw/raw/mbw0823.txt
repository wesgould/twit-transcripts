[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.160]   Renee Richie has rebooted everything.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.520]   That's a good epitaph.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.600]   I started with Earth.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.040]   Then I did the moon.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.680]   I've been rebooting cosmology as I go along, Leo.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.000]   To starting fresh, everyone deserves it.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.160]   I hope it all works well.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.800]   Renee is at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.440]   And you are working hard to make yourself a successful YouTube host.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.400]   But you are.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.960]   I'm trying picking up all the lessons that you can teach me, Leo.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.400]   I've been studying for years.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.040]   Well, I saw your tweet thread about, I guess you tweeted.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.360]   There's an Indian YouTuber who has 22 million subscribers
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.360]   who's declining rapidly.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.560]   And it really just shows.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.200]   You can't stop working, Renee.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.840]   You just can't.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.480]   No, no, but also you've done this for years.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.720]   He built a lot of his audience based on constant giveaways.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.280]   So the audience was there for giveaways and not for him.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.720]   And that's very hard to sustain.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.760]   I have always abjured giveaways.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.440]   And then people come to us all the time saying,
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.320]   "Well, you do giveaways."
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.760]   And I say, "That's called free ads and we don't do it."
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.200]   Yes.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.640]   But also I don't want to buy the audience.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.520]   Hey, I hear a little shorter.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.640]   It must be the Cheeseball powered Andy Ennaco from WG.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.000]   V-H, you're Boston.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.960]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.440]   How are you?
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.240]   Hello.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.160]   I'm doing just spiffy.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.280]   And Renee, that is a really good suggestion.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.360]   Like maybe God forbid that we lose you on this earthly plane
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.240]   before YouTube becomes a forgettable thing.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.680]   But I think it'd be really, really awesome.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.200]   If like, you know that message that sort of flashes on the stream
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.680]   like when it says that experiencing interruptions,
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.960]   here's reasons why.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.640]   That would be a perfect thing for it.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.280]   And then have like a little button that just basically never moves
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.640]   on your own head.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.160]   Dead, experiencing interruptions because dead.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.320]   Went 404 on the life server.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.120]   The ED dead.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.680]   Also, of course, from officehours.global and oh nine oh nine oh
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.480]   dot media, the inimitable Alex, Lindsay.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.920]   Good to see you Alex.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.560]   Good to be here.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.360]   I was thinking I was thinking that you know reboot could be the new word for reincarnation.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.800]   Yeah, I'm rebooting.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.520]   Oh nice.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.720]   Like reboot.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.000]   Alex, stay inside today.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.520]   It's going to be 38 degrees and the sun is shining.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.760]   I don't know what that means.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.240]   Oh, that's right.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.760]   We're imperialist here.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.040]   It's 101 degrees is our expected high today.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.560]   Did you see that thing yesterday that meme yesterday Leo where this I think
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.720]   she was a newscaster in France and she wanted to scare people
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.200]   by showing them what the 2050 weather would be like.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.040]   And this was back in 2015.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.600]   And everyone was was a gas by how hot it was going to get.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.200]   And that turns out to be the weather yesterday.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.560]   Yeah, it's not 20 surprise surprise surprise.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.920]   We're hot, man.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.400]   Handy.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.560]   I just want to show you something.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:32.120]   These are snack clips, aka conjoined chopsticks, designed.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.280]   Remember last week Andy was using regular everyday chopsticks
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.600]   to eat his planters cheese balls and cheese.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.360]   That stack of cheddar.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.320]   But these look they go on your fingers like this so that you can
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.360]   continue to type.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.960]   I don't think and.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.720]   Oh, I guess I need you to look Leo.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.400]   How much like Wolverine do you want Andy to look?
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.960]   I mean, really.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.800]   Yeah, it's top seven in the closet.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.320]   Planters cheese balls.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.280]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.160]   I'm not saving this lid.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.840]   It's going, man.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.480]   It's going.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.160]   Watch this.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.800]   Watch this.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.680]   Oh my god.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.800]   Cheesy ball goodness.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.920]   Clean fingers.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.200]   But wait, there's more.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.320]   Well, there's 20%
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.400]   to those is 13 seconds of your life, Leo.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.320]   Because I know, I know.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.600]   I'm heading toward the reboot.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.040]   One player's cheese ball is not enough.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.000]   Nothing for everybody.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.080]   I brought everybody.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.560]   I had to buy apparently you can't just buy one on Amazon.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.760]   So I had to buy.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.800]   Oh, here comes.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.240]   Here comes some snack clippers.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.960]   Go ahead.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.920]   Go ahead.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.600]   Snack clip away because you know what?
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.480]   There's sanitary.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.240]   How do you have these two?
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.560]   Everybody apparently in the studio has snack clips.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.360]   Just me and you.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.360]   When Andy puts them on, it says "snicked."
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.480]   But wait, there's more.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:57.000]   Apparently, why start with a little tiny can of cheese balls
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.440]   when the fine folks at--
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.560]   it's make a giant barrel of cheese balls.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.000]   Cheese boulders.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.200]   Look at that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.840]   Not nice.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.120]   I get concerned out of any container of snacks
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.880]   that's large enough to get my head stuck in.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.880]   That would be a very costly conversation.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.760]   That's like reading the book.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.640]   But boy, you know, it works just great with these.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.920]   So let us know if it's better.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.360]   Is it good or better?
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.400]   What's the compare?
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.720]   OK.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.920]   That's an interesting comparison.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.880]   I might have to try again.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.720]   It looks to me.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.720]   It looks to me.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.680]   It's called Samolealia.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.960]   First of all, is it heaven?
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.480]   And these cheese balls are larger,
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.360]   the planters.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.560]   But they're also crunchier.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.120]   And these--
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.840]   that's cheese balls are smaller,
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.040]   but they melt in your mouth.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.880]   All right.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.800]   Don't size shame the cheese balls.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:53.640]   We're also offering a two hour for subscribers
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.280]   to the--
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.680]   on the--
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.480]   This is a question.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.280]   This is a question.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.880]   We're also offering two hours for--
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.680]   to treat ASMR--
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.440]   G-S-M-R.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.400]   Can you hear the crunch?
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.960]   Is that actually--
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.440]   This is Club Boys Leo E's cheese balls.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.760]   This is the new show, Mac and Cheese.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.960]   Nice.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.680]   I can double--
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.720]   I can double fizz the--
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.360]   Whoa.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.680]   OK.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.000]   I hope Lisa's copywriting that.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.880]   One got away.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.240]   I can double--
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.720]   Oh, here's the cheese ball spoon.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.720]   You got to get him a shovel.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.240]   A trowel.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.760]   Three ways to get him a shovel.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.560]   You don't want a short circuit,
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.160]   the advantage of the chopsticks.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160]   The chopsticks force you to slow down.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.480]   Funnel.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.440]   You need a funnel and a--
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.800]   Yeah, a prowel.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.360]   Trowel.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.960]   Give up and start stabbing the cheese balls.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.440]   It's the cheese balls with the--
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.920]   Are you suggesting a cheese ball bomb, Alex?
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.480]   A cheese ball.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.040]   He's--
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.360]   He's--
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:46.360]   He's--
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:46.680]   He's--
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.200]   He's main lining cheese.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:48.360]   He's--
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:48.680]   He's--
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:48.680]   He's--
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:48.680]   He's--
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.160]   He's--
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.160]   He's--
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.360]   He's a stacks of cheddar.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:50.680]   All right.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:50.680]   Good.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.080]   You both.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.120]   Good.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.240]   Enough flivolity.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.120]   Let's do a show.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.200]   But I just wanted to show you that there has been parity
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:58.600]   in the--
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.640]   In the cheese ball wars.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.240]   Mm.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.840]   Actually, Anthony Nielsen had these apparently all along.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.880]   And then gave them--
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.040]   Escalation in the cheese ball wars, Leo.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.840]   Escalation?
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.520]   On East Coast, West Coast beefs in hip hop,
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.520]   it turns into warfare.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.640]   In geekdom, it just becomes, hey, how about instead of chopsticks,
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.880]   we have some sort of a mass market entrepreneur device
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.400]   that can be used--
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.840]   that be manufactured overseas, OK?
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.320]   How much do you think Apple charges for licensing the lightning
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.800]   jack on third party cables?
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.440]   The-- I've seen estimates of as much as three to four dollars
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.560]   per cable.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.120]   Does that seem recent?
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.080]   I was going to say more.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.800]   You think it's more?
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.520]   Mm-hmm.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.560]   Because it's a chipset.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:41.560]   So--
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.840]   Yeah, it's not just a--
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.600]   It's not just a thing.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.000]   It's--
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.160]   It's--
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.600]   You got a chip.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:52.360]   Well, that might explain why they're reluctant to give up the
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.760]   lightning, although they've given up everywhere except the iPhone.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.640]   And I guess some lower-end iPads--
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.320]   those are going to--
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:08:59.720]   Those are going to--
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.240]   Those are going to go to see too.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.440]   Well, the EU, of course, is moving to a universal standard,
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.720]   USB-C.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:14.680]   And now, three US senators have called for the Department of Commerce
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.960]   to adopt the common charger standard.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.040]   Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Ed Markey
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.320]   wrote a letter, open letter to the comments secretary,
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.280]   Gina at Ramondo urging the United States.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.200]   Follow suit with the EU.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.120]   I think Apple's ready for this.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:30.680]   And eliminated.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.560]   And eliminated.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.080]   Yeah, I think it looks good for them because Apple's--
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.040]   It's good to say.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.200]   We asked for something and then it happened.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.560]   You know, we put the pressure on it because Apple's already going this way.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.880]   You know, and the thing is that--
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.160]   And I think that, again, I get concerned about our representatives.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.160]   Micro-- And this is in the EU or the United States--
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.640]   Micro-Managing Technology because they are digital children.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.640]   It's like a 12-year-old doing open-heart surgery.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.480]   Like they're like making like--
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.160]   I'm going to tell you exactly how to do something that I don't know anything about.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.240]   They don't know anything about this.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.880]   I mean, those three definitely don't know anything about this.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.480]   And so the thing is that--
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:16.520]   So I think that it worries me that we've now taken the crazy EU view of--
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.720]   Let's take a 10-year-old technology that barely works and make it a standard.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.240]   Look, it's just stupid.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.120]   I have a guess though.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.160]   I have a guess that if Apple had everything in a row,
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.920]   they weren't so damn secretive all the time,
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.560]   they would have actually preferred to ship USB-C last year with the ProRes
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.920]   because it makes zero sense to have a ProRes chip and a ProRes storage controller.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.520]   And so that to me is just, oh, there was COVID and nothing was lined up
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.400]   and they just couldn't get it done in time and they're working to get it done
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.320]   because the amount of money that they make from MFI--
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.720]   It's not nothing, but for Apple it's nothing.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.960]   It's such a small, tiny amount.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.880]   The control was great because while everybody was worried in the early years of USB-C,
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.360]   they got lightning out two years before USB-C
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.120]   and there were zero quality control issues and zero confusion about compatibility.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.680]   Anybody could just plug in any lightning cable and it worked.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.840]   It was way better for its time.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.440]   That time is blissfully over.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.800]   And I believe honestly they were going to transition regardless of the EU.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:17.880]   This EU law in the US, if they do it, would be by 2024 long after Apple's already
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.680]   abandoned lightning.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:18.680]   Right now.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.640]   Sure handy.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.720]   I can see you wanted to say something.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.880]   No, a bit of trivia.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.800]   You noticed that all four of the people involved in that communication,
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:34.520]   Sanders, Mark E. Warren, and the Secretary of Commerce are all New Englanders
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.600]   for Dylin, Massachusetts, and Vermont.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.000]   Interesting.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.400]   So basically they're probably already in their own rolodexes.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:47.240]   I think that it's a move that Apple should be making anyway only because
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.000]   obviously if they were big fans of lightning, we would have seen
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.920]   MacBooks with lightning ports on them.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.560]   We never did.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.960]   So that basically shows where the writing on the wall was.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:01.400]   But the only thing that kind of concerns me about it is that I did read the letter
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:06.360]   and the thing is the language that they used was not really precise,
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.680]   saying that, "Well, we do have a charging standard and it has revolutionized all devices
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.920]   where it really is the USB standard."
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.120]   What they're talking about is they want a standard connector, not a standard charger.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:23.880]   When you go through a library of phones that dates past five or six years,
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.560]   you do see a whole bunch of proprietary connectors and proprietary chargers.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:33.000]   That's the really big kind of e-waste that was just triumphant 10 years ago.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.040]   Not so much right now.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:39.000]   I do think that if Apple switches, if and when Apple switches to USB-C,
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:44.280]   it'll reduce the problem of having all of these knock off
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.640]   lightning connectors that you buy, the drug store that you buy,
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.520]   like the dollar store.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.680]   Of course, they don't have the MFI logo on them.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.040]   So God knows where they come from.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.160]   God knows how they're made.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.840]   Whereas USB-C, you can't knock them off because there is no way.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.680]   Because they weren't valuable enough to be made over and compensated to begin with.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.520]   So it's a good thing. If it makes people happy, that's fine.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:15.800]   I don't think it'll lead to any big problems in the future because,
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   God forbid, that there's going to be...
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.760]   Nobody can see another connector that follows USB-C.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.880]   The next connector that follows USB-C is going to be nothing.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.160]   No chargers, no connectors.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.240]   Just contactless everything.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:33.880]   By the way, does Apple get out of this if they eliminate connectors?
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.880]   Yeah, they do.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.040]   So if there's no connector, then you're not in violation.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.080]   By the way, this looks like an ad for cheese balls.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.720]   I'm going to have to...
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.920]   I'm going to have to use a keystone.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.280]   I'm going to put the cheese balls over.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:46.680]   No, no, no, no.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.480]   Clear.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.280]   Get a bid.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.080]   Get a bid.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:49.480]   Get a bid.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.280]   Get a bid.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.000]   Get a bidding war between oats and planters for the responsibility.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.120]   Who wants to be on this side of the whole thing?
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.720]   And it's on them maintaining the...
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.840]   Maintaining the cheese standard.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.840]   If they deviate from the cheese standard and make it proprietary,
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.840]   like Apple Watch, they can run into problems.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.840]   But as long as they're backwards compatible with cheats, fine.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.920]   And again, I don't have any...
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.040]   I want a new format because the lightning is old,
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.080]   and it's now become the thing that the one other cable that I have to do,
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.440]   because I have so many USB-C's.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.480]   It's mostly that...
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.920]   They never updated it.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.760]   The USB-C standard, it just isn't very good.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.080]   You know, like, and so to make it a standard, it's not like this is...
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.560]   I mean, you pick up a cable and you have no idea
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.040]   whether it can actually transfer data or not.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:26.600]   You know, and...
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.560]   That's a cable problem.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.840]   Well, that's a cable problem.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.400]   Not a...
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:29.880]   Not a...
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:30.920]   It is, but it's a device.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.600]   But I'm just saying that we're saying...
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.240]   If you got good cables, it would work with everything.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.120]   Sure, but the average...
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.000]   I just bought all Thunderbolt, and so...
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.120]   I gave up, spent a fortune...
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:38.680]   Yeah, I mean, I just threw up.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.920]   Yeah, no, no, no, Nate Renee gets worse, though.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:46.120]   I would buy all Thunderbolt except that certain devices don't work very well with Thunderbolt.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.360]   They have to have USB-C, so it's...
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.000]   I get the high...
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.280]   I get Thunderbolt 4.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.120]   I have lots of those that I generally...
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:57.880]   There is a USB-C video standard that requires not a Thunderbolt cable,
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.520]   but a USB video that's...
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.400]   Which is ridiculously...
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.600]   That's one of those monitors.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.680]   It's not very standardized for a standard, is it?
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.400]   No.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.480]   Well, on the other hand, though...
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:15.160]   It is good for consumers that we don't have a myriad of incompatible, proprietary chargers.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:15.560]   It's really...
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:15.960]   Which happens...
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:15.960]   Which happens...
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.120]   Which happens...
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:16.840]   ...without the government.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.040]   Without any legislation that just happened.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.760]   Because we got tired of having those.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.000]   Yeah, maybe they're requiring legislation.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.440]   Like we're gonna leave...
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.600]   Apple's gonna leave lightning because it's too slow.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.320]   Like it's not gonna...
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.360]   You know, I'm not gonna leave because...
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.480]   And I think what's gonna happen is the pro versions will all have lightning...
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.520]   I have USB-C in the base versions will have nothing.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.200]   You know, they'll just be like, you know,
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.400]   I think that's where Apple's gonna go with it.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.040]   Because it's just cheaper.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.720]   But my question is...
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.760]   So we...
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.160]   It's...
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.640]   This is part of the complication of any sort of discussion like this.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.160]   There's the connector, there's the cable, there's the standard.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:49.960]   Even there...
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.640]   It's what you put up cost a cable, then there's what you do with the connector.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:59.640]   I don't know how you would fix the myriad problems with things that look like USB-C
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.600]   cables without saying,
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.720]   "Well, now we're gonna put like a notch on this cable that won't...
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.920]   That will create this."
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.120]   And now you're back to the problems of,
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.480]   "Do I have a micro USB?
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.040]   Do I have a scar cable? Do I have a..."
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.960]   I don't think they should do anything about it.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.600]   I'm just saying that this is something that the government should do
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.520]   because it's very complicated and very gray.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.360]   And there's a whole bunch of things that are there.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.520]   And once you start pulling at that thread, it just becomes,
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.120]   you know, a mess.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:22.680]   You know, like...
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.320]   And it's just...
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.360]   On the market side?
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:24.920]   Well, just...
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.680]   Well, the market is the side.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.480]   It's a big mess.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.040]   It's fine.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.000]   Like it's...
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.800]   It is what it is.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.720]   I'm just saying that them sticking their head into it is just...
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.280]   You know, it's...
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.440]   Again, they're technological children.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.320]   Like they really are.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.880]   Like a lot of interactions with the wrongs that are there.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.440]   I guess that's the good thing about the EU law.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.440]   And if a proposed US law is based on it,
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.040]   it doesn't say all devices.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.480]   It really is just here are two or three specific classes of devices
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.560]   that we want to have a unified connector for.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.120]   So it's not...
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.800]   So if someone comes up with like an 8K video camera,
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.840]   for which, no, no, we actually need a hexagonal...
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.320]   We need like a Chinese...
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.760]   We need like a throwing star-shaped connector
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.720]   that basically...
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.440]   Like the blade and crawl where you put it in
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.920]   and these six other connectors sort of shink out
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.920]   in a star pattern inside the device.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.960]   You'll still be able to do that,
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.640]   but you won't be able to simply say,
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.560]   "Hey, we just thought it would be funny
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.800]   to have a banana-shaped charging connector
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.320]   on our new Apple phone,
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.960]   just to be jerks about it and flop the fact
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.640]   that you can't do anything to stop us."
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.320]   This also doesn't mean that MagSafe is gone on laptops.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.560]   I mean, you can do MagSafe and USB-C charging
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.040]   all the Apple laptops with MagSafe do that.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.680]   So you can have something better.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.720]   You wouldn't do it on a phone
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.320]   just because of space considerations.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.840]   Yeah, I think that the lower end phones will end up
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.440]   just being some kind of MagSafe.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.560]   You know, just set it down on things
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.360]   and not just the way it's designed like your watch.
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.480]   We've heard all these rumors.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.520]   Yeah, you're watching that way.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.720]   Which I hate, by the way.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.440]   I mean, I desperately want a connector for my watch
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.720]   because I knock it off my thing all the time.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.080]   It's magnetic.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:03.880]   How can you knock it off?
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.520]   They made it.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.080]   It was good.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:05.880]   Oh my gosh.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.440]   Just so you wouldn't knock it off,
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.080]   uni.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.360]   You're still knocking it off.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.520]   That noom-sto-med charger.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.320]   Superglue.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.840]   We have Nomad's going to be a sponsor,
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.960]   so we have a bunch of Nomad stuff.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.120]   I set Lisa up with the base station
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.320]   that does the watch and the phone.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.800]   It's snacks on there and you're not going nowhere.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.600]   It is.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.960]   And I use that.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.400]   On there like Mac Break on Cheeseball.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:27.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.000]   Ew.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.440]   I use the little show title,
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.880]   the little rubber Macintosh that you put the watch in.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.040]   And it gets a nice solid connection.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.600]   I have that.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.040]   I have it right here.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.000]   You can't go wrong with that.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:41.800]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.280]   So cute.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.880]   You put the little charging puck in there.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.840]   And you punch things in your sleep, Alex.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.560]   Is that too personal?
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.200]   I do not.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:48.760]   I do not.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.640]   Why do you ask that?
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.160]   Because he's locking it off a really hard magnetic charger.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.360]   No, no, I don't charge it.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.200]   If you charge it when you're sleeping,
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.720]   you don't get sleeping data.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.400]   So good point.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.200]   Good data guy.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.240]   Charge it when--
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:01.800]   Yes.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.720]   Oh, knock it off.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.320]   I usually charge probably in Mac Break or in office hours.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.840]   Charge during Mac Break.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.360]   That's the thing.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.880]   Everybody should do that.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.480]   It's an excuse to watch Mac Break.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.040]   And when the show's over, your watch is full.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.560]   I love that idea.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.960]   You shouldn't keep the people in the charge anyway.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.680]   Like, we don't want you to know what time it is.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.880]   We don't want to know when we start installing it.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.080]   You don't want to know how long it should have been.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.360]   Like casinos.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.560]   We don't want to just keep--
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.960]   Not as though we'll just keep them listening.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.760]   Apple workers at the Towson Maryland store
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.800]   vote to unionize the first Apple store in the US.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.480]   The dominoes perhaps are beginning to fall.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.600]   It happened to the Starbucks one store than another,
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.040]   than another, than another.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.040]   Well, C hasn't happened yet at Amazon warehouses,
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.840]   Amazon and Apple both fighting tooth and nails,
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.960]   not to unionize.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.040]   President Biden congratulated the Apple workers.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.080]   He said he's proud, proud of them,
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.080]   for voting in a union.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.280]   There you go.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.160]   And like President Bartlett,
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.160]   it came to a sudden bicyclicular stop.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.760]   He did, just like Bartlett.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.000]   That was the beginning of the West Wing.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.280]   It was the very first episode.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:10.760]   You're right.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.800]   He didn't--
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:12.600]   He said, "Narboreal stop."
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.120]   This is the "arboreal stop."
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.400]   I forgot about that.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.120]   Well, at least that President could have gotten
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.560]   on the bike in the first place.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.360]   I'm like some President's like, "Yeah, you never said
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.520]   Donald Trump right a bike, did you?
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.040]   Did you?"
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.640]   War, Taft.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.400]   Taft couldn't get on a bike.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.320]   There you go.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.400]   War and G-harding never rode a bike.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.600]   We're going to Harley, right?
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.640]   Yeah, yeah, Harley.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.680]   Reagan had a Harley.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.800]   But yeah, it is good news.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.520]   The-- it doesn't mean that there is a magic wand,
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.560]   and now suddenly even that shop is unionized.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.000]   Now it starts a process by which Apple and this union now
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.240]   have to meet to hammer out a contract.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:00.600]   Now we find out exactly how anti-union Apple is or isn't.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.480]   Like you kind of expect Apple to do the sort of things
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.200]   that they did or they have been doing.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.640]   And they are alleged to have done to have
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.520]   convinced the Atlanta store to not even--
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.960]   to cancel their vote.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:19.000]   But that's sort of like fair game.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.080]   So far, next what they could do, if they really, really
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.800]   want to put their shoulders into it,
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.240]   is basically stretch out these negotiations for a year,
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.880]   claim that the negotiations went to nothing.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.160]   Because of the union.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:34.660]   Right.
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.440]   Or the old land companies did.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.120]   Right.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.080]   They could even say that in the intervening year,
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.720]   we're convinced that the two to one margin of votes
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.360]   in favor of the union are now no longer a plurality,
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.080]   and now a majority of workers at that store now
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.600]   do not want to form a union.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.520]   Or they could just simply say that these people have
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.240]   been negotiating in bad faith.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.720]   These are not the right people for us to be negotiating with.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.480]   So they could really draw this out for a couple of years
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.160]   if they want to.
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.040]   So if they decide to simply make this
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.320]   into a linear process where they try to hammer out
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.960]   the best agreement they possibly can with this union,
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.800]   then we'll find out that no, they're not--
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:20.120]   they are the 2022 version of the coal company that hires
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.720]   the Pinkerton men to shoot at striking workers,
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.080]   blocking access to the pits.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.040]   Microsoft said it's going to try collaborating with unions
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.280]   to avoid public disputes.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.320]   They didn't go quite so far as to embrace unions,
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.640]   but Brad Smith said they're committed to working
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.360]   with employees if they choose to unionize.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.960]   This is in contrast to what Apple, Starbucks, and Amazon
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.760]   have been doing.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.360]   It's good that the union is called core.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.360]   It's the Apple core.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.160]   Apple core, get it?
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.000]   Apple core?
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.960]   Like every third Apple user group in the early--
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.760]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.320]   They roll Apple cores, weren't they?
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.080]   The coalition of organized retail employees,
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.640]   which will be part of the International Association
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.720]   of Machinists and Aerospace Workers--
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:06.040]   it's a big 300,000 strong industrial union.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.440]   Yeah, it'll be interesting to see what happens.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.880]   Two to one, though, pretty strong margin, despite videos
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.560]   from Didro Bryan saying, we're family.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.200]   We're family.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.720]   Why would you want to do this to the family?
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.480]   Supposedly, the workers at the Atlanta store--
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.040]   You can't remember.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.240]   --have been sort of committing.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.920]   So supposedly, workers at the Atlanta store, who basically
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.080]   lost in that attempt, had been sort of coaching other Apple
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.320]   stores, and here's the tricks they pulled on us.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.000]   Here's how maybe you should try to not make it quite so
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.760]   effective if they try it again on you.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:42.120]   There's still-- the NLRB still has an open investigation
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.200]   about Apple interfering in very, very simple ways,
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.440]   not really, really heinous ways with the vote.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:53.200]   I think in Maryland, it could be the Atlanta one.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.840]   But basic things like, hey, you're not supposed to pull one
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.840]   person aside and try to brow beat them
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.080]   into a convincing them not to vote a certain way.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.680]   You can't punish somebody for hanging up a union notice
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.880]   meeting, a union notice in a public-- in a work space,
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.880]   worker-only space on their free time, little things like that.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.400]   So there's still things that are kind of in the mix on that.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.320]   We'll see what happens.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.840]   The employees at the Grand Central Terminal Store in New York
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.760]   and the Louisville, Kentucky Apple Store, also are
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:22.280]   organizing.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.400]   They're going to wait to ask for an election until they feel
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.800]   like they have a strong support.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.240]   Atlanta says they're going to try to revive that election
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.400]   in the future.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.000]   But it often is the case that when one store goes,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.080]   it becomes a domino.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.800]   I think that's what happened with Starbucks.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.040]   Now, there's 150 Starbucks stores that
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.440]   have unionized in morale a lot of time.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:39.880]   It's like Canada.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.600]   You can call the election when you think you're going to win.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.600]   I love it.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.280]   Who is it?
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.240]   England has had-- somebody's having their fist elections
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.040]   three years.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:49.720]   Who is it?
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.160]   France.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:50.660]   France.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:51.640]   That's real.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.640]   Oh, no.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.120]   Israel.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.620]   Israel.
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.120]   Israel.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:54.640]   That's who it is.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.140]   Israel.
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.600]   Israel, you believe, always been doing that.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.200]   They never--
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.200]   Well, there's something different.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:58.880]   Do that again.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.200]   Let's try this one more time.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.680]   Let's do that one more time.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.200]   One more time.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.200]   A series of collapsing coal--
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:04.880]   Coalition.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.380]   Coalition.
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.280]   Yeah, Ellen and Lee.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.120]   You know what's collapsing is your internet, by the way.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.080]   Are you sure--
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:11.960]   Play with you again?
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.480]   No, no.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.400]   It's not that.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.960]   Oh, I'm video Tron.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.200]   Video Tron, that's right.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.680]   That's the great Francophone cable company.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.360]   Hydro-powered internet.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.360]   And I think maybe you're in out of water,
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.480]   like the rest of us, I don't know.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:25.680]   It just--
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.960]   More hamsters, more wheels.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:27.680]   It's just buzzing.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.160]   You have no water.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:28.720]   Don't invade.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.800]   It's pausing briefly.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.080]   All right.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.880]   Let's talk about the future.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.040]   I think the future will involve fewer CAPTCHAs, which I think
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.040]   is a great thing.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:46.800]   iOS 16-- now, I presume you've played with this, Renee.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.680]   And I guess the sites have to go along with it.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.120]   But Apple has a switch now in iOS 16
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.400]   under advanced automatic verification.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.000]   Bypass captures in apps and on the web
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.240]   by allowing iCloud to automatically and privately
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.760]   verify your device and account.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.960]   CAPTCHAs are second only to the cookie warning
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.760]   in internet annoyances.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.200]   But I think Google wants these CAPTCHAs.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.120]   They're paying their AI systems for free.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.400]   Google isn't--
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.160]   by the way, Steve Gibson years ago
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.560]   demonstrated how CAPTCHAs are completely ineffective
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.160]   in blocking bots.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.840]   There are a number of, for instance, porn sites
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.400]   with millions of visitors a day that
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.160]   take the capture from the site they're trying to get into,
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.040]   put it on the porn site, a human solves it,
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.160]   and then they go, here, the answer is.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.640]   Also, sometimes humans can't solve it.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.960]   I can't find another traffic light.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.560]   Leave me alone.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.280]   I just can't find another traffic light.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.840]   Is a motorcycle a bicycle?
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.680]   Is it a moped?
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.360]   Is it a bicycle?
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.440]   Is a bicycle a bicycle?
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.160]   I don't know what.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:50.640]   I hate this.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.480]   Ask me about sandwiches.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.560]   I can handle sandwiches.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.280]   And the thing about traffic lights--
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.240]   does the bar holding the traffic light?
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.200]   Is that the traffic light, right?
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.840]   I don't understand.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.160]   And why any website--
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.680]   It's like it's a touring test for humans.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.040]   They would torture their customers like this is beyond me.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.360]   Knock it off.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.400]   You can't apply it.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.440]   Like the Google one, you have to--
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.200]   it has to be able to put that up.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.920]   Like, it's not like you can say, I want to do this
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.360]   and just have someone say something that I'm not a human.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.840]   Or I mean, you think that you can get around it,
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.360]   but it's just the way that one works, the Google one, at least.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.120]   Well, and that's the thing.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.160]   I think Apple is nice for Apple to put that switch there.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:29.160]   But these sites have to then say, OK, we trust you, Apple.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.640]   And I'm convinced sites have some ulterior motive.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.880]   And we're doing this because they're horrible.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.240]   Why would they do this to us?
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.080]   Like Google capture system.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.600]   It just like verify you and pass along a verified token
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.520]   to the API for the Google capture system.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.000]   That's my hope.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:50.680]   To answer your question, your observation, oftentimes,
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.480]   a system will use it basically to punish you
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.360]   for using VPNs or other techniques that
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.160]   will prevent them from cracking you.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.960]   Where that's when-- that's when all of a sudden,
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.920]   you have to go through eight different recaptures.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.320]   And then they say, well, we don't recognize this IP address.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.840]   And so therefore, we've sent a code, one-time password code,
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.360]   to your email address.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.040]   And then we're going to have to log all the way back in.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.240]   This is why Facebook has such a hard time
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.200]   with almost anybody who tries to undermine them.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.680]   Good news is, fastly and clown flare,
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.160]   two very popular CDNs have both said,
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.640]   they will support this standard.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.520]   So if a company is using either one of these--
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.920]   And the capture comes from them, they'll support it.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.960]   Well, a cloud flare works.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.480]   So you should happen last time.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.680]   Were they down?
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.160]   It was--
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:36.880]   Oh my gosh.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.880]   Oh, they were down.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.800]   Who else was down?
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.600]   They were down.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.800]   Everybody was down.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.680]   They're like, Google had issues.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.720]   Discord.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.600]   It was like half an hour of chaos.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.640]   Discord is down.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.200]   You're all free.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:50.680]   You're quick.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.320]   Run away.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.480]   Here's the headline.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.360]   I like this from Amanda Yoe and Mashable.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.320]   Half the internet died where you were sleeping.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.080]   Here's what happened.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:03.000]   So everybody uses cloud flare as DDoS protection,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.240]   the variety of things.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.360]   Discord, Darr-League of Legends.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.400]   I guess I was asleep.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.160]   Quite a few days.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.080]   I have to admit, I was like, this doesn't work.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.280]   And then I went to sleep.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.280]   Like I was like, right.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.560]   It's just an excuse to go to bed early.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.680]   Crunchyroll, Amazon, Web Services, Google Services,
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:27.480]   NordVPN, Coinbase, Grindr, and Fur Affinity.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.760]   Well, there you go.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.280]   What is Fur Affinity?
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.480]   I don't know if I should ask.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.120]   Don't do it.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.280]   Don't do it.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.880]   I don't know.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.720]   Oh, no, it's OK.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.200]   It's an art gallery for all things scaled, feathered, and fluff.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.080]   We're not here, shame.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.720]   It's just a word.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.960]   Just a place to go.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.840]   We don't want a community guideline strike either.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.680]   It's an early issue.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.520]   We usually stay at once for later in the show.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:54.000]   OK.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.040]   It's interesting that Mashable has no links
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.200]   any of these services except for Affinity.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.440]   So maybe that--
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.040]   It's all fun in games until your eggplant looks
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.080]   like the latest dinosaur in Jurassic Dominion.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:11.920]   So yeah, somebody's calling it a CloudFlare Eclipse.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.200]   I think that's a good way to put it.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.760]   CloudFlare Renaud.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.280]   A lot of games, interestingly.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:23.520]   2K Games, League of Legends, Minecraft, Steam.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.720]   Wow.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.480]   You demeaned.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.560]   Notion was down.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.720]   Oh, that would have been bad.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.760]   Valorant?
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.400]   Holy cow.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:36.280]   It doesn't mean it does kind of tail on to what Alex was saying.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.920]   Alex said something earlier that I don't automatically
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.520]   think that all people who are lawmakers are idiots
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:47.120]   or maybe to the next extension, they
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.360]   don't have advisors who can tell them what's right
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.400]   and what's wrong.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.080]   But the thing is, the things that get me worried
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.960]   is when you see all of these proposed laws that kind of makes
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.800]   sense about, hey, you have too much power over who sees what.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.920]   You have to be transparent.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.360]   You have to make sure that you know that you're not
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.040]   trying to filter out content.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:07.680]   They're always talking about the name brand companies.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.680]   They're always talking about Google.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.840]   They're always talking about Facebook.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.960]   They're always talking about Apple.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.880]   They never talk about companies like CloudFlare
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:19.240]   that have, in the past, essentially put message boards
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.560]   and websites out of business simply by saying, OK,
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.360]   we will no longer provide you the sort of services that
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:28.640]   allow you to operate at scale without being totally DDOS.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.800]   And so not that I think that they've ever picked a bad fight.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.840]   The websites and message boards they've
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.560]   decided to pull out of are eminently not something
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.720]   that any business would want to have anything to do with.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.840]   But nonetheless, the outages that happened yesterday
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.680]   show you that everybody thinks that they're connecting
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.320]   everything through Google or everything through Verizon
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.440]   or everything through whatever.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.920]   They're really connecting through CloudFlare
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.160]   and like three other services that are always like two layers
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.040]   below between you and the keyboard.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.400]   Well, I think it was interesting that Amazon Web Services
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.560]   were also down.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:08.440]   So that's a double whammy because everybody else is on Amazon.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.440]   And I just want to clarify.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.520]   I don't think that the representatives are idiots.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.600]   I think that they are technologically technologically
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.320]   inept.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:20.880]   Like the thing is, is that Tom Brady is a really great quarterback
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.280]   but he should not play hockey.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.800]   You know, like that's all.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.200]   OK.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.720]   I get it.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.880]   Marky and Warren, though--
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.080]   Marky's pretty literate.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.160]   Marky-- Marky particularly because he's
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.800]   made it his cause celeb to be one of the point people
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.920]   in the Democratic Party for antitrust and anti-tech--
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.320]   or excuse me-- more regulation for tech.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.520]   He's-- I haven't-- I've never spoken to him directly.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.360]   I have spoken to people who have dealt with his office
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:49.560]   before and they've told me that no, they know what's--
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.440]   they know what's important.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.040]   They know it's right.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.280]   They know how things work.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.560]   And they know their power to break things
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:00.360]   by dumbing down a proposal into something that will actually
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.120]   make it illegal to put a JPEG attached to anything
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:03.800]   on the internet.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.880]   He also wrote a book called "Chemicals
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.000]   Used in Hydraulic Fracturing."
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.480]   So he's clearly--
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:09.980]   Yeah.
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.240]   So he knows a lot about chemists.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.880]   He knows a lot about fracking.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.360]   Marky is-- Marky is-- he's a lifer.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.200]   He is one of those, like guys that--
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.040]   if you've lived in New England, you
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.360]   have heard his name associated with local politics
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.360]   and local governance pretty much your entire life.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.880]   And he's not a dabbler.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.800]   He didn't just-- he didn't mark up eight episodes
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.400]   of the love boat.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.040]   And based on that fame, it launched
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.120]   a successful career in politics after that.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.360]   He's pretty good.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.880]   Born to.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.160]   All right.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.280]   Let's take a break.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.520]   Come back with more.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.040]   When can I order my gosh darn M2 MacBook
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:51.240]   Air?
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.600]   That's what I want to know.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.560]   Soon.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.800]   Coming up.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.560]   Soon.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.560]   Soon.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.400]   But first--
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:58.900]   $5.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.640]   Fly be free.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.080]   Yeah, really.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.280]   Fly to Cupertino.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.640]   I'm brewing a hole in my cheese ball can here.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.400]   I've been using this for money because no one would ever
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:12.000]   suspect that I've been storing my dollars in here.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   This episode of "Mac Break Weekly" is brought to you
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.400]   by Newvay and you V-E-I, tomorrow's payment platform
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.440]   designed to accelerate your business.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.880]   You may say, wait a minute.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.080]   I know these other payment platforms.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:26.960]   Newvay?
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.880]   Newvay is the latest.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.160]   It's next generation payment technology.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.120]   And it's something you want to look into because it not only
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.080]   boosts conversions and reduces fraud
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.360]   and increases approval rates, which
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.240]   means you make more money and it works seamlessly
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.800]   with your existing tech stack.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.680]   It's a single API integration that connects you
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.320]   to all this goodness.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.480]   An agile platform your business will
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.280]   use to add new payment methods, to enter more markets,
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.800]   to meet evolving customer demands,
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.400]   to stay ahead of the curve.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:02.800]   550 alternative payment methods, including cryptocurrencies.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:08.280]   Local payment solutions around the world in 150 currencies.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:13.720]   Local acquiring in 46 countries, more than 200
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:14.480]   global markets.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.040]   That's new Vay.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:19.480]   And look at the people who use newvay, wicks, valve,
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:25.040]   draft kings, general motors, Valentino, crypto.com, FTX,
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.640]   and on and on.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.720]   Newvay is the way.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.080]   Customers also benefit from all payout options, card
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:35.800]   issuing, banking, and fraud management services.

[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.080]   We thank newvay so much for supporting Mac Break Weekly.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.760]   N-U-V-E-I-I.com.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:47.480]   We're starting now as people get the betas.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.400]   And they try it.
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.920]   We're starting to learn more and more about Ventura,
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:55.880]   more and more about iOS 16, iPad OS 16.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.320]   Michael Sy, this gets back to your conversation, Renee,
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:06.960]   about why doesn't a stage manager work on older iPads?
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.080]   Michael Sy, who's lately been doing this on his blog,
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.080]   putting together quotes from a variety of people
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:15.520]   who's got Matthew Panzerina's quotes with Craig Federitti,
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.600]   which I thought were very straightforward.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:26.160]   Thomas Brand, at least Apple could throw three-year-old iPad
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.160]   pros a bone with minor software updates.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:34.440]   Now that this has been out for a couple of weeks,
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.720]   and you've heard Apple's response, Renee,
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.920]   I'm sure you've thought more about it.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.800]   Do you feel like Apple is artificially keeping stage manager
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.320]   for the higher-end iPads, or that it is really
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.680]   a technical limitation?
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.960]   Yeah, I mean, it's one of those damned if you do damned
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.680]   if you don't things, because when they put stuff that's
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.880]   exclusive to higher-end models, people complain
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.800]   they're withholding it so that you're forced to update.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.240]   And when they push it down to lower-end models,
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.160]   people complain the performance is crappy,
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.360]   and they're trying to force you to upgrade
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.600]   by destroying your experience.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.360]   And I don't want them to hold back something
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.480]   because this is where Apple has always shined compared
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.760]   to Microsoft.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.360]   Microsoft is so reluctant to do anything
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.200]   that every goddamn PC can't do that they--
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.000]   And Apple is savage.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:12.440]   --it holds them back.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.600]   And Apple's savage.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.760]   But I don't think that that's a terrible thing.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.880]   So the most damning complaint from Andrew Cunningham,
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:24.400]   who for years has been the guy at Ars Technica
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.200]   who writes those great pieces about Mac OS.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.160]   It's not unreasonable, he says, to expect a 14-month-old,
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.040]   $1,000-plus computer to support new OS features.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.960]   And he says, if Apple couldn't do that,
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:41.160]   they should have designed the feature differently.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.880]   See, that's hard too, because again, last year they got
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.600]   pasted for putting an M1 processor in the iPad
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.080]   and then not doing anything with it.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.440]   And so this month, they're like, OK, we'll do something
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.520]   with it, and then they get pasted for making
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.960]   an M1 exclusive feature.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.760]   And my understanding is the M1 chip is a Mac chip.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.560]   It was designed to do a lot of things
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.480]   that A-series chips were just never meant to do.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.920]   They never had to deal with.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.920]   So there's a lot of advanced dedicated silicon IP
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.760]   that's designed around page swapping and memory management
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.880]   and storage control, memory--
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.760]   sorry, I said memory management, the storage control,
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:13.960]   the graphics subsystems.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:17.320]   All of that is designed to deal with Mac issues
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.360]   that iPads and iPhones had nothing they needed for that.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.560]   So Apple never built it.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.680]   And Apple's very different from an Intel or a Qualcomm
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.400]   where they never know what kind of device any chip
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.280]   is going to be in.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.240]   So they have to put everything into every chip, which
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.320]   is why some of those chips are super expensive beyond what
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.040]   an individual or specific device needs.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.080]   And the M1 has a lot of these features
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.600]   that Apple is leaning on.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.680]   The M1 iPad with the 64 gigabytes is unfortunate
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.360]   because it doesn't have enough storage to do the swap
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.280]   effectively.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.160]   And that's probably the worst experience you'll get with this.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.000]   But it's really hard to say, OK, you
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.080]   can't have it on the M1 64, but you
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:58.440]   can have it on the 2 terabyte A5--
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.600]   that would just be a huge mess.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.120]   So they drew the line and said, we're building features
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.040]   for M1 iPads.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.280]   Honestly, they're not great features.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.280]   I think people are upset because they don't have them,
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:07.720]   which I get.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.680]   But if they did get them, they may not want them.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.000]   So the whole thing is a mess.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.600]   And I don't know what Apple's going to do
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.880]   because they got in trouble last year for doing nothing
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.720]   in trouble this year for doing something.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.080]   And I wish people were--
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.080]   this is a horrible thing to say, but a lot of this
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.920]   was based off really bad information in the beginning.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.520]   There were some quotes that went out that were not accurate.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.360]   And so people had a lot of expectation debt buildup.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.800]   And then it's the same thing as the swappable RAM
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:37.480]   on the studio display or why they think the graphics
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.720]   processes.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.720]   They don't understand how modern silicon works.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.520]   It's so much more complicated than the old x86
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.640]   because they have so many custom IP that
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:48.360]   is beyond just a CPU GPU.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.480]   It is so much harder, which is why my heart breaks
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.200]   that they've defunded an Antec so much
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.800]   because they would give us really definitive answers
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:56.400]   and all this.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.160]   But they have like one and a half employees left.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.040]   And I'm upset about that.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.880]   It's not ranting a bit.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.200]   But this is a-- my understanding is
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.720]   that the silicon checks out on this.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.080]   And honestly, you don't put credit
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.400]   figure radio up on the record twice in two days for him
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.120]   to just be called a fool one day later
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.080]   because someone on the internet had a hot take.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.240]   And I have to say, Microsoft got a lot of heat
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.440]   when they told people that Windows 11 would not
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:21.560]   run on machines that were equally new
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.640]   if it didn't have an eighth generation Intel
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.960]   processor or TPM 2.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.440]   And people got very, very upset.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.360]   In fact, that wasn't a real technical requirement
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.160]   because subsequently people showed it works just fine.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.960]   Windows 11, as one would expect since it really isn't
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.760]   any different than Windows 10, was just fine on all the hardware.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.240]   Like we had this problem last year.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.960]   Apple rolled out the live text feature.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.240]   And they said it's M1 only.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.640]   And that's because they were leveraging the neural engines
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:48.120]   to do it.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.600]   And that way it was always on.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:50.640]   It was real time.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.360]   You could hold something up to the camera.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.520]   It had zero impact on the CPU, the GPU.
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.720]   Any of your processing was an amazing feature.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.240]   And people got really angry that it was M1 only.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.800]   So over the summer they went back and they built a version
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.120]   that worked on Intel, but it was no longer all the time.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.000]   It was on demand.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.440]   It was no longer real time.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.760]   So you couldn't do it on a camera.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.320]   And it hit the CPU real hard.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.480]   Like when you were doing it for a few seconds.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.320]   But they did a version of it that worked.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.840]   And maybe they could do this too.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.440]   But I think it would just be the interface,
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.560]   which is the least interesting part.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.960]   Like it's just a fancier version of the task switcher.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.320]   The real interesting part is the swap.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.280]   And they can't do that on older iPads.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.160]   I think you pointed out that Apple's--
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.000]   I don't think Apple's failing was not to make this work
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.600]   on the most-- as many different iPads as possible.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.840]   But just not looking ahead and realizing that we're
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.920]   going to have to explain why we are limiting this.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.880]   Because that's going to be a legitimate thing for people
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.640]   to get a little bit upset about again,
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:54.480]   if they've just in the past three months bought a 2021 model
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.400]   iPad, that this wonderful thing that we've spent.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.520]   The problem with the WWDC keynote
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.120]   is that Apple loves these features.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.680]   And they're excited about these features.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.840]   And the whole point of the keynote
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.280]   is to get everybody excited about these features.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.760]   And you don't want to be watching everybody
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.560]   on the parade float, like passing you by.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.400]   And that's sometimes what it feels like if they don't--
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.240]   if there isn't something in the press release,
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.080]   something in the talking points for the interviews
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.480]   that they're going to be giving afterward, that, oh, by the way,
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.000]   we did try to get this working.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.240]   You could sort of get it working,
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.840]   but it doesn't work well enough that it would be a good experience.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.960]   And for us, the iPad is all about delivering
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.560]   the best possible experience to every single customer.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:37.080]   But I think that the other thing is that most people don't care.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.280]   People have gotten into it.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.000]   We care about it.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.120]   We pay attention to it.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.200]   But 99% of Apple's--
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.200]   they're going to build a PR pipeline for 99% of the users
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.760]   who are going to go, oh, that's great.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.240]   I can now get this thing, oh, I should just go get an M1,
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.440]   or whatever it is.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.680]   They're not going to care about that.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.680]   And so people get tied up in it, but Apple's not
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   going to spend PR resources until they have to in that area.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.720]   Because I think a lot of times you
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.080]   don't know what people are going to latch on to to be upset about.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.040]   Because they're going to be upset about something.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.080]   Sometimes it's better just to-- it's kind of like sometimes I
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.240]   just push my bag through the metal detector
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.280]   and don't try to take anything exactly the computer's out.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:13.600]   Not knowing what they're going to do,
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.120]   because I'm like, it's too much work to figure it out.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.440]   I'll get on the other side and sort it out.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.600]   But then again, WWDC really is all about the people
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.200]   who do care about this stuff.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.600]   And that's not just the present analyst.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:23.680]   Right.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:24.280]   Exactly.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:28.120]   I mean, you're right, and you have to always--
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:31.880]   we always have to make sure that the world that we live in--
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.040]   we have to understand it's not the world that the rest of the world
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.320]   lives in.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:41.200]   I was talking about WWDC in Chicago and in Boston Radio.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.960]   And both times I had to sort of brief people in on, here's
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.600]   what the WWDC is.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:47.920]   Here's why it's important.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.360]   Here's why the news that comes out of it is important.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:54.000]   But unfortunately, it's also the people who are paying attention
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.360]   who will then relay this information to other people.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.760]   And like I said, it's a finer point.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.840]   One of Apple's signatures is communication,
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.440]   like about trying to control the narrative,
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:06.840]   trying to make sure that they get out their side of the story
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.240]   and as complete a way as possible.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.560]   So it's just a little surprising to me
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.520]   that when they get caught up in something
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.920]   that they might have figured out.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:15.920]   It's not a scandal, but--
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.440]   It's a little complex, too, because there's
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.520]   three distinct aspects to stage manager.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.600]   There's a interface where some people just like the way it looks.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.680]   And they could do that.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.440]   It would just run under Jetson, which
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.240]   means that any app under pressure
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.840]   would restart, which would be hella annoying.
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.680]   That the whole point of running it on M1
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:31.680]   is that that never happens.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.480]   They have virtual memory swap now.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.280]   So Photoshop can run full--
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.240]   Pixelmator can run full.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.800]   Every app can run full, so it runs more like a Mac.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.680]   Then you have the external display, full external display
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.680]   support, which I think people are the maddest about,
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.760]   and maybe rightly so, because it doesn't
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.040]   need to be bound up into stage manager.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.920]   They could implement that separately.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.320]   And that's something I hope they do.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:57.120]   And I recognize, to exactly to Alex's point,
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.880]   Mac users--
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.480]   sorry, high single digit percentage of Mac users
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.560]   use external displays.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:05.680]   Low single digit of iPad users use external displays.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.640]   But wow, do they get angry they don't work right.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.800]   And so again, if Apple could do that,
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.240]   it would make them super happy.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.960]   And then the last part is a virtual memory swap,
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.680]   which they can't physically do on most older iPads,
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:18.920]   because a system isn't optimized for it.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.000]   But that's the whole magic that makes this feel
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.800]   like it's a desktop suddenly.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.240]   And I think also, you know, you're
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.640]   getting into the technical debt of trying
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.680]   to pay attention to the past.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.040]   They could try to do some somersault
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.320]   to try to make this work and try to make it look pretty
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.880]   or have people have the impression of it.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.400]   But to them, it's the past.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.400]   You know, like it's-- it is--
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.680]   I'm fairly certain that there is before M1 and after M1.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.000]   And developing a bunch of things that fix something
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.320]   for the legacy format, which is really what it is, is--
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.000]   I'm sure-- you know, I mean, I know that everyone thinks
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.760]   that Apple has unlimited resources,
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.800]   but there's just a certain number of programmers.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.400]   Like I love-- you know, like--
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.800]   and they have lots of things to do.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.360]   And I think that it's sometimes irrational
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:02.200]   to think they have unlimited resources to make everything
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.320]   work just the way they want.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.080]   We had an article, I think, that-- you know, where the guy said,
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.280]   we didn't have cut and paste because we didn't get around to it.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.600]   We just ran out of research.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:10.600]   We ran out of time.
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:11.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.640]   So the thing is that it is--
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.840]   you know, they just go, well, we have
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.120]   a limited amount of resources.
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.440]   And are we going to focus on the future or focus on the past?
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.960]   And Microsoft spends a lot of time focusing on the past.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.960]   And Apple just has never-- if you're buying into the Apple
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.520]   ecosystem, I don't think that should be your expectation.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:28.840]   Well, there's-- there's, like, Ken, who-- like,
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:30.840]   he did the keyboard for the first generation iPhone.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:32.400]   He didn't have time to do cut and paste.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.160]   And then they made a work on the App Store for the second year.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.560]   Didn't have time to do cut and paste.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.960]   But also, like, when they did iOS 7
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.080]   and they read everything with this Gaussian blur,
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.400]   and they were actually injecting straight into the GL pipeline,
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.200]   which you're not supposed to do, but YOLO,
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.400]   they wanted to make it look like no other company on Earth
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.400]   could support what the iPhone was doing.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.760]   And it didn't work on older iPhones.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:50.720]   And then, like, Eliza, who's a super genius,
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.560]   just figured out she could take a static image, paste it there.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.800]   And very few people would notice on older iPhones.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.920]   It's like, you know, problem solved.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.000]   It was like one engineering weekend.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.080]   But they have-- they have real resource costs.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.080]   And it's a trade-off.
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.360]   And if someone has to go and do this,
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.280]   they're not going to do something else.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.800]   You were talking about Ken Kachenda, who
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:11.040]   is the creator of AutoCorrect, and worked on the keyboard
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.160]   on the original iPhone.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.280]   He tweeted, the original iPhone didn't have cut, copy, paste,
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.280]   infamous.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.760]   The quick explanation-- this is his tweet-- is that I didn't
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.480]   have time to do it right.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.920]   I had too much keyboard auto correction and tech system
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:23.920]   work to do.
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.200]   And the design team didn't have time either.
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.600]   So we passed on the feature for 1.0.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.440]   And I think that once the most important word in that comment
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.320]   is, right.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:36.080]   And that is something that Apple, I think, can get really tied up
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.960]   in, is they think about all of these things.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.600]   And how does it impact-- they're not
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.800]   going to just add a feature like a lot of companies do.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.040]   Just add another dropdown menu.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:49.600]   But they-- so adding, cut and paste
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:54.240]   is thousands of hours of designers and programmers
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.800]   thinking about the best way to do it, and testing it,
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.720]   and then retesting it, and then beta testing it,
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:48:59.720]   and then gamma testing it.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.600]   And then all these other things to make sure
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.680]   that it works just right when it goes out.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.120]   And it's something that I think that that's
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.000]   why a lot of these-- every little button-- people always
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.520]   ask, why can't they just add one little button?
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.360]   I worked in a lot of companies' research teams,
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.840]   and that's like, that button's a million dollars.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:17.480]   Just so you know, it's not like we're
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.640]   going to do it over the weekend.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.360]   You might prep it over the weekend,
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.080]   but it's still going to be a million dollars.
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:23.200]   Put that button in.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:26.040]   But it's too bad they can't occasionally
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.840]   apportion the right number of people
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:29.120]   to the right kind of features.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:33.800]   I mean, boy, it was a super bummer for such a long time
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.640]   to not be able to do cut copy and paste, especially
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.000]   when it was already available on every other platform.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.240]   So I do-- there's so many times I
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:47.280]   say that I got to really, really admire how Apple did this,
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:50.880]   and I wish they didn't-- they've done it some or any other way.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.960]   So it's like, I don't want them to have a half-baked version
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.040]   of copy and paste, but having something that
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:59.200]   was functional as opposed to something that was perfect
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.960]   would have been so nice.
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:04.120]   But I would like to think that they
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.720]   had enough problems getting the iPhone out the door as a working
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:10.280]   phone with a working web browser that they could basically
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:13.000]   say, how about-- we're lucky to get upper and lower case
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:13.600]   on the keyboard.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.440]   Let's just take the win.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.840]   They had Ken, and you know Microsoft's Windows mobile team
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.120]   had 378 people on the keyboard just on the keyboard.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.160]   Well, Apple had Ken.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.320]   It's important--
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.960]   By the way, read the rest of the thread,
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.760]   just about this cut and paste.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.520]   It's about how difficult it is to do--
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:29.000]   Right.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.240]   --touch on a screen like this.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.520]   Also, Ken tells the full story in a four-year-old episode
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.880]   of Vector podcast that he was on with me when he first left out.
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:36.400]   Oh.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.000]   He sat down and decompressed about a--
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.360]   I'll try to find a whole book.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:39.840]   Of course.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:40.360]   Oh, no.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.400]   Yeah, the book is fantastic.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.080]   Creative so much.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:42.680]   About three years ago?
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:44.360]   We interviewed him.
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.240]   Megan Maroney did on triangulation,
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.240]   so we can go back and look at the phone.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.000]   That was really good, too.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:48.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:53.280]   But I think the important thing is that when you hear this,
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:56.520]   it eliminates the conspiracy theory.
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.760]   And in a vacuum, conspiracy theories
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.320]   thrive, the conspiracy theory that, oh, Apple left out
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.960]   cut and paste so that you would buy the next phone.
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.560]   That this is a way of-- they help back features.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:08.480]   People have always stopped.
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:09.080]   How about Apple is an update?
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.000]   Because it was one guy and he had another job for those two
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:11.640]   years.
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:12.800]   Isn't that funny, right?
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.680]   I mean, you would think Apple had plenty resources
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.240]   to do anything they wanted.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.920]   Yeah, I think that most of those--
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.680]   I just don't see-- anytime I look at these things with Apple,
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.200]   I don't see that they're specifically holding something
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.840]   back other than spending less money on a piece of hardware
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:27.760]   or something like that.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.360]   It's usually that it doesn't run perfectly
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.280]   on an older device or it doesn't run whatever
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:32.280]   as they take it out.
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.920]   But they see it as more trouble than it's worth.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.680]   But I don't think that they're purposefully
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.320]   trying to move people forward by not supporting something.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:43.600]   It's just not-- I don't think they care that much
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.560]   about the older stuff.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.080]   No.
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.080]   But I think that they--
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.240]   But it's not a purposeful thing.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.640]   It's just kind of like, oh, it's just--
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.320]   There's plenty of features on their punch list
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:52.240]   that they can add.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.640]   It's not like, oh, gosh, we make this phone too good.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:57.520]   Nobody's going to buy next year because we have nothing to do.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.600]   There will be plenty of things they can come up with,
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:03.280]   I'm sure, to make the next phones desirable.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.280]   By the way, there is this kind of feeling--
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.800]   and I don't know if this is reasonable--
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:12.720]   that iPhone 14 is going to be a significant upgrade,
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.960]   particularly in cameras.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.040]   That's the story.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.120]   That's the story, right?
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.360]   That's the-- every year, though.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.040]   Every year, I guess, was--
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.760]   I didn't feel like-- I stuck with the 12.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:27.400]   I didn't feel any drive to get the 13.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.760]   But maybe the 14 will be--
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:33.760]   I will say that the low light in the 13 is supernatural.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.760]   Like, I take photos--
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.600]   And the photos.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.240]   I don't even understand how it did that.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.280]   Just because it's a person moving in front of me
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.800]   and I take a picture and it comes out great.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:48.080]   Well, I also have a Pixel 6, so I'm kind of fortunate.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:49.280]   And it's 22 ultra.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.280]   So--
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:51.280]   I don't have to--
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:52.280]   I don't have to--
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.280]   I don't have to--
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.280]   I only have two hands, Leo, LaPorte.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:55.280]   How many phones do I need?
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.280]   Exactly.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.280]   Well, I have to look at them all.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.280]   That's why I buy them all.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.280]   Yeah, I think that the interesting thing will be the--
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.680]   whether we actually get a 48 megapixel image or--
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.680]   I think that's going to be the--
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.680]   There's also rumors--
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.680]   --with a telescopic.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:08.200]   Is it-- it'll be an A16?
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.280]   Only in the pro versions.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:12.120]   But that will be fast enough to do 8K 60 frames.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:13.680]   Isn't that one of the rumors?
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:16.240]   Well, it needs the 48 megapixels to do 8K.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.240]   Who needs--
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:18.240]   Who's most interested?
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.240]   8K?
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:21.240]   Who needs-- I'm sorry.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.240]   A mouse sample.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.240]   A mouse sample.
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.240]   Or you pan and scan.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.240]   No, you pan and scan to get the shot in 1004s.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.240]   Or you down sample to get better 4K.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.240]   OK.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:32.120]   Well, and you're also-- I mean, you know, we should see what happens with TVs and stuff.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.120]   But I think--
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.120]   There are 8K TVs out there.
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:37.080]   And there's always a lack of 8K content for now.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.080]   But maybe that'll change.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.080]   It'll change.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.080]   And the iPhone--
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.080]   4, 15 comes up.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.080]   14 comes up.
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:46.520]   Yeah, and the 48 megapixels is really good for photogrammetry.
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:54.200]   So if you have a LiDAR against a-- you know, you would go with-- at 48 megapixels, I'd
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.920]   probably rather use my iPhone than a still camera to do photogrammetry.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:03.720]   Because at that point, I have structured light from the-- the size of the chip in photogrammetry
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.440]   doesn't matter very much.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:07.240]   If it's good, if they're good pixels.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:11.960]   So if it's a well-lit scene, the size of a smaller sensor size is actually better because
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:14.920]   you have more depth of field, which makes it easier for the photogrammetry.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.200]   And when you add structured light, the LiDAR to figure that out.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:22.440]   And then the unstructured at 48 megapixels, if those are good megapixels, you know, that's
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:23.720]   the thing you always have to worry about.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:29.000]   But if they are, the opportunity to get incredible detail in 3D models is pretty good.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.120]   So again, something great for the pro, probably something you won't see.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:37.440]   And that could be a clear differentiator between the 14 pro and the regular one is that you
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.640]   won't have that camera.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.720]   This feels like some revision is thinking, though, because Apple's been 12 megapixels
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:48.200]   for some time, and there still are Android phones with 30, 40, 50 megapixels.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:52.440]   Well, so was Google, though, because they tuned everything for those and moving to a
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:56.840]   new sensor changes or new camera, like make a pixel account, changes everything for all
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:57.840]   your AI models.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:58.840]   So are we saying 12--
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.840]   Could we say like that not enough now or--
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.840]   Well, if for years you said it was 12 and 20.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.200]   And if you want pixel-vining, like you start to reach the limit of the physics.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.920]   And Google was hesitant to move too because you've got to retune everything and people
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:14.040]   will tell you that a lot of aspects of the Pixel 6 are not quite as tuned as a Pixel 5.
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.640]   And it's going to take them a year or so to get it done.
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:17.640]   I saw the Sony slide today.
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:22.920]   I don't know if you saw that, but Sony says that from 2024 to 2030 advances in mobile
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.760]   are going to overtake DSLR.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.760]   So because everything like folded lenses like the Paris--
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:27.760]   I think we're close to that.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:30.280]   --and the AI and the edge computing.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.560]   They believe they're going to exceed their SLR cameras.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:33.560]   Let's put it this way.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:34.560]   I--
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:38.400]   You know, as I travel now, the decision is, do I need to bring a big camera?
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.720]   And I just get away with my phone.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.400]   And increasingly, the phone is the right answer.
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:45.120]   You already have it anyway.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:50.640]   Yeah, I took a photo with my daughter yesterday, just a random photo with my phone.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:56.720]   And I was like, well, it's not as good as my SLR, but wow, is it getting close?
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.800]   The difference is more control, right?
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:04.240]   I mean, I think it probably is as good if I'm happy to settle for what Apple or Google
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.720]   or anybody is doing with the image because there's a lot of processing.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:11.560]   But with a DSLR or an SLR or a digital--
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:14.160]   I don't do SLRs, I use mirrorless.
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.840]   But those cameras, you have a lot more control over what's going on.
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:23.080]   But the crazy thing now is that I can take this photo, this portrait photo, and I can
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.720]   take it into an app and change it.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:25.720]   Right.
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:26.720]   And you get wrong now.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:27.720]   And you get wrong now.
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:28.720]   Yeah, you get wrong now.
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.040]   And you get all this computational photography.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.840]   And there's so much computational capability in these phones.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.240]   And these girls have never looked better.
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:39.640]   And Eddie, are you still shooting?
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.440]   Do you still shoot with your Olympus?
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:43.440]   Oh, no, all the time.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:50.240]   Because there's still lots of things that you can't possibly do with a phone camera.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:57.360]   For instance, I mean, I haven't been back to Comic-Con since before the event.
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:02.840]   So I haven't been able to shoot cosplay, haven't able to shoot roller derby.
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:06.480]   But I have started shooting the curtain calls at the Metropolitan Opera.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:07.480]   And those are the kind of--
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:08.640]   Oh, I've seen your images.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.640]   Talk about a dark room, and you need a really good long reach lens.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:17.440]   And you also need the ability to make, as you say, exactly the adjustments you need to
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:21.560]   make, not only make them, but also make them on the fly as you go.
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:22.560]   That's just not possible.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:30.960]   But the thing is, like, very few people are trying to get a good portrait of Joyce D.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.440]   Enano, like taking a bow at the end of Cinderella.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.880]   They just want to get a snapshot of the stage.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:37.480]   And that will work just fine.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:42.640]   The other complaint I could make is that, well, gee, I've been able to--
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:47.880]   when I take pictures with even my MacBook 4/3 camera, which is a smaller sensor than
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:53.200]   most mirrorless cameras, the difference is absolutely palpable when I print them at
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:56.640]   any sort of a really nice wall-hanging size.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:03.960]   But even then, the one time that I entered a juried competition at a gallery and got
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:09.600]   into the gallery show was with a photo I took with my iPhone 7 and printed at--
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.600]   Is that ironic?
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.600]   Working by whatever.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:17.760]   And the last thing is that, like, even if someone like me is like, oh, well, geez, it's
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.760]   not really photography.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:20.360]   It's because it's a little phone.
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:26.160]   But the thing is, if I am really going to say that, oh, well, it doesn't have the details
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:30.840]   of the resolution, I can buy AI-based tools for $50 to $100.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:35.640]   That will upscale up sample denoise and basically turn this into exactly the sort of picture
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:37.400]   that I would have ever dreamed it to be.
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:42.600]   So yeah, I mean, for most people, I used to-- at Comic-Cons, I used to have, like, on
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:48.520]   a good day, I used to have, like, the dual-hoster sort of approach where I'd have the one camera
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:51.840]   with a long lens for, like, taking pictures, like, at panels.
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:55.920]   The other one with the short lens, with the portrait lens for taking pictures of cosplayers.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:00.760]   And now, if I need a short lens, I will usually just take up my phone because it will do a
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:02.720]   really, really good job.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:06.320]   Yeah, and I think that for me, it's the location data.
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:07.320]   Like, I--
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:08.320]   That's true, too.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:11.200]   I look at-- I pick up an SLR and I go, I'm never going to find this photo.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.200]   Like, I'm never going to, like--
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:19.120]   I miss my Canon 5D Mark IV had a GPS built in, but most of my cameras, none of the Sony's
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.120]   do it.
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:21.120]   Exactly.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:25.680]   And it's just so frustrating because I use location in photos so often.
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:29.320]   And it's like, you know, I just type in, oh, Washington DC and I have thousands of photos
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:30.320]   that I should watch in DC.
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:31.320]   Right.
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:32.320]   Right.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:33.320]   It's how I find everything.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:34.320]   Right.
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:36.680]   And so, like, me looking at SLR, like, I have all these SLR photos that are, you know, in
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:40.000]   a library that I can't, you know, find anything.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:46.480]   Although you have to say, at least with-- I use Google Photos as one of my backups and
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:52.560]   it is just stunningly good at saying, I'll pick a-- gee, a picture of a squirrel with
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:55.600]   water in the background on a cloudy day and it will find--
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.600]   I will--
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:57.600]   It's amazing, isn't it?
[00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:59.080]   --it will find exactly the picture that I was thinking of.
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.080]   And I'll be able to make it for you if I can't.
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.800]   But it's even better if you saw it.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.800]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:12.080]   And I'm with Alex because you might have 100 shots that you took in the Washington Monument
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.840]   and you might be able to find some of them by typing in Washington Monument, but you're
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.560]   going to find all of them by location.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.560]   So that's--
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.400]   I love-- I just love looking at the map and looking at all these little photos all
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.400]   in the world.
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:24.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.400]   So it's--
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.400]   Sorry.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.400]   Alex's phone must look like undisclosed, undisclosed.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:35.400]   Photography is so many different categories and so many aspects.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:41.160]   Just the other day, I was just-- I wasn't even really trying to organize my Google Photos
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:47.680]   library, but I just-- I think I'm-- yeah, no, I was looking for the-- I was looking for
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.400]   a picture on the Vegas of terms.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.200]   I said, oh, I know that I put this stuff on a tabletop.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.520]   So I just did a search for tabletop.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.120]   And after scrolling three or four times, I did find the picture I was looking for.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:04.320]   But the thing is, it's kind of fun to just-- how about just do a search for coffee and
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.320]   just see--
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.320]   Yes.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:11.800]   Go take a trip through the past five to 10 years of your life and these random incidents
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.680]   in which coffee was somewhere part of the thing.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.680]   It's not even a theme.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:20.560]   It's a way to resurface pictures that you haven't really thought about.
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.080]   And it's really such a wonderful thing.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:26.640]   This is why photography is about so much more than, hey, I've got a medium format camera
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.600]   and I have a professional model in studio lighting.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:36.600]   Really a phone and an AI system that could retrieve any photo that you want on the slightest
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:41.880]   whim is as powerful as any hassle blad ever was when it comes to enjoying pictures and
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.480]   sharing them and making use of them.
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:45.920]   And it stays in your library, it's good to nobody.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:52.280]   I also think that there's no doubt that any camera phone today is better than the camera
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:55.520]   that say, I'll recart your brasson had.
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.520]   But--
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.520]   But--
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.520]   Exactly.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.800]   And so that is rolling over.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.520]   It's the photographer, not the camera.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:07.440]   It's all about the decisive moment for our unrecuted aerosol.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:11.160]   And so I wonder what he would have done with an iPhone.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.160]   But nevertheless--
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:19.080]   Well, one of the things that really put my head straight or at least solidified a lot
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:23.360]   of my thoughts was somebody on some board who-- on a professional photographers board
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:29.400]   who said, look, if you're going to be sniffy about the quality of an SLR versus a phone
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:36.680]   camera, realize that in Times Square, if you take a look at the advertisements in Times
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:42.120]   Square in 1982, these huge photos of models were taken with 35 months.
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:46.880]   And they were taken from a millimeter cameras with crappy lenses-- with crappy relatively--
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:47.880]   A grainy film.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:52.720]   And yet it was made into this big, big, huge 80-foot--
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:53.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.720]   --by 200-foot print.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:59.680]   So don't get all snippy about how it's not technically possible for bad film to create
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.680]   great prints.
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:05.320]   This brass-- Cartier Brasson print is $42,000, if anybody.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.400]   And it's-- you know what, it's worth it.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.400]   Less than--
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.400]   More than a Bitcoin now.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.400]   I wish I could afford it.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.000]   Yeah, you need two bitcoins to buy this one.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.080]   If you follow any of Apple's camera team on Instagram, you can see what they're capable
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.160]   of getting out of these things.
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.440]   And it's just like, OK, no one needs to photograph that again.
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.440]   It's fine.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.440]   Iceland's been done.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.760]   But like, car walls have been done.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   It's fine.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.760]   OK, whatever.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.280]   I have to say I felt that way.
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.200]   Last time I was in Paris, I was going to go to the Eiffel Tower.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.480]   I thought, should I bring a camera?
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.160]   And I thought, what can I take-- what picture of the Eiffel Tower?
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.160]   I said, but I don't.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.160]   I don't think you can take photographs.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.160]   Yeah, there's coffee.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.160]   You can do it.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.120]   You can do it in your drawings.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.480]   Yeah, the funny thing is when I go, I actually take all the photos.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:48.560]   And I actually will go to a travel manual, like photos.
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:49.560]   It's try to duplicate this.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.640]   Or I take pictures.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:56.640]   And I triangulate the position and the time of day of the photos that I really like.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:02.040]   And then I go to those-- and I can tell you, the hardest one is actually in Ankerwatt.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.960]   There's a three-foot-- there's a three-foot square basically on the other side of one
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:10.120]   of the pools that sits in front of the main temple.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.600]   That's the only place to take the photo.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.520]   Everybody takes the picture from there.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.800]   So the funny thing is that you show up at 4.45 in the morning.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.800]   And you show up at 4.45 in the morning.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:24.440]   And you just hope that it's like if it's someone who's Cambodian at 4.45, you know you're
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:27.480]   in trouble because they got paid to get to that spot.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:31.080]   And they're younger and faster than you are until you're not going to get it.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.080]   But otherwise--
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.080]   By the way, this is the picture.
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.960]   Because I know because there's 8,000 of them.
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:36.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.040]   And so that's the photo.
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:44.000]   You literally-- there's a three-foot square on that lake that is where you have to be
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   to take that photo.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   Oh, no, that's the other side.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   That's the other side?
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.840]   There's another one on the other side.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:51.480]   Anyway, I've shot a lot there.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.400]   You know your anchor what?
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.760]   That's the other side.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.960]   That is actually where everybody stands.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.560]   So there's like 2,000 people on one side of the road.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.200]   And then there's like 200 on the other.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:05.920]   And it's like-- anyway, but the funny thing is that-- so I, with all over, and I'm like
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:06.920]   especially anchor what?
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.440]   That's how I got into it.
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:09.440]   Because I would go around to anchor what?
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.440]   And buy in Temple.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.920]   And I was trying to figure out the best photos.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:14.040]   And so I just looked at the tourist things and I go, oh, I like that photo.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.040]   I like that photo.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.040]   And I know where that is.
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.160]   And then I go and I take those photos.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.160]   And now I do it all the time.
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:22.360]   Like if I'm going to a new city, I'll look at photos that I like of that city and then
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.360]   I'll go find them and take pictures.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.560]   And someone asked me, they're like, why do you do that?
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.560]   Someone already took them.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.480]   I was like, yeah, but the one I took is mine.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.480]   That's true.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.440]   Like, you know, like I don't have to go through it.
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.440]   Exactly.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:37.720]   And I use that photo somewhere I can, you know, but not just that.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:46.200]   Like, I still, I was at the Mac Tech Conference in LA and the organizers are, they will always
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.400]   organize these amazing like field trips.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:53.120]   We went to the museum that had the space shuttle in it.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.600]   We had the place all to ourselves all night.
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:00.680]   And one of the other attendees who was, he was German.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:08.320]   This is a character trait that I've seen to associate with people I've met at conferences
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:12.760]   who are German who are like, but why are you taking pictures of the space?
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.000]   It's been photographed so many times.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.520]   Why do you need to take a picture of it?
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:17.680]   You've seen it.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:22.360]   And it was hard to explain that, well, just like you said, it will be my picture.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:26.920]   And I'm not just talking about my intellectual property, but it will reflect this moment that
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.480]   I had in front of this thing.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.360]   And also part of the fun of photography is to say, okay, I've got the obvious picture.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:37.080]   I'm going to keep walking around until I find something that I don't think I've seen before.
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:41.960]   And I took, I've managed to take one by actually with another phone, another phone camera picture
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:45.720]   with the Nokia 1020, the Lumet, that that really cool.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:48.800]   I was thinking about that one, the 41 megapixel Lumia 1020.
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:49.800]   Yes.
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:55.040]   And I'm walking around and I see that you see all the thermal tiles on the bottom of the
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.040]   wing.
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:59.240]   And one of the Aliorans was like lifted a little bit, so there's a gap.
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.960]   You could just see like the stars and stripes behind it.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:06.920]   So I took this photo I really, really like of just this black field with just this one
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.760]   burst of color behind it.
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:14.360]   And that's, I always tell myself whenever I go for a photo walk, it's my favorite thing
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:17.560]   to do when I have a day off, like when I'm traveling on businesses.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.080]   There are some really great pictures hidden here somewhere.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.880]   It's my job to go out and find them.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.040]   And I raised Easter egg hunt.
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.880]   And again, when you're outside, it's never the same photo because it's a different time
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.880]   of day.
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:30.520]   Or even if it's same time of day, it's a different sky.
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:35.080]   It's a different, like when I'm in Cambodia, I've gone every single day to anchor what?
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.480]   Take that same photo over and over again and the same video.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.480]   You like toys today.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.480]   It's a little different.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.080]   Sometimes a good day, sometimes a bad day, sometimes it's raining, sometimes it's
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.680]   you know, whatever it is.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:47.160]   And you know, like, and by the way, just the tip for you.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.360]   So many have been to Roma couple of times.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.360]   First thing in the morning.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:51.360]   Oh yeah.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.360]   Keep you up early.
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.360]   Don't wait until golden.
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:59.440]   I had to, I had nobody's want to get a good picture of the White House.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.440]   Honest to God.
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:06.120]   Unfortunately, you can't get the, I don't know what the two sides that you know, people
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.320]   get pictures of.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:10.040]   One side, you're way too far away to get a good picture.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:12.000]   The other one, you're right in front of it.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:18.160]   But the thing is, like the sun, well, not just that, but the sun after like an hour after
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.680]   sunrise puts the entire facade into into shade.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.480]   And so I went one trip to DC.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:27.760]   I was determined to get a picture of my, of the Holsteins, my, my cows, like in front
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:28.760]   of the White House.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:34.760]   And so there I was explaining to the, the very, very friendly service at 6 30 in the
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.920]   morning, why I was like setting up this little special platform and.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:39.920]   Oh no.
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:44.000]   As soon as you realize, as soon as you, as soon as you, I could see the wheels processing,
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.760]   I see, I could see every hour of training this man had ever had.
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:52.960]   It's okay, he's definitely a nut, but he, there are a lot of tourists, art nuts or not
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.160]   dangerous nuts.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.760]   My job is to not ruin this person's day, but try to determine whether he is one of those
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:08:59.760]   dangerous nuts.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:04.240]   We did the same thing at Machu Picchu because it's so crowded.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:10.160]   The Peruvian Inca ruins is so crowded that you really, but you can get up at sunrise before
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.480]   sunrise, be the first in line.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:15.400]   And then you get to watch the sunrise, but my trick for taking.
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.320]   So this is sunrise at Machu Picchu.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:22.120]   So my trick for making a picture like that, which everybody has good is putting yourself
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.120]   in it.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:27.760]   Then you know, a little tripod action.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:28.760]   And then you got.
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:31.440]   Wait, Leo, did you magic a racer, everybody else out of it and use the new iOS feature
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:35.080]   to pick you and Lisa up out of another photo and drop you into that one?
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.680]   Oh, you're such a cynic.
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:39.680]   But where's Chris Evans?
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:42.600]   Have you seen the big one where Chris Evans where you can put him everywhere?
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.680]   Yeah, with out into his hands in his pockets.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.120]   No, but Renee was right in 10 years time.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:52.920]   That's going to be the problem where you can just simply type into Google Photos a picture
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:59.560]   of me, Dali, and this person in front of Machu Picchu at, but I don't want it to look
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.880]   like it was just a snapshot and not well taken.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.360]   So people think that it's real and you'll have that picture.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:11.040]   If you're if you're if your goal is not necessarily to lead a life of wonderment and
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:16.640]   adventure and and constant learning, but simply to make sure that at your at your funeral
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:22.280]   service, that table of photos that they blew up and put on to phone fiberboard to illustrate
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:26.120]   your life has some makes people think that, Oh my God, I didn't realize he worked for
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.120]   M5.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.120]   Wow.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.120]   Am I five?
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.120]   Wow.
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.120]   It's going to be hard.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:33.920]   I cherish the memories and get moving back to the station.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.920]   Not that five a.m. to be first in line of Machu Picchu was definitely, definitely.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.360]   You can't take that away from you.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.360]   You can't take that away from me.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.360]   Yeah.
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.360]   All right, let's take a little break.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.360]   By the way, I will not be here next week.
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:47.840]   I will be having breakfast at a diner with Andy and not go.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.840]   Yeah.
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:49.840]   I hope.
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.840]   Nice.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:51.840]   You guys doing it?
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:54.600]   You're staying your life from the diner is I will be flying to see my mom.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:59.600]   I'm going to take my daughter, Abby and I are going to go see grandma Monday through Friday
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.600]   of next week.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.760]   So I will not be hosting the show.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:04.760]   Is it hot there right now?
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.200]   Because it's 99 degrees outside right now in Petalone.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:14.160]   It's actually a very nice 70 to 75 degrees enough, not warm enough to go into the water
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.640]   at the beach, but certainly warm enough to enjoy being at the beach and waiting, waiting
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:19.640]   at the shoreline.
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:23.160]   As long as warm enough to enjoy a lobster roll, I'll be happy.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.160]   That's all I can do.
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.160]   We'll get you.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.160]   We'll get you.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.160]   We'll get you.
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.160]   Dels Lemonade.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.160]   Dels Lemonade.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.160]   Lots of roll.
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.160]   Bag a greasy bag a clam, clam cakes and I'm happy.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.160]   There you go.
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:37.760]   Our show today brought to you by ITProTV.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.560]   If you want to get an IT, I know there are a lot of places you can go.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.400]   You can go to the bookstore buy a stack of books.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.160]   It costs you hundreds of dollars.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:50.080]   You could cut pens tens of thousands of dollars and go to a technical school and learn.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:54.200]   Or you can do it for a lot less at ITProTV.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:59.000]   Get the most up to date content, far more update up to date than a book could be.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.760]   The best possible IT training and get those search you need to get that job in IT or if
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.200]   you're already in IT.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:09.840]   Get new skills, new certs, recertified, all of that.
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.800]   And do it on your own schedule.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:16.720]   With virtual labs, practice tests, you'll always be ready for the exams.
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:22.000]   Binge episodes, they're in 20 to 30 minute increments.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.480]   You could do it at lunch break, whenever you've got a moment.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:29.880]   The IT training is always up to date because they've got seven studios running all day,
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:35.040]   making sure that when there's new technology out there, when there's new questions, new
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.920]   certs, they're ready.
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:43.680]   5,800 hours of absolutely up to date IT training, the most current content.
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:45.320]   And it is enjoyable.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:50.920]   What they call binge worthy, one reviewer said, "Most engaging hosts I've ever watched,
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:56.720]   I highly recommend ITProTV, not only do IT professionals but to people who have an interest
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:57.800]   in IT.
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.840]   But don't know where to start.
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:03.720]   Very educational and entertaining."
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:04.720]   I agree.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:07.440]   These guys and gals are the best.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:11.560]   They know their stuff, their experts in the field, their passion communicates, they have
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:14.360]   fun while they're doing it.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:19.920]   Check out the new CompTIA A+ Core 1 and 2 courses designed for professionals who support
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:24.560]   today's Core technology, security, networking, virtualization and more.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:29.400]   These A+ certs are kind of the kind of table stakes if you want to get into IT.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.560]   It's a great way to get that first job.
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.440]   It's an industry standard for launching IT careers.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.440]   You learn about heart.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.440]   Well, you probably already know about it.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.000]   I mean, that's the beauty of this.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.600]   It fills in the gaps and it prepares you for the exams.
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:46.080]   Hardware operating systems, networking, security, troubleshooting.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:50.600]   You can always get better and CompTIA A+ certification is the standard.
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.440]   Two free webinars this month, by the way.
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.400]   We love all the free stuff ITProTV does.
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:14:01.480]   Chris Ward and Kelly Mack on Thursday will be hosting the Future of Project Management.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.480]   That's a 2 p.m.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.480]   Eastern.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.960]   Of course, you can watch it on demand free later.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.360]   But it's better to be there because you can ask questions.
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:15.320]   And then on demand earlier this month, they did all things cybersecurity hacking your way
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.960]   into the field with Daniel Lowry and Zach Hill.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:24.400]   That's a great way to learn about the cybersecurity field and what it takes to get a job in it.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.400]   I know a lot of you are fascinated by that.
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:31.280]   And if you want IT team training, you want to keep your team up to date, there's nothing
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:33.000]   better than ITProTV.

[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:30.040]   The offer code is "Mackbreak30".
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:38.680]   So Renee, Andy, Alex, what can I get my M2, my Midnight Black or Blue or whatever the
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:16:02.640]   whole color is?
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:27.080]   I'm going to say, "Mackbreak30" is a great one.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:34.080]   And I'm going to say, "Mackbreak30" is a great one.
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:58.240]   And I'm going to say, "Mackbreak30" is a great one.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:21.440]   And I'm going to say, "Mackbreak30" is a great one.
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:45.600]   And I'm going to say, "Mackbreak30" is a great one.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:55.600]   And I'm going to say, "Mackbreak30" is a great one.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:18.600]   And I'm going to say, "Mackbreak30" is a great one.
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:25.600]   It's funny when you have a Mac studio, you hear the fans on the next channel drive.
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.600]   You never heard before.
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:30.760]   Suddenly it's loud.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:32.600]   I have to say, I love that Mac studio.
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.160]   And I got the Pro, not the Ultra.
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.960]   Lisa has the Ultra in the other room.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:38.360]   I have the Mac as well and I'm happy with it.
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:39.360]   Yeah, the Macs.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.360]   That's what I got.
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.360]   Macs.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.080]   In fact, they call it Mac-Macs.
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:44.080]   That's what I call it.
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.080]   That's its name.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.080]   Mac-Macs.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:51.360]   So, again, I don't know if I'm going to order it.
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.960]   I think Micah wants to get one.
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:59.680]   The M2, not M2, M2 Air, MacBook Air.
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:00.880]   You think when?
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.480]   I mean, why did they release this 30?
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.080]   Oh, because it was not a redesign.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.320]   Yeah, the chassis are all too long.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.080]   They were all done.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.080]   So you think--
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.720]   Well, you have to put the new Emirates into it.
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:15.080]   Well, they do it the 4th of July.
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.280]   Ah, that would be fun.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.440]   I don't do it in July.
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:19.960]   I don't do like a month after WSE.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:20.960]   So what is that?
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:22.920]   July 6th, July 7th.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:23.920]   And I should get with--
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:26.360]   Next month, they like everything Macs.
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:30.240]   Two terabytes storage, I presume, and 24 gigs of RAM.
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:31.920]   I don't know if you need to run for a gigabytes of RAM.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:32.920]   You might.
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:33.920]   Depends on what you do with it.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.760]   Why not?
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:36.760]   Why not?
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:37.280]   Why not?
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:37.800]   Right?
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:41.240]   And get the midnight because, you know, why not?
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.440]   Just remember, there's no fans.
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.720]   So you're going to be constrained to about 20 minutes
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.680]   of full load, and then it's going to start downramping on you.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:50.960]   So the extra RAM is nice when you have multiple things going on
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.000]   at once, but you're still going to be in a thermally
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.440]   constrained chassis.
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.680]   Who had Marcus Brownlee had fingerprint issues
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:01.400]   on his mid-night air?
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:04.000]   Aw.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:04.520]   Aw.
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.680]   I'm going to show his fingerprint.
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:06.200]   You know what?
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.400]   You've got to get--
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:08.560]   it's really important.
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.880]   I should maybe send a note to Marcus.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:14.320]   You need the Cheeto chopsticks.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:17.560]   And then you won't get fingerprints on your midnight air.
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.200]   Oh, you remember all those early surfaces
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.120]   that had Cheetos on the Alcatera?
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:23.640]   They were just permanently orange?
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.440]   That was a test.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:25.440]   Somebody did.
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:26.440]   It was the Alcatera.
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:30.520]   They rubbed Cheetos into the Alcatera surface.
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:31.960]   All right, so I'm just going to stay here.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.120]   I favorited it.
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.320]   Got the little bookmark added to my saved item.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.040]   I'm just favorited.
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.360]   I'm going to stay here live until you can--
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.880]   I'm going to stay-- we're not-- the show does not end until I
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:41.480]   can order this, Apple.
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:42.000]   I'm hungry.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:42.800]   I'm watching.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.920]   I only have 12 cans of cheese balls and one giant barrel
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.120]   of vaults.
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:52.040]   But after that's over, I'm done.
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:53.240]   He's a-- he's a prepper.
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:56.720]   He's an Apple release prepper.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:59.000]   I'm in line, man.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.360]   Will this be faster than my 14-inch M1 MacBook Pro?
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.440]   Not for sustain.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:05.880]   Multi-core.
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:06.760]   Yeah, because I--
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:07.240]   Single-core.
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:07.720]   I don't do anything.
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.720]   I like a multi-core.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:10.280]   E-max is not multi-core.
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:10.880]   I bet you do.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.280]   I'm not multi-core.
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.160]   There's not that many things that are still single.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.920]   You're going to have older video games.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.840]   You're going to have some aspects of Xcode.
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.160]   You're going to have app launching.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.280]   You'll have some aspects of web rendering.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:23.120]   But there's Python.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:24.680]   But there's not a terrible amount of stuff
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:25.920]   that's not multi-core aware of.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.160]   I guarantee you, Lisp is not using--
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:30.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:30.920]   Actually, it might be.
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.320]   Yeah, scripting is hard.
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.280]   Yeah, it might be.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.920]   Switch to APL, man.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:38.240]   Get a modern 1871 programming language.
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:43.960]   I am using a very modern version of Common Lisp, SBCL,
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:48.920]   Steelbank Common Lisp that supports the M1 and the M2.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:49.600]   And might well do.
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.280]   Apple says 18% uplift.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.400]   So there'll be about 18% faster for you.
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:53.880]   It's--
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:54.720]   That's not a lot.
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:57.240]   They have efficiency cores, and they have performance cores.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.840]   It also varies because it can be faster.
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.200]   But a lot of the speed improvements
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:04.160]   on the performance cores are based on the system level
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.800]   cache and the L2 cache.
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:07.360]   So the latency of the workload will also
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:10.440]   depend on whether you get 5% more or 30% more.
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:15.520]   SBCL does support threading, by the way.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.120]   But not that I'm ever going to use it,
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:20.920]   because mostly I just write things like silly little--
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:22.360]   Why I'm also going to warn people
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.080]   to ignore a lot of the benchmarking that's not
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.080]   done by an Antec when--
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:26.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.480]   And I want to know how to do it.
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:28.200]   Yeah.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:33.880]   So OK, so maybe I just stick with my M1 Max Mac
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.880]   and just leave it at that.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.360]   This is like for travel, Leo.
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.120]   This is like an iPad alternative.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:41.320]   It's more travel with a Mac.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.440]   Nice 14.
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.800]   18% is not a lot.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:45.960]   For a single core.
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:46.440]   I just think that--
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:47.880]   For multi-core, you've got faster cores,
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:48.720]   but they're not as many.
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:49.960]   I like the midnight.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:51.480]   I don't care about fingerprints.
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:54.600]   And I really like the midnight.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:56.800]   And it's air.
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:58.440]   It's thin.
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.040]   The neural engines are faster.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:02.440]   The AMXs are faster, but there's fewer GPUs.
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:03.920]   So it depends on your machine learning.
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:04.760]   This is supply chain.
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:05.680]   That's complicated, Leo.
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:09.400]   This is all the supply chain is holding us up, right?
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.920]   For legacy, you know, it's like those little chips
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:12.080]   you get from Texas Instruments.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:13.800]   The stuff Apple's doing.
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:15.960]   Well, TSMC looks like they're starting to suffer
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.400]   towards the end of the year.
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:20.240]   Three nanometers, not out, four nanometers, not a lot.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:22.720]   I've yield, not yet, but a lot of supply.
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:26.120]   So I mean, people are going to start hurting.
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:27.200]   It's not over yet.
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:29.840]   Just last night, I was reading about a team
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:32.480]   that was producing a niche computer,
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:35.000]   but a very interesting one who had it--
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.400]   once again, explain why there was another delay.
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:39.880]   And people were stealing themselves for OK, component
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:40.360]   shortages.
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:45.560]   We get that factory time tables.
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:46.200]   We get that.
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:47.880]   No, it was the box.
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:50.160]   They did the cardboard they needed for the box.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.600]   They couldn't get the hand of.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:54.480]   And then it became like, OK, we got the cardboard,
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.240]   but you see, now it has to be put on a wooden pallet.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:01.200]   And the German depot that makes those wooden pallets
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.880]   use these-- gets their nails from Russia,
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:06.320]   and they can't get the nails for the pallets.
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.080]   And they managed to get out the first shipment anyway,
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.240]   but they were trying to basically make sure the-- look,
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:16.480]   we're not like the coolest quick starter,
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.680]   where we're just sort of like, not-- we're doing.
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:22.240]   If we had predicted that nails from Russia who
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:27.040]   was waged war on Ukraine, we couldn't plan for that.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.880]   I don't think you could have planned for that either.
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:29.440]   I think the--
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.560]   The nail a horse was lost for one of a horse.
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.720]   The battle was lost, right?
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:37.920]   I think that the just in time global production pipeline
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:41.360]   has just been ground to a whole--
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:43.560]   I think that it seemed like a good idea.
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:47.280]   I feel lucky when something comes.
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:49.360]   Like when that Cal digit came, which I've been waiting for
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:51.720]   for months, that came.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.280]   It's like, I won the jackpot.
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:55.440]   There's only three of them.
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.000]   We're going to pass this back on the shelves, I feel,
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:57.520]   going now.
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:00.680]   Oh, there's sometimes there's no pasta on the shelves.
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:01.480]   I just got an email.
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:02.960]   I do feel a lot of years.
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:05.160]   That's getting me all saying that my play date--
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.240]   hey, we just-- now we just shipped out the--
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:10.480]   starting to ship out the group two people for the next 10,000.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.520]   And then, oh, well, this-- and finally, you get my play date.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:14.520]   Oh, by the way, Andy, you're in group three.
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.240]   I got the same email.
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.960]   I got the exact same email that Kameh is asked for.
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.160]   What is he doing to us?
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:20.160]   I really want that play.
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.120]   I don't want to say cable, Kameh.
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:22.640]   Kameh.
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:22.840]   Kameh.
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:23.320]   Kameh.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:23.800]   Baby.
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:24.320]   Baby.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.160]   Hey, baby.
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:26.680]   Remember me, Andy.
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:28.120]   I got the steam deck.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:29.800]   We got the steam deck.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.880]   Mike, you got the steam deck.
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:33.800]   Very disappointing.
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.200]   Oh, George's husband loves it.
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:37.080]   Like, deeply, truly loves it.
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.000]   It's a Nintendo switch on--
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000]   it's all swole up.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.560]   And it's a line of tech tips Nintendo switch.
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:44.680]   Yeah, but you don't want to--
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.240]   I mean, I tried playing Valheim on it.
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:50.560]   If you've been playing on a 55-inch OLED screen,
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:53.880]   you just don't want to go down to that little--
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:54.920]   as nice as it is.
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:56.840]   But see, if Lisa takes you to Apple Picking,
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:58.640]   you can be playing Valheim while you're Apple Picking
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:25:58.840]   with Lisa.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.240]   Yeah, but I don't want to see--
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:04.640]   Portable is not that important to me.
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:08.600]   And so the game's as good at like Stardew Valley,
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.680]   Mike has suddenly become a gamer.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:12.920]   I see that's not a gamer.
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:14.080]   He says, that play Stardew Valley.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:15.440]   It's not a gamer.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.200]   But he loves--
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:16.800]   I've got a Simpsons mic.
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:17.680]   I've got a producer playing.
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:18.280]   --it's great for Stardew Valley.
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:21.880]   But you could do that on a switch.
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:22.880]   Yeah.
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.800]   I got to say, I played with--
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.080]   a friend of mine got one and let me play it with her for about
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.520]   half hour to 45 minutes.
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:32.000]   I had to remind myself that I'm not into gaming.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.080]   I just wanted--
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:33.560]   Yes.
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:36.680]   --this device is so beautifully put together for the purpose
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:37.760]   for which it was created.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:40.760]   I could almost say, but I have $500.
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.000]   I could own this thing.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.800]   And then what would you play on it?
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:44.360]   Solitary?
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:45.080]   Yes.
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:48.800]   But I mean, I'd be happy playing Solitary on this.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.000]   It's a beautiful device.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:50.480]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:51.840]   It's gorgeous.
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.000]   It gets hot.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.120]   Battery dies in.
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.120]   You know, in minutes--
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.040]   It's got a big APU in it.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:56.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:57.760]   I mean, it's just--
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:00.320]   Anyway, that's another one of those things.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:01.240]   Oh, boy.
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:02.120]   A year ago.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:02.640]   Can't wait.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:03.680]   It's for nerds, Leo.
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:05.560]   It's an niche device for nerds.
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:06.600]   But boy, do those nerds love it.
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.600]   I am a nerd.
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:08.520]   I am not--
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:12.120]   Yes, but you're not that particular kind of gaming--
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.440]   I'm not that kind of nerd.
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:14.640]   I am a gaming nerd.
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:15.280]   I want to play--
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:16.120]   There are different subspecies--
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:17.320]   --in 55-inch nerds.
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:22.440]   Oh, let's screen it with an Nvidia card.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:24.440]   And yeah, anyway.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:27.160]   You know the thing I'm not going to buy in that new beautiful
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:31.760]   Midnight MacBook Air is Microsoft Defender.
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.600]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:37.880]   Microsoft Defender, which is the built-in antivirus on Windows,
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:43.360]   is now available to people who have Microsoft 365 for iOS,
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:48.440]   Android, Mac OS, as well as Windows.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:49.800]   You need to, though, Leo.
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:52.120]   To protect you, the people you're sending stuff to on Windows.
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:53.120]   I mean, that was one of the--
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:54.120]   Oh.
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:55.840]   That was one of the attack factors.
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:58.080]   You would get the file, not know anything was wrong with it,
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.080]   and then forward on it.
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:00.080]   That's a good idea.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:02.840]   You send me a virus, you idiot, and you're like, ah.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:07.440]   Now, I should point out that iOS and iPad OS, you can get it.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:10.360]   But because of the way Apple's written,
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:11.960]   the operating system, third-party apps,
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:14.040]   can't actually do anything.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:20.240]   So on iPad and iOS, you're going to get security tips.
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.520]   It turns out that their behavior is indistinguishable
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:24.120]   from viruses, so you don't worry about it.
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.360]   Yeah, security tips.
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:27.480]   Don't double-click on that.
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:30.120]   That'll be $80.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:30.840]   Renewing on a Mac.
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:32.600]   iOS and iPad OS are so locked down.
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:33.880]   They're utilities.
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:36.280]   And you don't need-- and for that reason,
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:38.400]   I honestly don't think you really need any viruses
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.040]   on any mobile operating system.
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:41.000]   But that's just--
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.200]   Just like to literally to scan documents from your team
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.880]   to make sure you're not passing them from one person.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:46.160]   That is a good use.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.360]   For a long time, I use clam on-- yes, it's the name of any virus.
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:53.160]   Clam on Linux for that reason only,
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:55.160]   because it didn't, in fact, scan for Linux viruses.
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.840]   It only scanned for Windows viruses.
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:59.280]   But that's exactly the use cases.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.520]   I download them once a year.
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.240]   If I think I've done something stupid, I run them,
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:03.920]   and then I delete them.
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:06.200]   Because they're so heavy that they make my computer feel
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:06.960]   like it has a virus.
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:10.240]   I keep them installed.
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.560]   Apple's relationship with web apps
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:16.760]   will improve in 2023.
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:17.840]   They're getting back together.
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:18.600]   They've been talking.
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:19.640]   Always like to hear that.
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:20.960]   I don't know if they're going to get along.
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:21.480]   I don't know.
[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:22.080]   They keep on.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:23.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:28.080]   Apple Insider-- actually, this is actually very-- for me,
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:30.440]   this is very good news.
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:32.000]   Because what it really means is you're
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.600]   going to support PWA's better.
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:37.320]   They're going to have service workers.
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:40.760]   This is really a problem, because if you're on an iPad
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:44.200]   or an iPhone, you're basically a skinned Safari.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:45.440]   You have to use WebKit.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:51.360]   And if Safari does not offer PWA support,
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:54.040]   service workers being the chief of those,
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:56.680]   then it's not going to be a good platform for PWA's.
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:57.440]   It's not going to be--
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:58.760]   But Apple's advocate Leo.
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.200]   Is it going to be Java and Air and Electron?
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.360]   We're a bunch of companies that would have made native apps
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.160]   are now just happy to Amazon Prime throw out
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:08.040]   their common denominator app to every platform?
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.040]   That's the beauty of it.
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.120]   It isn't like Electron.
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:14.040]   You don't have a browser in the bundle.
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:16.040]   Basically, it's a browser app that's
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:18.800]   saved to the-- you can do that right now with Safari.
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:20.400]   No, but I mean, you get the same app.
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:23.000]   All the Smart TV apps are now PWA's.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:23.520]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:26.080]   You have Open GL, but they're still commodity code ones.
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:27.000]   Deploy everywhere apps.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.520]   They're not bespoke to every--
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.480]   Well, it will be, though, because the controls will
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:31.720]   be coming from Safari.
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:34.880]   And so I think it will be more native feeling.
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:35.880]   It is a window.
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:37.480]   It is basically a window on the web,
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:40.560]   except that if you have proper support for progressive--
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.840]   this is called Progressive Web Apps.
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:44.120]   If you have proper support, it has offline.
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:46.720]   You can use offline, obviously, not a streamer.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:49.240]   But the apps that can do stuff, if they're not connected
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.720]   to the internet, will be able to do those stuff,
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:52.920]   even though it's a browser window.
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:55.040]   The original sweet solution comes full circle to apps.
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:55.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:55.880]   It's amazing.
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:57.360]   Yeah, isn't that fun?
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:01.080]   But also, they could be letting the Fox into the henhouse.
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:04.920]   Because if there might be a lot of companies
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:06.920]   who are realizing that, look, we could
[01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:11.120]   avoid a lot of pain if we stop creating an app for our service
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:13.160]   that has to be downloaded to the App Store.
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:16.520]   If we just make-- given that this streaming app,
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:19.400]   or this comic book reading app, inherently requires a connection
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.440]   to the internet anyway, why don't we just
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.360]   make this as a Progressive Web App?
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.640]   And so basically, we can charge whatever we want.
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:28.000]   We can get whatever data we want from the user
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.680]   without having to do the privacy controls that
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:33.240]   are on the App Store.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.080]   We don't have to pay 30% for everything
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:36.480]   that we sell to that store.
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.760]   That's going to be a tipping point, I think.
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:42.680]   The moment that it makes sense to Facebook
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:48.480]   to stop having a bespoke app and start doing things directly
[01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:50.000]   to the web, the question is going to be,
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.680]   can they collect more information as a web client than they
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:56.560]   can as an actually installed app that can actually directly
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:57.440]   access hardware?
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:59.720]   Facebook learned that lesson, because the first Facebook
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:04.840]   app on iOS was just a frame to the web experience.
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:07.520]   Nobody liked it, and so they did write a native app.
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:09.400]   They were very famously.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:10.240]   Joe made it.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.040]   Remember Joe the Gardner went and made it for years.
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:13.760]   It was just him hitting the web app.
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:21.440]   So Apple is allowing push notifications, service workers.
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:25.200]   But you will still have to, as an app developer,
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:27.920]   you still have to fire up the permission dialogue
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:30.880]   and allow when you hit the subscribe button.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:33.440]   The idea of a Progressive Web Apps is you're on a web page.
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.720]   Twitter is a perfect example.
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:39.280]   And you want to have it as an app, just like in the early days
[01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:42.160]   of the iPhone, you can press a button.
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:43.920]   It'll now be an app and have an icon.
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:46.960]   But it's a little bit more smart than just a bookmark
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.320]   to the web browser, because of service workers.
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:51.240]   It can run offline.
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:55.800]   For me, for us, just purely shell selfishly,
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:57.560]   we've always had a hard-- a devil of a time
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:00.760]   making custom apps for our podcasts.
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:02.960]   But if you would support Progressive Web Apps,
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:06.320]   it would be fairly easy for us to have a Mac break weekly app,
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:08.480]   for instance, that would automatically download Mac
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:11.800]   break weekly, allow you to listen offline, all the things
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:15.480]   that you would want an app to do, as opposed to the website.
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:21.120]   Also, if Apple wants to avoid basically handing over
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.640]   their entire browser market to Chrome,
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:25.720]   they're going to have to keep making enterprise happy.
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:28.920]   At Enterprise does so many of their apps.
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:31.600]   They don't want to have to maintain an iOS app and an Android
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:31.760]   app.
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:35.080]   They want to make everything accessible through a responsive
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:35.800]   website.
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:39.440]   And so they have to make sure that Safari is going to be just
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:42.200]   as good at Chrome, at doing web apps.
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.800]   Right.
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.320]   It probably is the case, as well.
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:50.240]   Apple Insider observes that this secondary ecosystem might
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:53.360]   help them with some governments that want them to force
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:55.840]   opening of the app store.
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:59.320]   It's a form of sideloading, in effect.
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:02.200]   We're going right back to Steve Jobs' original argument,
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:06.400]   saying, hey, if people want apps, we see the web as the best
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:11.120]   solution for third-party apps on the iPhone.
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.320]   Yeah, it's ironic, isn't it?
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:13.680]   Pavol--
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:16.200]   Oh, and the Playboy app launched as a web app.
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:18.360]   They got so much press back in the early days of the iPhone
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.240]   because they weren't allowed on a store, famously.
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:21.560]   So they just made a web app.
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:24.720]   Pavol Doroff, who is the creator of Telegram, which
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:27.720]   is an immensely popular messaging app,
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:30.160]   close to a billion users now, says,
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:33.160]   we suspect Apple may be intentionally crippling its web
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:36.520]   apps to force users to download more native apps where
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:40.600]   Apple's able to charge that 30% commission.
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.120]   He's actually--
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:45.720]   is one of many developers who are calling on Apple to provide
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:48.600]   a better experience in Safari.
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:51.120]   So I'm hoping they fix it.
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:51.640]   Yeah.
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.240]   Oh, it's an interesting footnote.
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:57.480]   I can no longer say, well, gee, if on the Google Play
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:00.720]   store they allow companies to sell things without the 30%.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:01.960]   How can Apple do it?
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:04.680]   Now Google has recently tightened up their own rules.
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:07.880]   So I can no longer buy comic books directly
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:10.360]   through a comic-sology app on Android anymore.
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:12.600]   So that's unfortunately that's a battle
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:13.840]   that we seem to have lost.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:20.520]   Here is Doroff points to Telegram developers
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:24.560]   post on the WebKit channel about all the things he wishes
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:26.040]   mobile Safari could do.
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:27.600]   Push notifications is number one.
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:31.360]   That will now be a feature of the next version of iOS.
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:34.880]   There's some other issues like text fields moving around,
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:39.520]   centering, even if you don't want them to center.
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:42.560]   There's other random reloading unsupported video stickers.
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:45.400]   No up with support, no shared workers, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:50.360]   Many of these will be, I think, solved with progressive
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:51.200]   web apps.
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:53.960]   I think if Apple really pushes the envelope
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:56.720]   of the progressive apps, it would take a lot of pressure off.
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:57.720]   Yeah, that's--
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:58.560]   Well, that's a thriving--
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:00.440]   The only reason they do it, I understand.
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:02.600]   But there's a good reason.
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.040]   Do it, please.
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:05.040]   I beg of you.
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:08.960]   Let's see.
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:13.200]   Bruce Schneier writing on his blog, Schneier.com.
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:17.680]   With a warning, he says he supports two Senate bills,
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:20.240]   the American Innovation and Choice Online Act
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:23.800]   and the OpenApp Markets Act, both intended
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:25.320]   to reduce power to tech monopolies.
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:28.640]   But he also points out there are provisions in there
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:32.080]   that could be used to break end to end encryption.
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:35.960]   And the carve outs for E2E are two weak, he says,
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:40.240]   and to vague, to protect encryption.
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:40.840]   Yeah, Schneier.
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:42.240]   I wonder why that would be the case now.
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:45.040]   I wonder why in a country that's part of the Five Eyes.
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.920]   I just wonder why you would put something in care.
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:49.040]   Use quietly, like, why don't we just insert this in your--
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.040]   Yeah.
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:51.560]   Let's see.
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:52.720]   There's one that says--
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:37:01.400]   in S2992, which is the American Innovation and Choice Online
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:04.920]   Act, would allow a company to deny access
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:08.560]   to apps installed by users where there's app makers have
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:10.360]   been identified by the federal government
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:13.480]   as national security intelligence or law enforcement
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:17.840]   risks, which means Apple could--
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:24.400]   if FBI says, hey, this encryption gets in our way, boom.
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:25.760]   That's all it takes.
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:28.240]   It makes it impossible for Apple and other companies
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:30.440]   to work the way they usually would say, hey, look,
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:34.520]   we don't even have any data whatsoever that could be used
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:37.440]   by even us to break this encryption that will basically--
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.040]   even if they maintain this as an end-to-end encryption,
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:42.160]   they will have to create--
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.640]   according to the reading of this law,
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:46.040]   they would have to create a system so that they could retrieve
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:47.440]   the keys if they had to.
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:51.200]   And once the door is open, you can't shut it again.
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:54.040]   He points out that, for instance,
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:57.760]   Apple could block third-party services
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:01.040]   from offering competing end-to-end encrypted backups
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:04.240]   of iMessage, because right now iMessage has a backdoor
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.880]   on the cloud that Apple can hand over
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:10.400]   unencrypted iCloud backups from messaging apps.
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:12.320]   And they would then say, well, that's
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:13.800]   why we can't have any competition here,
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:19.240]   because then you would be able to hide from the law enforcement.
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:22.600]   It's amazing how sophisticated lawmakers understand
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:25.800]   of delicate technology is when it comes to removing
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:27.120]   our rights from us.
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.760]   When it comes to figuring out how to put a plug
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:31.520]   out of a cable--
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:32.960]   Because they didn't write that part.
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:34.280]   Like, that's why it's--
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:35.120]   It was clear.
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:36.880]   That's a very good point.
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:38.960]   That was written by the intelligence agencies.
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:42.440]   It was put in in a way that looked as simple as possible,
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:44.680]   but gave them what the tools that they need for this.
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:46.680]   That's what these bills are about.
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:47.200]   Right.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.880]   They're set, which I said six months ago.
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.800]   So let's--
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:53.440]   But Shania says, on balance, he would
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:54.560]   like to see these bills pass.
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:56.800]   But these are-- you've really got to resolve these issues
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:58.000]   before they do.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:38:58.920]   That's a lot.
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:00.520]   There was an interesting thread on Twitter
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:02.920]   where they talked about the reason we get into a lot of situations
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:05.000]   we are is that you have a bunch of reasonable people
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.600]   in the middle who just assume that these laws will work out.
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:10.000]   Like, they'll say, oh, that's an extreme example.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.200]   That'll never happen.
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:12.520]   You don't have to worry about that.
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:14.160]   And so they don't push to have anything codified.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:17.260]   And nothing that isn't codified in the law ever actually
[01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:18.240]   really happens.
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:20.320]   So they'll say, oh, it's an extreme law,
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:21.880]   but everyone will be totally reasonable about it
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:22.760]   when it's actually in place.
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:23.480]   And it never is.
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:26.000]   So it's really important to fight that to have everything
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.240]   that you know is important in enshrined in the law
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.880]   when it is first passed.
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:32.480]   Also that there are no accidents in the drafting
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:33.640]   of this legislation.
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:37.600]   Just last week, Massachusetts struck down a--
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:43.400]   or rather, throughout a voter question that
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:46.320]   was due for November on whether or not
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:49.080]   gig companies like Uber could classify their workers
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:51.240]   as contractors instead of employees.
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:52.720]   And the reason why it got thrown out
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:56.280]   was because in big, big, bold letters at the top,
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:59.480]   it said, we want to be able to classify our gig workers
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:01.880]   as the contractors and not employees.
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:05.120]   But then if you kept reading page after page after page,
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:09.040]   the subscript of page 18 paragraph, whatever, was, oh,
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:12.000]   and by the way, our company is going to be absolutely
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.880]   and completely indemnified against any crimes or accidents
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:18.840]   created by anybody working for us as a contractor.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:21.280]   And what would you know, the state Supreme Court actually
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:24.680]   read down that far and said, no, no, no, you can't do that.
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:26.680]   You can't deceive the voter that way.
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:28.880]   And so therefore, we're throwing out your ballot question
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:30.800]   that you worked so hard and spent so much money
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:32.200]   to get on the November ballot.
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:34.720]   So yeah, nothing is in these laws by accident.
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:36.640]   The wording is very, very well chosen.
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:40.880]   And as Alex said, it's usually provided to the legislators
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:44.760]   by either a special interest group or intelligence switches
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:46.160]   and other special interest group.
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:47.120]   - Yeah.
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:50.200]   Good article in the Sentinel One blog about new security
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:52.160]   features in Ventura.
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:54.160]   Here's one I didn't know about, Renee, you knew
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:56.760]   because you're probably running the public beta,
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:58.720]   or am I sorry, the developer beta public beta
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:40:59.800]   is next month.
[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:02.600]   But there's no more system preference pains.
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:06.880]   Oh my God, how many years have I had to bend my tongue
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:10.240]   around the phrase system preference pains?
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:13.000]   Instead of just saying, go to the settings.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.640]   - Yeah, controversial though, because it really
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:15.520]   is the settings app.
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:17.200]   And it's not fully cooked yet.
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:18.480]   People were complaining.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:20.920]   John Gruber, during the talk show, asked Craig.
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:23.200]   He's like, there used to be these beautiful animations,
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:25.840]   these beautiful videos of how to use the trackpad.
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:26.680]   And that's all gone.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:28.240]   And that looks like a terrible iPhone sheet.
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:30.080]   And Craig's like, we need new videos.
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:30.840]   They're not ready yet.
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.680]   We didn't want us cram the old videos in there.
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:34.520]   So there will be videos, good.
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:35.360]   All right.
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:37.320]   - Yeah, so it's not finished yet, but it is settings.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:38.320]   And not everyone is happy about that.
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.600]   - I think that makes sense.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:41.720]   That's what everybody calls them.
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.680]   That's what they should be, period.
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:46.040]   - But also, nonetheless, people who are writing
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:48.680]   about accessibility have pointed out that the new style
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:50.920]   makes it much more accessible when you have a video
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:52.360]   that explains how to do something.
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:55.720]   It's not necessarily, unless they cook in a lot
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:59.480]   of talk over things to make it work for people
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:01.280]   who can't necessarily see that.
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:05.560]   - It's, I don't know, it's, I don't know
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:07.080]   what's the right question.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.480]   I know which way I think is prettier.
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:12.280]   I know which way is clearer, but I don't know
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:15.520]   which way is better for the entirety of macOS users.
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:19.600]   - Honestly, since most Mac OS users will also be using iPhones,
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:21.600]   many will be using iPads.
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:25.320]   Consistent naming convention, a consistent look
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:26.680]   is not a bad thing.
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:27.520]   - It's a user benefit.
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:29.560]   - Consistency is a user benefit, but people are changing
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.280]   the universe. - Yeah, I understand.
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:32.760]   - Well, it depends.
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:34.960]   Sometimes they change, just to be consistent.
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:36.360]   They take away something that works well.
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:40.320]   I would be very disappointed if preferences for the app
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:42.280]   that I'm looking at right now was not underneath
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:44.720]   the application menu that I have to now go into settings,
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:48.200]   find the tile or find the line item that refers to
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:50.120]   this app and then there's a setting in there.
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:51.160]   I think that's ridiculous.
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:53.480]   - I'm very used to going to the Apple menu.
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:54.360]   - It'll hot link you in.
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:56.680]   - If it says Apple and if it says settings,
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:59.040]   not system preferences, I'm fine with that.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:01.160]   I think that's just modernizing it.
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:05.360]   It will be a very long list of settings.
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:08.240]   You'll have to get used to using that search.
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:09.160]   - That would be easier to find.
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:10.000]   - Scroll.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:10.840]   - It's just gonna be way easier to do it.
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:11.680]   - Search and scroll.
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:12.520]   - Yeah.
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:17.120]   A big change, Sentinel one points out,
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:20.800]   is now you can manage login items, launch agents
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:24.960]   and launch demons all from a single place in system settings.
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:29.960]   And anytime anything adds a persistent login item,
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:32.720]   you will get notified about it
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:35.640]   and you will be able to turn it off in the settings
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:38.880]   and that's a long, long needed update.
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:42.920]   It's really, I think many users don't know
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:44.840]   all the different places you can look
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:47.920]   to find launch agents and other persistent--
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:48.760]   - It's labyrinthian, right?
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:52.640]   - It's labyrinthian, launch demons, is it a login item?
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:53.640]   Is it a launch demon?
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:54.480]   Is it a launch agent?
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:57.240]   Why doesn't it show up in the system preference pane?
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:58.600]   - One of the nice things about iOS is that--
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:43:59.440]   - I think we have this.
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:01.160]   - If something applies in multiple areas,
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:02.640]   they put them in all those areas.
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:04.320]   Like I shouldn't have to know the one place
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:05.160]   that it's in--
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:07.040]   - It's all, well, it'll all, but I think it'll all be
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.000]   in the settings.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.320]   - And I think, isn't, didn't we have this in Mac OS 7,
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:12.440]   like startup items?
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.000]   Like it was just like, there was a,
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000]   as I remember it, there was like a startup item thing
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.960]   where everything that was gonna start up was available.
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:19.640]   - It's one of those things that grows like Topsy.
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:21.600]   You know, they add a here and then they put it there
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:23.240]   and they put it here and then pretty soon
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:24.320]   you got 15 different places.
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:26.480]   - Yes, and by the way, in terms of modernizing
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.200]   system preferences, remember that in System 6.02,
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:32.800]   it was a list of things and you have to click on each one
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:33.640]   to get the sub item.
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:37.120]   So maybe we're taking a once and one step into the,
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:38.920]   one step into the past, a half step.
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:40.840]   - Back to the future, yes.
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:46.400]   Anyway, I think fantastic to have at least one place,
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.200]   and I hope this is the case where we can go
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:51.360]   and see all the items that launch on login.
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:52.200]   That will be--
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:53.360]   - We'll give them everything.
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:56.880]   - Huge, huge, huge.
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:58.920]   - Boot into verbose mode by default.
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:01.720]   - You get to hold down three keys in order to not see
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:02.920]   the kernel loading in.
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:07.920]   - Yeah, and there's a new endpoint security logger.
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.080]   Okay, I don't know anything about that,
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:12.840]   but apparently Sentinel one's very excited about,
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:13.880]   yes, logger.
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:17.440]   We'll let you know more about what's going on
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:20.240]   with your machine, it will support DNS sec,
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:24.560]   which is really good and much needed, secure DNS.
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:26.480]   Steve keeps us talking a lot about DNS sec.
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:31.480]   So having that built into the OS improvement, good.
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:33.160]   A plus Apple.
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:38.080]   I've been for, and I haven't,
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:41.360]   last three or four in Mycadosis, 'cause he sees me,
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:44.280]   put it into the show, run down and then take it out.
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:46.760]   Wanting to recommend Diablo Immortal.
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:52.920]   I pre-ordered it, 'cause I'm a huge Diablo nerd.
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:57.520]   I loved all the Diablo games, played 'em for hundreds of hours,
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:59.640]   and I got it the minute it came out,
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:03.200]   and I've put it since that week, which is like a month ago,
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:05.040]   every week as my ran, and then take it out
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:06.080]   of the recommendations.
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:08.160]   Not because I don't love it, I do love it.
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:12.400]   The problem is, it's funny because reviewers
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:14.280]   are giving it high reviews, users are getting it,
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:17.120]   terrible reviews, 'cause of its loot box mechanics.
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:19.800]   And the real problem, which is,
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:22.600]   if you're willing to pay literally hundreds,
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:25.000]   if not thousands of dollars, you can be--
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.840]   Hundreds of thousands of dollars to max your character.
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:28.360]   You can be the best.
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:29.800]   Yeah, you can be the best, yes.
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:34.880]   100, if you're a beast, you have the best character ever.
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:36.680]   Jez from Windows Central to his credit
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:38.800]   wrote a screed about how terrible this is.
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:41.440]   This is peak sleazy monetization at its worst,
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.320]   and needs to be regulated, which if you know Jez
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:45.000]   from Windows Central, he is the biggest fanboy
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:45.960]   of every game ever.
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:49.280]   So for them to have done this to him is a tragedy.
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.520]   I will say this, and I agree with Joseph Cox writing
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:54.120]   for motherboard and vice.
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:56.760]   He says, "How I learned to stop caring about Diablo
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:58.880]   "immortal's pay to win mechanics."
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:02.560]   You can still play it for free forever.
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:06.320]   You may be beaten by people, but it's still quite,
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:10.460]   I enjoy it, it's fun, it's Diablo on your phone or iPad.
[01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:13.720]   I'm not crazy, and I never have been,
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:15.440]   I've said this many times, you just say it all the time
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:20.440]   on iOS today about how controls are on work on the iPad
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:24.440]   where you have to do your thumb on a phony controller
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:25.280]   and all that.
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:27.920]   But that's Diablo, it was always designed
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:30.800]   around a gaming controller, not around touch.
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:32.160]   Did you see the stream this weekend, Leo,
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:34.640]   where I forget his name, he spent $15,000
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:38.200]   to get his first 100% gem and then deleted it
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:40.120]   through his computer, but figured it'd lead
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:42.160]   through his computer and deleted the game.
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:43.760]   Oh, just a protest.
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:46.520]   - That'll show him giving him $15,000.
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:48.800]   - Yeah, boy, take that.
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:50.000]   Take that, Blizzard.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.560]   - Yeah, it'd be nice not to have microtransactions
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:55.560]   in loot boxes, and it certainly would be nice
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:58.440]   not to get beat by somebody who spent thousands of dollars
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:47:59.280]   to beef up the game. - And then you're just
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:00.960]   a shamelessness, like people don't mind paying
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:02.360]   a little bit, but the shamelessness,
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:04.920]   like the $100,000 mark, I think, put people off.
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:07.240]   - Yeah, and I think that if you feel like you could work
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:08.880]   your way up to it and you don't want to spend the money,
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:11.720]   like as I've said before, like the game that I really
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:15.000]   enjoy is Kingdom Rush, and you can definitely buy
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.560]   a lot of things, I just never have.
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:18.240]   I just sit there and I just play a certain,
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:20.640]   I can play it out and just start building up coins
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:22.160]   until I buy what I need.
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:27.160]   And I think that that is a good model
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:29.800]   is that you could work your way up to it,
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:31.520]   but I think with Diablo, it doesn't feel like you.
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:32.360]   I mean, you couldn't.
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:35.160]   - I think if you don't spend money,
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.200]   you will never be at the highest level.
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:42.200]   But I just, it's still a fun game to play,
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:44.480]   but I never wanted to be on the leaderboard,
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:46.760]   I never was good enough to be there anyway.
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:48.880]   So it's really, it affects people who,
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:51.200]   I guess are really talented gamers.
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:52.760]   - It's a good model to make money.
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:56.120]   - Yeah, I think it's an obstacle towards people
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:59.240]   getting into the game or getting into gaming to begin with.
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:03.440]   The one type of like, of triple eight style game
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:05.080]   that I like are racing games.
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:07.360]   And every time I try a new one,
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:08.640]   it's like, okay, great.
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.160]   I had a great time driving around this track very, very badly,
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:13.840]   but I'm looking forward to going again.
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:16.960]   But no, instead of just saying, oh, let's go for another race,
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:17.800]   let's go for another run.
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:19.520]   I was like, hey, you finished great.
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:21.560]   Now, hey, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:22.920]   Now here you are in the garage.
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:24.120]   Do you wanna upgrade your tires?
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:25.720]   Do you wanna get into the very, do you wanna,
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:27.800]   maybe you should upgrade your fuel system.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:30.280]   I said, no, I want to go back onto the,
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:33.280]   gas me up, new tires, put me back on the track
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:34.880]   so I can continue to drive.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:37.720]   And drive like a Massachusetts person
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:40.160]   without any of the insurance points affecting me.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:44.000]   By the way, you can now buy,
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.680]   even though you can't get a midnight blue MacBook Air,
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:52.680]   the dual USB support compact power adapters for $59.
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:54.200]   This is one place I feel like Apple
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:55.360]   has really fallen behind.
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:57.600]   Like I would never buy, I mean,
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.400]   I buy a lot of Apple products.
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:00.680]   No, but not never the charges.
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:01.600]   Are not one of them.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:02.440]   Never the charges.
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:03.280]   Never the charges.
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:04.680]   With the GAN technology, you're kinda like,
[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:06.800]   I've got so many things that I can plug into
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:08.680]   of all these different formats that work for me.
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:09.880]   And I just feel like, I mean,
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:11.360]   it's nice that Apple makes them, I guess.
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:12.800]   You have to make them, right?
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:16.200]   But 35 watts, you're like, it's so small,
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:17.040]   like it's so tiny.
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:19.840]   Like why would I do 35 watts for two of them?
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:20.720]   No, no.
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:23.200]   And there's so many great charges out there, anchor.
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:24.040]   Yeah.
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:25.520]   So many great charges out there.
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:26.720]   The only difference with this one,
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.520]   and I don't think it's compelling, is that it's smart.
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:32.400]   It doesn't just push out raw charge through both outlets.
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:34.080]   It measures the capacity of the devices
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:36.000]   and then can adjust the relative charge
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.680]   depending on what needs something at a given time.
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:40.560]   At least on paper, most of them are.
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:42.400]   Most of them are, most of the newer ones that are,
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.240]   I mean, that are actually a little bit more expensive
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:45.920]   than the Apple one.
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:47.840]   They at least claim to, I don't know if they do or not,
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:48.880]   but they seem to, I don't know,
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:50.680]   they charge my devices really well.
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:53.360]   95Mac had the rundown saying that if you connect
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:55.480]   a Mac on a notebook and an iPhone or iPad,
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:57.800]   each device receives up to 17 and a half watts.
[01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:59.480]   If you connect an iPhone and an iPad,
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:01.960]   each receives up to 17 and a half watts.
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:04.960]   But if you connect a Mac notebook or iPhone
[01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:07.080]   and an Apple Watch or iPad or AirPods,
[01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:10.120]   the notebook or iPhone receives up to 27 and a half watts.
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:13.440]   And the Apple Watch or AirPods receive up to seven and a half watts.
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:16.920]   But yeah, the whole point of chargers is having one,
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:18.520]   having multiples of them.
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:20.480]   You have to have like a half a dozen of them.
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:23.120]   One in every bag, one next to every place
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:25.880]   that you are likely to be doing more than an hour's worth of work.
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:29.280]   And so if I don't care how nicely designed the Apple charger is,
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:31.280]   I'm sure it's wonderfully designed,
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:34.040]   I'd much rather have something that has a more dull,
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:36.800]   a more dull, gray, easier to manufacture, finish
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:40.600]   and have an extra, an extra 65 watt charger
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:43.520]   than be stuck with just one Apple 35 watt charger.
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:48.040]   Those of us who have been using Macs since 1984
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:51.560]   are very familiar with Claris, the cow dog.
[01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:57.280]   Claris, dog cow, pardon me, oh God, oh, I deserved to,
[01:51:57.280 --> 01:51:58.760]   I deserved to be spanked for that.
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:00.840]   Oof, oof, oof.
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:11.920]   That is, Claris is back, baby, in the new Mac OS Ventura Printer Dialogue,
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:16.200]   at least according to the shadow facts blog.
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:18.880]   This is on the left, the original Claris, the dog cow.
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:22.760]   I think the problem is the new one has,
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:25.760]   the ear goes up instead of like a little wag,
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:26.840]   look at the front ear.
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:28.520]   Doesn't wag down properly.
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:29.520]   That's what I want to know.
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:31.920]   Well, 'cause this one is vector,
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:34.080]   so you can scale it all the way up.
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:36.000]   But the thing is, I think there's going to be
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.160]   sort of like a philosophical debate where is Claris,
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:43.120]   is Claris blocky because it was,
[01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:45.600]   because Claris was originally created to be a,
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:47.880]   be in a system font from the original Mac,
[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:51.440]   or is that just simply the nature of Claris to be blocky
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:53.720]   and if you scale it up, you're supposed to scale it up a lot?
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:55.720]   But I think, I just feel like there's character there.
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:58.000]   There's, look at the eye, the ratio of the eye
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.600]   to the ear, the tail, like all these things
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:02.120]   you could have kept when you built that out
[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:04.200]   and they smooth those out.
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:05.920]   Like the tail has still got so much more character
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:06.760]   in the old one.
[01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:08.360]   And it's got, you've got more resolution now.
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:09.360]   I'm really upset about that.
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:10.720]   It's very dramatic for me.
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:13.440]   The blog post is great because it does go into,
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:15.440]   like he was trying to, they were trying to figure out,
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:16.640]   wait, am I imagining this?
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:19.040]   Is this just like an individual programmer who did this?
[01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:22.360]   But he did verify that it happens in the pre-venture app.
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:24.160]   Does not happen in Merrick Mavergaps.
[01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:27.880]   He goes deep into the app kit hop file
[01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:30.400]   and he means really digging through the...
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:32.080]   (laughing)
[01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:34.680]   And the payoff for scrolling to the bottom
[01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:38.360]   is a link to a PDF version of the new Vector Clares.
[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:39.480]   And yes, I did download it.
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:42.280]   Yes, I did scale it up to be like absolutely huge.
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:43.280]   And it's like, you know what?
[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:47.040]   I don't, I'm not willing to say that this is the Clares
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:49.040]   that I grew up with in the 80s.
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:52.160]   However, perhaps it's like on Iron Chef,
[01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:54.880]   like on the Netflix version, you don't get Chairman Kaga,
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:56.760]   you get Chairman Kaga's nephew.
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:57.960]   He's still introducing the Iron Chefs.
[01:53:57.960 --> 01:53:58.880]   I think this is what we're,
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:01.280]   I think this is Clares' nephew.
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:02.840]   I think it's kind of like someone got a facelift
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:04.200]   and you're like, ooh, you shouldn't have done that.
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:07.400]   You know, like it looks smoother, but it's like,
[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:10.000]   hmm, you know, you lost the character of who you are.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.160]   So I think it's Dolly version of...
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:17.000]   Let's zoom in on Clares, the dog, how.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.400]   There's not as many wrinkles, but...
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:21.000]   But PDF, how big can it get?
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:21.840]   Go in forever.
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:22.960]   You can get as long as you want.
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:25.440]   But I think that they, I think that there was just
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:26.880]   the easy stuff that you could have kept there.
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:27.720]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:28.560]   - Okay.
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:33.320]   - I almost, I saw this, I almost opened up the Infinity Designer.
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:34.920]   It was like, I gotta do this again.
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:35.920]   - I gotta get it right.
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:38.680]   - I gotta say that that's probably a much easier Clares
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:40.280]   to tattoo than the Bitmap version.
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:41.280]   - Yes, that's true.
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:42.640]   - You don't need someone who's good at getting
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:43.840]   pulling nice sharp lines.
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:46.240]   - It's not the bits that are black, though.
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:47.880]   - They're black, it's beyond point, but yeah.
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:50.120]   - The shapes are clearly different.
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:51.440]   The shapes are clearly different.
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:53.600]   And you've lost some of the,
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:55.240]   like the faces that's shorter now,
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:57.800]   but the ear doesn't have the character.
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:54:59.840]   There's so many things that are wrong with that.
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:01.080]   - Did you know Clara's gone?
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:03.800]   - Did you rename immediately print something
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:06.240]   from your macOS Ventura just to have it?
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:08.040]   - I haven't owned a printer in like 20 years.
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:13.040]   - Oh, here's the history of the dog cow.
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:18.760]   Clara's the dog, goof, goof, goof, goof, goof.
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:20.360]   This is all Susan Care's work.
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:22.920]   You can blame Susan Care for this, the great.
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:23.760]   - She's a good one.
[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:24.600]   - She's a good one.
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:28.520]   - Clara's was the official symbol of Apple,
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:30.760]   Mac and Dell of developer support.
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:34.640]   So this is like, it used to be like in 1985,
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:37.320]   like it would be, you would suck up to any,
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:39.280]   like member of the developer team you bumped into
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:42.120]   at Mac role, 'cause they would probably have a green move,
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:44.480]   green move pin, and you just wanna make sure
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:46.760]   you have a move pin or else you're not,
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:47.600]   you're not one of the cool people.
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:48.440]   - I wanna move pin.
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:50.640]   - That's in somebody's, isn't it a famous story
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:52.280]   where like Steve goes, we're getting rid of everything.
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:53.520]   We're getting rid of all this old stuff.
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:55.000]   And they're like, Steve, you can't, it's history.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.080]   It's like, you tell them they have 24 hours to salvage
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:00.560]   anything that they want or it's gonna be gone.
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:01.960]   And then so I think all that stuff
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:03.480]   is in people's garages now.
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:06.300]   - I've managed to buy like an official
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:08.660]   Clara's move watch before the hammer
[01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:10.800]   fell down on all the licensing stuff.
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:13.440]   And now it's like, there are two watches,
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:15.040]   no, actually three watches that I own
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:16.560]   that I'm scared to wear.
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:18.800]   One is the beautiful watch that my mom gave me
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:21.520]   for my 21st birthday, which is too nice to wear.
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:23.880]   The second is my Millennium Falcon watch
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:26.080]   that I bought three of because I loved it so much.
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:28.440]   And I'm down to my last one, I don't wanna break it.
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:31.640]   And my Clara's the dog cow watch because again,
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:34.800]   it's too nice, I don't want anything to happen to it.
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:37.440]   - Here is a Clara's, the dog cow,
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:40.000]   merry-go-round, rendered in quick time.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:45.000]   In 1991, each video took over 24 hours
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.520]   on a Mac 2FX.
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:51.320]   (laughing)
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:53.920]   - It was hard to do this stuff back in the day.
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:56.120]   You know, we've come a long way.
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:59.160]   All right, get your pics ready, boys, because--
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:01.680]   - Alio, I have one last thing if we can just quickly
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:03.160]   get into a terrible fight at the end of the show.
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:05.000]   - Oh, that'd be wonderful, yes.
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.760]   - I was gonna say Microsoft being forced
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:10.640]   to repatriate data to Paris, Apple being forced
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:13.160]   to repatriate data to China, and now TikTok
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:15.760]   being forced to repatriate data to the US.
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:17.400]   I know those are all very different countries,
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:19.040]   but we seem to have very different reactions
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:20.480]   to all the different data-patriation laws.
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:24.440]   - We talked about TikTok on Sunday on The Big Show on Twitch,
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:29.440]   and I mean, who do you trust with your data more?
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:32.680]   The Chinese Communist Party or Oracle?
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:34.800]   - Honestly, I don't know.
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:35.640]   - Honestly.
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:38.160]   - That was not the twist I was expecting on that hot take deal.
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:42.560]   - Honestly, Larry and his samurai suits.
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:45.000]   - I'm no fan of the Chinese Communist Party,
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.640]   but I don't think they're gonna do anything with my name.
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:49.120]   - Also, their access doesn't change
[01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:51.000]   depending on where the data's stored.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.840]   - I would like to introduce as a topic of evidence
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:56.240]   in this discussion that Chinese Communist Party
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:00.880]   would be the enemies in a 1970s or 80s Bond movie.
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:03.200]   Oracle would be the name of the evil company
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:06.360]   or the last name of the evil guy in an 80s or 90s Bond movie.
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:07.520]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:09.560]   - So I don't know if that plays in, but--
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:13.400]   - I'm going with the 70s evil villain.
[01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:15.160]   - And a ceremonial cheese puff.
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:16.400]   - I feel like that moment,
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:18.200]   that question is kind of a Larry David moment.
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:19.040]   - I know.
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:20.600]   (laughing)
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:21.440]   - No.
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:22.520]   - Exactly.
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:24.640]   - At least no one will have access to it if it's on Oracle.
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:26.200]   I mean, that's the same part.
[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:27.920]   - How can, well, the thing is, I mean--
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:29.200]   - Every hacker.
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:31.080]   - I got a trust a guy named Larry.
[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:33.400]   So as I found out his name was Larry Allison,
[01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:35.680]   it's sort of a brotherhood of Larry's.
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:38.120]   I don't know any Larry Chinese people.
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:40.680]   The only thing making perfect is if he were bald.
[01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:43.440]   - Good cheese puffs.
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:44.280]   - Well, that was fun.
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:45.120]   I appreciate that though.
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:47.160]   - Thank you for bringing that up.
[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:49.000]   - And now, a word from our sponsor
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.040]   while you prepare your picks of the week.
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:54.640]   - Clarice the dog cow.
[01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:56.560]   Not the cow dog.
[01:58:56.560 --> 01:58:58.600]   The dog cow, let's get that right.
[01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:02.440]   (laughing)
[01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:07.440]   Our share today brought to you by Zachtok.
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:10.200]   You know, I love this idea.
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:11.040]   I love this idea.
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:13.400]   There's some amazing doctors out there,
[01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:15.240]   but what good is a doctor
[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:17.080]   who doesn't take your insurance, right?
[01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:21.480]   With Zachtok, you can focus on doctors who are in network,
[01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:23.280]   putting you on the path to see the doctors
[01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:24.320]   who are right for you.
[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:26.300]   You don't have to waste time hunting down
[01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:28.440]   Aunt Shirley's cash, only chiropractor,
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:31.240]   or the dentist, your coworker recommended
[01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:32.720]   who's out of your network.
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:34.880]   No one knows what you're looking for in a doctor
[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:36.200]   better than you.
[01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:37.840]   And no one's better at giving you the tools
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:41.960]   to find the perfect doctor than Zachtok.
[01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:44.800]   The people who created Zachtok found the major pain points
[01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:47.040]   in healthcare, all the things that weren't working.
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:49.680]   They said, "Enough as great entrepreneurs do."
[01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:53.600]   They made a booking of great doctors surprisingly pain free.
[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:55.000]   Now this is a free app.
[01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:58.760]   It shows you doctors who are patient reviewed,
[01:59:58.760 --> 01:59:59.960]   take your insurance.
[01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:03.320]   They're also available when you need them.
[02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:04.400]   All three are very important,
[02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:06.360]   but I love the patient review part
[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:10.840]   because you want a doctor that patients like.
[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:14.040]   We've all had that doctor who's just a jerk.
[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:14.880]   (laughing)
[02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:17.280]   No, no, I want to know ahead of time.
[02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:19.560]   Read up on local doctors, get verified,
[02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:21.560]   patient reviews, see whether the real humans
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:23.040]   had to say about their visit.
[02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:24.600]   So when you walk into that doctor's office,
[02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:27.960]   you're set up to see someone in your network who gets you.
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:32.520]   Z-O-C-D-O-C, zachtok.com.
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:33.880]   Go there, choose a time slot,
[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:35.560]   whether you want to see the doctor in person,
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:38.640]   or do a video visit, and just like that, you're booked.
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:40.040]   You find the doctor that's right for you,
[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:42.560]   book an appointment that works for your schedule.
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:45.280]   Every month millions of people use Zachtok.

[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:49.400]   and book a doctor.
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:52.160]   And the chaotic world of healthcare let Zachtok

[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:25.640]   That way they know you saw it here, zachtok.com/macbreak.
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:28.600]   I so rarely have a pick.
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:31.520]   I'm gonna kick the picks of the week off this week
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:36.000]   because I saw a post from Harper,
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.960]   twitter.com/harper, one of my heroes.
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:43.000]   I love Harper, he worked in the Obama administration,
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000]   smart guy, fully geek.
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:48.840]   He was on an airplane and he saw a CO2 measurement,
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:52.560]   a carbon dioxide measurement, nearly of 2000.
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:55.600]   And he said, "I thought airplane air was supposed to be good."
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:58.000]   Now it's important in the year of COVID
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.360]   that there be ventilation on an airplane.
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:03.000]   So I thought, "Well, I'm taking a couple of trips.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.520]   I'm gonna go back east next week.
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:07.320]   I'm gonna go to Alaska, first Seattle,
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:09.880]   then Alaska in a month."
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:10.720]   So I bought this.
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:13.520]   This is an Aranet for about 250 bucks.
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:15.680]   And it does actually three things.
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:19.040]   It tells you the CO2 parts per million.
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:21.720]   It tells you the current temperature and the humidity.
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:25.080]   So it actually is a really good indicator of a comfort level.
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:28.440]   OSHA says the carbon dioxide,
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:30.960]   which is the, what we are exhaling.
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:34.320]   Level and air can be as high as 5,000.
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:36.440]   After that, you might pass out.
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:38.200]   (laughs)
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:41.320]   Studies show, in fact, somebody who I was talking about this
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:46.360]   on Saturday and a listener sent me a very interesting study
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:50.000]   that showed that in fact, when the CO2 level reaches
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.440]   as high as a thousand, you lose about 25%
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:53.840]   of your cognitive ability.
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:58.040]   1500, you're talking about 50% of your cognitive ability.
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:01.360]   It's a big, big deal.
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:04.120]   So I thought, "Well, I'm gonna be on an airplane.
[02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:05.120]   I think I'm gonna try this.
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:08.600]   This is the Aranet for, I didn't get the pro version."
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:10.240]   It does tidy your smartphone.
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:15.240]   So you can see, you know, on your smartphone,
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:18.720]   you can see a graph of all the measurements.
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:21.560]   It is from A-R-A-N-E-T.com.
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:24.480]   I'm not necessarily recommending this,
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:28.160]   but before I fly, I think I kinda wanna know
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:30.240]   what it's gonna be like.
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:33.320]   And not like it can open a window on the airplane or anything,
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:36.600]   but I think it's a good thing to collect.
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:41.160]   So I have it, and it's 540 parts per million right now,
[02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:42.560]   which is very good.
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:44.160]   By the way, this is something you might wanna use
[02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:46.800]   in sealed offices too, because often sealed offices
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:48.960]   don't add enough fresh air to the mix.
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:50.360]   Like, that's why I'm always getting tired
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:51.200]   in sealed offices.
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:53.760]   Yeah, it's exactly what.
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:57.760]   Classrooms, you know, they don't open the windows.
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:00.680]   And the reason airplanes, I think, are so high,
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:05.280]   after reading all of this, I think the reason airplanes
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:07.600]   are so high is because it's not that they're not
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:09.160]   filtering the air with HEPA filters.
[02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:11.320]   So maybe they are taking COVID particles
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:12.920]   and other viruses out of the air,
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:15.000]   but they don't wanna put in fresh air
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.640]   'cause it's freezing and they have to heat it.
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:19.600]   And it's just, it's expensive.
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:21.400]   It also adds to the drag on the airplane.
[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:22.560]   So it's a costly thing to do.
[02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:25.560]   So they limit the amount of fresh air being mixed in.
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:27.720]   And tanks of oxygen are not a good idea.
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:28.760]   No, not an airplane.
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:30.640]   They start thinking they can't think of it.
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:32.440]   They can let the outside air in.
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:34.520]   I mean, they're not, you know, they're not without--
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:35.480]   Open a window.
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:36.880]   Yeah, exactly, like crack a window.
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:38.280]   Yeah, I wish I could.
[02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:41.800]   Anyway, here it is from Aaronette.
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:42.640]   And, you know?
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:46.000]   I'll tell you what, I'll be bringing back pictures
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.240]   of my CO2 level.
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:50.680]   It's like Andy with his Holsteins.
[02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:52.000]   You just have to have that little thing around.
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:52.840]   I could, I have it everywhere.
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:53.760]   All over the world, you know.
[02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:55.400]   Yeah, here's a picture of the restaurant.
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:56.920]   It was 483, amazing.
[02:04:56.920 --> 02:04:59.240]   Yeah, I mean, when I saw this from Harper,
[02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:01.240]   I thought, well, this is going to be a, you know,
[02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:03.600]   this is going to be a big issue.
[02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:05.200]   But then I realized, oh, no, they're
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:06.720]   probably filtering the air.
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:09.560]   It's just they're not putting fresh air into the air
[02:05:09.560 --> 02:05:11.560]   because it's, you know, for energy reasons.
[02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:13.000]   And I knew that airplanes did that.
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:18.240]   So normally, this would be a kind of proxy for, you know,
[02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:19.480]   COVID, right?
[02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:21.760]   Because ventilation is very closely related.
[02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:25.600]   But probably in an airplane, it's not a perfect proxy.
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:27.440]   So there you have it.
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:33.280]   Ladies and gentlemen, the era for my pick of the week,
[02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:34.960]   plus also the Cal digit.
[02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:36.080]   I almost brought that in.
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:39.600]   And I thought, no, I'm never letting it on my site.
[02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:42.320]   And of course, planters, cheese balls or odds.
[02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:43.720]   I don't know.
[02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:44.600]   And Diablo.
[02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:45.480]   And Diablo.
[02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:47.040]   Immortal.
[02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:48.920]   All I need are these apps.
[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:55.560]   Renee Richie, pick of the week.
[02:05:55.560 --> 02:05:58.880]   All right, so mine is just 100% absolutely delightful.
[02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:01.720]   There's a YouTuber named Patrick H. Willems, who
[02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:04.560]   did a lot of like, you do video essays on movies and TV
[02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:05.160]   shows.
[02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:08.040]   He got really famous by dissecting the color grading
[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:10.920]   of Marvel movies and why he hates it so much.
[02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:13.680]   But he's just, he's a brilliant film theorist.
[02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:15.320]   And during the pandemic, ended up staying
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:16.760]   at getting stuck at his parents' place.
[02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:19.960]   So he started doing this weird narrative intermix
[02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:23.600]   into his essays where a googly-eyed coconut
[02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:25.160]   became his best friend.
[02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:27.560]   And it turned out over the intervening years
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:29.640]   that he was a Patrick from an alternate dimension
[02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:31.920]   who was a tax evader who had came and replaced
[02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:33.520]   our YouTuber Patrick.
[02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:36.920]   And it all built up to now he has done a full length, 90-minute
[02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:40.160]   feature film on Nebula, which you can just
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:40.800]   play the trailer, Leo.
[02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:41.760]   It's not in Content ID.
[02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:42.720]   Like, it's totally fine for you.
[02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:43.360]   Oh, thank you.
[02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:45.840]   But it is just--
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:48.520]   Googly-eyed coconut, the star of the show.
[02:06:48.520 --> 02:06:49.360]   That's friend of the show.
[02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:50.960]   Dave Whiskis is Dave the agent.
[02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:53.720]   Dr. Mike is in there doing physicals.
[02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:54.480]   I am in there.
[02:06:54.480 --> 02:06:55.480]   I have a brief caveat.
[02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:55.840]   Oh.
[02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:57.840]   And it's a bunch of other YouTubers.
[02:06:57.840 --> 02:06:58.920]   Mr. Beast is in it.
[02:06:58.920 --> 02:07:00.400]   It is just--
[02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:02.280]   I have not seen something pure fun.
[02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:05.320]   Like, it's got a little bit of a Kevin Smith vibe to it
[02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:06.560]   because it's an indie movie.
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:09.880]   And it's got a lot of-- in our industry banter
[02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:12.840]   and a lot of cameos from people in our industry.
[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:15.200]   But I wasn't sure what to expect.
[02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:16.600]   The editing is so good.
[02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:20.240]   The storytelling is so funny.
[02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:23.000]   I just enjoyed the ever-loving stuff and out of it.
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:23.960]   It's kind of amazing.
[02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:26.120]   Is it shot on an iPhone?
[02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:27.280]   No, he is like--
[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:29.760]   I believe it was shot on Canon cinema cameras.
[02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:31.560]   I don't have to double check with Patrick on that.
[02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:32.960]   But it's--
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:33.800]   It's pretty impressive.
[02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:37.600]   It is-- it is just a complete labor of love.
[02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:40.600]   And it astounds me that, like, going from YouTuber
[02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:43.080]   to making stuff like this in a couple of years
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:46.240]   is just such a dream artistic journey for me.
[02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:48.640]   The night of the coconut.
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:50.360]   And it's coming to Nebula--
[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:51.560]   or it's on Nebula right now.
[02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:52.400]   So if you go to Nebula--
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:53.200]   It's on Nebula now, yeah.
[02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:56.120]   With that app, you can buy the whole movie.
[02:07:56.120 --> 02:07:57.000]   It's got a takeover.
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.720]   There's a whole charl takeover.
[02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:00.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:01.440]   Nice.
[02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:03.680]   And of course, Mr. Renee Richie is also
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:06.280]   part of the Nebula fun.
[02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:06.600]   Yes.
[02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:07.800]   Although go watch that movie first.
[02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:09.840]   It's just like-- you'll be in a good mood
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:11.000]   to watch my stuff afterwards.
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:11.400]   Nice.
[02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:13.480]   The night of the coconut.
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:13.920]   Yeah.
[02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:14.600]   Yum.
[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:17.360]   You have to be signed in to watch it.
[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:18.240]   Yes.
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:18.880]   It's an original.
[02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:21.680]   So like, that's one of the things with originals is they--
[02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:22.560]   cost a lot to make.
[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:24.120]   So you have to be signed in to watch it.
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:25.200]   Yeah.
[02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:26.000]   Very cool.
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:26.720]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:29.000]   Andy and Ico, pick of the week.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.600]   Something really kind of fun if you're
[02:08:30.600 --> 02:08:34.040]   screwing around 3D for any reason whatsoever.
[02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:39.520]   Google decided to release a data set of over 1,000 really
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:43.320]   highly detailed scanned 3D models of common houseable
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:46.880]   items, accompanied with an academic paper that basically
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:48.560]   says that, hey, we're doing-- there's
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:51.480]   a lot of research being done about like scene composition
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:54.640]   and robotic manipulation of objects and simulation.
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:56.080]   So what are all--
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:58.880]   but there aren't like standards for what objects
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:08:59.560]   are we dealing with.
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:02.520]   So hey, we spent a whole long time scanning
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:04.160]   1,000 different items.
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:05.760]   And so now here is the entire library
[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:07.720]   that you can just basically download and use.
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:10.640]   And I'm not thinking about using these things for research.
[02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:12.560]   I'm thinking about just saying, hey,
[02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:15.360]   wouldn't it be cool for an AR project to simply put this little
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:16.040]   stuff--
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:18.840]   a plush squirrel somewhere in the scene of this thing
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:19.600]   that I'm building?
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:23.000]   Or it would be nice to do a 3D print of this Dr. Doom action
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.720]   figure or all these sort of things.
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:31.600]   It's charming because these objects are so random.
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:34.560]   It really did seem like for a two-week period,
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:38.080]   this team of people were just bringing in crap from home
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:41.640]   because they've got like three dozen different kinds of shoes.
[02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:43.760]   They've got boxes of--
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:47.680]   12 packs of Pepsi, five different flavors.
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:50.360]   And I'm just to demonstrate that they've
[02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:52.680]   got all the product packaging correct on all sides.
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:55.440]   So it is like five different 12 packs.
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:59.520]   But in case your robotics model, you need-- well,
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:01.840]   it can lift a 12 pack of Diet Pepsi
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:04.880]   but can it do a diet while cherry Pepsi?
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:09.000]   What if the artificial sweetener were not the aspartame?
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.160]   It was actually so agreed.
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:13.320]   Could we do actually Pepsi max?
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:15.680]   So a lot of toys, a lot of children's toys,
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:18.920]   a lot of consumer products, even still in their packaging.
[02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:23.560]   It's worth knowing about because if you're just setting a scene
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:27.160]   and you need to have like brick a brick on the shelves,
[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:30.960]   like you need a couple of vases, you need a potted plant,
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:32.920]   you can probably grab one for free.
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:35.080]   A really, really good detail right here.
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:38.600]   And yeah, you can download them in two or three different formats.
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:42.360]   And yes, SDF is among them.
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:44.080]   Fun.
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:47.840]   GazeboSim.org.
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:51.880]   If you want to get your 3D models, thousands of them.
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:54.840]   Absolutely free.
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:57.920]   Alex Lindsay, pick of the week.
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:10:59.680]   Yes, sorry.
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:01.840]   I always think I should drink more water.
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:02.760]   But I never do.
[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:03.960]   I never remember it.
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:04.960]   And like--
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:06.680]   You can app.
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:07.400]   You can app.
[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:09.080]   The funny thing is that it's--
[02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:11.560]   the problem for me is that anything with tech
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:14.440]   will is kind of like putting molasses into my--
[02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:15.320]   or sugar into the cereal.
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:16.560]   Like, oh, I'll eat more of that.
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:17.480]   It's got some tech in it.
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:18.800]   I have something I can measure.
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:20.920]   And so I'm afraid that I went out.
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:22.640]   And I wasn't sure if I'd actually use it.
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:25.720]   So a couple weeks ago, I got this thing called Hydrate Spark.
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:26.320]   And I bought it.
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:28.640]   And it was certainly expensive for what it does.
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:30.080]   Smart water bottle, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:30.560]   So here it is.
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:31.080]   Here it is.
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:31.880]   And I use it all the time.
[02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:32.640]   Oh my god.
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:34.200]   So anyway, so the nice thing is--
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:36.040]   here's the funny thing about it is I actually--
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:38.120]   now I have the bigger one than those ones.
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:38.640]   I went ahead.
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:39.680]   I was like, I don't want to be at home.
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:40.680]   Yours looks really big.
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:41.680]   I do.
[02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:42.680]   It's a giant.
[02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:42.680]   It's like--
[02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:43.680]   I don't--
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:44.680]   The pro, the Titan.
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:45.680]   The Titan.
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:46.680]   I think it might be the Titan.
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:47.680]   I think it might be the--
[02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:49.680]   Is it plastic or is it metal?
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:50.680]   It's metal.
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:52.680]   Oh, well then you might have the pro, right?
[02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:53.680]   Let's see.
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:54.680]   So I mean, this is how big it is.
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:55.680]   You take it bigger than a pro.
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:57.680]   If I traveled with it, I'd probably get a smaller one.
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:11:59.920]   They have a 32-- you got the 32 answer.
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:00.920]   That's why.
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:02.920]   Yeah, and so it's a beast.
[02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:06.160]   I'm just going to get a pink.
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:07.160]   You know?
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:08.160]   You know?
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:09.160]   That's all I have to say.
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:13.720]   Now, here's the funny thing is, so far I've had this much.
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:14.720]   This is my--
[02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:17.120]   20 gallons of water?
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:18.120]   20.5 ounces.
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:19.120]   Oh, ounces.
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:22.640]   I don't know what it is in milk mill.
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:23.640]   I didn't metric.
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:26.200]   I'm sure you can set it that way.
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:27.640]   You can see I crushed it yesterday.
[02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:28.640]   So I had--
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:29.640]   I had 60--
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:30.640]   60 ounces.
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:31.640]   I had 60 ounces.
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:36.760]   Anyway, so then if I take a drink, so if I just go like--
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:37.960]   I'm actually tempted.
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:39.720]   It's only $80.
[02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:40.960]   Is the insulation good?
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:41.960]   I mean--
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:42.960]   Then you set it down.
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:43.960]   The installation is excellent.
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:44.960]   So it stays colder.
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:45.960]   It's the best water.
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:46.960]   So then what does is it'll flash here.
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:47.960]   Let's see if it usually--
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:50.080]   Can you put vodka in it is the question.
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:51.080]   You can.
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:52.080]   You can.
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:53.080]   That could probably actually control your intake.
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:54.920]   So the bottom will glow.
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:58.960]   And now you can see I just took a swig of three ounces.
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:12:59.960]   And so--
[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:03.840]   Anyway, and the funny thing is, so the bottom glows is this is the part you kind of charge
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:04.840]   and you every once in a while.
[02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:05.840]   I don't know.
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:06.840]   I haven't charged it yet.
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:07.840]   I'm going to have to.
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:10.360]   It's something I'm going to be like, I keep on drinking water and it's not measuring.
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:12.200]   I'll know that I have to plug it in.
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:16.880]   So the thing about it is it's not just that it's a geeky kind of thing.
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:18.600]   It is a geeky kind of thing.
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:21.120]   It's a really well-- it's like the best water bottle I bought.
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:22.120]   The water doesn't taste like anything.
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:24.360]   Did you get the chug or the straw?
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:25.360]   Which did you--
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:26.360]   I got the--
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:27.360]   Did you opt for it?
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:28.360]   I might get the straw.
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:29.360]   I think it's the chug.
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:30.360]   I think it's the chug I got.
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:31.360]   It's like a lot.
[02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:33.120]   I can't decide if I want a chug or a straw.
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:34.120]   I'm number for water.
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:35.120]   Yes.
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:36.120]   I'm torn.
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:37.120]   It's really good.
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:40.120]   And again, here's the worst part.
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:43.680]   I may buy the smaller one for when I travel because I went to LA last week for a couple
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:45.960]   days and I didn't take it.
[02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:49.840]   So now I have two days that have no data, which is very exciting for me.
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:50.840]   But the--
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:51.840]   Isn't that the worst?
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:54.440]   You know, you quantified self as a gap.
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:55.800]   I know, exactly.
[02:13:55.800 --> 02:14:01.960]   So anyway, so-- but it's-- it actually-- I know that I'm drinking more water and I know
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:03.280]   that I feel better.
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:07.200]   And that should be enough to get me to drink more water without the cup, but it's not
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:08.200]   the same.
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:11.320]   And again, I think that part of what makes it work is that it's not that it's a bad cup
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:12.520]   with a measurement tool.
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:15.680]   It's actually the best water jug I've ever had.
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:16.880]   For 80 bucks, it better be.
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:17.880]   You know, like--
[02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:18.880]   It glows.
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:19.880]   It glows in the bottom.
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:20.880]   It glows in the bottom.
[02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:22.120]   I'm getting the bright pink one.
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:23.120]   Are you kidding?
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:24.120]   Yeah, there you go.
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:29.720]   And it's a-- it's a cool-- it's a really-- again, I'm going to probably get another one for
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:30.720]   when I travel.
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:33.520]   How two of them fit into this and whether it matches them or not.
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:36.680]   I mean, that's the only problem I have is I don't know if I have to tell it that I'm
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:37.680]   using the smaller one.
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:40.160]   I don't-- I haven't figured that part out yet.
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:46.000]   But it's a-- it's a-- again, if it was without the measurement tool, I would still use it
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.200]   because it's a really comfortable one.
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:51.080]   The chug one at least is a really comfortable-- I thought the straw was going to be weird,
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:52.080]   so I just bought the chug.
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:53.080]   I'm getting the straw.
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:54.080]   It did take me.
[02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:56.800]   I just want to point out, if you're looking at it, I'm not that smart.
[02:14:56.800 --> 02:14:57.960]   I'm not a very smart person.
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:14:59.480]   It took me a long time to figure out how to open it.
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:01.200]   I kept on trying to go like this.
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:03.280]   I'm just going to save you some time.
[02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:05.240]   If you push it down like this, that red bar--
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:06.240]   Oh.
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:07.240]   --is it on open.
[02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:09.800]   For additional $10, you can have a chug lid and a straw.
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:13.360]   And then you go-- and then the key is push the bottom part and it just pops open.
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:19.640]   But when you finally do that, I guess I've taken away the feeling of accomplishment that
[02:15:19.640 --> 02:15:23.360]   you might have there that you sat there for a day or two, trying to figure out how to
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:25.800]   turn open the thing.
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:27.720]   So anyway--
[02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:28.520]   I don't actually--
[02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:33.440]   I don't actually believe you need to keep track of how much you drink, water you drink, maybe
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:36.760]   vodka, but not water you drink when you're thirsty, you'll be fine.
[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:38.760]   I still want it.
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:39.760]   That's really cool.
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:40.760]   I still want it.
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:41.760]   You get the positive report from the cools.
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:42.760]   It's the most when you drink.
[02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:44.200]   Every time you have a drink.
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:46.720]   About 10 seconds later, it goes--
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:47.720]   Oh, yes.
[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:51.520]   --you know, it rewards you.
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:52.520]   Does it sigh?
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:54.960]   It doesn't sigh until the end of the day.
[02:15:54.960 --> 02:16:01.760]   When you only are at like 32, it's like-- when it's obvious you're going to bed it goes.
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:03.240]   Sigh.
[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:04.240]   I tried.
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:06.560]   I tried to make him drink more.
[02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:09.880]   I'm like, I can't drink anymore at this time of day or I'll have to get up in the middle
[02:16:09.880 --> 02:16:10.880]   of the night.
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:12.080]   I kind of want this.
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:13.080]   I don't--
[02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:14.080]   That's really neat.
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:15.080]   You don't need it.
[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:16.080]   I didn't need it, but--
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:17.080]   I am drinking a lot more water and I feel a lot better.
[02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:18.080]   I think I just--
[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:19.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:21.840]   But I don't know.
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:27.960]   You know, I'll tell you the truth is the other reason I need it, yesterday I have a Bubba,
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:31.440]   which is just a thing with a straw in it.
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:36.200]   And I made up a nice 32-ounce Bubba with my vitamin C in it and the stuff.
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:38.600]   And I spilled it on the carpet immediately.
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:39.600]   Right.
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:41.800]   It was such a sad thing.
[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:44.760]   You know, and here they won't let me do that.
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:46.920]   So I have a Contigo.
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:48.680]   But it doesn't glow and it doesn't--
[02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:49.680]   No.
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:50.680]   No.
[02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:51.680]   It glows and it knows.
[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:52.680]   It glows and it knows.
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:53.680]   Yeah, there you go.
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:54.680]   You should send that to marketing.
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:56.680]   I just bought it.
[02:16:56.680 --> 02:16:57.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:16:59.680]   It's such a sucker.
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:01.680]   You're worse than Instagram, Alex.
[02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:02.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:03.680]   All right.
[02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:11.680]   Hydrate, I H spelled H-I-D-R-A-T-E-S, Spark.com.
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:16.680]   Alex is going to do and ask me anything in our ClubTwit July 14th.
[02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:17.680]   Yep.
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:18.680]   Very excited about that.
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:19.920]   That's one of many things.
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:22.480]   We make ClubTwit fun.
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:25.080]   You merely give us $7 a month.
[02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:26.440]   A couple of Starbucks.
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:27.440]   That's it.
[02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:32.640]   And we give you ad-free versions of all the shows, which shortens their length considerably.
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:39.320]   We give you access to our fabulous Discord, which is full of fun and games and animated
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:40.920]   gifts and events.
[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:43.840]   We had Stacey's book club the other day and it was so much fun.
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:45.200]   I'm going to do that.
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:48.200]   We're voting right now in the next book.
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:54.320]   Those are the interesting people coming up a fireside chat on the 28th.
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:58.000]   And then of course the Twit Plus feed, which has stuff that doesn't make it to the podcast,
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:01.640]   including our untitled Linux show, the Gizfiz, the book club.
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:06.160]   We launch new shows there like this week in space thanks to the generosity of our club
[02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:07.160]   members.
[02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:08.320]   We'd love to have you in the club.
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:09.960]   Would you join us?
[02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:14.360]   All you have to do is go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:17.240]   There's annual memberships as well as monthly.
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:19.480]   And there's corporate memberships there too.
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:22.920]   And Alex Lindsay will be there in a couple of weeks.
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:26.200]   I will not be here next week.
[02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:27.200]   What is going on next week?
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:29.560]   Do we know who's going to take over for me?
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:30.560]   Do we know how that's going to work?
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:32.800]   Is Micah going to be here?
[02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:36.920]   They've told me many times, but it's too many cheese balls.
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:38.960]   I don't have any memory anymore.
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:44.200]   Anyway, it'll be a great show and I will be back in two weeks.
[02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:52.520]   Alex Lindsay is at officehours.global every morning talking about cool stuff like.
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:54.920]   Today we had a date a video on.
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:57.000]   They have built these little VPN things.
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:04.560]   A lot of us are doing remote production and they basically build a VPN to a remote site.
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:06.640]   So you can have these little things and it just does it on the web.
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:09.320]   A lot of us have had it build all this stuff and you have to figure out how to set it all
[02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:10.320]   up.
[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:14.000]   Just plug them into the internet once they're set up and they basically feel like they're
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.400]   in the same place and it lets us run out of all of our equipment on the other side.
[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:24.560]   And it's really kind of what happens a lot in our group is that something bubbles up.
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:27.400]   Someone buys it a whole bunch of people talk about it and they're like, "Well, let's bring
[02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:30.040]   them on and have them talk to us about it."
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:31.600]   Someone's decided this is cool.
[02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:35.920]   It's a very democratic thing.
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:39.920]   In the sense that members just start suggesting stuff and we throw it up there.
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:42.160]   That was one of the things we're covering.
[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:43.920]   Every day it's always something.
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:45.680]   We're always having a good time.
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:47.920]   Second hours and the first hours.
[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:51.000]   Just a lot of great questions and a lot of great answers.
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.600]   And I think we're pushed zoom about as far as it can go.
[02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:59.440]   If you look at the thing, everyone's quite a thing.
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:01.600]   It's really impressive what you've done with this.
[02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:02.600]   A lot of fun.
[02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:03.600]   Yeah, officehours.global.
[02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:04.600]   Open to all.
[02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:09.960]   Of course, if you're looking to get Alex to not host, help stream your next event.
[02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:11.880]   Although I'm sure Alex will be glad to host it too.
[02:20:11.880 --> 02:20:15.640]   090.media is his day job.
[02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:18.480]   When are you going to be on WGBH next, Mr. Andy?
[02:20:18.480 --> 02:20:27.240]   I'm off this week, but I'm going to be on again Thursday at 1250, 1250, go to WGBHNews.org
[02:20:27.240 --> 02:20:29.480]   to stream it live or later.
[02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:30.480]   Thank you.
[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:32.280]   Maybe we can get together when I'm out your way.
[02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:33.280]   I hope so.
[02:20:33.280 --> 02:20:36.320]   I might even be broadcasting from the Boston Public Library.
[02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:38.080]   If you're doing that, I'll come up on Thursday.
[02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:39.080]   That'd be fun.
[02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:40.080]   I'd love to see you do that.
[02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:41.080]   I'll let you know.
[02:20:41.080 --> 02:20:44.280]   I will make time for you.
[02:20:44.280 --> 02:20:45.280]   Absolutely.
[02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:46.280]   Ah, he's sweetie.
[02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:49.320]   Renee Ritchie, YouTube.com/Renee Ritchie.
[02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:54.040]   He's the star, also a Nebula broadcaster, Nebula.app.
[02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:55.800]   What are you working on?
[02:20:55.800 --> 02:21:00.360]   I just put up in M2 versus M1 Pro.
[02:21:00.360 --> 02:21:01.360]   That's what I'm watching.
[02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:02.360]   There's a lot of work confused about that.
[02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:03.360]   That's what I'm doing.
[02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:07.800]   And I did a passkey versus passwords because people were super confused about how passkey
[02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:10.080]   is actually implemented and how they're secured and all that.
[02:21:10.080 --> 02:21:14.560]   I did a full explainer on all the aspects, everything you possibly want to know and more
[02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:15.560]   about passkey.
[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:16.560]   The world needs that.
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:17.560]   Yes.
[02:21:17.560 --> 02:21:18.560]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:19.560]   We appreciate you being here.
[02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:23.760]   My cosage will be in this seat next week taking over the show for me.
[02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:25.840]   I will be back in two weeks.
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:31.120]   We do Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern, 1800 UTC.
[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:32.120]   Stop by and say hi.

[02:21:50.440 --> 02:21:51.520]   We also put it on YouTube.
[02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:54.280]   There's a dedicated Mac Break Weekly channel.

[02:22:03.640 --> 02:22:04.640]   Thank you for being here.
[02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:05.720]   We'll see you next time.
[02:22:05.720 --> 02:22:08.760]   Now get back to work because break time is over.
[02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:10.680]   Is that an iPhone in your hand?
[02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:12.240]   Wait a second.
[02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:15.160]   Is that an Apple watch on your wrist?
[02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:18.160]   And do I see an iPad sitting there on the table?
[02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:19.640]   Oh my goodness.
[02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:25.280]   You are the perfect person to be watching iOS today, the show where Rosemary Orchard
[02:22:25.280 --> 02:22:31.200]   and I, Mike, is Sergeant talk all things iOS, TV, OS, watch, OS, HomePod, OS.
[02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:33.640]   It's all the OS that Apple has on offer.
[02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:36.160]   And we show you how to make the most of those gadgets.
[02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:39.840]   Head to twitch.tv/ios to check it out.
[02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:49.840]   [MUSIC]
