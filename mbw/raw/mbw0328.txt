[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.800]   Exactly.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.320]   That's what we do.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.080]   We get it out of our system, so to speak.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.760]   The team is here.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.400]   We got Andy and Naco joining us from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.840]   It's--
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.400]   --knowing in Boston, or at least it is on his iPad.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.240]   It's snowing in the Charlie Brown Christmas special.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.560]   That's all we need to know.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.160]   That's all we need.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.200]   That's a really festive little display you've got behind you.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.000]   It's become like my--
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.720]   the Charlie Brown Christmas book that
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.920]   has all those still page animations that
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.480]   has become my screensaver.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.560]   Because now I walk back to the office, all worried about,
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.120]   geez, I got these two articles done.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.000]   I got to get this column.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.680]   I was like, oh, look, it's snowing.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.600]   And they're skating.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   Oh.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.680]   Things aren't so bad.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.640]   [HONKING]
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.000]   Also with his from Canadian, from his home in Montreal,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.120]   Mr. Renee Ritchie of iMore.com.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.760]   Renee, good to see you.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.640]   Good to see you, too, Leo.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.280]   And I finally got my iPad mini, so I
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.400]   believe that I fit in now.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.680]   Ooh, look at that.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.040]   You fell for the smart cover, didn't you?
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.520]   I ordered it to come with it because I didn't have anything else.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.440]   And I know I would drop it almost immediately.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.520]   That's good.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.320]   No, you need to cover.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.720]   But boy, it's a terrible--
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.200]   It's an unsmart cover.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.960]   It's a dumb cover.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.400]   It's floppy.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.920]   But as we talked about, I think last episode,
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.320]   it's all about geometry.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.120]   But it's not an equilateral triangle when you've
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.800]   propped it up.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.040]   Yes.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.880]   That is-- Mr. Euclid here is Alex Lindsey of the Pixel
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.800]   Core in two weeks running.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.960]   It's as awesome.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.040]   Crazy, isn't it?
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.920]   He's here to help me with my new grill.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.000]   That's all about my cream egg.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.400]   Which size did you get?
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.800]   Well, you told me to get the extra large.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.760]   No, I said not to get the extra large.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.280]   No, good.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.000]   I got the large.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.480]   The large is good.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.200]   They had it in stock, so I just threw it in the back.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.720]   The extra large is hard to build.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.880]   The thing is heavy.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.280]   It is.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.360]   Hundreds of pounds.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.560]   Did you get the table with it?
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.800]   I didn't get the table I got with the colon nest.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.880]   So this is a grill, folks, that is actually
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.880]   a modernized version of a Japanese Kamado cooker.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.520]   So it's a ceramic egg.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.760]   Many people ask, why are we talking about this on Mac Break?
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.520]   And the answer is, this is the Mac of Grills.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.520]   It is truly--
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.000]   That's it.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.240]   If Apple would make a grill--
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.840]   if Apple decided they wanted to get an a grilling,
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.400]   they would just buy a big green egg.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.080]   They would purchase them and say, there's
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.920]   nothing else we need to do.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.120]   That's the one I got on the screen.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.480]   And the table is really nice, by the way.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:19.680]   I know.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.480]   I want to get the table.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.480]   That's perfect analogy, too.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.840]   That's a perfect analogy, because it, too,
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.880]   doesn't have a DVD drive.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.960]   But it's simple.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.560]   It's effective, and it has a crazy, rabid base.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.040]   You know, to back this up--
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.040]   And it's expensive.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.600]   Half the chatroom apparently has one, and I never knew this.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.280]   They're all going, oh, yeah, I got one of those.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.200]   Have you seen the App Store?
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.080]   You know, the best thing-- and the best thing on a big green
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.120]   egg is a beer butt chicken.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.640]   You take it.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.480]   Can a beer?
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.680]   Half.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.120]   Can a beer?
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.680]   Show it up.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.240]   The back of a chicken.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.960]   In the can?
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.520]   No, you can actually get--
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.480]   if you go to Amazon, you get a stainless steel can.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.040]   And the last thing you get is a big green--
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.560]   Well, I'll just say, it's a big beer butt chicken.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.480]   I'm all over the store.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.240]   You leave it in there for an hour.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.200]   If you've got an egg, you've got to get yourself a beer butt
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   chicken.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.160]   All about the beer butt chicken.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.720]   It's a song.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.560]   See, look, people are already saying that's the best.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.080]   See, it's a song just writes itself.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.840]   All about the beer butt.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.760]   Either ukulele, do it pro.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.680]   I need a steel guitar.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.400]   Hey, that means I can expense a steel guitar now.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.400]   Awesome.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.160]   I'll be asking you about the beer butt chicken.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.520]   It's after the show, because I don't want to get lynched.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:34.640]   But there isn't a whole lot of Apple news today.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.600]   But we could talk about, I guess, the big news, which
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.200]   is Thursday at the very last possible moment
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.360]   that Apple pushed out iTunes 11.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.760]   They said it would come out first in October,
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.200]   didn't change your minds, which is fine.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.600]   I don't want them to ship it until it's ready.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.320]   But then they said, we'll have it in November.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.200]   And they did it in November 29th to 30th,
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.840]   I mean, the last possible day.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.440]   So you guys have had a week to play with it.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.680]   What do you think?
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.080]   It's very iOS-y.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.480]   That's funny.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.880]   I'm still getting used to it.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.080]   I mean, the good news is that if you really put off
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.760]   by the new user interface, so the big deal
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.240]   is it's a one-window interface for pretty much everything.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.560]   If you're put off by that, you can go into the view menu
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.120]   and put the sidebar back in and put all these other previous
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.600]   version elements right back in.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.360]   I'm trying not to do that until I absolutely
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.840]   feel as though there's no alternative,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.280]   because it's such a difference between what you've done.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.880]   The new iTunes is a completely redesigned player, a new store.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.720]   Turn off my Mac.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.680]   And it's even more iCloud.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.480]   Thank you.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.200]   Now you may continue.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.120]   No, no.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.200]   Chad went, aah!
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.080]   That's exactly right, because now we're kind of like dogs who
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.880]   are like, no, what kind of photo voice
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.480]   means we're about to get hit.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.640]   And it was that brand new wonderfully upgraded experience
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.400]   for our finest Mac product ever ever.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.400]   Oh, no.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.960]   They took away something that makes my life--
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.880]   It's the thinnest iTunes ever.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.400]   I mean, the only feature that I love to pop up player,
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.800]   I love the ability to just scan--
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.240]   to put something in shuffle mode and just scan head, oh,
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.000]   I hate that song.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.480]   Please don't play that one.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.880]   But the thing that I'm really missing immediately
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.360]   is the ability to have a playlist open in a separate window
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.040]   and keep it open for like maintenance,
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.880]   because there's so many times you're just--
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.560]   you're putting together a playlist for a trip
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.120]   or you're maintaining one of your many awesome playlists
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.280]   you use for your daily walks, stuff like that.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.960]   And it's not really a-- I'm going to sit down.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.280]   I'm going to focus for five minutes.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.080]   I'm going to get this thing done and knock this out.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.000]   It's often a-- I'm just going to keep this open
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.640]   so that whenever I encounter a song that's
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.840]   appropriate for this playlist, I'm going to drag it in there.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.120]   So now that is no more.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.880]   But-- Oh, well.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.480]   It's inevitable.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.800]   Any time they make a change, it's inevitable
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.720]   that the first reaction is going to be, oh, right?
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.320]   Exactly.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.200]   So I think people should stick with it before they decide to sort
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.600]   of reroll it back to the way it was before.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.840]   Yeah, Zephyr in our chatroom said,
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.200]   I immediately turn the sidebar on.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.640]   When you turn the sidebar on, it's much more
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.600]   like the old iTunes, right?
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.280]   It's kind of weird.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.680]   The whole thing is more like lion than mountain lion.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.040]   It's like the transition between the old iTunes
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.480]   and the new iTunes.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.160]   And they gave it a nice new coat of paint,
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.680]   but they didn't really re-engineer it that much.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.480]   And there's a lot of really confusing choices.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.000]   Like you minimize the window on the right,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.200]   but then you have to maximize it again on the left.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.800]   And you have searchable drop downs.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.960]   And they have popovers in the popovers.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.360]   And there's just a lot of stuff that looks like it could
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.600]   have used a couple of months or maybe one more iteration
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.560]   of polish before it was saying.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.440]   Popovers within popovers sounds like beer butt chicken.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:29.880]   What?
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.760]   I mean, that's a little bit too--
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   You have to get the accessory steamer for the top of the egg.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.440]   John Gruber, as one might expect, is my first impression
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.760]   of the new design impressed.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.200]   But he does point out it's a redesign, not a rewrite.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.200]   And I think what we all wanted was, frankly, something
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.840]   faster and smoother.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.340]   Yeah.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.640]   I have to admit, I just don't use it that often.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.080]   I mean, it's not enough to get me to use it again.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.080]   Let's put it there.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.840]   I guess most of my experience is now on my iPad or my iPhone.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.800]   And I just don't like it enough that it to come back.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.520]   So I don't use it very often anymore.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.120]   And I just find the iPad version kind of inadequate
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.040]   for really managing a music library
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.120]   and putting together those playlists and stuff.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.080]   So it's a bit more of a struggle for people who, like me,
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.080]   who are doing stuff like that.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.520]   But there are a lot of really nice, common sense features
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.840]   have been added in.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.280]   Fairly recently, they've extended the duration
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.000]   of the previews in the iTunes store from 30 seconds,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.840]   usually down to a minute and a half.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.360]   And so now if you are previewing a song
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.320]   and you navigate away, unless you're just
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.200]   clicking to another song on the playlist,
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.080]   it doesn't automatically stop the playback of the sample
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:37.760]   you're listening to.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.200]   It'll keep playing through the end
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.440]   until you actually ask for another sample.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.520]   So those are little things that, OK, that makes sense.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.720]   That actually makes the product better.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.480]   I like that.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.000]   I have to admit, I pretty much use Spotify almost exclusively
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.160]   for playlists.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.080]   So if I listen to specific things,
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.120]   I'm listening to it on iTunes.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.120]   If it's not in Spotify, but iTunes,
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.120]   I think it's probably why I don't think about the playlist
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.120]   that much.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.000]   There's a lot of nice new auto-magicalness as well now.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.800]   If you start dragging a song, a sidebar will pop up
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.560]   and let you just drag it into a playlist.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.480]   And there's next up so that if you're playing music,
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.400]   you can add a song to this almost secondary stage area.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.120]   And that'll play next without destroying
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.920]   whatever you're playing now or your playlist that you're on now.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.960]   So there is a lot of good stuff in there too.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.520]   Although I'm kind of-- one step back
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.000]   was that they got rid of a cover flow, which was kind of cool,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.280]   but I didn't really use it.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.600]   But the thing that I really wish they hadn't copied away
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.960]   from the iPad was where the sort of the default view was now
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.880]   a grid of album art, which isn't really useful for me
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.240]   because I buy a couple of tracks here, a couple of tracks there.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.040]   I don't even associate with the image that's on the album.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.880]   And by making the album title shrink
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.360]   to fit the dimensions of that spot in the grid,
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.480]   I really don't know what the name of that album is either.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.840]   So it's like, for me, it's giving me
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.680]   this view of my collection that doesn't give me
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.720]   any useful information.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.480]   But it just-- it reminds me what "Sligh Stone"
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.720]   looked like in 1971.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.200]   But other than that, I don't know anything useful
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.280]   that that's like an apply.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.280]   It's also nice that--
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.240]   you tap on an album, and the whole thing opens up
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.880]   like a folder in iOS, and you have all the songs inside.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.920]   And they do this color algorithm where they match the album art
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.960]   and paint the background, that color.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.760]   So it's almost like you still have the right click
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.440]   if you want to get nerdy about it.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.880]   But then you also have all these things
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.080]   that are very more accessible to people
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.000]   who maybe aren't as familiar with the Mac or iOS,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.440]   or iTunes to begin with.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.200]   And let me say something that might be slightly incendiary.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.520]   I liked it a lot more when acting on a hunch
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.040]   about what I was reacting to.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:45.040]   I installed it on my Samsung multi-touch Windows 8 slate.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:50.120]   And I think that iTunes 11 would work better
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.240]   on a multi-touch device than on anything else.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.600]   Because the targets are-- it seems to be more laid out
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.320]   for a touch system than for a keyboard system.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.960]   Do we think that's by accident?
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.600]   It's not by the touch system.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.440]   I don't think that's by accident at all.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.200]   I think that Alex, you're the one who keeps saying that
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.440]   sometimes in the next x-years with an x-number, x-greater than 2,
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.000]   we're going to see like emerging of the desktop
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.560]   and the mobile operating system.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.840]   I'm wondering if this isn't part of a larger little--
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.680]   just in the back of Apple's mind, there's always--
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.320]   if there's a way to redesign something
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.120]   so that it would work better as a multi-touch thing.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.000]   Or at the very least, make it look more consistent
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.760]   with the iOS counterpart.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.640]   Because people's first interface into computing these days
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.640]   is the touchscreen on their phone, not on a desktop,
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.760]   not on a notebook anymore.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.400]   Maybe that's part of the--
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.760]   in the back of my mind, let's make sure this will work
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.120]   in a tablet.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.760]   Yeah, I think that I still think that the progression is
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.560]   going to be in touch screen laptops and then just touch
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.560]   screen.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.400]   And more something you can decide if you want a keyboard on it.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:56.000]   But I think that I'd wager that that's one of the requirements
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.360]   for Apple stuff now is to make--
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.120]   is that it has to be leaning--
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.760]   I wouldn't lean in that direction.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.600]   I would suggest if you go have a VNC client on your iPad,
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.080]   try operating it--
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.720]   when run iTunes 11 on your desktop,
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.040]   but use it via VNC on your iPad, where you're actually
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.680]   touching things.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.680]   And I think, OK, now I like this a lot more than I did
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.440]   when I was trying to use it with a trackpad.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.280]   And even the-- all the navigation has changed.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.400]   It used to be those little gum drop to make it smaller,
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.840]   large, or to close it.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.520]   And those became traffic lights in the last version of iTunes.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.280]   And now they're gone.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.400]   And there's a big X button instead, which is a huge--
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.800]   a really huge X button.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.680]   And I did the same thing.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.480]   I loaded it up in screens on the iPad, and I played with it.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.840]   And it worked.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.200]   The old one was almost unusable.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.400]   And the new one is highly workable.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.360]   Dare I ask how it works on the Windows?
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.160]   Does anybody here use Windows?
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.440]   Because one of the problems I keep running into is--
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.840]   and I don't use iTunes, even on the Mac, really, very much.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.080]   I mean, I have to a little bit, but I use it as little as I can.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.760]   I keep it running in the background so I can access it via my Apple
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.400]   TV.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.760]   But I hear from people all the time who use Windows who say,
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.400]   I'll say that when I use it on Windows this weekend,
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.840]   that was the first time I've used iTunes on Windows,
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.160]   probably in like two or three years.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.440]   It's-- as I said, it was interesting to use it on a true
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.560]   multi-touch tablet, because it did make a lot more sense.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.440]   I don't see that there's any real advantage to using
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.240]   on Windows versus Mac, though.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.880]   It really is the exact same app on both platforms.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.440]   It's the same.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.520]   And not improved, particularly in performance.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.120]   It's revenge for Office Mac.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.560]   It's what I think.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.960]   You know, that's a really apt analogy.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.240]   As Office is to the Mac, iTunes is to Windows.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.680]   Microsoft refused to use Apple's memory management
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.960]   or do anything Apple like at all.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.440]   And I have a feeling that iTunes on Windows is pretty much
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.520]   a Mac experience in a box on Windows.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.640]   They've got to wrap up core audio and all car animation
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.160]   and port all that stuff over to Windows.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.480]   The same way Microsoft has to wrap all those DLLs.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.720]   Do you think they're going to make it work?
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.080]   Yeah, I guess you do.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.960]   Laurie in our chat room, Laurie79 says,
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.160]   "My iTunes 11 crashed on me about five times on Windows
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.040]   before I got it to work."
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.680]   Five is average.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.760]   You can go anywhere from two to 12.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.120]   So you're right in the middle there.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.280]   I think that's good.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.180]   Downloads are slow under Windows.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:29.200]   A lot of people are saying it's crashing.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.160]   I think, you know, part of the problem is a quick time
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.760]   on Windows often is problematic as well.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.920]   I find Windows to be problematic.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.200]   That could be two.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.040]   That could be two.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.400]   There's so many options.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.920]   There's so many ways for a Windows machine to crash.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.080]   My Mac crashes as well.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.760]   I mean, but I have this, you know, there's just a lot of,
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.240]   when I have to go home and fix my dad's PC,
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.840]   I'm reminded why I use Mac.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.320]   You know, if you have an iOS device, you don't have to use iTunes.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.520]   You can use iCloud, but if you have a traditional iPod,
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.120]   like a Nano or a shuffle or a classic, yeah,
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.360]   you're locked to iTunes.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.240]   But actually, that principle could point right away.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.680]   Though, of course, this is also the iTunes came around
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.520]   the same time that the new iMac came in.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.960]   And what really, really sold me on iTunes 11
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.880]   was this thing where this--
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.520]   I had to reflect upon the fact that this computer in front
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.840]   of me right now was in Styrofoam 10 minutes ago.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.880]   And right now, it's telling me your library has 5,312 tracks
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.760]   in it and all my playlists are there.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.080]   And I click on a playlist.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.200]   And after only about a 12-second delay,
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.640]   all that music starts playing.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.600]   OK, maybe that's a good--
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.880]   maybe that's a salvageable feature of iTunes 11.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.360]   But the cloud integration, making it look as good
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.320]   as having 130 gigabytes with the music actually
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.120]   on that hard drive.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.960]   That part's fantastic.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.360]   One of our chatters, G. Milton, Greg Milton, says
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.840]   that it's booted faster, much faster for him on iTunes 11
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.240]   on Windows and iTunes 10 did.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.120]   So that's good.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.880]   I think that the big thing with Windows,
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.120]   it'll be the mileage varies.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.120]   And as with Macs, where if you have a newer computer,
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.600]   I bet you had really, really fast.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.840]   And if you have an older one, it's probably crashing.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:17.040]   And then the next question I have is, do you have to upgrade?
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.880]   Could you-- if you said, oh, I don't want to go through this,
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.040]   could you stay with iTunes 10 on Windows or Mac?
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.880]   Is there a compelling-- has Apple done anything yet that
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.040]   says, oh, you got to have this?
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.520]   You probably can't update any--
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.520]   Not to me.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.760]   I think I'd be-- if I had two Macs,
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.880]   I think I would definitely be keeping iTunes 10 on my main Mac
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.760]   and iTunes 11 on something that I don't use quite so long.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.200]   Right.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:40.920]   And at the opposite.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.640]   But it does say on the new iOS devices
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.200]   that they require iTunes 11.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.440]   But because iTunes 11 wasn't available when they came out,
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.160]   they worked fine with iTunes 10.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.200]   You can redeem one hot feature.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.200]   You can redeem gift cards by putting it
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.440]   in front of the computer's camera.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.920]   That actually looks pretty cool.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.440]   Yes.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:58.920]   I don't know.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.000]   That was a cool idea.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.040]   I just don't give away that many.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.200]   I don't just don't give it that many.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:02.800]   No, it is.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.280]   Is it?
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.520]   I didn't think it's a pain in there.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:04.520]   OK.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.960]   It's so delicious library.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.680]   It's delicious library.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.200]   Is that still around?
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.680]   That was the cool thing about the delicious library.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.560]   You'd scan your VHS tape barcodes.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.560]   Right.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.800]   Now you go into an Apple store and you can scan stuff
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.480]   and buy it with the iPhone camera.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.080]   I mean, Apple's getting into that, obviously.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:21.480]   That's good.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.440]   It's good.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.880]   It's good.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.240]   Variable cost iTunes gift cards, as long as we're talking
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.840]   iTunes, we'll do all the iTunes stories, are here.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.480]   I know.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.720]   Apple will be selling these at third party retailers
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.160]   for the holidays.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.320]   Give any amount from $15 to $500.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.480]   Anything I problem with that now is that when you hand it
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.680]   to someone as a gift, they're going to go, wow,
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.520]   he gave me a $500 gift card.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.200]   And then there'll be like, they'll be--
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.720]   Mismatched expectations.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.920]   I'm hearing.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.360]   You're a good mailman, but you're not
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.920]   a $500 gift card mailman.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.080]   I'm sorry, Gus.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:18:59.760]   Is it better--
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.920]   Because the charts are worth by the needle on that card.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.040]   Is it better to give a gift card, an iTunes gift card, or cash?
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.440]   Wouldn't you just give them cash,
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.120]   and then they could buy whatever they wanted?
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.880]   Well, because what's great about an iTunes gift card
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.880]   is that you can also--
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.200]   one of my gifts to one of my nieces
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:24.520]   is I make an impression upon her that I might taste
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.000]   and music is, of course, by definition, better than hers
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.560]   because I'm older than she is.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.000]   So she does get the iTunes gift card that I'm sure--
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.960]   Is that how she feels about it?
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.440]   I'm sure she does.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.400]   I try to be a good steward, a good uncle.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   Uncle Andy's makes tapes.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:40.960]   Exactly.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.200]   So every year, I do give her the iTunes gift card
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.160]   that she uses and enjoys.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.640]   But it also comes with a playlist, a pre-made playlist,
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.720]   of a great taste in music edition 2012, of all the music
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.120]   that I'm sure you haven't found this yet.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.680]   So you're going to have to sit through at least one
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.440]   pro-kill hammerman.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.920]   Pro-kill harem.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.160]   You're going to need some dino domrau.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:09.360]   I'm going to have to insist on a little, bicks, just a little.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.840]   So give them a gift card.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.120]   But you take the curse off the hide,
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.040]   and I have a pocket full of gifts for people
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.000]   that I didn't remember how to buy a gift for.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.160]   So here, do you can say, no, I built this playlist exactly
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.360]   for you because I thought they'd be music.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.120]   You would do exactly.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.360]   And then use the other $50 for things you will actually enjoy.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.920]   And I think the important thing is
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.440]   is that it's very hard to buy heroin with an iTunes gift card.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.120]   So you give it to the addict in your family.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.600]   Enjoy some music.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.520]   Don't go out.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.680]   Don't you always suspect the week after Christmas
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.520]   you can see who the drunks are, who the drug addicts are.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.840]   We see someone who's got a $100 gift card.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.120]   I'll sell it for $20, can't.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:46.840]   Well, exactly.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.320]   That's corner.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.640]   You can use it to buy heroin.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.800]   It's just not face value.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.320]   That's all.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:57.400]   iTunes event is going to take place in Muscovah coming up
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.320]   December today.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.240]   It's supposed to happen today.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.640]   I've been looking for them before to see what actually happened.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:07.040]   And the question is whether iTunes will be rolling out in Russia.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:07.960]   It did yesterday, I believe.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.040]   I don't think we went 56 new countries yesterday.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.520]   Yeah, they're a bunch of new countries.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.120]   Yeah, it launched two hours ago.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.360]   So it is in Russia now, too.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.200]   And they got television-- sorry, movies in Russia as well.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:19.960]   Oh, that's good.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:25.120]   Because that's a place where piracy really doesn't exist.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:25.920]   I'm just kidding.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.800]   I would like to point out that most albums offered
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.200]   in iTunes and Russia cost between 99 rubles and 149.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:36.760]   That's $3.20 to $4.80.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.200]   Ooh, that's expensive.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.200]   Well, but it's much cheaper than here.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.360]   Well, no.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.600]   Oh, the whole album, the whole album.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.960]   Because they're fighting the street vendor selling
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.080]   the legitimate copy outside on the sidewalk.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.080]   Go street vendor, go street vendor.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.440]   We can't-- can we get more of those here?
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.040]   Lower the price, actually.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.680]   I'm sure that this is a common American point of view
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.680]   that somehow piracy is rampant in Russia.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.560]   I would guess, if you really looked at it,
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.920]   there's probably more piracy in the US
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.880]   than any country in the world.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.880]   It's just kind of--
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.800]   It's more visible than other people.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.280]   Well, but I mean, it's more visible.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.080]   Because they have a carpet out in the red square.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.120]   I remember leaving movie theaters in Hong Kong,
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.400]   coming in front of the movie theater
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.080]   and being able to buy the movie I just
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.360]   saw in the theater.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.640]   And why don't they do that here?
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.920]   Like, you walk out of Skyfall and go,
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.960]   that was awesome here by the DVD.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.880]   They should do that.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.720]   They should do that.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.720]   I would buy it.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.720]   I would buy it.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.720]   Wow.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.800]   Alex, they have that $35,000 machine that's biocoded to you
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.360]   that you can watch the movie for $500
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.360]   when it comes out in the theater.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.560]   We don't need DVDs.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.560]   Really?
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.560]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.560]   I'm trying to think.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.560]   Is that a joke?
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.560]   No, they announced that last week.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.640]   It's a $35,000 box that goes in your living room.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.280]   And it's used as biometrics to make sure it's only you
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.280]   that can access it.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.280]   What?
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.280]   And then you can watch first run movies for $500 a pop.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:57.120]   I'm trying to think of who the market is for that.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.120]   Very rich people.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.520]   Do you spend $35,000 or do they subsidize that?
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.960]   No, you buy the projector for whatever it's called for $35,000.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.160]   So this is for Shaquille O'Neal, who would be mock.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.160]   Do you know what's enacted out?
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.160]   I see what it is.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.160]   I see what it is.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.160]   I see what it is.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.160]   That makes sense.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.640]   It's for people like Bruce Springsteen or George Clooney, who
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.600]   couldn't go to a movie theater and show movies.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:26.080]   So Bruce, George, you got the money by a $35,000 iris scanner.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.880]   Or if just people who just don't want to mix.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.000]   It's almost the price of the Coke in the theater anyway.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.240]   Wouldn't it be weird, though?
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.600]   I mean, do you want to watch a movie tonight?
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.600]   What do you want to watch?
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.200]   $500.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.960]   There are some people that have little theaters in their house.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.800]   You know, and that are very nice.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.600]   Not me.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.160]   But I wish.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.680]   I have dreams.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.680]   I have a little theater.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.960]   I dream of big theaters.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.960]   Alex is traveling, and his wife can't access it, because her
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.400]   thumbprint is different.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.360]   Ah, right.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.600]   Is it thumbprint or fireworks?
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:57.960]   What's funny is in Africa, you can't even buy a legitimate DVD,
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.120]   because the illegal trade is so high.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.240]   It's so rampant that--
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.240]   But when you stop at a stoplight, there's guys walking around
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.240]   with these little DVDs all flared out.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.920]   Literally, it's like the ones that were released three days ago.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.440]   But of course, when you buy them, it's
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:17.160]   at a guy shooting at an angle with Hong Kong subtitles.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.880]   So folks, when you complain about the fact that the Hobbit,
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.760]   I just bought tickets to see the Hobbit.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.400]   By the way, you can join us if you like.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.600]   We got a group of 20 going, but it's a week after it opens.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.040]   You probably want to go opening night.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.400]   Yeah, see, that's the thing.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.200]   I knew that this would be a bad idea.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:35.080]   December 21st, we're going down to the iMacs 48 FPS iMacs
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.160]   down in San Francisco.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.680]   I think that's how you should see the Hobbit.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.880]   Double frame rate, yeah.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.680]   Double frame account.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.760]   But it's like 17 bucks for a ticket.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.200]   But see, but see, that's the double compare to 500.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.040]   It's like you're seeing the movie twice.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.040]   It's double frame rate.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:52.640]   I got tickets for Sunday for the same thing.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.280]   Yeah, I want to see it like as it was as Peter Jackson intended.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.120]   You know, they're always scary.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.440]   They get a JRR toll keen intended it.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.040]   They've been having to explain to people.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.400]   There's actually a lot of trouble.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.640]   There's complaints about this.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.560]   A lot of the early views, a lot of this has to do with it.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.080]   The number of times it's flashing.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:14.400]   So in a standard 24 FPS, they flash it three times, you know,
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.120]   between right and left to make sure that you don't see any of the 3D artifacts.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:18.640]   Oh.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.680]   And this one, I think they're only flashing it once or twice.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.840]   And people are starting to say that they.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.320]   They could see the spirit come behind Gandalf's ear.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.720]   Is it going to be like Max, like Max Hadrim, when the blipfert makes your head explode?
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.960]   That's my only real concern.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:38.000]   Supposedly Peter Jackson says this makes you less sick than 28 frame.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.680]   And the reports that people are seeing is a lot of it has this.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.680]   The first time it's ever been done and that the flash rate may be too low.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.760]   And so we're actually getting is not enough.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.360]   And you're actually seeing more 3D artifacts than you saw.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:55.720]   So it may not the technology may not be completely sorted out, but we'll find out, won't we?
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.120]   Well, we'll find out on December 24.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.080]   I'm going to watch it in 2D so that I can enjoy the story.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:01.600]   Yes.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.920]   And then I'm going to watch it in 3D so I can see what it actually is.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.880]   That's kind of my preference.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.480]   I really.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.360]   Is there a 2D? Can you go see it in 2D?
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:08.800]   Yeah, it is 2D.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.120]   Pretty.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:14.400]   I'm kind of I like 3D for certain things.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.720]   I think it's really cool to experience the world.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.040]   Like I think that there are really like I take I have a 3D camera that I shoot stuff with.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.440]   And I really enjoy that.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.400]   I don't like it for movies.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.200]   Yeah, I kind of decided.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:34.160]   Apple's iTunes, according to Bloomberg, Bloomberg would be the world's would be one of the world's biggest media companies.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.720]   If we're just by itself.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:43.320]   Apple's media storefronts took in more than eight and a half billion dollars in their fiscal year that ended in September.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.320]   Eight and a half billion dollars through them.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.760]   That's music movies, TVs.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.160]   But if you so so put 8.5 billion.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:57.160]   That's that's more money than Warner Brothers.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.920]   Time magazine, The New York Times, Simon and Schuster combined.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.760]   I think Apple should.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.560]   I think there is a movement.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.080]   And I think that I'm kind of surprised.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.360]   I think that now that Steve Jobs is not there.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:12.880]   I think Steve Jobs, in my opinion, pandered too much to the to the to the to the to Hollywood.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.040]   I don't think he has era.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.440]   He had to kiss, but but I think that I think Apple.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:26.640]   I mean, I think what we're seeing with Netflix and with YouTube is and not yet with Amazon, but we're seeing some fairly aggressive moves to if you're not going to license your content, we're going to create our own.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.000]   We're going to pay for next to Netflix.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.480]   I mean, that YouTube this week, this last week opened a 40,000 square foot facility in LA to support that.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:34.760]   I know.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.120]   You know who you know, one of the people running that?
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.880]   Eileen Eileen Rivera.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:47.840]   So I think that that is a that's a great example and all of the I mean, one of the shows that's actually, you know, on YouTube is right around the corner.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.840]   Sort of sward in Lancer in our studio.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:56.920]   So the so that the point is is that the I think YouTube going down the direction Netflix getting their own content.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:02.280]   If Apple spent 100, you know, funded a blockbuster every week.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.480]   I mean, I'm sorry, every week, every month.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.080]   Every month, they can afford it.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.040]   It would be like more 200 million, 100 million, which is a hundred million.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.280]   They spend a hundred million dollars on it.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:09.800]   Small, small, small, small.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:16.120]   iTunes only releases, you know, that are that are shot, you know, and maybe they just do artsy ones and they're only 20 million dollars.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:16.520]   It doesn't matter.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:24.040]   It'd be like noise to them, but I think that I think that it increases their their leverage with Hollywood to show that they could come right into their.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:24.920]   It'd be the same people.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.680]   In the same way they would get the directors, they would just the same directors that everybody else has.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.440]   They would just be fun.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.080]   They would just be another media company, another funding company.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.000]   Because media, you know, Warner Brothers and Paramount, they're not movie companies.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.880]   They're banks.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:44.160]   You know, and the thing is, is that they're banks that fund other people's ideas and Apple could fund those just as easily and make them exclusively iTunes.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.040]   Oh, they don't think that'd be that it'd be that easy.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:47.760]   Why?
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.440]   I think I think why?
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:56.640]   Because how much money does Hollywood spend developing every single script that isn't produced for all them for each one that they actually produce?
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:01.120]   How many movies do they actually make that lose money before they find one that actually makes money?
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.920]   But the crazy thing is Apple doesn't need to necessarily make money at it.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.480]   You know, the thing is that they do.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.080]   Yeah, they do.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:12.760]   Let's bring our guests from Apple who says whether or not they expect to get something back for the 20 million dollars they spend for a low budget movie.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:21.480]   But the thing is, is that the issue, though, is that Apple, if you are underlying the platform that they're building, it could be seen as market interest.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.400]   I think I see that's the issue.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.520]   I'm with you.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:29.880]   If they were to if they were to look at the way that, of course, we have to mention Louis CK.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:38.920]   If the way that he does it, which the way that the way that he's done his career, where he accepted less money from FX network because they gave him complete control.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:48.400]   He accepted more trouble and more upfront money he had to spend on his pocket to releases concert movie himself because it gave him all the control and the money.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:59.880]   If Apple were to do were to essentially say the exact same thing, like if they were to if they were able to do for actor producers, what HBO is kind of able to do, they were they say, Hi, you're.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.280]   You're 52 years old, which means that Hollywood is not good.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:06.040]   It doesn't think that you're you're a bankable, openable actor anymore.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:10.760]   We will give you 40 million dollars to act produce and star in your own movie.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.120]   We, of course, are interested in building up content less than making money.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:18.520]   So you will essentially take one one out of every $2 that this takes in.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:27.520]   And we're asked Hollywood will tell you that that that all all the Star Wars movies have yet to turn a dollar in profits so that we're not so we can't pay off any of our profits.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:36.520]   We will actually open our books to you so that if you if this generated $10 million revenue, you will actually receive a check from us for $5 million.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.480]   Talk to all of our developers when they make money, we make money.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.160]   We make money. We give the money to them.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.000]   That that would actually work.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:57.600]   I don't think what what you're fighting against though is the fact that all these stars, the remember that 20 years ago, the idea of a movie star doing television, every one of their managers and ages would say, no, no, no, no, because once you start doing it,
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:03.000]   you're you're you're an house to the world that you are now off of the A list or no longer movie actor.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.280]   You are a television actor and it took a whole generation for that to burn off to realize that, well, actually, no, I'm Steve Buscemi.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.720]   I am acting at the top of my game in this series.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.680]   I'm on HBO is has increased my profile by by by.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:25.760]   Do you think that you know, do you think the fact that Kevin Spacey is going to do produce and act in a a series for Netflix shows that that's a little different?
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:40.920]   Kevin Spacey is different because he has not had a great career for the past 10 years, which is which is not to say that it's a desperation move, but it means that he is probably more receptive to interesting ideas like this.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:56.760]   The moment that Tom Cruise says that I've got this, I have this really cool historical drama that I really, really want to do, but even even Tom Cruise cannot get this movie made, I will take the I will take six weeks off to shoot and film this and we will release this direct on iTunes.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:12.920]   That will cause a lot of heads to turn because one of the great one of the great podcasts, the writer of the usual suspects, Chris John Corey was talking about how really it is once you get the right director on board, then you're kind of made as a screenwriter because the actors, the
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.600]   the A list actors, the first question they ask is who's directing this.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.640]   I want to I want to work with these great directors.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:25.120]   So if they were to get a the right director between jobs, this would be really, really interesting that has happened before.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.000]   There are all kinds of like Scorsese has done music videos.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.040]   He's done commercials.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:35.200]   He's done TV shows because he's got, you know, maybe five or six months of downtime between projects.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.680]   This shoot will only take him about three or four weeks and he likes to work.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:44.680]   So it's it's I don't think I don't think they would Apple could ever succeed at this by trying to be a studio.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:55.080]   But if they were to simply try to be the company that does for creative content, what they also do for for software developers saying, we will
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:55.720]   take the money.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:06.200]   We will give you a a a a predictable percentage of every single dollar that you make and we don't and we will give you some we'll give you some hassle about what constitutes the shape of a button.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.440]   But still, as long as your movie does not act.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.320]   You can do that now.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:15.040]   I mean, there are clearing houses right now that will let you know like there's basically in the same way that CD Baby works.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:24.120]   There are independent groups that if you want to put your film onto iTunes, you know, you can get it on the iTunes and get your 70% well, they get your 70% and then you split that with them.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.160]   And I don't know how that split works.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.400]   So it's it's possible to get stuff on the iTunes right now.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.240]   But I think it's not see baby.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:29.960]   Somebody like that.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.120]   It's like someone I can't think of the name of it.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:39.400]   But there's some independent interesting, you know, there are ways to get your stuff on the iTunes right now at what Apple doesn't want to do is is be writing $10 checks to 20,000 people.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:43.600]   So there they want they want someone else to act as the mediator for that.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:53.160]   But but I think that the I think that the opportunity for Apple, though, is a focused effort to show that filmmakers could make money doing this directly.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:59.920]   And I think that in many ways, the way YouTube is, you know, and Netflix is investing directly.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.760]   I think that there are ways to prove that model.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:06.520]   And I think that Apple stands to lose ground to those two players.
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:09.160]   If they don't agree, they have the money to do it.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:14.880]   They have the they have people who much people who are much more likely to pay connected to their to their system.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.960]   They have all the pieces in place to make that work.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.160]   And I think that, you know, it would make a lot of sense.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:23.120]   And it doesn't have to be a hundred million dollar movie could be a lot of 20 million dollar movies or 10 million dollar movies.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:29.840]   These are five million dollar movies that are only available on iTunes that that are being that are specifically going down that path.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.120]   And it doesn't mean, you know, Apple stirring that pot, priming that pump.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:42.320]   You know, I think, you know, could greatly greatly improve their leverage with Hollywood.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:50.360]   If they start showing because the conversations behind the scenes are, you know, this gets a whole lot uglier from here because we've got we've got enough cash to bury you.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:58.880]   I mean, as soon as they get two or three hits on iTunes, this whole conversation gets, you know, downright ugly because now you have Hollywood running scared.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.960]   You've got so much more experience with Hollywood and show business than I do.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:09.160]   But also I'm just saying this as perspective of someone who is asking what might be dumb questions, but isn't.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:13.080]   I don't think that it doesn't seem to me that they will have any leverage with Hollywood.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:23.680]   So long as Hollywood will always have the last Batman movie offered on streaming and offered for digital purpose purchase, as long as they will have the hobbit.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:31.480]   So long as they will have the next transformers, the next movie, these ones that they could say they could say, oh, Apple, you want to be in the movie business?
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.960]   Great. Well, just like we wouldn't really lease out our Disney.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.360]   We wouldn't lease out our Pixar movies to a competing studio.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.800]   I don't think we're going to let you have any of our any of our other releases.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.760]   Okay. Just just a bad example with that.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:49.840]   Yeah, but those are definitely there are definitely marquee products, but there's a lot of other films out there that make money.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.600]   You look at Argo from, you know, Ben Beniflek would be the kind of guy that you that Apple could probably make.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.600]   I can see him doing it.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:06.640]   You know, you know, Ed Burns will be another guy that would probably do, you know, there's a lot of producers out there that have produced a lot of great, you know, content producers and directors that are there all.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:10.680]   I mean, when you're in Hollywood, everyone's talking about how to survive what's happening.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:21.120]   You know, they're, you know, they're the whole, everything is constricting there right now, you know, and everyone's trying to figure out, you know, and everyone knows that online is somehow going to be the future and they can't figure out how to make money with it.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:27.680]   If Apple starts dishing out some money and start pushing pushing down that path, it would and it would scare the studio.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:33.840]   Because they would see where Apple could go with this because Apple has, I mean, they're spending as an aggregate.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.760]   I think the number is 30 to $40 billion a year.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:44.720]   That's all of the movie theaters. I mean, all the movie, all the entire movie industry, you know, and so Apple, you know, Apple decided that they just wanted to lean into this.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:54.040]   You know, they don't have to lean very hard before they start losing, you know, and the key is it's not what Apple doesn't need to do is it doesn't need to pay for all of it.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:59.440]   It needs to, it needs to create a passage that starts to look profitable.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:09.440]   Apple figures that out. Like, you know, because I'm the kind of guy that if Skyfall, for instance, came out as an iTunes property and was there, I would much rather watch it at home.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:13.760]   Like, you know, I don't want to wait. You know, I'd watch it. You know, I just, I buy it.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.440]   I mean, I buy a movie probably once every two or three days at home.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:21.920]   You know, and so the thing is, is that it would be, it would be great to have that Josh Whedon, by the way, it would be another.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:32.640]   A Joss Whedon would be another person that would be great to, you know, let's take a break. We're going to come back with more Andy and not co Alex Lindsey Renee Richie, as somebody on Twitter said the dream team.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:41.440]   And Twitter, you know, is always right. We will have more on Mac break weekly in a bit, but first a word from Ford, the Ford Motor Company.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:47.080]   Now that's the Apple of Motor Company cars. If you ask me, Ford is doing some amazing things.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:56.080]   And I love it that it's an American car company that is making such great strides in technology. We talked about the lane assist, lane keeper assist.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:02.200]   We talked about the adaptive cruise control. Have you played with bliss? This is pretty cool.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:10.440]   It's called the blind spot information system bliss. You've got sensor. This, this, this I need.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:17.040]   There it is. There's sensors in both vehicle rear quarter panels that scan blind spots to detect traffic.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:25.520]   And then you saw the light in the rear view mirror, you get audible and visual alerts saying, hey, there's something my son is learning to drive right now.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.240]   Just got his permit. We could really use this.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:32.400]   Send a me going, it could just go.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.280]   You might want to watch your left rear.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:40.560]   You can warn drivers of oncoming traffic when you're backing out of a parking space.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:45.240]   You know, I, this happens to me all the time. You're backing out and there's a big van here and there's a truck there.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.400]   You can't see what's around that corner, but the bliss can.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:52.920]   And I've actually used this and it's kind of amazing where it goes. Yeah, there's slow that. Whoop.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.000]   They also have active park assistants. I have used this.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:03.480]   Couple of years ago. And I didn't do so good in it, but you will do better in it.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.840]   What it does is you're driving. So I was driving a Ford Flex and you drive along.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:12.200]   They actually set this up the test track for me and you drive along and it press the button and it finds you a space.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.920]   It actually measures the spaces that you're going by.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.760]   So it could say, yeah, that one will fit. It calculates.
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.280]   Yes. It can. And then you just take your hands off the wheel.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.200]   What you don't do and what I did is I took my foot off the brake and the.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.360]   So you take your hands off the wheel.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.480]   It steers the car into place exactly in 24 seconds.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:35.040]   You do operate the accelerator gear selector and brake pedal.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:39.760]   They neglected to tell me that because the car, once it's parked, is still in gear.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.680]   Right. You don't just sit there. It backed up slowly in the car behind me.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.640]   They thought that it would be nice for you to have a little control.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:52.000]   I don't know what I was thinking. I thought it was going to turn off the car, open the door and say you're here.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.480]   Yes. Didn't do that. But it does. Do it. Show that video again.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.320]   If for those of you watching a video, it's amazing.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.200]   If you're not watching a video, you can go to Ford.com/technology
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.120]   and see how this stuff works. It is really, really cool.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.680]   It's available in the 2013 Ford Fusion, my next car.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.520]   So see now it says searching space found, pull forward.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.640]   And then you put it in drive.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.960]   You do keep your foot on the accelerator and not and or break.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:18.680]   And then it's it's really weird because it spins the wheel around and parks you.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:23.400]   Perfectly, by the way, the way you were taught to do parallel parking, but never could really
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.960]   reproduce just so.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.600]   It's also available in the 2013 Ford tourists.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.160]   I had it in the Flex. So it's available in some other fords as well.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:36.240]   If you go to your Ford dealer and say, I want to take a look at Bliss and the active park assist,
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:41.040]   they can show you or learn more at Ford.com/technology.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:45.080]   That was all done by the car. That's so sweet. So sweet.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:48.960]   Soon, Stormbringer says, this generation is going to barely know how to tie their shoes.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.200]   Yeah, you know, as soon as they come up with a self tying shoe, I'm buying.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.520]   Wasn't that in the back to the future? I'm buying the future.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.960]   I have a self-tying shoe. I have a self-tying shoe.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.040]   Yes, it's called Velcro. It's called it's called slip-ons.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.840]   I don't wear it. I don't wear me too.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.840]   You spent too much time in an airport and you stop you stop getting lazy.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:08.480]   No more laces. No, I don't. I literally don't have any shoes that have laces.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.720]   It's an interesting problem because, you know, Michael, Lisa's son is 10.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:16.520]   And he says, I want to wear lace-up shoes now because you wore Velcro like up until then.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:20.440]   And all the big kids wear lace-up shoes, but he doesn't have to tie shoes because he's always used Velcro.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.840]   Right. Right. So we got to I got to sit down.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.360]   Okay.
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.840]   I have to think about it now because I don't have any years.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:32.400]   Is there a song? See, Canadians have a song. What's the song?
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.560]   I'm sure it's the same instructions.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.000]   You loop the bow and you put it underneath.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.920]   We just do it to probably the theme of "O Canada."
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:44.160]   I love it. I want it.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:51.040]   Let's see. Actually, Leo, there was a really interesting story that broke just this afternoon.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.200]   Netflix has gotten like first run rights to Disney movies starting in 2016.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.920]   I saw that. That is huge because I never gave up on Netflix.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:04.040]   And people were worried because they lost one of the libraries that they had
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.200]   about that time frame. So they got Disney, huh?
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.680]   Yeah. Well, also starting in 2016, Netflix is going to Mashable.com.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.040]   Starting in 2016, Netflix users will be able to stream first-run Disney movies on their mobile devices,
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.520]   computers and television. Oh, also includes direct to video new releases.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.200]   I'm trying to figure out. I just, well, during the commercial, I'm paying somebody to try to find out
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.960]   whether they mean actual first-run releases or do they mean with the entertainment?
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:30.200]   Here's the Reuters story that I'm sure Mashable is just reprinting.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:34.280]   Walt Disney Company agreed to give Netflix exclusive TV distribution rights to its movies,
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:41.160]   becoming the first major studio to stream its movies to TV viewers via Netflix instead of HBO
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.960]   Showtime or other premium channels. In other words, HBO and Showtime just lost Disney.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.280]   Netflix won exclusive.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.160]   That was expensive. This is not till 2016.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.920]   Currently, they have a deal with stars.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.800]   That's what they lost. Netflix lost stars.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.800]   Oh, that's what I'm like.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:00.480]   Talk about blowback. Holy cow.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.280]   Oh, you don't want to do a deal. OK, I understand.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.240]   We're just going to take your number one property.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:09.360]   The deal gives Netflix streaming rights to movies from Disney's live action and animation studios.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:13.840]   That includes Pixar and Star Wars, Lucas films, Marvel.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:20.440]   Wow. DreamWorks, not included in the deal is that studio to show time.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:28.440]   The last episode before the season finale, Netflix is surrounded by all of its enemies.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.080]   They're holding up to you.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.800]   And then the phone call the next.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.520]   Oh, it looks like Nucky Thompson pulled one out of the fire again.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:38.480]   So to clarify what you were asking about Netflix,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.880]   constrained Disney movies beginning seven to nine months after theatrical release.
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.160]   That's the same as stars deal.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.880]   So it's it's not right away.
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.440]   It's not first run in the sense that, you know,
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:52.720]   at the same time as in theater, it does not cover DVD rentals of Disney movies.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:59.080]   So it starts seven to nine months after theaters, but that's probably 30 days after.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:07.120]   It makes it makes you think a little bit, though, that if if Apple were to do like a streaming service,
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:12.520]   now Netflix has that exclusive, but they would still have the iTunes store would still have access to rental.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.120]   Wow.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:18.520]   But from this, you would the one interpret the interpretation that I'm getting
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:22.080]   from the Reuters article is that if Apple were doing all these behind the scenes deals
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:26.160]   to get like these streaming content, they would not be able to have that.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.440]   Or at least not as not not before it would be available to to video.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.280]   Right.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.200]   Interesting.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.720]   It comes back.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:43.040]   Apple still leads Samsung and overall impressions, but Android dominance iOS with 20 with 52
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:43.680]   percent dominate.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.880]   I think it's a big.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.760]   OK, 52 percent market share.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.760]   Can't Apple Apple doesn't have 48.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.560]   They have Apple 31.45 percent.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.240]   So Apple is up, by the way.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:58.200]   You've I guess that's dominating.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.560]   That's a that's a big number.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:04.000]   Samsung second place 21 Samsung alone.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.720]   We're talking we're trying to enjoy all of Android, but Samsung alone is number three.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:14.320]   So it's Android Apple Samsung, 24.5 percent of all phones.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:19.120]   Galaxy S overtook the blackberry curve.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:21.280]   Is it?
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.120]   Should they feel good about that?
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.160]   I mean, well, it was second place.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.400]   iPhones number one galaxy passed someone who was crawling on the ground.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.160]   Yeah, but it was but it was number two was the number two phone because of all the
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.000]   emerging markets are huge emerging markets.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.600]   Yeah, this is in this includes international.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:39.680]   You know, Mary Meeker did her annual state of the whatever and her state of the
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:44.920]   whatever was Android dominates globally, but in the US iOS dominates iPhone
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:45.480]   dominates.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:49.280]   And I think that that's probably the accurate way to describe that.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.200]   The strange relationship because they have the market share, but Apple has the
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:52.840]   profit share.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:56.560]   They have the handset share, but Apple has the web usage and app usage share.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:00.360]   It's a very strange dichotomy that exists between people who buy Android
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.480]   devices and people who use iOS devices.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:02.720]   Right.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.960]   I wish these companies be more clear about how they get their numbers and how
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.840]   they measure them and what they're actually reporting because it's always
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:09.760]   nebulous.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:13.120]   And the companies that report on these findings always pick the most
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.480]   sensational title possible.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.560]   And then it's very hard to see what they're measuring.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:16.840]   Right.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:21.200]   I mean, I talk it's it's interesting how those two lines are going to start
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:27.640]   converging every every person of every company that sells content through both
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.880]   an Android store and an iTunes store.
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.720]   I'm not talking about just apps.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.920]   I'm talking about in app purchases.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:35.880]   They tell they won't give me specific numbers, but they tell me that their
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:40.520]   iTunes, excuse me, their iOS apps or on a per app basis are more profitable than
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:41.360]   their Android apps.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:47.800]   However, the the quantity of Android devices is starting the numbers are starting
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:52.360]   to say that the quantity is starting to make up for that lack of profitability per
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:52.840]   handset.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:58.000]   So as these two different graphs of how how the Android business and how the
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.200]   iPhone business is going are going to start flattening out and meeting each other.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.560]   I wonder how far in the future it's going to start to.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.160]   We're going to find a point which a developer might say, actually, we will
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:11.200]   probably make more money in total if we get a certain percentage of the total
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.000]   Android market versus if we target this towards iOS first.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.960]   It's it's interesting to look at the look of the numbers.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:22.560]   I was I always think Andy, if there'd be one of those Marvel what if comics and
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:27.240]   Google and Apple had never split up and we had the Apple hardware with all the
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.120]   Google services still where we'd be today.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:33.840]   I think it's it's something that it's it's really fascinating to take a
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:39.080]   look at all this stuff because Apple is I think next year is going to be an
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.960]   especially interesting year for the iPhone because I'm wondering how much
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:49.240]   longer Apple can put all of their iPhone business into one new device a year and
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:54.240]   say that I know that market wise people want a larger screen than the one you're
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.600]   providing you, but we decided to give you a thinner phone instead.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.560]   I think there's good I think there's going to be a moment where Apple is going
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.600]   to have to say, okay, we're going to have to produce two different phones because
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:07.280]   we're getting so much information about what the market wants out of a handset.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.920]   And we are no than the market is now competitive enough that we can no longer
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:17.360]   simply say that the style the the ecosystem, although there's the stability of the
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:21.760]   of the iOS ecosystem outweighs the fact that maybe people want a larger screen or
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:26.560]   maybe people want a phone with a bigger camera, a better camera, which now we can't
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:32.160]   produce because Nokia Nokia and other companies are willing to put technologies
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.680]   into their phones that make the phone a little bit thicker, but they give these
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:39.560]   really cool image stable optical image stabilization features that might not be
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:42.520]   possible when you try to pack that into a tiny tiny thin phone.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:47.040]   So it's going to continue to be an interesting year as Apple is now starting
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:51.320]   now as now starting to fight against the competitors who can actually punch back.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.400]   It's interesting to see if they let Samsung do their market research.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.240]   You know, they've waited a long time to put out the mini iPad and now
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.640]   Samsung has a device that every quarter inch interval in Apple might just be
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:04.920]   watching to see which ones are actually the gravitational devices to go to words.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:09.280]   I've actually I've actually thought that before where Samsung steals from the
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:12.640]   iPhone for their they steal their design information from from Apple.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:17.280]   Apple steals marketing information from Samsung because I mean, I just I just got
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:22.200]   the the Galaxy Note 2 last week for testing and just it's fun to put these
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.080]   next to here.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.320]   Okay, here's the really big Samsung Galaxy phone.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.240]   Here's the really small Galaxy phone.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:31.400]   In the middle, here's the one that's a little bit between those two of them.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:35.520]   And it's it really it really look at this and you wonder, Samsung is a big
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:36.000]   enough company.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.160]   They can afford to do that.
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.680]   They're successful enough that they're active that they did a note too,
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:42.200]   instead of just making this one for one off free product.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:46.360]   You know, at what point does do you look at this and say, isn't it kind of cool
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:51.120]   that if I want a really big stupid big screen, I can buy one.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:54.840]   If I want a really small screen, Samsung will sell me one of those two.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.880]   They're not telling me I'm stupid for wanting something that's a little bit
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:01.040]   different from what's when someone next to me on the plane has.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.800]   They're selling that note too pretty well.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.560]   I think what did I see the numbers was like five million, 10 million.
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:09.960]   It's now their number one Android beating the Galaxy S3.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.560]   People and people like big phones, I guess.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:17.480]   I, you know, I thought was I got to admit that last year, the first time I saw
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:18.840]   one, I thought it was stupid.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.080]   I thought it was big and dumb and ungainly.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:24.280]   I think after this year of having so much experience with seven
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:27.080]   centimeter inch tablets, it makes more sense to me.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:32.840]   It's big enough that it just barely fits in my one size fits all car cradle.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:38.200]   But now I've got, I can see when I'm using the ways app, I can see 20 minutes
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.920]   ahead of me, every traffic condition and know if I need to bail out of my
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:42.960]   my current plans or not.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:46.920]   And that alone is like, okay, it's not too bad reading a full pay paperback
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.440]   page of text on a pocket size device.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:50.760]   It's not too bad either.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:54.000]   So just imagine if you went to Best Buy in every size television cost,
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.240]   the same amount of money, how many people would go for the biggest
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.880]   television in the store?
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.280]   Cause it's no longer any money.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:50:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:05.480]   I have two Galaxy Note twos cause then I put them together and I can do windowing.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.240]   Do you know the one with the Verizon button Leo?
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.400]   The Verizon button on the front?
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.680]   No, I have, I just got a sprint one cause I wanted LTE.
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:13.200]   This was the unlocked European one.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:18.320]   Um, and, uh, I like the big size and I guess I'm not alone.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.000]   Uh, yeah, again, it's selling well.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.240]   It's, it isn't cheap either.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.360]   The world's smallest way contact.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.080]   Also, yeah.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.800]   That's it.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:31.320]   And that's another thing to again, the idea of having an actual like active
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:35.520]   stylus on it, the first, the first time that I was using this and there's like,
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:39.600]   the, the note app has like, I don't know if you can see it has like line grids or
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:40.520]   actually graph paper.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:45.120]   And I'm a big fan of styluses on the iPad cause I like to sketch and doodle
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:45.760]   and that sort of stuff.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:49.720]   The first time I'm like, gee, I wonder if I can put a dot right at the intersection
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:50.120]   of those two.
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.840]   Hey, I can put a dot right at the intersection of those two.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.640]   I wonder if I can draw a circle that's perfectly centered around that dot.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.520]   Hey, I can draw a circle that's perfectly centered around that dot.
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:02.080]   Gee, I wonder if I wonder if I, there's a button at the bottom here that says,
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.400]   please ignore my palm resting on the screen and only take input from the, hey,
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.720]   I can actually actually move, like she put my finger wherever I want.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:11.560]   Cause it's only, oh boy.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:16.840]   And you have that awful awful, often traveling salesman and lonely, traveling
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:20.480]   salesman who remembers his wife, but now he's very lonely and he's in an airport bar
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.680]   and that woman at the end of the bar was giving him the eyes.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:24.000]   Like it's good for writing phone numbers down.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.480]   I must say it'd be nice to have a stylist on my iPhone.
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.280]   I'm doing that with the IP and the Google Connect.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:35.880]   So this raises a problem for Apple because according to Philip Elmer,
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:40.600]   DeWitt writing and fortune, Apple gets all of its processors for the iPhone,
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:45.640]   the iPad, the iPod touch, all the ARM process from Samsung for now.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:50.080]   Well, I'm sure Apple would love to change that.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:56.240]   But maybe it's not so easy that he, Philip quotes RBC capitals,
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:03.040]   Amit Dariani, who is an analyst and Dariani says,
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:05.320]   it's not going to be easy to switch suppliers.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:09.720]   Apple did most of the heavy lifting on the A6 chips and the current iPhones and
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:13.240]   iPads, designing the processes in house and then using Samsung as a fab,
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.000]   but paying them to manufacture.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.680]   But moving to a different factory would require a complete redo that would take
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:24.160]   a minimum of 12 to 18 months cost of fortune and not produce marketable chips
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.400]   before 2014.
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:29.240]   So we're talking billions of dollars to make a new fab.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.080]   Unfortunately, Apple doesn't have that kind of money.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.000]   It couldn't be a good.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.280]   I'm not going to bet they've actually broken ground.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.560]   I would think that this is something that Tim Cook said, well, we got to do it.
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.840]   I mean, I think there's our secret fabs.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:45.120]   The advantage of, I think the advantage to Apple obviously is,
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.000]   is being able to build something that's very custom, being able to,
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.640]   you know, be very secretive.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.640]   I think the disadvantage is that there are certain levels of synergy when you're
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:57.680]   working with a fab company that is working for everyone, that there's a lot of
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:01.160]   stuff that they're constantly investing in and improving, that, you know,
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:05.400]   when you start forking and doing it yourself, you have to keep, you have to be
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.760]   doing all that upkeep yourself.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.520]   So I, you know, that's, I think that's the downside for Apple.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.720]   Here's the interesting thing.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:15.400]   Apparently, according to RBC, Intel has made an offer to Apple saying,
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:16.960]   we'll build ARM processors.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.840]   Intel has fabs up the wazoo.
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:22.000]   We'll build ARM processors for the iPhone.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.440]   If you, if you switch to Intel for the iPad, and they have the best fabs,
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:29.320]   I mean, I think they're down to 14 nanometer with the internet chips.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.720]   Apple's still at 22.
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:31.240]   That's right.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.880]   It's really hugely important for mobile.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:33.440]   That's right.
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.120]   The only thing with, with analyst stuff, I never believe that their interests are
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.120]   actually aligned with media or with readers.
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:42.040]   So what they're putting out is quite often designed to serve analyst purposes.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:44.360]   And sometimes it's already based on the blogs, then later,
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.800]   right, take their statements and rewrite it.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:47.480]   So, right.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:49.520]   So this is the, yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.920]   And so let's, let's qualify this.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:54.720]   This comes from RBC capital, which is an analyst and Doug Friedman.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.840]   And he reported this on Friday that Cupertino's and talks, but no one else has
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.680]   confirmed that, including Intel or Apple.
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:00.160]   Right.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.840]   Um, you're right.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:06.120]   And we should always, uh, salt those stories when they're from analysts.
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.600]   And just mention that that's from an analyst.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.440]   I know analysts are serving their customers and their companies.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:11.720]   Yes.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.000]   They're not serving, as you say, media or us or users.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.520]   They're using us to service their banks and then they're going.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.640]   No, the interesting thing though, is that if Apple took it away from Samsung,
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:24.560]   that would they, they would take more away from Samsung than the entire, uh,
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.880]   ruling from a, you know, the one billion, right?
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.400]   And it'd be much more expensive.
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.440]   You wanted to punish them.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.440]   That's the way to do it.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:34.480]   But, and I don't think, and you know, by the way, they added the note to, to the court case,
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.560]   they're trying to get, they're trying to get the note to out of the US.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:41.240]   I think any jury looking at the note to is not going to say, Oh, that's a copy of an iPhone.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:41.760]   Right.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.800]   I think at this point, there's enough differentiation that it's pretty
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.040]   obviously a different product.
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:51.120]   Apple owns the page turn, ladies and gentlemen, and it's about time.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:56.320]   No, connect to built in writing in the bits blog, uh, patent filed by Apple and
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.200]   approved the week of November 16th, the United States patent and trademark office,
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:04.880]   a design patent titled display screen or portion thereof with animated graphical
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:05.920]   user interface.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:11.960]   Apple now exclusively owns the page turn in an e-reader application.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.880]   Nothing.
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.120]   I don't think that's so skew amore, skew morphic.
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.960]   I don't think people really care about that, do they?
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.040]   Kindle doesn't bother.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:20.640]   No.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:25.160]   Well, they hear, I'm, I'm putting to screen lock mode.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:25.880]   Cause I just, okay.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:31.640]   Anyway, there's the, here's how Google Play book reader app does it, where
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:35.000]   there's still sort of a kind of a pseudo page turn.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.480]   So it's not like a corner page, but it's a cool little piece of animation.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:41.760]   Do we all agree? This is ridiculous. Oh yeah.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:44.560]   In fact, this is what Nick built and says, yeah, that's right.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:49.160]   Apple now owns the page turn, you know, as when you turn a page with your hand,
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:53.000]   a interface that's been around for hundreds of years in physical form.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.760]   I swear I've seen similar animations at Disney or Warner Brothers cartoons.
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:00.720]   This is where readers are probably checking the URL of this article to make sure
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.280]   it's the New York Times and not the onion.
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:08.520]   Even there was iOS apps like classic that did the page turn long before Apple did
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:12.200]   in the iBooks. But I think companies, Apple and any other company just patent
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.680]   everything that comes out of them.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:14.720]   It's automatic.
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:18.120]   And if the feds say, okay, yeah, they bought it.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:19.520]   Truckled it.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:23.080]   I mean, they, they, I mean, that is part of the culture to patent everything,
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:26.600]   but it's in the, in the light of all the legal actions that have been filed,
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:31.000]   left and right, none, not, not the least of which from Apple, you just hate,
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.280]   you hate to see a device like the note to being, being under any sort of a legal
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:41.360]   threat for any reason other than it looks and acts exactly like clearly it was
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:44.520]   stolen from, from something that Apple designed with that, which is what happened
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:45.640]   with the first Samsung Galaxy.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:46.520]   That's perfectly fine.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:49.440]   But when they start saying that, oh, well, yes, by some phony,
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.280]   baloney thing that everybody thinks is ridiculous.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.160]   We got a patent on turning pages and hey, what's that?
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:57.640]   You've actually got a page turning mechanism inside your device band or at
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:58.280]   least we'll get to it.
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:01.720]   We'll try to get an injunction against you so that we'll at least not lie to
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:04.200]   launch in the US at the same time we're launching worldwide.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:04.520]   Right.
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:07.840]   So that's, that's, that's, that's why this is like, oh, man, really,
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.680]   but I'm not sure, but I think that like radio patents, when you look at prior
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:13.960]   art, I think that I'm not sure, but I think Zinnio has been doing this for at
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:14.600]   least a decade.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:19.240]   People have as, as Renee pointed out, classic, which is a third party app.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.920]   Did it before Apple did it.
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:25.720]   I think you're right, Renee, but it's one of 38 patents granted to Apple in that
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:26.720]   week alone.
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:29.120]   So they've got a building full of lawyers.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:30.280]   They're building nuclear bombs.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:31.440]   They're just putting their warehouse.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.440]   Everyone else is building up their way.
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:33.760]   They're putting them at each other.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:40.040]   One of the other ones is skin tone aware color boost for cameras, location based
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:44.920]   categorical information services and consistent backup of electronic
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:48.520]   information, all of these granted patents of mass destruction.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.320]   Patents of mass destruction.
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:52.200]   I think we have a show.
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:57.560]   Unless you unless unless like the plans for the, for the, the new, new spaceship
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:01.400]   headquarters has like a docking bay for temp time traveling DeLoreans.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:04.160]   I think that Apple's going to have problems explaining that yes, we invented
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:04.760]   all this stuff.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:09.160]   I don't, that's the point is that you can get a patent, but it has to be
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:10.120]   defended in court.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:14.040]   You got to convince a judge or a jury that this is legit.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:17.760]   And I don't think it's so hard for the opponents to say, really, your honor
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.440]   and age turn your honor.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:24.480]   And as some folks in the, uh, in our chat room are, are, are pointing out is the
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:29.480]   other issue is, is that you, um, uh, is that it also protects you against other,
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:30.600]   you know, pay.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:31.440]   It's a fence.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:34.400]   It's also a defensive thing, whether you're going to, you know, you, you, because, you
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:37.560]   know, if Apple could patent it, so could somebody else and then they'd, then it's,
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:41.480]   it's less expensive to do the patent than to get into a legal back and forth with a
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:43.320]   patent role, even if you're going to win.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:46.360]   And you get the feeling that the US patent office would rather just grant
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:47.720]   everything and let people sue it out.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:48.840]   They would stand on that.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:52.080]   That's how it's, that's what it's become is that essentially we'll, we'll grant it.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:56.040]   And it has to be approved in court, which is, I think not a good system.
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:58.600]   I think, I think we should go back to where you have to build every, remember, then
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:03.880]   the old patent days, we had to build an actual, uh, example of what it was going to be.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:04.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.320]   I think that's, you couldn't patent math.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.160]   You can, can patent math.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.720]   You have to have a model, a physical model.
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.440]   I mean, that's awesome.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.320]   You know what, you know what?
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:11.400]   You know what?
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.520]   I think the ultimate solution is I, I think that would a wonderful world.
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:19.960]   This would be if the same Apple employees whose job it is to like approve apps were
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:23.240]   to transfer to the patent office, because I want them to be the nipus.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:27.160]   Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm going to delay this patent for a year and a half.
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:32.280]   Like, yeah, we rejected it because you put the staple a little bit too high in the left corner.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.720]   It should be a little bit lower.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.160]   But you're, you're, you're welcome to refile.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.400]   Oh, Ariel wrong font choice.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.000]   I don't like a gradient.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:41.800]   All right.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:46.120]   We're, you know, unfortunately, unfortunately this, this duplicates existing features already
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.960]   found in the natural world.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:48.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:53.720]   Now, but I guess if you're going to allow software pens, what they're patenting is the
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:56.440]   implementation of a real page turn in software, right?
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.000]   So that's, that is not, I mean, the fact that you could do it on a book is not germane.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.480]   You're duplicating that capability on, you know, on, on, on in a software.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:10.280]   But this, this is where people who aren't lawyers like us get really, really hot and
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:15.160]   bothered about it because you can't, we, we, we're, we grew up with this, a naive idea that
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.000]   patents are for people who invent things.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.680]   And, and the first question that we all think is, well, they didn't invent turning a page.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:26.200]   They looked at a page turn, but she wouldn't be cool to do that exact same thing.
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.080]   And software.
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.520]   And that's where they got it from that you could, you could have a software development team that
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:35.160]   has never used touch or heard of Apple before developing a book reader app that does the exact
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.120]   same thing.
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.520]   And just, yeah, yeah, copyists.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.680]   I guess we're just naive.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.320]   Let's take a break.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:46.520]   Come back with more Andy and not go from the Chicago Sun Times, ukulele player extraordinaire.
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:50.520]   Renee Richie, I'm curious if I more has some new rumors.
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.800]   We'll, we'll ask you about the rumors.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.240]   Uh, links, I guess is the one rumor we haven't really talked about.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:02:00.040]   The next version of OS 10 and also here, Alex Lindsey from Pixel core.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:04.600]   If you create a new web space, a new website, a new presence on the internet, can I tell you
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:09.160]   the best place to go squarespace.com, you're going to need hosting and you're going to want
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.920]   to put software on there that lets you do a content management, unless you plan to hand design
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.680]   in every single page in HTML and all the content.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.720]   And that's no way to go.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:21.320]   So squarespace is the first place you should go because Squarespace does hosting.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.920]   The best hosting ever never goes down.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:28.600]   Remember the during Hurricane Sandy, they were hand ferrying buckets of diesel fuel to keep
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.400]   a generator running on the servers.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:35.720]   That's how much Anthony, Castellain and crew care, but they also have the best,
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.600]   the best software, the new squarespaces out, squarespace six.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:45.160]   And it is very modern, beautiful templates by beautiful, you know, I mean, spectacular designs,
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:48.040]   but they're also mobile responsive.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:52.280]   So when you go to different screen sizes, and nowadays every site has to be able to go to a,
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.000]   you know, a three and a half inch screen all the way up to 27 inch screen.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:55.640]   How do you do that?
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.320]   Mobile responsive design.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:05.240]   This is the site in its underlying underpinnings is designed fundamentally to adapt itself to
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.360]   any screen size.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:11.960]   That's why when you, for instance, post a picture on a squarespace site, they automatically generate
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.640]   seven thumbnails to have exactly the right size for the right screen.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:20.120]   This is why if you're a photographer, you want a portfolio, a designer, a artist,
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.520]   squarespace is a great place to go for portfolios.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:28.120]   Your portfolio is going to look great, represent you beautifully, no matter what size screen people
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:28.680]   visit it on.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.440]   I think that's a real selling point.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:36.200]   If your photographer wants to send clients to your site, that site has to look great and has
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.480]   to work great and squarespace never goes down, always looks great.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:43.160]   I think the best thing to do is to try a free 14 day trial.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.840]   You get 24 seven support, you get all the support you would get as a paying customer.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.440]   So you can ask all the questions you want.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.680]   You get to play with all the tools you don't need a credit card.
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:56.040]   Just go right now to squarespace.com, click the yellow get started button, you'll choose a template.
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:02.200]   You can import all your content from existing sites using the main APIs, the blogger,
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.040]   I think it's a blogger type pad and WordPress API.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:11.880]   So those just get imported right in, including comments, including SEO, including links.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.360]   There's all the beautiful templates you can choose from.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.000]   I just think you're going to love it.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.320]   Now, if you decide, hey, yeah, this is pretty good.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.800]   You're going to be very impressed by the pricing.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.320]   They've simplified the pricing scheme.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.200]   It's much more straightforward than it used to be.
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.680]   A standard subscription is $8 a month when you buy an annual plan.
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:33.160]   I know I say this every week, but I always look at that and go, what?
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:38.440]   Well, this is the one is this unlimited plan where you get unlimited pages,
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:41.960]   unlimited galleries, unlimited blogs, unlimited bandwidth.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:46.520]   That means if you suddenly get tweeted or slash dotted, if everybody goes to your site at once,
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.080]   it doesn't matter.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:50.680]   Not only will the site not go down, you're not going to pay some sort of premium.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.840]   If you're on squarespace, you won't even know what a slash dot is.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.200]   You won't even know what a slash dot is.
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:54.920]   It'll just happen.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.720]   What it'll be called is more more visitors.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:01.640]   And by the way, the stats are great to see exactly where that spike was and all that stuff.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.640]   Unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:08.600]   When you buy an annual plan, you get the domain name free so you can register any domain name you want.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:12.680]   They also hook it up so that it works seamlessly to go to your squarespace site.
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:18.600]   You get an advanced form builder, all the $16 a month when you pay annually.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:22.920]   And we're going to save you even more because if you use our offer code, Macbreak12,
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:30.120]   Macbreak12, you get 10% off whatever your first purchase is.
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.800]   So you can save a significant amount of money.
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.960]   It's like a month and a half free.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:37.000]   squarespace.com
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.200]   I invite you to try it free because I think you're going to be very
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:40.600]   impressed.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:46.600]   And if you do decide to buy Macbreak12 as the offer code, this exceptional, exceptional stuff.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:47.880]   It's key to the operation.
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:51.240]   The key to the operation as Mr. Lindsay says,
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:54.360]   Apple is interesting.
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.560]   His hiring doesn't.
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:59.640]   This kind of goes back to that story about Apple maybe going building their own fab.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:03.400]   They've hired dozens of former Texas Instruments engineers
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:08.040]   and sent them to Israel to work on chips.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:13.320]   We knew they'd been expanding their chip stuff, but they've really expanded it quite a bit.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:16.120]   They have Bob Mansfield now heading to technology division.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:21.080]   According to sources close to the situation, and this is the next web,
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:28.280]   writing Matt Bryan, Apple's been hiring dozens of engineers from Texas Instruments after the
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:33.720]   company, after TI began cutting jobs from its Israeli development center.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:34.920]   Oh, so they were already in Israel.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:38.360]   Intel's looking to lay off 1700 employees.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:41.000]   Apple's going, I think is it Texas Instruments or Intel?
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:41.960]   I'm sorry, Tech TI.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:48.920]   Well, I mean, anytime any of these development companies and good engineers are good software
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.480]   engineers are very, very hard to find these days.
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:55.320]   There's not a low, there's not a high unemployment rate in these areas.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:07:02.040]   And I think anytime someone's downsizing, everybody is competing for those engineers.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:03.960]   Good engineers are worth it.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:09.720]   Apple started selling unlocked iPhones, GSM only.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.280]   That's not good.
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:10.600]   Are you?
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.560]   They did this with the iPhone 4 and 4s.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:20.760]   They're not cheap, 16 gigabytes, 650 bucks, 32 gigabytes, 750 bucks, 64,
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:24.360]   Apple really overcharges for this NAND memory, because if that's the difference,
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.600]   that's 100 bucks for 16 gigs.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.640]   Is that right for NAND?
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:32.040]   There's a graph, so they make less money on the lowest storage queue,
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.600]   and they make the most money on the highest storage queue.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.080]   Of course.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.560]   And most people buy one of the others, and then that averages out their costs.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.000]   I get it.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.760]   It's a profit deal.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.160]   850 bucks.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.680]   And of course, you're going to buy the 64 gig, because you're Alex Lindsey.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:47.800]   Yes.
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:48.840]   850 dollars.
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:52.520]   I'm already, but the thing is, is that it's now unlocked, and I can make decisions about
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:53.160]   where I'm going to go.
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.040]   Can I say something?
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:08:00.760]   If you have a Verizon iPhone, the SIM card is also unlocked.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:05.960]   And you get Verizon's LTE in the US, which you won't get on that iPhone 5.
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:09.240]   So you can only use AT&T, basically, if you're doing it.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.760]   And the Verizon one will work on the price.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:13.080]   You could probably use T-Mobile as well, because they change their frequencies.
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.280]   You use Pop the SIM out?
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:14.760]   I did.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:15.640]   You don't even have to pop the...
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.200]   Well, okay.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.880]   So here's what you do with Verizon.
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.120]   Yes.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:21.640]   You can use it as a CDMA phone in the US with LTE.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:25.640]   You can use it as a GSM phone overseas, with its existing SIM.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.480]   So obviously, make sure they put a SIM in it.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.520]   And yes, you could pop the SIM.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.000]   It's unlocked.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.800]   So I'm not sure why Apple's selling these unlocked ones.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.880]   I think the best deal right now is AT&T.
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:34.920]   I mean, Verizon.
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:37.480]   I don't know what it's like.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:38.840]   What's the story in Canada?
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.040]   The same day...
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:43.320]   We've had unlocked units available online since launch day.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:46.520]   They used to do it in store too, but then you had tons of scalpers every morning.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:51.160]   There'd be 10 or 20 people, the same 10 or 20 people outside the Apple store every day
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.400]   buying them and shipping them to other countries.
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:58.200]   So they only did online orders this year, but the same day they did the unlocked phone in the US,
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:02.680]   you can now walk into a store and walk out with an unlocked phone in Canada.
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.400]   We only have GSM carriers.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:09.720]   Our CDMA carriers Bell and Tell us switched to HSA a couple of years ago.
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:10.120]   Oh, interesting.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.080]   I didn't know that.
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.920]   So it's one phone to rule them all here.
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.680]   Now, here's the question.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:20.040]   And the chatroom's saying there are even more frequencies available on the Verizon iPhone.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:22.360]   So you should check and see what frequencies.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:25.240]   Because that's always the part of the issue is you might have a GSM phone,
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.680]   but it has to have the frequencies of...
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:27.960]   So you're going to Rwanda.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.240]   Yes.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.760]   So you got to check and see what...
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:31.480]   Well, they're working on...
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:33.560]   Well, and right now, I mean, I'm going to London tomorrow,
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.400]   so I just want to be able to use it locally.
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:36.440]   London, you know, that's where...
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:43.000]   Sarah Lane got a three SIM card, put that in the iPhone 5.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.480]   It was unlimited data for...
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:46.440]   I think it was 30 pounds.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:47.480]   It was an incredible deal.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:47.960]   Three is...
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:53.880]   That's what I have a three portable modem that I use the other way in London.
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:54.280]   Sure.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:56.280]   And it works great.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.200]   Good deal, but I have portable modems for many countries.
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.200]   Now, these are the budget people...
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.960]   Say, go ahead.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:05.560]   We had a bunch of people with a Verizon phone come to Montreal for the singleton conference,
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.880]   and they were just putting SIMs in and they had absolutely no problem.
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.520]   Yeah, fine.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:08.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:09.640]   That's the iPhone 5.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:10.840]   Yep.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:11.960]   So I would look...
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.080]   Before you don't rush out and get that $850 you've arrived in London.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.120]   I've not been rushing.
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.320]   I've been thinking about it slowly.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:17.800]   Take your time.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.960]   Then I talk about it on the show and then I'm corrected and then I...
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:20.840]   Well, I'm not correcting you.
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.680]   I'm just proposing.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:23.560]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:29.640]   And by the way, notice there was a one week lag for the unlock if you order online at the Apple Store.
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:37.240]   But apparently Apple would like you to know there are lots of iPhone 5s in stock ready now
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:39.800]   for you to go in and buy, buy, buy.
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.880]   They've overcome the supply issues.
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:46.200]   I don't know if that means they've overcome supply issues or if demand is now matching supply.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:51.400]   More likely that there was a ramped up demand at the beginning that supply couldn't keep up with.
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:56.440]   But apparently most of the Apple stores surveyed by our friend Gene Munster.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:58.680]   Let's think of it as Herman Munster.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:01.000]   I don't know why.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.120]   Gene Munster is an analyst for Piper Jeffery and he's the guy who goes into the stores.
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:08.360]   He's the most active Apple analyst and sometimes he's just wildly crazy.
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.560]   He's an Apple television guy.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.920]   And what did he say about Apple Television?
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.040]   Oh, he's the guy who said it should?
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.320]   We're waiting.
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.080]   Waiting for the last three years.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:17.640]   Waiting.
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.440]   Anyway, for some reason I always imagine him with giant boots
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:26.840]   and kind of a flathead and bolts on his neck going into the stores saying show me service.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:27.480]   I don't know why.
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:29.400]   Must be the last name.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.920]   I have to meet your I have to meet Mr. Gene Herman Munster.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:33.960]   I bet his real name is Herman.
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.920]   And I bet you he doesn't look like that at all.
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:37.400]   ATC.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:41.160]   I imagine him playing the Michael Palin role in the cheese shops there.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.360]   How about Munster?
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.000]   Nice.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.120]   Oh, I'll have some of that then.
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:46.760]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.200]   That's my name, sir.
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.320]   Herman Munster.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.120]   Charles Munster.
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:53.000]   ATT Sprint and Verizon.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.880]   According to Mr. Munster, apparently showing 90% plus availability consistently.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:03.480]   So if you've been waiting till the iPhone, you'd walk into a store and get an iPhone, you can.
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.880]   Even soon in China.
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:11.480]   Well, by the way, with the unlocked one, I mean, one of the advantages of doing that
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:16.040]   is if you are a foreign visitor to the United States and it's not in your market and you buy it,
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.600]   then you don't have to get any kind of subscription and you take it home.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.480]   That's who wants it.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.680]   Like, if I wanted to pay for my flight to Rwanda or Zimbabwe,
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:27.800]   right, and I bought 10 of these and put them in my backpack, I can sell them for 50% more than I
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.880]   bought them for if they're just as unlocked phones.
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.080]   Not that we'd recommend that.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.520]   I would absolutely recommend that.
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:36.840]   That is the way.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:40.280]   If you want to take a trip to Africa, you want to enjoy safari, go to an Apple's
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:45.640]   door and buy 20 iPhones and you will be able to pay for the nicest safari ever.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:49.000]   Are we looking at the newest of the growing list of subsidiaries?
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:50.520]   Of Pixel Core?
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.160]   Of Pixel Core?
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:51.640]   That's across my mind.
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.720]   Well, and the thing is, is that in some countries...
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:54.680]   Is that legal?
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.120]   In some countries it isn't, sometimes it isn't.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:59.720]   So like if you're going to Rwanda or Tanzania, they don't have electronic...
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:00.680]   I don't think Tanzania does.
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:01.560]   I know Rwanda doesn't.
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:02.360]   It does not have a...
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:07.160]   There is no customs on imports for electronics.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:08.360]   No tariff.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:09.000]   No tariff.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.400]   And so they don't care if you're bringing electronics into the country.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:16.120]   Different countries have different sensitivities about that.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:22.360]   So the countries that are trying to grow their IT, for instance, will say there's no
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.320]   tariff on electronics.
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:24.440]   They might have it on other things.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:27.240]   Like for instance in Rwanda, you can't bring a plastic bag in.
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:29.160]   So don't put your iPhones in a plastic bag.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.080]   But if you bring them by themselves, you're fine.
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:39.160]   In other areas, you might need to hide them in the clothes or just walk quickly through
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:39.960]   nothing to declare.
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:43.160]   And that would be illegal.
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.120]   That would be illegal.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:47.240]   And they'll frown, quote unquote, "gans and people."
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:50.360]   I just don't want to advocate people by something that they could get in trouble for.
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.480]   You could get in trouble for that.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:56.200]   But in the countries that don't care, they still like Rwanda is a good example.
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.320]   There is no Apple dealer.
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.800]   There is no one selling iPhones there.
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:00.760]   They want people to it.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.360]   And it is a status symbol because it's not available by any bookables.
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:07.240]   And there are people with enough money to spend over a thousand bucks on an iPhone?
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.040]   There are more...
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:11.880]   I mean in any African country, I just have to remember that if you're in the capital,
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:14.200]   there are the expats.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.320]   Son of the president.
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:22.200]   Well, and there are plenty of people with a lot of money floating around.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.120]   And there's a lot of people that don't have that as well.
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:29.720]   But there's definitely people who are willing to pay a premium for that kind of thing.
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.640]   So just to speak about it.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:34.760]   Just one small caveat with the unlocked iPhones, if you take them to another country
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:38.280]   and that country doesn't have a network with an LTE deal with Apple,
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:42.600]   then LTE won't work even though the phone is capable because Apple recertifies
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:46.360]   all the LTE networks and then they flip the bit to enable LTE on the phone.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.080]   So if you bring it to your carrier, they have the best LTE in the world,
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.600]   but they don't have a deal with Apple.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.040]   It's going to be an H-28.
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.640]   But it'll be 3G, right?
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:54.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.080]   And most of the countries...
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:55.720]   And most of the countries...
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:56.200]   Which is faster.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.400]   Most of the countries that I'm talking about.
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.880]   Now, I'm going to be 45 new countries this month anyway,
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.000]   so it'll be better soon.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.880]   And most of the countries I'm talking about do not have an LTE network.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:08.120]   So Apple has received its network access license from China.
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:13.000]   So expect a Chinese version of the iPhone 5.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.720]   Usually, vendors in China often sell news handsets within weeks of approval.
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:22.680]   So maybe by early December, according to the Wall Street Journal,
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.640]   for an iPhone 5.
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:28.120]   So it's a status symbol.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:28.600]   It makes sense.
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:29.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:29.560]   Yeah.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:32.200]   iPhones are being status-ingable in Africa.
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:32.760]   I mean, that's...
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.280]   South Korea December 7th.
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:38.280]   50 additional markets through the month of December.
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:42.920]   Big, big explosion of iPhone 5s all over the world.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.440]   Good at getting the phones out.
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:44.920]   Yep.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.680]   It's currently in 47 countries.
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.360]   They're going to add another 50.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.440]   They're only 210 countries.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.640]   They're halfway there.
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:52.600]   Go me and go.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.400]   Go man, go!
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.800]   And multiple networks in some countries.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:56.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:59.640]   Albania, Antigua, and Barbuda, Armenia.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.680]   This sounds like the Olympics.
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:06.120]   Bahamas, Bahrain, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Ecuador,
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.760]   Grenada, Indonesia, Israel.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:09.960]   I think we're in Israel.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:15.240]   Jamaica, Jordan, Kuwait, Macedonia, Malaysia, Moldova, Montenegro.
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:17.480]   I'm going to be in Montenegro in September.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.400]   Oh, that's a good one.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:24.280]   Then into the Caribbean on December 21st in time for Christmas,
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.280]   Barbados, Botswana, Cameroon.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:26.760]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.360]   We should see if Rwanda is on this list.
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:30.680]   Senegal, the Central African Republic,
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.320]   Egypt, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Madagascar,
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:33.720]   Oh my god.
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:37.560]   Malley, Maricius, Morocco, Niger, Senegal,
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.680]   St. Kitts, Santa Lucia, Santa Vincent,
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:42.040]   the Grenadines, Tunisia.
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.400]   I like saying these names.
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:47.000]   No, it's just you're tapping into something very, very old
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   and primal in my childhood as a winglitter
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.960]   because I'm thinking, come on, come on, say Walpole.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.880]   Oh, no school, I'll say Walpole.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:57.560]   It's a snow day in my mind.
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:58.680]   I'm preparing this sled.
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.320]   School has been, I did that too.
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.120]   I did that too.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.360]   You listen, you listen on the local radio station,
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:05.800]   they'll tell you who's got a snow day.
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:08.840]   And if they say Walpole, you don't have to go.
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:11.160]   Walpole?
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.400]   You were in Pennsylvania, did they do that?
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.520]   Yeah, they, I know.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.040]   Sure, in Montreal, it's just automatic.
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.280]   It's like, no, our schools don't close.
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:18.760]   Really?
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:19.960]   There's no such thing as a snow day.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:22.440]   No, we all have winter tires and they clean the
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:23.720]   giant snow moving machines.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.240]   You got to get your butt to school.
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:27.400]   We had two bus drivers when I went to school.
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:30.600]   And it was a private, it was a little church school.
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:36.120]   And one was from London and one was from Minneapolis.
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.680]   And we always rooted when it snowed.
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:40.440]   If the one from London was supposed to drive,
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:42.440]   if it flurried, we would have the day off.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.800]   And if the one that was supposed to,
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.520]   from Minneapolis is eight inches,
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.880]   and we'd still get to school on time.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:52.680]   But you know who still doesn't have the iPhone T mobile?
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:55.560]   However, it may get worse.
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:56.680]   They don't really want it.
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.040]   That's what they said.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.440]   It's more trouble than it's worse.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.280]   You know, the business, the business end of this,
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.800]   they want to be able to do it on their own terms.
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:06.440]   And of course, it might be a center of churn for them as,
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.960]   quote unquote, "Jurling"
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:11.240]   analyst says that they'll get it next week.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:15.880]   But Gig Ome is saying, man, their network is just,
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:19.400]   they're not anywhere near compatible with the iPhones 3G.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:24.840]   So at this point, you'd be getting, you know, 2G phone.
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:29.240]   Yeah, Apple's not adding AWS spectrum to the iPhone radio
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:31.320]   anytime soon and T-Mobile is building out.
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.960]   I mean, last year, they famously built out a 3G bubble
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.160]   over WWDC.
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:37.080]   And now it's in a couple of cities, but...
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.040]   15 cities.
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.600]   That's not enough to make, well, you know, I don't know, we'll see.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:45.000]   They're working hard.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.080]   They are already invited people with unlocked iPhones to get SIM cards.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:53.240]   People have reported receiving T-Mobile's HSPA plus
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:55.160]   in New York, Chicago.
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:00.280]   Some of the big metros be interesting to see.
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:03.480]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:04.920]   We've got Renee Richie from IMO.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.680]   Oh, I forgot to ask you about rumors.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:08.200]   Remind me when we come back.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.240]   I want to talk about rumors.
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.120]   I don't care what they are.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.520]   They can be that Steve Jobs is back.
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:13.480]   He's running Apple.
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.000]   He's in a secret.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:15.800]   He never left.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.440]   He's in a secret room.
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.040]   Tell me what you bought, Leo, and I'll start over.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:18.680]   I'll run around now.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.080]   Would you?
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:22.600]   Because that'll make me feel better.
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:26.440]   Alex Lindsey from Pixelcore, Andy and Naco from Waffle.
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.640]   Say it.
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.760]   How do they say it in Waffle?
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.040]   They have a there's a way of saying it.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.240]   Waffle.
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:33.880]   Okay.
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:37.400]   By the lemon stir, Worcester,
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.760]   Waffle.
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:39.880]   Rivean.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:40.520]   I like Rivean.
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.880]   That's how we out you.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.080]   I like Rivean.
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.480]   You know, in Australia, there's a town called Cairns,
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.240]   C-A-I-R-N-S.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:50.520]   There's McKay Island, MCK, A-Y Island.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.920]   But I was told several times, no, no, no, it's pronounced Cairns.
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:54.600]   And McKay.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:57.800]   And then I realized, oh, no, this is an Australian accent.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:02.120]   You just say, but you say it with an Australian.
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:03.960]   So you revere is revere.
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.400]   Does that mean it's Pecan Island?
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.280]   Pecan Island.
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:07.880]   Cairns.
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:10.200]   We're going to Cairns.
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.200]   Next week on Mac Pray, we'll teach you what you're doing.
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.000]   You got to a rotary.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:19.320]   Well, I'm told you, if you want to take the VFW Parkway,
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:20.440]   it's just not hell.
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:20.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.440]   You got to know what you don't be wanting them.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.440]   Bunnies are just like, stop short.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:25.480]   I got places to go.
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:27.000]   It's a little bit of a chance to be a Cairns.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.520]   Is that why they call them Bunnies?
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.120]   Bunnies?
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.440]   And Somerville.
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:35.240]   Yeah, Bunnies.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:37.080]   People who clearly are from not here,
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.280]   but not in a mean-spirited way,
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.640]   because you don't know.
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:43.560]   When the lady at Dunkin' Donuts points to you,
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.640]   you say, give me a scratch, take it in the Herald,
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:46.840]   and give me a large coffee.
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:49.640]   Then you step aside, and I make my order.
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:52.600]   You don't like to look at the toad-blad.
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.680]   If you don't know what the program is,
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:56.200]   stand outside.
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:01.400]   Barney, the etymology is like,
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.080]   if you just came here from a barn.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.120]   Yeah, you're a Barney.
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:06.360]   Well, you brought up in a band?
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:09.400]   I'm not sure if it's the derogatory term against Barney Frank,
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:09.880]   if that is the true name.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:10.680]   No, no, I don't think.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:11.240]   I think you're right.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.920]   I think it's where you brought up in a band.
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.600]   It's like a carny, except a Barney.
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:15.080]   Barney.
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:18.040]   Our show today brought to you by Smile Software,
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.240]   G. MacDonald was on our cruise.
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.120]   We had so much fun.
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:21.080]   She actually, she was smart.
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:24.440]   She spent an extra month in Australia before and after the cruise.
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:27.640]   She went back to Portland where she's located the other day.
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:31.720]   She said, she posted a picture of 30% gray on her Facebook page.
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:34.360]   This is what Portland feels like after being in Australia for a while.
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:38.440]   30% gray.
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.320]   She's so great.
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:40.280]   She's awesome.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.200]   And I just love Smile's products.
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:44.520]   Go to smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:45.880]   You can see all the great products,

[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:51.240]   They're fantastic PDF program for the iPhone.
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:54.760]   Now, this is a program that not only lets you open PDFs.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:57.000]   There are plenty of programs that do this, but also edit them.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.760]   You can sign contracts, make changes, fill out applications,
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.480]   automatically detects the form and lets you fill out the form,
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:04.840]   and more.
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:07.480]   And it supports both iCloud and Dropbox.
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:10.920]   So you can move those PDFs around seamlessly from Mac, iPad and iPhone.
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:14.520]   You have a library where you can append your signatures,
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.640]   your text, your images, fix typos on the PDFs.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:19.560]   I don't know many programs that let you do that.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:22.040]   Resize and delete images on the PDF.
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.680]   You can mark up documents, notes, comments, highlighting.
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:26.360]   They've got arrows, shapes, all the stuff.
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.760]   And it's really easy to use.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:31.000]   And it's so cool that it works on the iPhone.

[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:29.640]   Okay.

[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.400]   Special, special.
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.200]   I think I have a special.
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:34.600]   I have a special.
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:35.800]   I'll hold them, but hopefully.
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:37.160]   I have PDF pen on everything.
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:39.160]   Because it's really convenient.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:42.680]   It's really much easier than anything else.
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:44.520]   You get a form.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.720]   I get them all the time for the kid.
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.640]   The kid gets the forms.
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:49.000]   And I'm going to fill out the forms.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.200]   And it's so much easier to say.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:51.480]   Okay, there's a field.
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:52.120]   So much.
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.720]   I used to drag stuff around.
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:59.400]   Mr. Eddie Q, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:03.320]   Clearly on the rise, good article on the Wall Street Journal,
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:07.080]   they call him Apple's Rising Mr. Fix It.
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:12.200]   So that reorg did a few things, but Johnny I've in charge of human interface design across the
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:12.920]   board.
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:15.880]   But it then took Eddie Q, who wasn't in charge of iTunes, right?
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:16.440]   Yeah.
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.560]   Internet services.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.920]   And of Internet services.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:22.120]   He was basically in charge of anything that wasn't working in Apple and needs to work now.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.920]   And he is now, man, across the board.
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.680]   Sorry.
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:27.080]   Maps.
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:27.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:30.120]   He's really, really impressed.
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:32.760]   So if you need to clean up a body, this is the guy.
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.120]   Apple.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:35.800]   But come up, you'll pull up in his Ferrari.
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:36.440]   Yeah.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.200]   What was that?
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:39.960]   That's in the pulp fiction, right?
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:40.760]   What do they call him?
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:41.560]   Mr. Wolf.
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:42.680]   Mr. Wolf.
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:43.400]   Yes.
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:43.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.280]   I was on my way to I was I was called away from a private from a private from a formal function.
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:51.320]   That's why I'm wearing this.
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.280]   This is a stuxedo.
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.080]   Mr. Wolf.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.080]   Eddie Q is Apple's Mr. Wolf.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:56.760]   And not too much pressure on him.
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:01.720]   I was like, oh, by the way, every product that's failed and disappointed people are now under Eddie Q's.
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:03.960]   And everybody knows it's going to be perfect now.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:06.280]   And four months because Eddie Q was working on it.
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:07.240]   Like, dudes.
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:08.600]   He's firing.
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:09.000]   All right.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000]   I got ideas, but dudes.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.240]   Now, I did not realize, but he's been with Apple for 23 years.
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.520]   He's been there a long time.
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:22.440]   And obviously, that means he was a Steve Jobs man from from the beginning.
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:29.240]   Because he was software and services, he was kind of less, you know, more peripheral to the
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:36.040]   hardware business. But now he's got a job to do is the prime architect of Apple's software strategy.
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:39.320]   And according to the Wall Street Journal, one of the most important product voices
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:44.280]   at the company, he's senior vice president of internet software and services.
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.800]   iCloud.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.520]   I'm saying just Rupert Murdoch to launch the daily a couple years ago.
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:52.280]   That's right, which is just was just canceled yesterday.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.480]   They should have hired him longer.
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:54.680]   That's right.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:58.360]   That was Apple saying, yeah, we believe we're we think this this daily newspaper,
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.200]   the Rupert Murdoch is doing for the iPad.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.880]   iPad only is so significant.
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.360]   We're going to send Mr. Eddie Q, ladies and gentlemen, Mr.
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:06.040]   Wolf will be joining you on stage to clean up.
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:08.280]   It was supposed to be Steve Jobs, but then he was ill and they sent.
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.080]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:09.880]   Wow.
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:15.560]   As it turns out that daily wasn't such a great idea.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:16.600]   I think it happened this last week.
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.520]   I canceled yesterday.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:21.000]   I think that I mean, we knew it was kind of coming.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.920]   They laid off people and so forth.
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:25.880]   The problem was primarily that it was so expensive.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:29.320]   There was no way they would have to have half a million subscribers to be profitable.
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:33.320]   I mean, but the problem with not getting to half a million subscribers was really a pain in the neck to download it.
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:34.200]   I mean, I had it.
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:39.240]   You know, and the problem was I just it would take forever to download and then and it still wasn't downloading everything.
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:43.640]   So you'd end up in this, you know, and the biggest problem was is that as soon as Flipboard was released,
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:44.840]   it was over like,
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:49.720]   Flipboard literally, I think Flipboard killed like I really thought that predated the daily.
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:53.480]   I know, but that's why it was weird to release the daily in a world where the Flipboard exists.
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.720]   Did it really? I mean, I didn't know about it until the end.
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:56.760]   Oh, I knew about it.
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:58.440]   Right. But I didn't know Flipboard that well.
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:04.440]   And I don't think it was as but you know, Flipboard is probably the app that I use more than any other app on them on my phone on my iPad.
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:07.080]   Groobers said it was really poor execution that killed the daily.
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:07.640]   It wasn't.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:08.120]   Yeah.
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:09.560]   They didn't know what they they didn't know.
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:12.040]   I don't know. I mean, I thought the content you were it was a little too.
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:17.320]   It was it was, you know, a mile wide and an inch deep and and it was it took a long time to download.
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.200]   That was the issue.
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:19.480]   The cost structure was insane.
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:21.080]   99 cents a week.
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:26.760]   I just look back and I mean, they were they were spending millions, it was half a million dollar burn rate for every.
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:27.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:28.920]   Some some crazy number and there.
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:33.800]   The stuff that's successful in digital usually has more people in front and less people behind.
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:33.960]   Right.
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:37.640]   They seem to be more traditional with this huge back end that just would never ever.
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:41.000]   Well, I think that they could roll over everybody else by by really applying all of that.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:47.320]   But it still came out and it's hard to run into anything that daily, but but I yeah, I think that it was a.
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.880]   Yeah, 100. I think it was like 150 people or something that worked there.
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.960]   So it was just an incredible number.
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:56.440]   I just think that sometimes you see these products where they surgically tried to avoid
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:59.400]   every possible advantage of the medium they've chosen to use.
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:04.440]   And this is I wish I wish I was saying that as a joke, but that's almost exactly true where they said,
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:07.080]   let's let's not do a weekly news magazine.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.160]   We'll we'll do it on a daily basis.
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:13.560]   Oh, so we're asked if you did it as a weekly to have the benefit of being selective about
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:17.480]   not just leaping on every new story, but only choosing the ones that report up to read.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.240]   And also having long analysis. Now you're simply competing with news that
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.800]   outlets that got it into these people's hands by flipboard 12 hours before you're able to publish.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.320]   And let's not do it in a lean way that could be easily transmitted over 3G.
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:34.280]   Like you said, let's do it in a really, really fat content rich magazine format that takes an
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:41.560]   eternity and a half to download. I mean, every failure is poor execution. I mean, but this is where
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:46.680]   it's like, it's like, again, it's one of those those choose your own adventure books where
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:51.720]   at the bottom of every page was, do you want your project to be successful or unsuccessful?
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:56.280]   Unsuccessful? Okay. Now to turn to page 18. If you want this project to be successful or
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:02.840]   unsuccessful, okay. Now turn page to page 34. And then, okay, wow, are you dead? You're dead, dead,
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:07.080]   dead, dead, dead. And people who came up with this idea and implemented this idea and worked
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:11.160]   with this idea are not even going to mention this on their resumes, resumes, because it's
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:16.840]   such an embarrassment. And they made a lot of good content. I first, saving throw, there is no,
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:20.360]   there is no Marvel comics that you're from now telling you that you're actually,
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:23.400]   you're actually hiding in a pocket dimension when you thought people thought that you were
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:27.480]   exploded. Well, what was great? I mean, they made a lot of good content. There was a friend of mine
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:30.520]   was actually producer there doing working on the behind the scenes for movies. And some of
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:33.800]   that's content which you could find on YouTube was great. I mean, it was just like, it was great
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:37.960]   content, but it was only one little section. And the rest of it wasn't, you know, and they broke
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:43.160]   stories like the Xbox TV console and Office for iPad. But if you look at like the New
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:48.200]   York Times, they make the New York Times app and it's much more, they understand digital much
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:52.840]   better than I think the daily day, the daily was still a traditional publication, just distributed
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:58.200]   to the iPad instead of actually being, it was, it was digital, immigrant and not a digital native.
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:01.000]   And you really, you really want that digital native experience.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.840]   And I don't know how you compete with footboard at this point. I mean, the problem is for me is
[01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:09.800]   that I don't want to go to like my magazine. My magazine is the fact that I'm reading all of
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:15.400]   these content pipes at the same time. And I'm able to flip, you know, flip between them and make all
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:20.600]   of that, you know, it's just such a seamless experience that I use so often that I, you know,
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:24.040]   and I don't want to go to, I don't want to download anybody's app at this point to do that.
[01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:25.880]   I think that's the problem. It's like the web for content.
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:33.080]   Or Wall Street Journal. I think the silo is, it's not the pay because people pay for the Wall Street
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:35.400]   Journal. I think it's good too. I mean, I pay for the economist.
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.800]   But I do have to say this one problem. Well, economist is like the daily one respect,
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:44.360]   which is a big download. The New Yorker too, it's like, I want to have it on my iPad, but just,
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:47.480]   it takes too long to get it. The reason I'm here for the PDF.
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:51.560]   The reason that I that I that I that I subscribe to the economist is because
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:56.040]   it's dictated to me by English women.
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:02.920]   Or you listen to British voices. English and men too. But I like to tell you.
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:07.560]   So the great thing about the economist and what everyone should be doing, I mean, they literally
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:15.000]   dictate every single article in the economist. And I, that's, I walk around airports.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.920]   So you listen to it. I just listen to the economy. How do you do that?
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:21.800]   If you get the economist, you can you can you can download the whole thing, which will take like
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:25.080]   seconds. And then it says, do you want to, if you're connected to Wi-Fi, which is annoying,
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.760]   it will say, do you want to download it? It'll take a couple minutes for it to download.
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:33.080]   It is by the way, all the audio every 95. It is not 10 seconds. Somebody in the chair,
[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:37.160]   I'm saying, Oh, crimey river. You can't wait 10 seconds. No, it's more like five minutes. And
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:40.440]   that's for the audio. Well, no, I'm talking about the New Yorker. I don't know.
[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:44.600]   The economist, all the text and everything else comes down really quickly. It's the media.
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:48.200]   That's the media. Well, it's not a lot. There's not a lot of media in it that isn't in the magazine,
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:51.160]   except for the fact that it does all the audio, which does take five or 10 minutes to download.
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:54.280]   But once you download it, if you do that in the morning on a Monday or whatever,
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:59.320]   you now are walking around, is this a new stand app or is there a separate app?
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:02.440]   I think it's now in the newsstand. I downloaded it as an app. I have it as an app.
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:07.080]   I think it's a look at it. It's expensive, but I've been thinking I would like to get
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:11.720]   something like that. It is. It goes newsstand and you get the background downloads, Alex. He'll
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:15.240]   just wake up one morning. It'll all be there. It happens automatically. That's another thing
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:21.800]   that daily did wrong, right? Yeah. Yeah. I guess every decision, it was like the
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:26.040]   managing under was George Costanza. Every decision they made was the wrong one.
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:31.400]   Who the opposite? The opposite. But it is a good idea, a basic idea. I think that more,
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:36.760]   it is going to be like a rise in magazines, more than newspapers, anything else. People who can
[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:41.720]   deliver really great content, not even necessarily on a daily basis, because you are going to be
[01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:45.640]   competing with everything. Everything's being posted everywhere. But there's going to be room
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:48.520]   for the economists. It's going to be room for the New Yorker. It's going to be room for even a
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:53.400]   timer or a news week. As long as they find a way to sell their product, where it doesn't cost a
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:57.880]   fortune every week to download this thing. We have to remember that they have to remember that
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:03.160]   in their model is that they're not spending a fortune on paper or delivery.
[01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:07.080]   Or delivery or all those other things. That's something that they forgot.
[01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:11.400]   Oscapes them when they try to charge them. They forgot that part. Mine, your D-Gail.
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:16.600]   That's another problem with perception. I have more knowledge about this when it comes to
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:21.800]   Compo Publishing than all the other magazine publishing. But the amount of expense that goes
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:26.680]   into the production of that $3.99 comic so little of it is in the paper, the printing, and the delivery.
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:31.560]   So much of it is in the creative end of it in the editorial end and the company that
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:36.040]   can put all those elements together to put it out. Even though we think that it's just a bundle
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:40.920]   of electrons, this should be 99 cents, they can show you, "Here's how much that we are paying out
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:45.240]   to produce this thing before we even put it, print it, and put it on a truck." You realize that,
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:49.960]   "Oh, you can't really charge 99 cents for that," or at least not. You can't charge 99 cents and
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:53.640]   support all the comics that you're giving an extra three months worth of chances to before you
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:58.120]   cancel them. I don't know what. I think I saw something with a newspaper, a local newspaper like
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:02.360]   San Francisco Chronicle or whatever. I think it was half. I think half of it was going to half
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:08.440]   and half for a local magazine, which has not gotten nearly the same. I would have to find a level of
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:13.160]   design if it's half. It's a significant amount. I thought that it was half and half.
[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:18.920]   That's not insignificant. Speaking of comics, you know the app Comic Flow, right?
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:27.240]   Yes. Do you like that app? I guess my only vote is that I don't use it regularly.
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:30.440]   Then I won't mention what I was going to say, which is we had its creator,
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:35.400]   actually, a really interesting guy on triangulation last week, Paul, Pierre Olivier Latour,
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:41.160]   he wrote Quartz Composer. Actually, he wrote it as a, it's something called Pixel Shock,
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:47.720]   as a third-party app that Apple acquired and acquired him. If you've ever used Xcode, the
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:54.600]   Quartz Composer is amazing. Then he wrote Comic Flow and he still maintains that it's a comic book
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:35:01.240]   reader. It's really sweet. He's local because he has a new company called EverPix that is an
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:06.520]   album. He also worked at Cool Iris for all, but he's an album product for the iPad that's very,
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:09.880]   very interesting. Like Bay Area or North Bay? San Francisco. I'm going to take that guy out
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:14.600]   to lunch. Oh, yeah. He's amazing. Young guy, smart. Anyway, if you want to find out more,
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:18.600]   he was our interview on triangulation last week, last Wednesday, and a really fascinating guy.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:24.040]   But I like comic books. I'm a crazy Quartz Composer fan. Yeah. I mean, this guy knows
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:30.280]   how to the guts of the Mac, man. I do want to point out, when I say that I wasn't a regular user,
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:36.600]   yeah, that wasn't a comment that was a bad app. It's just that it's not, I don't think it's as good
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:42.440]   when you have a few comics on your iPad, when you're following a number of different series,
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:46.360]   or when you want to put the watchman here, I want to put the different versions of Fantastic
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:53.880]   Four here. It's not as good as the organization. Let us take, actually, a couple, okay, I got to
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:36:01.640]   do it now. Renee Richie, any rumors? There's the inverse of rumors. I mean, Apple updated so many
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:06.120]   products over the last three months. There's nothing, there can't be anything new. Yeah, there's,
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:10.440]   if you're expecting, I think for anyone in the industry, it's going to be very quiet
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:14.840]   through December and Apple doesn't go to CES. They don't even go to Mac world anymore. So it's
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:19.880]   probably going to be quiet. There's usually a March event for the big iPad, the big iPad just
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:25.160]   got updated again in October. There will be an update at some point, probably to give that the
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:30.840]   new design language that you see in the iPad Mini, but probably not for a significant amount of time.
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:37.240]   So we might see the new version of OS X previewed early in the year and then WWC will be iOS 7.
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:41.240]   Are they going to go to yearly? I guess they are at yearly. Are they at yearly?
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:45.400]   Yep. They're yearly updates for OS X and iOS now. So we just kind of know that there'll be
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:49.160]   something because it's yearly. But there'll be tick tock updates. Like they'll do the small
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:51.720]   update and then the large ones. Are we on a tick or a talk?
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:58.040]   Mountain lion was a tick, I would say. Yeah, believe it or there was a big update. So next,
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:02.520]   so links, if that's what it's called, will be a lesser update. It's almost like Intel where they
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:06.200]   say you get the new architecture, then you get the die shrink with Apple, you get the new,
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:09.160]   like the new goodies, and then you get those stuff made good. Then you get the fixes.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:15.080]   When will the line fixed a lot of line? When will they do a 5s? Will it be the fall?
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:17.880]   Yeah, probably. Everything's going to be fall now, right?
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:21.880]   If they don't go to a multiple phone option, you never know with Apple. You always say Apple
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:25.880]   would never do this just the day before they actually do it. Then you're looking at it because
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:29.080]   that's just how their model works. They make so many phones, it takes them a while to pay down
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:34.120]   all that development. Right. So we don't have to worry about a 5s. I think we've had enough new
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:39.800]   iPads to last. I hope. I think Apple has a 5s rumor just to say that Apple would fix some of
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:44.280]   the manufacturing things that caused lower yield rates and maybe some of the scuffing issues.
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:47.720]   I would push that out early. But if they do that, it'd probably be something more like the
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:53.240]   Verizon iPhone 4 where it's a very stealthy update. So is now Cheetos pointing out that
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:38:01.480]   if you'd talk TikTok, Leopard was big, Snow Leopard small. Lion would be big, Mountain Lion small. So
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:06.680]   would links be a big, and then they do Snow Links? I think since they went to the yearly updates,
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:09.960]   though it's not going to be as pronounced, it'll just be the new stuff and then the new stuff.
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:15.240]   A bunch of talks. No big ticks anymore. And we have a show title.
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:24.440]   Until Alex gets his one unified grand. Well, I think my big theory is that I think OS 10 11 is
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:28.760]   the unified interface. I think that's what moves as we as we as we as we as we as we as we as we
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:33.480]   don't think that there's going to be I think 11 is when they're both the same. They may operate
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:37.400]   differently in different platforms, but they will be the same operating system at that point.
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:41.400]   That's my guess. And I think Apple's going to release a big Apple TV on the Monday of CES
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:44.360]   without actually going. And then no one will talk about CES. That would be January
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:52.120]   seventh, something like that. That'd be soon. That's my rumor. One month for an Apple TV.
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:55.960]   That's a good rumor. How about a Max Pro? What any rumors are floating around there? No.
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:39:02.840]   No. End of the year. End of 2013? According to Tim Cook, that email he sent out, we're working
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:07.240]   on something for the end of 2013. I don't know. All I got to say for that is that
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:12.520]   the new 27 inch iMac whenever it's whenever it's released is coming out at the end of the year
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:19.880]   and has two thunderbolts and is 32 gigs of RAM is the max. Even I don't know if I need
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:25.960]   a this new iMac. You can get it now. They are you can order they there's already been some
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:30.680]   tear downs. They've changed a little bit the way the 21-inch iMac is laid out.
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:37.640]   This is from a believe it or not, not from I fix it from a Japanese enthusiast,
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:43.000]   Kodo Wasari, Warysan. I wonder if they got enough ads to take something apart that they'll
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:49.480]   never get to use again. 21 inch iMac appears to acquire only suction cups and a spudger.
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:56.840]   That's all you need, folks. All you need is suction cups and a spudger and you're good to go.
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:04.120]   Also good show title. We're just we're rife with good show titles. The 21 is kind of weird though.
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:13.240]   They have one for a few days now and looks great. Also, I love to look I love to just
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:18.680]   research and get an article on how much work they put into the magic trick of making it look
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:24.520]   much thinner than it actually is because it's like it's when you when you look at it head on,
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:29.880]   it looks absolutely no different from even like the 2008 era iMac that I have in my office over there.
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:34.120]   But when you turn it to the side, it's like oh my god, it's like almost as thin as a plate of
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:39.080]   window glass and it still looks thin, still looks thin, still looks thin, still looks thin, and you
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:43.880]   finally get to this extreme angle. We can start to see the the bulge at the back of the screen
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:47.720]   where okay, so I can see that it's actually just really really thick in the middle. But
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:52.600]   the curve that defines the back of that thing to make sure that you can be walking all around the
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:57.640]   office and get really to almost behind it before you realize how thick it actually is.
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:02.840]   That must have taken a lot of research and a lot of effort. I think it's mirrors myself.
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:11.000]   The glossy surface of this way, but you've all been reading about like all the things that are
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.040]   not present on this thing and you know, not just the DVD drive but not upgradable RAM
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:22.040]   with the explanation there being that well we sort of maxed it out to eight so that which is for
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:26.360]   the 21 right because the seven the seven the 27 can you can there is a there's a compartment
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:32.120]   that's only that's only true in the 21 they also only one thing they deleted only from the 21
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:36.840]   inches that you can you can no longer just like do that trip you sort of get jab a credit card in
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:42.360]   the base of the pedestal and detach the base entirely then mount it like on an ice to display
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:46.280]   arm or something like that. So this is going to be locked to that stand. Oh that's too bad.
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:51.640]   Yeah, because we've done that with my old iMac we have a it's a visa. So I have an arm.
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:57.800]   Is it does it never does the 27 pop out? Yes it does. I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't have a 27
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:01.800]   but I've been told that this is only something that they've removed from the 21. So 21 is really
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:06.680]   more of a consumer device. It's like the Mac book air by Max. Yeah. And the and the and the and the
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:11.320]   big one is the one you want if you want to do things like put more memory in or put it on an arm.
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:15.000]   I still like the 27 is now the new Mac Pro. I mean I don't know I don't I don't see how I mean when
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:21.720]   you look at the specs on it. I think I should order a 27 just to find out. Don't you think
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:25.160]   you're Leo for the good of the 20 universe. John's been wanting me to do that. Maybe I should
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:31.720]   replace that thick that thick iMac in my office so thick with a nice makes you want to puke just
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:36.200]   want to puke but I have to be but we have an Ergotron arm so it has to have a visa
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:40.920]   mount in the back. I have to be able to pop that out. You can you can do that you can do that on
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:45.000]   the 27 can't roll the 24. I just make sure. And by the way I fix it does have it's teardown.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:50.200]   I apologize they now have their teardown up as well of the 21 and a half. They really
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:53.560]   tore it down. They didn't just open it up. They tore it down. They broke it apart. They
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:58.840]   nothing left. There's your spudger which looks strangely like a guitar pick with the iFixit logo
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:05.160]   on it and such special suction cups. I fix it does this all for free but then they sell the tools
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:10.520]   so you can do it too. Then I we did the suction cup Colleen Kelly and we had to replace a hard drive
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:17.720]   in my 27 inch my old 27 Chi Mac and she on on camera in the old Twit cottage used a giant suction cup
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:22.680]   and it works. There's nothing holding that glass in there. He's that's kind of scary.
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:29.560]   Well won't fall out but it's once you take the back off. Yeah just remember that the the the
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:37.160]   the legacy that goes back far far far even the first first Mac you needed to have a not only a T15
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:42.200]   torque screwdriver but a special oddball like really really super long one to get at the screws
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:46.280]   that were buried deep deep deep deep inside the handle to prevent you from getting at them.
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:52.280]   Then you needed a special tool to pry the this is before the days they're having spudgers at that
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:57.480]   point we'd had to use a piece of plastic with a bit of a bunch of leverage. I love it. One of the
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:02.360]   things they're in car Los Angeles cost just you nickel but yeah I mean this is this is exactly
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:06.600]   the first Mac they've made where it's like oh man apple why do you not want me to see what what
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:13.800]   color wire you put on the transformer. They do I like it I fix it offers a wallpaper 1920 by
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:19.240]   1080 wallpaper of the internals if you want to use that for your Mac. I'm definitely putting
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:24.040]   that on the iMac. Here's what's inside. They said completely laid out completely differently
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:28.920]   from the last years iMac. Yeah that makes sense I mean if you look at what they what they got to
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:35.160]   fit it in there it's not easy. Yeah I mean that's that's that's why you give them sort of a buy on
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:40.280]   moving the SD card slot where it is. Sure. Because if you if you've already if you've already
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:44.360]   established as an engineer that this is how thin the edge can be and we're not allowed to put a
[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:49.160]   bump out anywhere to accommodate that connector it's like all the like just not like this a big big
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:55.880]   TV tray full of electronics everything is designed to fit inside that that bump out and so okay it
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:45:00.440]   really is no other place to put that slot than right where the rest the rest the the inputs are.
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:07.080]   You particularly I'm pretty interested in step 16 which I fix it calls stop speaker time.
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:12.680]   He says the speakers may look simple but removing them is nerve-wracking for seemingly no reason
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:17.640]   other than to push our buttons apple has added a bar to the bottom of the speaker assembly that
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:21.880]   makes them harder than necessary to remove. Richel's going I'm gonna I'm gonna give it to iFix
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:28.280]   at this time I'm putting a bar here show you there's a barb. So I don't know if you remember but in
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:32.520]   one version of iOS firmware apple decided to play a little joke on all the bloggers and put like
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:38.280]   iPhone 10 comma 3 and just a whole bunch of crazy product names for them. Yeah that's what you do.
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:43.160]   You got I wonder how how long like in the manufacturing process is oh wait a minute we
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:49.800]   it right now this part has like screw you I fix it actually molded into it. Hey kyleeans this is
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:55.000]   for you are too easy to fix we got to change that that's pretty funny I love I fix it.
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:46:00.120]   Let's see I'm just quickly run through any other stories we want to get in here
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:08.440]   before we go to Lio. Say again. Email 2.0 for iOS just came out. Email 2.0 for i. Gmail. Gmail 2.0 oh I've
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:17.240]   been waiting for that. Is it iPad and iPhone? Yes sir. And what's new? It is totally redone you can
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:22.440]   have multiple accounts it's got a whole new interface. Google's really stepped out there
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:26.280]   interface game. I don't know if the sparrow guys are involved in this but you know Google's
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:33.800]   right they bought the butzpero. And instant as instant RSVP it has easy search it is a far better app
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:42.680]   than it was 10 minutes ago. Oh that's so 10 minutes ago. Amazon also released a new version
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:47.800]   the Kindle app for all iOS devices the main the main thing they added is now it has x-ray support
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:52.600]   which is their feature where if you're reading like Lord of the Rings and you forgot is it my is
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:47:01.000]   this person an elf a gnome a race is this right where it's like it's essentially having like a
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.160]   condensed Wikipedia for like here's how here's where all the characters are and here's where you're
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:09.880]   going to see this person go from that place to that place which is a cool feature on a lot of I
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:15.080]   use it a lot on these epic books where it's like I wish I had the sort of brain where I could
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:20.520]   remember who the game used to be before game of thrones you definitely think there's an iPad app
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:25.720]   we talked about the other yeah thrones just understand who you and it's cool because you they have a
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:30.200]   slider so there's no it's a no spoiler slider so as you read the chapters you just slide the slide
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:34.120]   of the right so I learn more because you don't want to learn too much about a character too soon right
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:43.480]   all right I think we're I think we're good we're good to go Griffin launching lightning connector
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:53.160]   cables next week that's good news all right let us take a break when we come back we'll have more

[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:52.280]   you if you say Leo Leo sent me. I want to mention our Twit Mugs they're selling like hotcakes but
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:59.080]   that's because there's only five days four hours left as we record teespring.com/twitmugs
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:04.760]   they look awesome. Well just between you and me this is going to be the we created these as the
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:11.400]   gifts we were going to give our hosts. We do this every year and so don't apply one. I was about
[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:19.080]   to go off there. I'm going to go get one of those. But we thought hey maybe people would like
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:22.840]   these there you get two mugs for 20 bucks you have your choice there's two kinds there's a 16
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:27.640]   ounce pretty standard mug it's got the gorgeous color mugs with the twit logo the orange gear
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:33.160]   the twit logo inside and a matching orange liner but they also have a spoon mug Lisa said I love
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:38.040]   the spoon mug so we did the spoon mug too this is a nine ounce mug that has a spoon holder in
[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:46.840]   the handle and a matching spoon. You can get one of each or two of one your choice for 20 dollars
[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:51.240]   and we're going to talk about it on inside Twit tomorrow because I don't I think we're raising
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:57.480]   money for something but they haven't told me. We've actually sold 727 already every I know I'm stunned
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:52:01.480]   because because that's a lot of the smart people are buying two of the ones that have the spoon
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:06.680]   because you can just imagine 50 years from now on antiques road shows the host saying you know this
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:12.600]   this was supposed to come with a spoon if you still had the spoon with 20 thousand dollars as is still
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:17.160]   very collectible 900 it don't lose you spoon and it's just not the same if you print it if you
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:23.720]   printed on a 3d printer. No these were actually created without a 3d printer which is I know for
[01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:27.400]   many men of the younger viewers do not understand what that would look like that means it doesn't
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:33.000]   dissolve in hot tea for one thing. It doesn't kill you if I feel me when it gets above 30 degrees.
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:41.640]   Tea. Teespring is T double E spring dot com and T spring dot com slash twit mugs all one word
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:47.080]   you get two mugs for 20 bucks. I think that's a that's a nice choice. I don't know about international
[01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:52.360]   lereate. They did that last time did they not? I can't remember what the deal is somebody will
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:59.240]   know somebody will know and don't be thrown if if it says thanks for buying a t-shirt on the checkout
[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:03.240]   currently they forgot to because mostly they sell t-shirts so they forgot to change the yet
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:10.280]   yeah neglected to change the text. I'm gonna like this on Facebook. Here we go.
[01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:18.840]   Bye bye bye. Time for our picks and tips and we haven't done an iOS or a lion tip in a while.
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:21.960]   I don't know if you guys are prepped to do such a thing. What first of all not prepped?
[01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:26.680]   You have a zag case on your I do. Do you like that better? We've tried both the
[01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:31.720]   Logitech Ultra Thin. I have lots of those covered so for a while all my iPads have the Logitech.
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:37.080]   Yeah. Problem is they'd slide off. It's not a great case. It's it's a good keyboard. It is. It is and
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:43.480]   and so I saw actually someone on a plane with this and I asked you to watch. This is the zag and
[01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:48.360]   it is it's great. I mean I really like it. I like the fact that it's a better case.
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:53.960]   It latches. It does create a little bit more bulk to it but it really just makes it like a
[01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:58.600]   laptop at that point. You know it's it is it's pulled up so we can see it. So if I um
[01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:03.800]   so really it's a full case at this point. You got cover all the way around and that's the only
[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:09.160]   problem with the Ultra Thin PC from Logitech. It slips off and people ask like so why would you
[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:14.840]   use this other than just getting a 11 inch iMac right? I mean or like a little inch air or whatever
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:19.720]   right because about the same really the same mass it's actually heavier than an air. Oh that's
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:24.040]   funny. Yeah with it with this whole thing is actually heavier than an air and probably a little bit
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:29.720]   larger. But I like the touchscreen. Right. You know this is like my air with the touch screen.
[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:33.480]   It would be a great little thing. Yeah but I like I like the touchscreen. I like being able to go
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:38.520]   back and forth and I like being able to it's not very hard. So I pull this out and it's very sturdy.
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:43.560]   So when you pull it out here and I and I lock it in it's a very you know very sturdy setup
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:48.760]   and when I want to just use my iPad I simply just you know this is what I like is that it's
[01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:53.640]   sturdy but I just pull it right out and it's out. You know it's not this long drawn-out process and so
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:58.680]   I really like the Zag. It's not my pick for the week but it's but it is it is APIC. This one is the
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:05.720]   is the Porte Zag Folio is that what it's called? You can see the plus. They have some new ones now.
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:11.000]   Yeah this is uh there's the Zag he's Pro Plus but that looks more like an ultra thin. That looks like
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:16.120]   I look like a Mac with a touchscreen. Yeah yeah. But that looks more like it. See I like the fact
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:20.520]   that this wraps around it. This is the Zag Folio. I like the Zag Folio is what I hit. Hundred bucks.
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:26.440]   And I and I like it. Yeah. But that's not your pick of the week. No. What's his job? So Andy was
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:30.040]   having trouble and we were trying to figure out what was going on with his connection in turn
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:34.440]   out to be nothing new to his Mac or whatever but but I was thinking about you know what we
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:39.320]   what we need to get Andy if if this isn't working if it happened to be his USB you know connection.
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:44.760]   Yeah what we do. And I thought I'd show we have we we have a lot of need for USB connections.
[01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:50.120]   This is not um I've been pretty nice. I've been doing like lots of cheap stuff. Okay this is not cheap.
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:54.840]   Um looks well first of all I can tell it's not cheap because it's built like made out of steel.
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:59.080]   Yeah so okay now that I know that it's not cheap I should tell you that actually ran upstairs
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:03.560]   got a replacement computer because this one that I normally have here it was definitely the USB.
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:10.280]   So that's interesting. Okay so now this is a USB interface and um this is cheaper than a new computer.
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:14.680]   No actually it may not be. How much is it? Oh this is about 600. Okay so cheaper than a new computer.
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:20.520]   So it's you should definitely send me one of those. So yeah this is so for those of you who really
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:23.960]   need to do audio there's just a lot of people that don't you know that that are still messing
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:28.680]   around with the little little toys and um uh if you really need to get audio in and out of your
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:34.200]   computer this is the Swiss Army knife. This is a sound devices USB pre-2 um and the thing is so
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:40.120]   here's here's the deal is you've got mic inputs here um you've also got line inputs and these are
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:44.920]   all what we call balanced which you know is the way our entire pipeline works is balanced uh it just
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:49.160]   means that it's it's gonna have a lot less noise and not less buzz and all kinds of other stuff.
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:53.240]   Doesn't always mean them but it generally does but you also have you can you know hook up little
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:58.120]   your little RCA connections too. Um importantly if you're doing outputs you're trying to figure out
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:03.720]   how to hook into a professional um system. You have unbalanced you have balanced I'm sorry balanced
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:09.320]   outputs um that come out of here just XLR connections as well as TOSLink and SPIDIF um out of here
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:14.280]   which is kind of uh insane. Um and then you have a lot of control over all of these things in the
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:20.760]   front. So um uh so you have you know individual control over there's the inputs um your preview
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:26.840]   and then there's a lot of extra stuff that they even stuffed into it via um uh dip switches and
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:31.720]   stuff so there's a lot of ways to customize it. It is uh I don't show up at events that need
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:37.000]   audio without without a couple of these in tow because it is a um it is like the Swiss Army knife
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:43.720]   of um of getting audio in and out of your computer. So this isn't for everyone. Um you know uh this
[01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:47.800]   isn't uh you know everybody's solution. It also has limiters by the way so for those of you
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:53.000]   know need limiters what that means is you'll never peek so never have that ugly when someone's
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.080]   so there's limiters built in there 20 to 1 limiters you're not gonna peek it. You know so it might
[01:57:57.080 --> 01:58:00.920]   sound a little warm if you're hitting it too hard but it's not gonna you're never gonna peek this
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:06.760]   uh this input which is why we started getting them and now we have um I hate input peaking.
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:12.760]   Yes and it doesn't happen on this guy and that's why we got it originally um and uh it is you know
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:17.240]   like all the other sound devices stuff it's it's like you know a great little piece of hardware so
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:21.480]   anyway we're thinking of I was thinking about USB because of Andy's little issue and um and I
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:26.120]   thought that my and I realized I had not recommended it and we have um I don't know how many of these
[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:32.280]   right now 20 of them or something so and they're not even a full Alex it's only a 0.67 Alex's
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:37.400]   oh I think it's like a 0.9 0.9 Alex that's exactly what it is 0.9 Alex's yeah and it's but it's um
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:41.800]   it's just beautiful though yeah it's it's great and they're really I mean we these things get
[01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:47.400]   carried all over the world for us so they're you know they get banged up slammed um and it's just
[01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:52.200]   made metal knobs yeah and look look at this look look push the little one little ones push push
[01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:57.160]   in them they pop out ooh look at that and then you can that's your output and then you have the
[01:58:57.160 --> 01:59:03.240]   fader that goes back and forth between monitoring the pc in them you know it's just really really
[01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:10.120]   really well thought out even these two those those those are your your selectors um yeah it's
[01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:19.560]   um yeah yeah see well we will not be saying these to hosts I think you I think you need to send
[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:24.200]   one of those just for safekeeping because you get mud forgot for being like you're like gonna get
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:30.920]   lost you know that Andy has one of mine that I convinced he'll send to me yes off-site back
[01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:36.760]   of Alex can't recommend highly enough off-site backup for any device that you like the cost more
[01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:41.720]   than 500 we need one of these for the iMac i availability okay yeah why don't you get one for me
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:47.560]   we're using a $20 proof and iMac this is better this is better than the iMac yes it's better
[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:51.960]   well it's so great if you actually are working in this industry when you when you tell i'm not
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:54.920]   working in this industry when you're when you're working in like an event industry and you talk
[01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:58.520]   to the guys and they go so how are you gonna get us the audio and when you can say i can give you
[01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:05.480]   a balanced output from either mine or mic from an XLR or TRS they immediately they're they're uh
[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:08.840]   they know they're down they're realising you're dealing with the professional actually know that
[02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:12.600]   that's important you know you know and uh in so anyway i have an iMac
[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:21.000]   yeah so these are these are great um and so i would uh i love eight hundred forty nine dollars
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:25.000]   list so it's more than an Alex but it's not what it costs though i think it costs uh that's the list
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:29.080]   yeah i think the b&h cost is like six seventy or something make it so john get me one
[02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:35.800]   you have to talk to Lisa okay we're gonna sell a few mugs maybe that's what the mugs are for
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:41.240]   billy knows mug money's going that goes the mug money boom out the door hey yeah
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:49.720]   Alex Lindsay thank you so much for spending my money my pleasure you spend a lot of mine too
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:52.440]   because i'm waiting for you to do your recommendation so i can purchase whatever that
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:55.480]   was you're gonna you're gonna know what my recommendation is in just a moment but first
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:01:03.160]   Renee Richie from imore.com there's this new uh for a while now there's been a way to do aftermarket
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:07.800]   color changes on iPhones because apple only does white and black iPhones and some people have
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:11.800]   swapped parts they've gotten aftermarket parts some people have painted them and there's a new
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:16.760]   thing that's just started i think yesterday or today called ano style and what they do is they
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:22.680]   strip off the anodized color that apple puts on and then they re-anidize it with your choice of a
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:28.360]   whole rainbow of colors and where apple i think does two layers of anodization they do for they
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:32.840]   do military grade um i don't know if right word is anodization but that's what they do military
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:38.920]   grade four layers they can install protectors on it they do iPhones that is gorgeous looks
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:43.560]   yeah it looks fantastic i mean you can get the iron man red and gold version that's a whole
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:51.160]   purple and green version um how much and they just look fantastic i believe it's 250 or something
[02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:54.520]   like that so it's it's not an Alex you know if they're selling a lot of these though really
[02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:58.360]   might say something that apple about the fact that people want something that says black and white
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:03.160]   and these are really these aren't flat colors are really you know knock you down and make you
[02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:07.480]   notice them sort of colors and they do every area that's usually the aluminum part of the
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:11.960]   island it's the status symbol for the status symbol well i mean a lot of people several people
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:15.320]   i i've seen on twitter already have them and they they get a lot of questions about them so they're
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:21.480]   definitely i think trendy the most trendy they look awesome beautiful people won't take years by
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:23.480]   accident i'll tell you that well they they'll take it on purpose
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:33.400]   that's very nice um your pick of the week mr. anti-nico
[02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:39.960]   uh my pick of the week is uh bb edit which is a text editor that all of us use in love
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:46.520]   as just can come up with another big big update to 10.5 just released today a free update for everybody
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:50.120]   good uh i just bought 10.
[02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:54.760]   Well send me the 49 bucks that you were gonna spend on with the other new update and we'll
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:03:03.400]   work something out um and it's in a way like bare bones is the most like non apple non mac company
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:07.720]   ever because you know we just got through talking about how apple removed features from
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:14.120]   iTunes by making the latest update update after update after update they don't uh the bb edit
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:21.560]   does not have uh features deleted from it with 10.5 the worst that has happened in any situation is
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:26.120]   that they've taken a feature that has been like sort of buried under menus and found a better
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:30.920]   context in which to present it or taken something to just trim down the interface but that feature
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:34.280]   is still there somewhere it's just been taken away from where it's gonna distract you from what you
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:40.840]   want to do uh and i've only uh it's i haven't spent as much time working with it as uh as i as i might
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:46.440]   have but i've already found uh it's it's added so many little bells and which is what bells and
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:51.480]   whistles features uh cleaner interface much nicer to look at it's been updated to support retina
[02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:56.600]   max now so you'll get that cool like nicely done text uh but uh two features that i immediately
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:04:02.520]   found were um i'm often i often use bb edit to edit like css files and html files and because
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:07.640]   i'm a dope when it comes to editing like html i'm always just like zipping top bottom in middle to
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:12.360]   get to one place to another to another to another now it will sort of it's always had a feature where
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:16.920]   you can sort of bookmark certain parts of a document now i sort of realize that oh he keeps coming back
[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:21.320]   to the header tag to make edits there so i'm gonna sort of put a soft bookmark right there
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:25.880]   automatically so after like a few minutes with a document there's this automatically populated
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:32.600]   pop-up so i can instantly teleport to where i want to go or i'm designing a new layout for the blog
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:37.800]   and i keep changing my design for like the header uh but that's already been like embedded in the code
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:44.280]   and so now it's uh every time i embed something like as an image with an image tag there's now a
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:49.640]   contextual menu that says uh normally normally when i as soon as i use the image tag it will like
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:54.200]   automatically look at that file and make sure that i've got the dimensions automatically embedded
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:59.480]   there for me now if i do a contextual selection on it and click it will say it will give me the
[02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:04.600]   opportunity to rescan that file and adjust and resize it because i've just made it larger instead
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:10.440]   of smaller just all these tiny tiny little details that make the simple idea of typing askey text in
[02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:15.000]   the form of code that a computer will then tell me is no damn good for any good purpose so much
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:20.760]   nicer so much more streamlined and so much more pleasant bb edit 10.5 free upgrade good because i
[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:25.560]   just yeah i'm 50 bucks if you're dafting you haven't bought it yet and retina ready i was like i use
[02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:29.720]   it for everything almost everything i write starts in bb edit really even near your columns and stuff
[02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:35.400]   yeah cool offline safety i just got this and i haven't had a whole lot of time to spend with it but
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:38.840]   already i can tell you i'm going to recommend it this is rick smolen you may remember him from a
[02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:45.560]   day in the life he's got a new book called the human face of big data it's also there's also an
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:50.440]   ipad app that goes along with it which i haven't tried but i'm sure will be beautiful so rick is a
[02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:56.120]   photographer and his day in the life series was you know here's a day in the life of a town a city
[02:05:56.120 --> 02:06:01.000]   and so forth they even did one where you could put your picture on the cover of it and so forth
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:05.960]   but this is just gorgeous big coffee table book i'm sure it's expensive
[02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:13.000]   $50 worth it be a great gift for somebody and what i love is that it's about big data so it's
[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:17.800]   about a lot of the topics that we think of and talk about all the time for instance here's a thing
[02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:25.560]   about ways which is uh the uh the here's a google self-driving car here's uh space
[02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:31.160]   here's what we put in a recycling but anyway just goes on and on and on the idea is that someday
[02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:39.160]   soon someday soon everything in the world every bit every item every object even ourselves will have
[02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:46.520]   will be spewing data the intelligent sensor mesh and this talks about what big data uh can mean
[02:06:47.240 --> 02:06:53.880]   and in what it's meaning today how it is already being used i told you you get me back just a gorgeous
[02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:59.720]   book just a gorgeous book $50 for a beautiful book like this is not bad i'm definitely getting it
[02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:06.600]   uh they're talking here about the dna sampling you know um the library of alexanderate look at
[02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:14.360]   these people rooster kale this is all the stuff we talk about all the time and i have already sent a
[02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:20.200]   note to uh our producer for triangulation that we got to get Rick smaller on he's just down the
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:26.440]   road a piece i've known Rick for years the human face of big data just came out yesterday
[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:31.400]   yeah i was i was sitting next to a um a geneticist that's working on you know um designer drugs and
[02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:35.800]   really that you know that this that i was just thinking about it when the uh um they're talking
[02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:39.000]   about really getting to a point where they they prescribe you the correct drug because they know
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:42.680]   that you know all those side effects that they talk about right do you have a dna chip that you
[02:07:42.680 --> 02:07:46.920]   just you just show them this is what it'll do and they go oh well people with that dna you know that
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:51.720]   dna combination you know they're the one that has the you know suicidal tendencies when they
[02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:56.040]   take this drug you know that kind of thing and it's um it's a good to know a fascinating subject yeah

[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:33.800]   because you don't celebrate new years in uh kind of kind of i know it's a month earlier than you
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:41.640]   got it because of the earlier harpisk if you have if you have suggestions twit.tv/best of
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:47.880]   you now it says required you need to know the program name the episode number the timecode
[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:53.880]   and why your name no it none of that we just sent off an email that says none of that's required
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:58.600]   it's just by the time you download it may be gone whatever it's a google spreadsheet and i think
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:02.920]   we could probably fix that but anyway whatever you do know give us it would make it a lot easier if
[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:07.240]   you put that stuff well if you knew the timecode but who knows the freaking timecode but put in like
[02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:12.600]   an hour into the episode or near the end yeah i mean that'll help near the end you actually just
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:17.800]   yeah rough rough location rough location is so just thinking of a slob chad uh johnson who has to
