[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.300]   Andy Innotko. How are you, Andy?
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.600]   Very good. But don't disappoint me.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.400]   I hope we get to talk about lawsuits as well.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.700]   And like it will talk about some patents.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.000]   Patents. Patents.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.500]   Go!
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.200]   I might have to change my underwear now. I'm sorry.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.300]   Also the man who put Pixel in Pixel Core, Alex, Lindsey.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.000]   How are you, Alex?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.200]   I'm doing well. How about yourself?
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.100]   Is this live or is this green screen?
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.100]   I cannot tell anymore.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.900]   Well, I'm actually coming in as we discussed earlier.
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.800]   I'm actually coming in from Rwanda and I'm actually being pasted over.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.500]   I'm actually Leo in Japan, but Alex is in Rwanda
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.300]   and it's all being tied together and then broadcast it back to you.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.300]   I don't know what's real.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.800]   So complicated pipeline, but we've thought this would be a good time to test it first.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.700]   I don't know what's real. And also joining us,
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.800]   one of my favorite people in this universe or any of the multiverses.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.200]   Quite frankly, Lori Gill. How are you, Lori?
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.100]   I'm doing really good. Thanks for having me.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.200]   And I am actually transmitting from the 75th multiverse.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   So, you know.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.500]   So it's not 616.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.800]   This is the one where the evil people control the Marvel universe.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.300]   Is that right?
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.900]   So you better watch out when you're talking to me because, you know,
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.300]   I might have something to say.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.300]   You might have to bleep me.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.200]   Is there is there a sensor button going on right now?
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.100]   I don't think we have a five second bleeps.
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.100]   We just got to be in our best behavior.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.700]   I want to start off with a subject.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.900]   It wasn't actually on the list.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.000]   So I apologize, but Andy did mention it earlier.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.500]   So I hope we have lots of strong opinions about it.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.500]   But there was a video that went viral on YouTube.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.200]   It was by Linus Tech Tips, Linus Sebastian.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   And he bought an iMac Pro to make some videos with.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.400]   And one of the videos he made first was a complete tear down of the iMac Pro.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.600]   And then when he went to put it back together,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   he broke a few things or his team broke a few things on it.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.000]   So he posted a video saying Apple refuses to repair my iMac Pro.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.200]   I did a response video to it because I thought it was fascinating.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.400]   Like, of course, it's terrible if you ever break any of your Apple gear.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.900]   But the way the video was laid out, at first, there was what looked to be,
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.800]   but was not identified as a recreation with like a fake spark
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.100]   and the monitor breaking and him saying that they took it to Apple and Apple wouldn't fix it.
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.200]   But as the story went on, the condition of this poor machine,
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.500]   like at first it was the monitor and then it was the monitor and the power supply.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.300]   And at the very end of the video, he said it was a monitor and the power supply
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.300]   and the logic board.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.600]   And he also said that not only would Apple not fix it,
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.200]   but Apple had neglected to provide parts to third party vendors
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.100]   so that they can fix it.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.400]   So Mac rumors and Apple insider independently did some follow up
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.100]   and they determined that Apple, in fact, third parties that had the ability
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.700]   and the training to repair this since at least January,
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.500]   maybe in some cases only March, but in some cases as far back as January.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.500]   But by then it was an entire internet thing as only the internet make things.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.900]   And it got me thinking about this whole right to repair on one side
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.300]   that companies should let you repair your products with anybody.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.500]   But at some point, is there a stage when you can no longer take your product?
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.300]   Like if you opened it up and poured molten lava inside,
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.900]   are they then, is it unacceptable to say I don't even know what this is anymore?
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.500]   Andy, do you have any strong feelings on this?
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.000]   A couple. I did see the whole video.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.800]   I probably had the same immediate reaction that you did.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.300]   To be fair, it wasn't like he was trying to take it back
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.800]   and have Apple store fix it for free.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.600]   The part where I got really interested was when he was conveying
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.600]   what he said that Apple was conveying to the people he was taking it to.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.900]   That at some point, it's like, no, we can't fix it because there's too much wackiness going on here.
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.800]   But if you can go, but an authorized third party Apple service person can do that.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.100]   And then he claimed that Apple would not sell that third party service place
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.600]   the screen that they needed to in order to fix this thing.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.800]   And then apparently, again, according to his line of his claims,
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.400]   they said that someone who was talking to him said that
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.800]   we don't have the training yet or we don't have the equipment yet in the pipeline
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.800]   of maybe this was someone who was just trying to sort of, you know, please take your...
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.800]   Take your will and blend.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   I think your will it blend.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   I'm back elsewhere because we really have we have cracked iPhone screens to fix.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.800]   Okay, we've got a long line of teenagers who have dropped things and other things that need things to be fixed.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   But it was an interesting at least conversation to have about at some Apple certainly has the right to say
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.800]   you've definitely violated your warranty.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.800]   We don't have to fix this for free.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   I think they also have there's a level in which they can say this is so far gone that we just and you were so irresponsible with it.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.800]   I mean, this is so totally on you that we're not even responsible for tying up one of our text time for 11 hours on this
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   because we've got lots of people we need to serve.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   I would be disappointed if it were not possible to go to a third party and that third party who's authorized and trained by Apple
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.800]   could not order the parts that they need.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.800]   Even if they have to wait several months because they're saying,
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.800]   hey, look, we've got this is a brand new product.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.800]   We don't have enough we don't have enough screens just even to build these things let alone to to service things under warranty.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   Your order is good. We will fill it, but we're going to take three or four months.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:17.800]   So long as there is some sort of root so that you don't miss the whether or not your $4,000 I'm at gets fixed or not is not someone
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.800]   else's decision, but your decision.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.800]   I think that's I think it's important to have the ability to fix things.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   I think that I think the only thing I'd say about that is that, you know, there are times when we decide that the car is total.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   You know, like it's not, you know, that there's no way to really bring it back.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   That's what I buy it.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.800]   That's when you buy it.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:41.800]   Well, that was his analogy though, Alex, like he said that imagine like you buy a car, you drive it off the lot, you drive it into a lamp post, and they refuse to fix it.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   But it seemed like the more now you go analogy often refuse to drive the car off the lot.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   You take it apart, you blow a bunch of things up and you slam into a light post and then they refuse to fix it.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   Yeah, and I just think that again, there are definitely many times where you're you just make it this you make a call that I'm not going to work on that for you because it's not it's too far like it's there's more work there.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.800]   It's going to cost you more than the original computer and parts and labor and all those other things for us to do that.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:12.800]   And we make those I mean, I don't know, that's what people that's what insurance companies do about cars.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.800]   That's what there's lots of people say, I can't fix that, you know, and it's not and we have production equipment.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:24.800]   We had one one little piece got ripped off and we were we called the company and they were like, yeah, there's nothing the way it's built.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   There's no way to put that back on, you know, like and so and now it costs less because they make it forward thinking.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:40.800]   But it is I think that that is I think this was a great PR opportunity for, you know, for the website that they did, but it's kind of BS.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.800]   There's two different conversations to be had here.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:58.800]   Number one is how far do you go before you to expect that somebody's going to fix something that's wrong with your device or anything like Renee was saying your car or even if a house is in such bad.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.800]   It just repair, it'll have to be completely demolished.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:17.800]   So that's one thing that you would have a discussion about, which I think the Linus Tech Tips video kind of fits more into this category of how how far do you go before your your device is just irreparable and it has nothing to do with Apple.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   It has nothing to do with third party repair organizations.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   But the other conversation, which if you take his video out of it, it is a really important discussion to have, which is repairability of our devices and Apple is as well known for having a really low score on the repairability scale.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   So that is kind of a conversation that that is important to have is how easy is it to repair your own device or take it to a third party repair shop and have them repair that.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:10:09.800]   So I think, you know, we can talk all day about how the Linus Tech Tips video was definitely just a doom and gloom scare tactic, but at the same time, it does open this conversation to when, when can we, how much can we expect Apple to repair our devices and how much can we ask Apple to allow us to take it somewhere else
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:29.800]   and how much can we ask Apple to allow us to do it ourselves in our own home with the proper, you know, guides. There are some tech companies, gadget makers who supply their own guides for repairing your device or replacing a battery or screen or something like that.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:45.800]   So I was wondering, because we have a lot of this stuff like you, the iPad is really far from an Apple too and a Tesla is really far from a Model T and my father used to take apart and rebuild Alfa Romeo's and other cars that you just flipped them all the time when I was young.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.800]   I remember him working on them and he just looked at a schematic of a Tesla and shook his head and walked away.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:11:08.800]   And I started thinking like the future that we're getting, it really is these appliances that are so complicated. They're almost run like fighter planes are run. And then you go a step forward. And when we have self driving cars, should you even be allowed to self repair a self driving car that has to then be a part of the hive mind on a highway.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.800]   Sorry, Andy, I cut you off there.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.800]   No, no, I'm sorry. I almost cut you up before you can start speaking.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:33.800]   No, that's a really great point. There's an engineer here in Boston who has, I wish I had, I don't have his YouTube handle handy, but he bought, he essentially built a Tesla for $6,000 by buying a couple of salvage title Teslas and from the two of them building like one that was in perfect shape.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:44.800]   And so number one, you have the, you have this car that is not documented. There's no service guide for it. You can't, the only, the only Tesla will allow Tesla will only allow Tesla service people to service it.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   And so you have this community of people who are trying to figure out how to affix their own stuff, but also to do stuff that they've been able to do with cars for years, which is again, so I'm just going to buy a bunch of old, I can't afford $80,000.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:07.800]   Actually, he has pictures of his house. He might be able to afford $80,000 car to speak for, but just, hey, I love cars. I want to see if I can do this.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:14.800]   And then he even gets the, it runs great. It's perfect. And then he gets to the point where he takes it to a charging station. And there's this.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:27.800]   It's a great video because he's legit, he and his friends are legitimately filled with like hesitancy and expectation because at the point where he tries to plug this into like an official Tesla charging station instead of his home charger.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:35.800]   He knows that that car is going to send a code off to Tesla. And Tesla, for all he knows, is going to say, Hey, wait a minute, that is a salvage title Tesla.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:45.800]   It's not supposed to be on the road. I'm going to not only not only going to refuse to charge this, but I'm also going to send a code back that says turn off your computer and go into five mile an hour mode.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:50.800]   Well, it's going to be, it's going to be a big problem only because, I'm sorry, just to wind up.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:13:02.800]   It's going to be a big problem because the EU right now is working on a lot of different laws that say about right to repair saying that something has to be manufactured in such a way that a third party can repair it.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   The idea that once I own something, I do own it. So if I want to take their part and do something else with it after I own it, that's something I should be able to do.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   And a company should not do something to a device to make sure that they have a monopoly on being able to fix something.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:23.800]   Well, and just take that rabbit hole one once a further. If you really want to see a lot of this stuff, as you look at the farming industry with the track.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   You know, that there is all the software and they say in the licensing that you don't own the software for the tractor and you can't update it.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.800]   And there's all kinds of hacks and everyone's trying, you know, everyone's hacking their tractors to get them to do what they need or to fix them.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   I mean, a lot of times it's just that they just don't want to pay someone to come out and plug something in and do a thing and do a thing.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:50.800]   Or they can't afford to have this machinery like down for the amount of time it's going to take whereas they have a mechanic there who could get it running in an hour instead of two days.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.800]   Right.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.800]   Yeah. So it's definitely a looming problem that keeps on getting worse.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.800]   So there's Hacktors and Hackless now.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.800]   Is that what we're saying?
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   Well, it's also that these things are becoming so complicated and they're also dangerous. Like we've seen what happens with lithium ion batteries and a Tesla is a giant lithium ion battery.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   And if someone who's not calling, maybe it's not you, maybe you get your friend to do it.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.800]   Yeah, I can do that. No problem.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.800]   And then you're out driving and it explodes and who's liable that are they going to sue Tesla?
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.800]   Are they going to sue Apple if that IMAC Pro then explodes or hurt somebody?
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.800]   The amount of damage that we can do.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:33.800]   I remember as a child, my grandmother would tell me that you used to have a mechanic riding with you with the very early days of cars.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.800]   You have to literally have a mechanic on the car in order to operate it.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.800]   And we've come so far from that it's now like you can't even open up the sealed box.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:52.800]   But those sealed boxes are so much more complex and so much more dangerous that there's probably as much as there's control factors is also probably a huge fear of litigation around all these things.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.800]   Renee, think about the car analogy for this circumstance.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.800]   If I buy a car, I can't, I don't expect, and I don't mean a Tesla.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:11.800]   I don't expect that. I can't ever change the oil on the car or replace the battery on the car without having to take it to the dealership.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.800]   Now that does void the warranty, but I am capable of doing it.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.800]   I'm capable of taking it into a mechanic and having it done if I can't figure out how to do myself.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:28.800]   So, you know, it's dangerous to, you know, put the wrong kind of battery in your car, but you physically literally can't do it.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.800]   And there's not like a lock on the car's battery that keeps you from getting into it.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.800]   This is kind of somewhat similar circumstance.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.800]   You know, the right to repair, I think, is a really big deal.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:54.800]   And I think it's important that these device makers are responsible and make sure that if you are going to repair your own devices that they have as much available as possible to make those repairs yourself.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   But at the same time, it should be allowed.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:15.800]   I shouldn't have to use special tools and melt glue and just destroy my phone to get it open just to access the battery, which I then have to break in order to remove it and possibly, you know, short out the entire system.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:34.800]   Well, I think the only thing I'll say about that is that, you know, when you put stuff together, when you talk about stability and workability and things, you're making decisions that make the system work better and to make it possibly more stable and more efficient and smaller.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   You know, and those things, as you start to work through those, there are trade-offs and a lot of times modularity is one of those trade-offs.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:59.800]   We build a lot of systems that aren't nearly as complicated as an iPhone, but you make a decision when you build it that no one's going to be able to touch this, you know, as we build through it because it's just not, you can't, it's not that we can't take it apart, but as we use it, there's no way to go in and change anything because it's, if we did that, it would have to be bigger.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:04.800]   It would have to be more less modular or bigger and more bulky and less stable.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:13.800]   And so I think that one of the things we have to kind of keep in mind is that when they do those things, it's not doing it to keep you from fixing it. They're doing it so that because that from an engineering perspective, it's superior.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:20.800]   Now, they're not thinking about, they're not using fixing as one of the criteria that they're measuring when they decide what to do with the phone.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.800]   And that's why it goes away, but they're looking at the most efficient way to build the phone.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:31.800]   And I think that, you know, when we make things really modular, we just end up with a lot of the Android phones that we see.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.800]   So they're, they're, they're, they're, they're paying in the, what?
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:40.800]   Whenever my car has a dent, I have to replace the entire side because it's not just that one panel.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.800]   That's a good example. Like you.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.800]   It's one part.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.800]   Yeah, you kind of like, I, I bumped something on my car and they were like, yeah, we just, here's the bumper.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:57.800]   Like, there's no way to pop it out. There's no way to fix it. There's no way to other than you just pop it off and put a new one on because that, that's how they built it because that made it more efficient, that made it a little cheaper, that made it a little, you know, easier to put together.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:07.800]   Or rigid or like Apple people ding apple a lot because you have to replace whole swaths of the computer when there's a problem with the keyboard, but that's also what allows it to be rigid when it's in a very small, you know, package.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.800]   And, and, and more stable over a longer period of time.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:18.800]   It's trade offs. It's all these trade offs. And I know it like the Millennium Falcon, Han and Chewy can fix it themselves, but as humanity starts going to the stars, I don't know the complexity.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   Like these two things are trade offs and you're going to have the Amadallah ship that Alex knows too well and then Millennium Falcon and there'll be different repairability between them.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:32.800]   Yeah, absolutely. I'm guessing. I don't think you could fix the queenship, but I, you know, I think it'd be difficult.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:41.800]   You'd ruin the finish at the very least. So the second thing, Tim Cook, this apparently took place back during the education event, but it didn't surface until recently.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:48.800]   He was interviewed again and he once again repeated that Mac OS and iOS are separate things that he doesn't see.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:55.800]   He doesn't foresee, and this is a standard Apple line that they believe that Mac OS is better suited for desktop computers and laptops and iOS is better suited for desktop computers and laptops.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.800]   And iOS is better suited for mobile devices and they don't foresee a hybrid of those operating systems.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.800]   And I don't think that Apple, I think one of the things that happens with Apple is they speak very candidly in my experience.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.800]   What they say is exactly what they mean. It doesn't mean that their opinions don't change.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.800]   They also have a really big history of changing their opinions over time.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.800]   But I think when they do speak, they're candid about these kinds of things and this is legitimately what they think.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:27.800]   And that doesn't mean that iOS won't become more capable over time or that Mac OS won't become more approachable over time.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   And each of them take on characteristics of the other.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:38.800]   But I think it's sort of like that Steve Jobs thing where iOS is going to stay being the car and Mac OS is going to stay being the truck.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.800]   And maybe someday something will replace both of them.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:48.800]   But Andy, I think this still goes into the fears that iOS is just going to run rampant across the entire line one day.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   Yeah, I agree with you. I don't think that Apple is one of the most honest companies that I've ever spoken to.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   Even when reading conversations they have with other people then seeing what turns out.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:08.800]   If they feel as though the only thing they can say is deceptive or unhelpful, they simply don't say anything.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:21.800]   But the problem there is that sometimes what they are saying within Cupertino, we assume it means something else entirely.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:30.800]   So it's possible that Tim there was saying that no, no, no, the Mac is unique and incredibly valuable.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   We're building our future on both of those things. We will always have a Mac and the Mac will always be enhanced by iOS features and iOS will always be enhanced by Mac features.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:55.800]   He could also be saying that, excuse me, if behind closed doors they could also be saying that we feel as though iOS is our operating system and hardware platform for consumers.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.800]   And the Mac is our hardware platform and hardware system for professionals.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:11.800]   So this could also reflect, no, we have no need to make the Mac more user friendly because we have no intention of selling Macs to people who want simple taskers in the next five years.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.800]   We're going to be trying to sell them whatever the version of the iPad is going to be in three or four years.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.800]   So I'm still a little bit worried.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:26.800]   There's complete silence about what happens to the Mac Mini, what happens to the plane, iMac, what happens to consumer Macs.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:34.800]   It's so silent that I don't believe that there is any doom indicated, but it's not a good sign.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:44.800]   I have not seen the sort of rest they've gone to great lengths over the past year to make sure the pro users don't switch to anything else because, hey, look, we're building machines exactly for you.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   We know what you want or we're trying to learn what you want and trying to build you something that you need.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   They haven't been saying the same things about for consumers and nor have they been introducing hardware that makes me confident that they are convinced that they're committed to consumer Macs.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   I don't think you were here for that, Alex, but Matthew Panzerino went inside Apple and met their new pro workflow team and Apple because they couldn't get like the guy at Lucasfilm scoring Han Solo to bring the Han Solo score overs they could work on as you can.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:22.800]   They just started hiring these professionals, hiring professional video videographers, audio technicians, people making film scores, people making albums.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.800]   I'm guessing they're working on Apple's original content.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:34.800]   That gives them a huge amount of stuff to actually give feedback on, but they work hand in hand with the engineers to say, like, why does that palette take five seconds to pop up every time I tap it?
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:39.800]   And then they can dive deep into final cut and figure out what's delaying it and fix it.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:44.800]   But is that an advantage you have when you start bringing content in-house?
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:50.800]   I think a lot of companies, whether they're doing content in-house or not, a lot of these larger companies do things like that.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.800]   So having people, it's one of the most valuable things.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.800]   You take the people that are going to use your product and you have them pound on it.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   And you definitely want some people that are on staff doing that because mostly from a confidentiality perspective, having outside folks, the more they touch it, the more it's going to get out there somewhere.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.800]   And if they're employees, it's going to be easier for that.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.800]   I think Apple has the money.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   They don't need to make their own content to just hire these people and have them play with the stuff.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:30.800]   I think doing your own content, the advantage of that is that when you're trying to figure out how a product works, if you aren't actually using it for what you're, if you're not trying to actually produce a product, it's very hard to know whether it's working or not.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:42.800]   Because you'll, "Oh, I'll test this. I'll test this." But until you're actually trying to do what it was designed to do, and it very rarely works if you build your own test project.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:50.800]   So the problem is that clients ask you, clients or partners ask you to do things that you would never do because that would be crazy.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.800]   You're just like, "I don't want to do that." I would never think of doing that.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.800]   And so you have to work through that solution. And in that working through that solution, you find a bunch of things that aren't working.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.800]   This is weird, and this doesn't work quite right.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:10.800]   So the real world environment that is service with the product often drives that process through it.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   I think that the danger is always, or the thing you always want to do is get the widest number of people to use it.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:25.800]   If you look at what happens is you only work with one group and you might end up with a product that works really well for them and not necessarily for everyone else.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:32.800]   A good example is something like Autodesk's Maya was originally created by a company called Alias.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:38.800]   And what Alias did is just came to Industrial Light Magic and said, "We'll make whatever you want."
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.800]   We'll just do it the way you want it.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.800]   And so ILM just kind of gave them all the things that this is what we wanted to look like.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.800]   This is how we wanted to work, everything else. And so they built it that way.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:54.800]   And so if you are a big facility, Maya is perfect because it has all the things that coders can drop onto because ILM didn't want an all-in-one.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:01.800]   ILM wanted a core app that they could add onto with code and everything else.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.800]   And so if you want to customize everything and do the muscles and do everything else, Maya is perfect.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:11.800]   If you're an average person that wants to just use a 3D product, it is not perfect, not even useful.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   So when they say that they worked on Star Wars with that, they didn't mean that they worked on it with a guy in his garage.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.800]   They had army of programmers that built a bunch of custom plugins.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.800]   And it works perfectly for that.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:34.800]   But so you have to be careful of only getting one side of the product.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   So I think that they have to bring in a lot of people.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:47.800]   And I think that Apple, like everybody else that develops hardware and software, the more they can get professionals banging on it and giving them feedback, the more it's going to be useful for all of us.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.800]   And the engineers oftentimes won't. They just say, "Don't touch that button."
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.800]   Or, "I don't know why you did that."
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:59.800]   So our job as artists is to sit there and give them feedback of, "Hey, I know that it's going to be harder to do it this way, but it really needs..."
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:06.800]   And Apple is probably one of the best companies to work with in that area because they're focused on interface.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.800]   I mean, everybody's focused on interface because the future now is interface.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.800]   I mean, everything, it doesn't matter how useful your product is if people can't find the right...
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.800]   If there's too many buttons, I mean, it's really gotten down to that.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   You have to figure out how you get rid of... how you get the UX out of your way.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:29.800]   And so the... and Apple is probably the best in the world at getting the UX out of the way.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.800]   You know, in my opinion.
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:37.800]   So I think that that's a lot of what they're working on. And the culture makes it easier, I think, in a lot of ways for them to do that.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.800]   What do you want to do?
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:47.800]   In that case, does that mean... I mean, so for talking about Apple being really great at getting the UX out of the way,
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:59.800]   doesn't that sort of seem like, well, maybe there is a future that combines iOS and Mac OS so that the average user can integrate between Mac and iPhone and iPad much easier?
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:08.800]   I actually don't see Apple ever going complete combo software across all their devices,
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:16.800]   but I'm encouraged by the thought that Apple will take into consideration the Mac operating system
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:24.800]   and the iPhone iPad operating system and finding a way to make those interfaces work together seamlessly,
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   not removing features from one or adding features to another,
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:34.800]   but just making the operating systems flow more easily, which I think they're already doing.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:44.800]   Every operating system update that we get brings the two operating systems for mobile and for desktop closer and closer together.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   And maybe that's what that means.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.800]   Maybe merging Mac OS and iOS doesn't mean literally turning them into one operating system,
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   but merging their interfaces so that they are more complimentary of each other.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:04.800]   I wouldn't be surprised of seeing something that might look like a virtual environment where the iOS worked inside the Mac.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   I think it's very unlikely that the Mac will work inside the iOS devices,
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.800]   but I think that I could definitely see being able to open iOS devices on a Mac
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.800]   and run them in possibly a virtual environment that might go full-screen,
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   and I think that could also open the possibility for touch screens,
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.800]   where it works when you do the iOS stuff.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.800]   Maybe Apple doesn't want to have it work with the Mac OS stuff, or maybe they do.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:30.800]   We're now seeing that process building up, but I think that we're getting closer and closer to touch screens
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:36.800]   when we see what the last update to the iWork tools were.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.800]   But I think that, again, to agree with you, I think that there is a merge,
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.800]   but I think that it's iOS opening up on a Mac OS.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   To be honest with you, if you're trying to get rid of Mac OS for the consumer,
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.800]   that's the way you do it.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.800]   They buy something on iOS, they can use it on their Mac,
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.800]   they can't bring their Mac to their iOS.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   It's going to have people continually using more and more iOS.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:04.800]   I do agree with the other comments that I think that Apple is not going to probably get rid of Mac OS anytime soon,
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   but I do think it may be relegated to the high-end user.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.800]   What about an abstraction layer?
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.800]   Sorry, go ahead, Andy.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.800]   Just quickly, I don't think that Apple would ever do an emulation layer,
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   or something where you could run iOS apps inside Mac.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:23.800]   I do think that the rumors that we're having about how Xcode is going to be supporting having shared libraries
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   and basically one project that you can then spit out for Mac and iOS.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   I think that's a natural flow for Apple.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:37.800]   It's also worrying for, again, people who are worried about Mac consumer hardware,
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:42.800]   because it'd be one of my favorite apps for any platform ever since I was 10 years old,
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.800]   is Scrivener, the wonderful word processor.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:52.800]   And literature and latte spent so much time and effort producing an iOS version of a very, very polished,
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.800]   what was already very polished, Mac app.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   And I could definitely see, let's say, in five years' time,
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:05.800]   there being a sort of a developer workflow where you essentially build what is 80% an iOS app,
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.800]   20% a Mac OS app, because you're essentially targeting,
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.800]   you're mostly targeting iPad users and iPhone users,
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   and then you can decide how to make that iOS app work well as a consumer level Mac app,
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:24.800]   because that way benefits users because they will be able to switch from one to the other very, very quickly.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.800]   But also, I think that's where things are going.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.800]   I'll just, I'll backpedal in one way, though.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   It's actually a line from that interview that we started talking about with Tim Cook,
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:42.800]   saying that he uses Mac in the office and iOS devices, iPads when he's out of the office.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.800]   Okay, well, yeah, duh, he's going to be running Windows on his office machine.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.800]   But the thing that reminded me that I'd overlook something,
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:55.800]   that of course Apple is going to be using Macs internally,
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.800]   so if they're going to eat their own dog food, they're going to make sure it's at least high quality dog food.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.800]   So that's the reason for hope.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.800]   >> So what I was thinking about, though, is we go a little bit more into the future.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.800]   You have an abstraction layer where you have sort of an AI-based operating system.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:14.800]   I've been talking about this on vector with Brian Romley, who's a big voice first advocate,
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.800]   and then you have something that is like Siri OS,
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.800]   and not the current Siri we have today, the Tormans Justin is a butt of every internet joke,
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.800]   but a product that is like Siri, that is a contextual interface,
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.800]   it's a voice interface.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.800]   There's probably some sort of tactile interfaces that are happening because we have things like Siri Touch now,
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:38.800]   and we have many more ways to communicate with the computer than we did when the original gooies came up.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:44.800]   So you have some sort of operating system, just like OS 10, Mac OS 10, supplanted system,
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.800]   you know, the old Mac OS system interfaces.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.800]   And just like iOS came after a bunch of operating systems,
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.800]   it seems feasible that there will be something that replaces them,
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.800]   and I think it'll be that same kind of, it won't be one becoming the other,
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   it won't be that same kind of generational leap where we just get a whole new paradigm for interface,
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:06.800]   along with all the stuff that is, and AR screens and whatever it takes to power that.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:14.800]   Yeah, it's the thing that I think one of the things that defines consumer orientation versus poor orientation
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:19.800]   is that consumers are more easy to, their behavior is easier to predict,
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:24.800]   their needs are easier to sort of figure out, which means that they have,
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.800]   are such a wonderful target for improving things via AI,
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.800]   basically to watch what you're doing day after day after day,
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.800]   and suddenly you find that your dashboard contains the project that you're working on,
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   or it contains the report that you tend to turn to every Wednesday,
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:44.800]   or if it sees that there's a meeting on your calendar or a phone briefing,
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.800]   it knows that here are the documents that are related to the project you're going to be talking about.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   That's the sort of stuff where they could really, really put some high Tabasco
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:57.800]   on the consumer experience, and just quickly in passing,
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.800]   remember that there are people who have vision impairments
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:07.800]   for whom the ability to simply express a clear intent with a few number of words,
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.800]   and have that translated to what would be a series of clicks on buttons
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.800]   and a lot of voiceovers and a lot of keyboard actions,
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:20.800]   that's another reason why AI is going to be floating a lot of boats in the harbor at the same time.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.800]   So there's a ton more to talk about, but before we do,
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   I want to check in with Leo, I want to see what he's up to, I want to see what he is talking about.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:33.800]   Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter, what a lifesaver, what a lifeline Zip Recruiter is.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.800]   If you're the person in charge of hiring at your company,
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   I was when we used Zip Recruiter the first time, it's a lifesaver.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:48.800]   Zip Recruiter, the first reason we used it was because it posted our job listening
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:54.800]   to 100+ job boards and social networks, which means our listing went to the most possible people.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   But in the intervening years, since we first started using Zip Recruiter,
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.800]   they've gotten better and better now, they do something I don't think anybody else does.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   They go out and find the right people for you.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.800]   See, Zip Recruiter has access to tens of millions of current resumes.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:14.800]   They built a platform that finds the right job candidates for you.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.800]   They learn what you're looking for as Zip Recruiter identifies people
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:22.800]   with the right experience and then says, "Hey, Leo's got a job."
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.800]   Invites them to apply.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:30.800]   These invitations have absolutely changed how you find the next hire for your company.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:35.800]   It's huge. In fact, it's so successful that 80% of employers get this.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.800]   80% of employers are supposed to job a Zip Recruiter.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   Get a quality candidate through the site in less than a day.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.800]   Less than a day.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.800]   Imagine if tomorrow you've got the perfect person for that opening.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   And Zip Recruiter doesn't stop there.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   They even, you know, all the applications flow into the Zip Recruiter interface
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.800]   where it's easy to screen and rank and hire the right person fast,
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   but they also will spotlight the strongest applications.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.800]   They'll say, "Oh, you should look at this one."
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.800]   It's like you have this great assistant.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   You'll never miss a great match.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.800]   The right candidates are out there.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.800]   Zip Recruiter is how you find them.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.800]   Businesses of all sizes from ours to Ford, to Volkswagen,
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.800]   they've all trusted Zip Recruiter for their hiring needs.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.800]   Right now, you can try Zip Recruiter absolutely free, free,
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   when you go to ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.800]   Zip Recruiter is the smartest way to hire.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.800]   Ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.800]   And now I return you to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.800]   Already in progress.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.800]   No, it's not a bug.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   It's not an error.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.800]   Leo is on vacation, so I am hosting this week.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   The inmates are running the asylum, joining me Andy Ennaco
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:51.800]   from the Chicago Sun Times, Alex Lindsey from the Pixelcore,
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.800]   Lori Gill from IMOR, and we are talking about all things Apple.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   And since it is earnings season, the numbers are also almost upon us.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:04.800]   It is also silly season, and we have to deal once again with reports that say,
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:09.800]   for example, Apple is earning one third of the profit of all mobile devices,
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   and nobody is buying iPhones.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   And every time Andy, I have to try to figure out how to reconcile all these reports.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   I don't know which ones are stock manipulation, which ones are people trying to make really smart guesses,
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.800]   which ones are just being caught in between different waves of Apple orders.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.800]   But it really does happen every season.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:33.800]   We get to this quarter, which is after the holiday quarter,
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.800]   and it seems like the numbers get thrown in a blender and everyone sticks their hands in after them.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   Yeah, I've almost given up on trying to figure out what any of that means.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.800]   I really think that the stock market collectively is like a game of rock paper scissors,
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:55.800]   where it's not based on your next move is not based on any actual hard empirical data.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.800]   It can't be.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.800]   It has to be based on what you think the other players are going to do for the next move.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.800]   And so you see a lot of these articles coming up that is a lot of, well, okay,
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.800]   he opened with rock and then he lost paper.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.800]   So he's probably going to open with whatever is going to kill paper.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.800]   And that's why people who are being paid to be analysts like this,
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.800]   they have to figure out what is going to move people to either buy or sell.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:25.800]   And also to be a little bit less contemptuous of analysts,
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:29.800]   they each represent a different point of view of what's important to the bottom line,
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:34.800]   what's important to the health of the company is that they are selling an amazing amount of iPhone.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.800]   So they're incredibly healthy, what a wonderful company.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   Another one might feel as though with the data in front of them,
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.800]   they're selling a hell of a lot of iPhones, but they're not paying attention to other parts of the business
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.800]   that they're going to need in the next five years.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.800]   So I don't think that's a good piece of data.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.800]   So long as you don't try to, as long as you're not trying to get clicks on a web page
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:57.800]   or you're not trying to fund your retirement, you're 67 years old,
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:02.800]   you just start investing last year and you desperately need to make a million dollars in the next year,
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.800]   I think you can really just ignore all this stuff.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   That's a really good way to address it.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   There's always talk about Apple and the stock market, Apple earnings,
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.800]   how many phones they've sold, whether or not they're doing better or worse than their previous quarter.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   And I kind of get a little glossy item on that stuff.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   I don't care what their profits are, I care about whether or not they're making a good product
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   and whether or not I want to buy the next good product.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   And if they do put out something that I'm not interested in,
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   I don't assume that that means that the company's going to just crumble and go out of business.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.800]   I just assume, well, they didn't appeal to me this time, maybe next time.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:45.800]   So when it comes to stocks and earnings and units pushed,
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:50.800]   I have a very low interest of that information.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:54.800]   It's interesting to me because the iPhone X is the most expensive iPhone Apple's ever made.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:59.800]   And so they could sell less of them and still make as much, if not more money,
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   off the ones that they sell.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   There also, Apple is probably not going to keep the iPhone X around next year
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.800]   because it's expensive to make.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.800]   So like with the iPhone 5, they might replace it with something else.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:14.800]   An iPhone 5C, but in this case, an LED version of the iPhone X design,
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.800]   while introducing a new one, but instead of the iPhone 5S,
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:22.800]   we'll get these two sizes of iPhone 11 or like X1 or whatever the hell they want to call it.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.800]   And all of those give ripples throughout the supply chain.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   And those ripples are orders for the exact parts that make the iPhone X disappear,
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   but orders for the parts that make the iPhone 11 or the LED version of the iPhone X start to appear.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   And those may or may not be from the same companies,
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   or next generation versions of sensors may or may not be from the same suppliers
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.800]   or use the same components.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.800]   And that's why I think Tim Cook was spot on when he said, and again, in my experience,
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.800]   very candid that looking at one or two data points on a supply chain,
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.800]   it's very hard to extrapolate these big product decisions from it.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:02.800]   But I think that's what we get here is we get sort of the sum of all the linear reads
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:07.800]   on the component news that we can because everyone is sort of desperate
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   to fill the cycle until Apple releases actual numbers.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:16.800]   There is something that's really valuable though, is I don't care about all the articles
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.800]   about the buildup.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:22.800]   I really, really care about the call that Tim Cook has to make,
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:26.800]   because this isn't this has two things that you don't normally get to see.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.800]   Number one, anything that he says in this conversation,
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:35.800]   there is a legally binding component to it so that if he misleads or if he fudges
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   or if he says something that's a little bit indirect,
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   there are repercussions for it.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.800]   So if he says something in this, that language, even when he's saying something off the cuff,
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.800]   it has to be really, you have to be able to take that at face value.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.800]   And secondly, you have an opportunity for the,
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.800]   you almost never see a chance where there is just an open Q&A between Tim Cook
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.800]   and just a room full of people.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:03.800]   And so when analysts have the chance with a take questions at the end,
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:08.800]   once again, you can ask him any question and he has to answer truthfully or
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   weigh the impact of saying, I'm not going to answer that in this venue at this time.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:17.800]   So that's the sort of stuff that's interesting to journalists.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.800]   It's interesting to nerds like me and it's interesting to people who are
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.800]   considering buying hardware in the next six to eight months.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:28.800]   >> One of the things you mentioned, Laurie, was how, like you care mostly about how much you like the product
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.800]   and Ben Beherin of Tech Pinyons and Creative Strategies put out a survey,
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:38.800]   the results of a survey where Apple got 97% customer satisfaction rating.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.800]   People were satisfied with the product.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.800]   He said that was one or two points below what Apple had gotten from a different supplier,
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   but you know, you ask different questions, you get different results.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:51.800]   But the number that surprised him that he said stood out was that 85% were very satisfied
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.800]   with iPhone 10 and that's not a number.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.800]   That was a number that was impressive enough that it really stood out for him.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:03.800]   >> Being an iPhone 10 owner, that actually doesn't surprise me because that,
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   the iPhone 10 is actually, for the first time in all of the different iPhones I've ever owned,
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:12.800]   it's the first one that really affected me when I got it.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:17.800]   I've always been excited about the next iPhone and really enjoyed kind of playing with them
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:23.800]   and learning all of their new little tricks, but the iPhone 10 immediately became this
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   comfort level for me that I've never experienced before in any kind of technology.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   So I'm actually not surprised to hear that it was such, it got such a high, very satisfied rating.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:45.800]   My own personal experience was just amazing, my own feelings about using the iPhone 10
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.800]   versus the iPhone 7 Plus at the time.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.800]   So there you go, it really makes a lot of sense.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:56.800]   I think a lot of it has to do with the gestures on the interface,
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:03.800]   taking away that home button and replacing it with gestures really made a difference for me
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.800]   about how I felt comfortable using the device.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:13.800]   >> I'm always just amazed at how Apple is skilled at taking a phone that I'm perfectly happy with
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.800]   and ruining it and I have to get a new phone.
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.800]   I'm just like, how do they do that?
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.800]   I mean, I was totally fine with my 7.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.800]   I was like, "Oh, great, so great and everything else."
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.800]   And then I got a new phone.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.800]   I saw the phone and I had to have it and I bought it and then it was great.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.800]   And I look back on the other phone, which I still use as a backup.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.800]   And I was like, "Oh, this is horrible."
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.800]   >> Oh, this ugly monster.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.800]   How could they even put that in my face?
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   >> Well, I do admit, there are holes in the iPhone 10 as far as when it gets into trouble,
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.800]   like getting it to restart and doing some of the other stuff is not quite as clean.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:50.800]   There are times when it just kind of locks up and it just will not go anywhere.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:54.800]   It's only happened a couple of times, but I realized that's the one time I missed the button
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.800]   because I just felt like there was some kind of mechanical way to talk to it.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.800]   >> You have to ask Siri to change apps and then it snaps out of it.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.800]   It's one of the tricks I learned.
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:07.800]   >> Yeah, so it's been a couple of those kinds of little bugs that were --
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.800]   it took me a little while to figure out how to screen capture the same way every time
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.800]   because sometimes the buttons worked and sometimes they didn't.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.800]   It's gotten better with the updates.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.800]   So I think that they're getting better, but I do think there are a handful of times
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.800]   when I miss the button.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:27.800]   >> But what you're actually -- your one minor complaint has to do with physical buttons, right?
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:34.800]   So why not get rid of all the physical buttons and have gestures to do the same thing that the physical buttons do?
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.800]   >> You joke, but they're working on it, Laura.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:40.800]   I mean, there was a rumor that the Pixel 2 was going to have no buttons and no ports.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.800]   And we got -- the HTC has been doing the squeeze phones where you get rid of physical buttons
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:48.800]   and you just squeeze the sides and a lot of manufacturers are getting rid of ports
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.800]   and doing remote restarts and remote recovery.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:55.800]   And I don't think Apple will be the first one, but I don't think we're very far away
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.800]   from having our phones be slabs with glass on front.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:03.800]   >> And the more you get away from the physical interface, the more control you have to make adjustments
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:07.800]   and changes and behavioral changes, not just in the user, but in the --
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.800]   >> And there's no hardware failure point.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.800]   So if they would ease them, you get rid of having to pull out little cards
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:17.800]   and take the thing back in and jamming it and people putting memory cards instead of sim cards in the tray.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:18.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.800]   Still miss my head set.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.800]   >> I still think clicky buttons.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.800]   The best interfaces are a combination of the two.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:30.800]   I mean, I got -- I was in the MIT flea market last week and I had to have it.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:36.800]   It is a like a pre-Vintage keyboard with like a really wacky layout.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:43.800]   And there's just something about the tactile experience of this that glass is never, ever, ever going to compare with.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:50.800]   And I like the idea of having at least one clicky button, even if it's a fake clicky button that uses haptics.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   And here is a button that will -- this will always be here on the screen.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.800]   It will never move.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.800]   It will never be covered by anything.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:03.800]   You never have to remember anything to reveal this button that will instantly take you back to some place that you're very, very familiar with.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.800]   I think that's a really, really reassuring and important part of the user interface.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:14.800]   As is like a clicky button on the side that does something important, like wake up the machine,
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:19.800]   or even just having a user define clicky button that will take you instantly to the one feature.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:26.800]   I'm a big fan of a dedicated shutter button on the side because there are shortcuts.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:32.800]   I know they're wonderful, but it is -- there are times when it's in your pocket, you've got a dead piece of glass in your pocket.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.800]   You've got something awesome happening in front of you.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:40.800]   You want that picture to be taken as quickly as possible, even if it's a no look shot.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.800]   And so there will always be --
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.800]   Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.800]   The Huawei PR20 that will -- you double press it twice and it will take a photo regardless of what you're doing.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:48.800]   That's awesome.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.800]   It doesn't even light up the screen.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:53.800]   It's like, okay, he doesn't care if it's even aimed properly, just get the picture.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.800]   That's like, oh, I want that.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:56.800]   I love that, too.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:02.800]   I think all of this when we look at this, getting rid of the buttons and moving towards the different kind of interface and adding Siri.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:08.800]   And on both sides, whether it's Google building that or Apple building that, all of everybody is working towards what is the next thing,
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:15.800]   which is not passive, you know, beyond phone, you know, and the AR experience and those types of things,
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.800]   because they have a whole new set of those.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:23.800]   And I think that a lot of people are trying to figure that out with the phone, you know, so a lot of that stuff of the gestures and so on and so forth.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:35.800]   It gets -- UI is probably the most complicated part of VR, NAR, but definitely VR, because you're in there and how do you interact with things without having -- being able to type, you know, and those types of things.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   And I think that, you know, the phones are the mass market thing to figure out how to do that, but I think we're -- everyone -- everyone I think is thinking about what happens, you know, what happens after the phone, which is still 10 years.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:50.800]   But maybe five.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.800]   >> Yeah, let's say -- maybe you could build this.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:48:01.800]   I just want like a marble or a mother box that does local authentication based on persistent biometrics, so it knows my gate, my voice, my eyes, my fingers, whatever.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.800]   And then it connects me to the cloud.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:08.800]   And whenever I actually need an interface that either gives me an AR one or takes over whatever piece of glass happens to be nearby.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.800]   And then it's all I have to remember to carry with me is that little marble or mother box or whatever.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.800]   Don't need a phone, don't need a tablet, just that.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.800]   >> I just want -- I'm just ready for passwords.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:22.800]   I mean, it's starting to get that way with the Face ID, the word passwords are getting less and less, but it gets to the point now you're really annoyed if you have to type another password in.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.800]   I can't believe I'm doing this again.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:25.800]   >> But they ruined it.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:30.800]   Like when the iPhone X first came out, all you have to do is look at it and it would auto-fill the website and send it in.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.800]   But then people started making fake submission forms to steal your password through that mechanism.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:40.800]   So now you have to tap first before it'll scan your face to make sure it's a user indicated action and -- yeah.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:41.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.800]   >> They've run everything.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:44.800]   >> They're not even humans.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:58.800]   One thing I wanted to ask Laurie is also some people suggested that the lack of an iPhone SE refresh has changed the dynamics of Apple's financials because there is -- famously when the iPhone SE first came out, Apple didn't really understand how it was going to perform.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:06.800]   They thought people who wanted less expensive iPhones would get it, but their forecasting wasn't great on it and people who wanted just smaller iPhones.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:12.800]   And there's rumors again now that Apple's going to have an iPhone SE maybe in May, maybe at WWDC.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:16.800]   Do you think that'll skew things differently than previous years where it didn't get updated?
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:17.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:24.800]   So there is -- I am one of this camp that I want a 4-inch iPhone.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:28.800]   I've always loved that size, that form factor.
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:36.800]   The only time that I've strayed from that and felt comfortable with it was the iPhone X, but I still absolutely love that 4-inch form factor.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:42.800]   And if Apple releases a second-generation iPhone SE, I really think that that's going to be a big hit.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.800]   And there's a lot of people like me.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:53.800]   Believe it or not, there's not as many as just any old iPhone user, but there's a lot of people like me out there that are interested in a 4-inch iPhone.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   It's not about the low cost.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:56.800]   It's not about the price.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   It's about wanting that size.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:05.800]   So if Apple is going -- if they're going to do this, if they're going to upgrade an iPhone 4-inch iPhone and they're going to make it --
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:23.800]   with the 812 processor chip, let's say, if they're going to -- I think there's a new rumor that they're going to remove the 3.5 millimeter jack and use the lightning port instead for headphones,
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   which actually will free up space in the phone for other bits of technology that could help maybe --
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:31.800]   >> The bigger camera module.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:32.800]   >> Bigger camera module.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:47.800]   So these are all options that could potentially make the iPhone SE second-generation closer aligned with the iPhone 8 or, you know, whatever iPhone 9 or iPhone 11 or whatever is coming.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:53.800]   Not the top of the line, but closer aligned with the bottom of the line of the top of the line.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:51:05.800]   I want that. I want Apple to give me a 4-inch phone and I want them to make it just as good as the regular premium phones as they can, as close as they can.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   And I will pay the extra money for it.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.800]   It's not about low cost.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.800]   It's about the size.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.800]   >> You know if it had a home button like an animal?
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.800]   >> Even if it had a home button.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:16.800]   It's the size.
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:32.800]   I do really love the iPhone X and I'm very happy with it and it's the absolute next best thing to the 4-inch iPhone, but nothing beats the size of that 4-inch phone in your hand.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.800]   When you can reach all over, you don't have to hold it in a weird way.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.800]   You can slip it in your back pocket and it's not going to fall out.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.800]   You can stick it in the tiniest pocket in your bag or your backpack.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:48.800]   It feels so good to have that 4-inch form factor.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.800]   I talk about it a lot, but I really do appreciate it.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:53.800]   I am the kind of person.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:52:02.800]   I don't need a larger screen to play games or to browse the internet or to use my applications because that's what I have the iPad for.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.800]   That's what I have a computer for.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:12.800]   My iPhone, when I like, I love to use it for text messaging or doing kind of quick reconnaissance for checking my email or something like that.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.800]   I'm spending a large amount of time on it.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.800]   I have other devices for that that I love to use.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:25.800]   Though I have been using my iPhone X more often than my iPad since I got it because it does have a gorgeous screen.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:34.800]   There's a lot of people like me out there that the size, the 4-inch size of the phone is absolutely perfect.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:41.800]   Anything that doesn't feel perfect on that 4-inch phone, we already have other devices that we can use it on.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:45.800]   The iPhone is meant to be the most mobile device, not the biggest screen.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.800]   So, you know?
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:49.800]   There was a...
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.800]   I don't think...
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   Unless Andy, I forget which one said that we could be on the crux of having an iPhone from $330 or $350 all the way up to $1100 when we have the full, you know, 3 new phones plus maybe a new SE plus the rest of the lineup at the end of this year.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:09.800]   Yeah, I bet that they're kind of really pruned down the product line at the end of the year.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:18.800]   I was amazed that they didn't delete more products from the line last year because I had to keep double check and wait, there still is the iPhone 7 and there's still this iPhone.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.800]   Wow, okay.
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.800]   Okay, way to go.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.800]   I wonder if they really are...
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:29.800]   They really do feel the need to experiment with price ranges right now that they are...
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:33.800]   As we said a few times, Apple is running out of people to sell iPhones too.
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:43.800]   And so the only way to continue to grow is to continue to find people who aren't buying iPhones, figure out why that is and figure out how to sell them an iPhone.
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:51.800]   And a lot of it is we tend to be very United States focused because that's where we live and that's where we...
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.800]   Those are the people that we see.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:58.800]   But they're parts of the world in which $800 is an insane amount of money to spend on a phone.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:12.800]   And there are also parts of the world in which a government will look very, very favorably to a company that will want to have their phones manufactured locally instead of having them shipped in from elsewhere.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.800]   So these are things that Apple is certainly looking at.
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:22.800]   I think that even in the US, the 4-inch phone is a really, really big part of the solution because...
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:30.800]   phones are... Modern smartphone design is inherently sexist because I'm a dude.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:36.800]   They give dude pants have big pockets in them so I can pretty much carry whatever I want.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:41.800]   My favorite pants, I can actually have an iPad mini in the back pocket, but non-dude pants have small...
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:44.800]   It's the 511 tactical pants.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.800]   511 tactical pants.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:50.800]   Yes, these are the... My shoplifting pants anyway.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:55.800]   And there are people who just don't want to have a huge phone.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:57.800]   There are people who have smaller hands.
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:09.800]   Apple has the... It's important for Apple even though they don't have the ability to have a million different types of phones on the market to make sure that everybody who wants an iPhone has one that will at least work for them.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:12.800]   So they really do need to have a small phone in the product line somewhere.
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.800]   And I like small and somewhat thick.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:20.800]   I lost my 5C, but I had it for a while and what I really liked about it was that it was durable.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.800]   I just throw it in my back pocket. I didn't feel like it was going to bend it.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:26.800]   Now my wife thinks it was 7 or 8 and puts it in her back pocket.
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:27.800]   It was crazy.
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:36.800]   But the little one was just this thing that you could just kind of throw in and I used it for a long time for those types of things.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:40.800]   And I just... Having something small and durable, I thought really made sense for a phone.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.800]   I don't know if I would have it be my only phone, but it was great.
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:48.800]   Just say nothing of the idea of having a small screen that doesn't require a whole lot of battery to power it.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.800]   And so you can basically have a day and a half iPhone.
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:57.800]   A lot of people say, "Would you like to have a phone that you don't need to charge every day if it would be a little bit smaller?"
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:02.800]   They said, "I don't care about having a big phone. I care about not having to travel with a battery charger in my pocket."
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.800]   All right. So lots more to come.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:10.800]   We're going to find out why Apple went tattle-tailing to the Department of Justice about AT&T and Verizon.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:18.800]   But first, we're going to hear from our friend Leo, who is... While he is in Japan, he is simultaneously here telling us about awesome things.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:22.800]   Hey guys, let me just horn in here to remind everybody about rocket mortgage.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.800]   Maybe that time has come, spring is here.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:29.800]   Maybe you're a young couple's fancy, turns to thoughts of a new home.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.800]   Maybe you've got a little one on the way, you need some extra room.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:36.800]   Maybe the kids are moving out and you're going to get your dream house.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.800]   There's lots of reasons people are looking at houses.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.800]   Sometimes it just hits you.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:50.800]   It's fun just to look at the neighbors, but then you go, "Oh, hey, it's for sale. Let's buy it. This is a nice house."
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:54.800]   That's when you'll be really glad you know about rocket mortgage from Quick & Loans.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:57:02.800]   Quick and Loans, the number one lender in the country, number one in customer satisfaction, created rocket mortgage to bring the whole process into the 21st century.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:08.800]   It's entirely online, completely computerized, no more going to the bank, no more going to the attic to find paperware.
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.800]   Everything you need is right there on your phone.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:16.800]   You could literally be at an open house and say, "Oh, we should buy this."
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:19.800]   Then go to rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:25.800]   Answer a few simple questions because rocket mortgage has relationships with all the financial institutions.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:28.800]   All you have to do is get permission. They'll get the information they need.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   They crunch the numbers super fast.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:34.800]   Those big mainframe computers in Detroit, they're ready.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:42.800]   They go boom, boom, boom. Within a few minutes, based on your income and your assets and your credit, they look at all the loans for which you qualify.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:47.800]   That means they're probably looking at hundreds of different loan sources.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:58.800]   Then they say, "Okay, this is what you qualify for. You choose the term, 15 year, 30 year. You choose the rate.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.800]   You choose the down payment. You get the loan."
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:07.800]   It's that easy. Apply simply. Understand fully and then mortgage confidently at rocketmortgage.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:13.800]   To get started, go to rocketmortgage.com/macbreakequalhousinglender, licensed in all 50 states,
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:19.800]   and MLSconsumeraccess.org 30. Remember this book market. Write it down.
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:24.800]   Or maybe even just go and set up the account so you'll be ready when you see that perfect house.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:28.800]   Or, I should say, I shouldn't forget to refinance as interest rates go up.
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:34.800]   That becomes very attractive. Rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.800]   We thank them so much for their support. Macbreak Weekly.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:44.800]   Thank you, Leo. Thank you so much. Thank you for making time in between Sushi Binges and Sumo Matches for doing that for us.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:49.800]   I am here with Andy Anako, Alex Lindsey, Lori Gill.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:57.800]   We are talking about all things Apple. It turns out, we talked earlier about eliminating hard points to potential hardware failure.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.800]   One of the biggest debates going on in the industry is over E-Sims.
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:06.800]   E-Sims replaced a traditional little before they had standard sims, then mini-sims, then micro-sims.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:10.800]   Now most phones have micro-sims, but you'd have to go get it from your carrier or it would come with the phone.
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:15.800]   Pull a little tray out. You put the sim in. You push it in there, and then everything locks down.
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:21.800]   You have to beg, plead, and get federal legislation in order for you to get it out and unlock the phone that you paid for.
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:29.800]   An Apple and some other companies have been working a while on an E-Sim, an electronic sim that would let you at least buy a phone without having to get a sim card.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:34.800]   And then it would take on the attributes of the carrier that you chose to go with.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:38.800]   They still try to lock it down at that point, but it would also make potentially switching easier.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:50.800]   So for example, if you traveled internationally, you could switch from using a USM and roaming to using a sim in Italy or a sim in Zimbabwe or a sim in whatever country in Japan.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:56.800]   When you're Leo, whatever country you are in, and that would make it in some places in the world, it's so dense.
[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:02.800]   There's so many countries that having two sim cards are normal in phones, and this just eliminates a lot of the complexity.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:10.800]   But AT&T and Verizon specifically in the US don't like it, and the Department of Justice is now investigating them for antitrust.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:19.800]   The antitrust action was brought by a carrier. It doesn't say which carrier, but I'm going to get steam mobile because if there's any company that's maverick enough to want to go after the others,
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:24.800]   it just seems like it's John Leger, and he probably had a lot of four letter words in his complaint in the Justice Department.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:32.800]   The handset maker, the vendor though, was clearly identified by the people familiar with the matter as Apple,
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.800]   and Apple's been including ESIMs and a lot of their devices for a while now.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.800]   So what do you think, Laurie? Is this something that Apple should be complaining about?
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.800]   Is it something that the Justice Department should be looking into?
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:49.800]   So with regard to Apple, I can see where they would be.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:59.800]   I can see where they would be kind of hoping that this ESIM idea would become commonplace amongst all phone carriers or all phone makers.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:10.800]   It seems like it would be less expensive for Apple to have to carry the different phone types so that
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:21.800]   as a consumer, I could just buy an iPhone anytime. I wouldn't have to set it up with AT&T or Verizon or Sprint or T-Mobile when I go to make the purchase.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:33.800]   I could just buy the phone and then I can go home, I can set it up with the ESIM and either use the carrier that I already have or switch to a different one.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:48.800]   So it makes a lot of sense to want that ESIM technology to grow and to kind of move out across the world so that phone makers have a little less on their end to deal with.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:02:01.800]   With regards to antitrust, I don't know, it almost doesn't seem like this is the right area for this kind of lawsuit.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:10.800]   I don't know a lot about antitrust law, but it seems to me that this doesn't fit into that category very well.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:22.800]   I think that when you have two organizations that represent a very large portion of the market, I think the problem they get into is that doing anything that looks like it's anti-competitive becomes very complicated for them.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:38.800]   But yes, I do agree with what you're saying, but how does this show anti-competitive-ness when they're not trying to stop other companies from having a lockable phone?
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:44.800]   They're trying to stop phone makers from making an ESIM card.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:50.800]   They're trying to keep the ability to lock the phone to any carrier, not their own, but any carrier.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:58.800]   Well, them trying to push stop things from moving forward because of their size is the thing that when you're a minority of the market, you can do that.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:13.800]   Once you start, if there's any collusion between the two at all or any situation of that and they're trying to stop that process, it becomes something that the Justice Department gets real interested in.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:25.800]   So you're just going to get a lot of attention and a lot of unwanted attention for their part. If they lose it, the big problem is they can negotiate their way out of this, or they can lose all positive control of the conversation.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:36.800]   If the government steps in and starts making that decision, it may mean that it's legal, but there's a lot that can happen that they lose control.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:48.800]   And I think that Apple is pushing that forward. It's one thing for little companies to do it. When Apple starts to press down against you on that process, they're not trying to force it because they have a certain market size.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:55.800]   But Apple is still not... The advantage Apple has is a single entity. They are not a majority holder of the market.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:05.800]   And so they need to do all kinds of stuff. That's been the best part of Android for Apple, is that they get to live inside of a minority position and gives them a lot of latitude.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:12.800]   If they started partnering with Google to force people to do things, they'd have the same problem. You know that AT&T is going to have...
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:23.800]   To be devil's advocate for a moment, Andy, and tell me if I'm off base here. I think they would argue... I don't know if we would take them on face value, but they would argue that the SIM card is the last part of the customer relationship that they still have.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:29.800]   That they've been bullied for years by the likes of Apple, but customers still have to come to them for a SIM card.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:33.800]   And if they give that up, they lose sort of any direct contact with their customers.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:52.800]   The only devil's advocate argument I can really accept is that the center of this complaint is that there's a whole purpose of the E-SIM is that it allows consumers have flexibility to go from carrier to carrier whenever they're not on contract to make it make that a very, very easy thing to do.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:57.800]   They don't have to leave the house as somebody who doesn't like to leave the house. That's a very, very important thing for me.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:06.800]   And it's also a big deal for Apple because they keep complaining about how there's no room inside these devices to put anything.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:18.800]   So be able to rely completely on E-SIMs is a big, big savings for them. Also, if you're doing a smartwatch, it's kind of insane to have a drawer inside a watch to slide a card into.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:32.800]   And so they really want a standard to be built so that they can start supporting that make things much, much easier for them. So they can start essentially buying things off the shelf or making sure they're building devices that people are going to be able to use everywhere.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:47.800]   The complaint is that in the North America, these two companies have been colluding with the standards committee to say that we need a mechanism so that the user would, yes, there's no SIM, but still the owner of this phone, if we sell to them, would need to get our permission to unlock that E-SIM and lock it.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:06:05.800]   And allow them to take it to another carrier. That's the only devil's advocate position that I really support, excuse me, that I can see, is that we want to still have the ability to say we will give you a one heck of a wonderful discount on this phone if you, if we lock you into a two year contract.
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:14.800]   After two years, we will automatically send out the magic twinkle dust pulse that unlocks your E-SIM and then after two years you can take that phone wherever you want.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:32.800]   But whether it's an anti, it's probably, like Alex said, it probably qualifies as something that the Department of Justice should look into because you have two companies that are competitors joining together to ask for something that benefits those two companies at the expense of smaller carriers.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:52.800]   Also, the Washington Post had a piece today about how this isn't a news story. The DOJ looked into this in 2015, 2016, under the Obama administration, and determined that they don't see evidence yet about that there has been anti-trust violations on this issue.
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:07:00.800]   However, they left the issue open to, they left the issue to be reopened later on. So this is something that they've been arguing about for a long, long time.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:21.800]   I don't want that the whole point of an E-SIM would be sort of undermined if essentially you're still locked into a carrier, you still have to go to, you still have to call AT&T and go, listen as the person in the other phone goes through that three ring binder say, would you like to tell me why you wanted to switch?
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:37.800]   No, no, I just want to change. Well, we could change your plans. I want you to turn off my SIM. The ability to simply cut them out of the conversation completely, simply call T-Mobile and say, "Hi, pick my phone your phone." Great. I can't think about that.
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.800]   That's what they want, and that's what Verizon does not want.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:55.800]   Yeah, it seems like there's another, Alex, to your previous point, there's another example of Apple now in the antitrust crosshairs, and that's what they're bid to buy Shazam and the EU, this is according to Gizmodo, who cut through the longer statement to give this little sort of quick reality check.
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:09.800]   The statement goes on to say the EU is concerned that if a buyout goes through Apple would gain access to customer data that would allow the company to send targeted ads to Shazam users, entice them to switch over, thereby increasing Apple Music's market share and putting competitors such as Spotify and these
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:16.800]   who currently are listed as referral streaming services, entice them alongside Apple Music at a significant disadvantage.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:20.800]   You think that's, should that be an area of concern for this deal?
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:34.800]   Yeah, I mean, the shazam is a pretty big deal. I mean, that is a lot of how people discover, you know, you hear something that you like and you turn it on and then you immediately, the closer that, if Apple is able, and I'm sure Apple is
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:52.800]   missing this, is that if Apple's able to be the first thing that you get or the easiest way to grab that song that you heard and put it right into a library, you know, it could have a, it could have a meaningful impact on on Spotify and others because it's, it really does those kinds of efficiencies become really good.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:59.800]   I don't know whether that makes sense for them to, again, Apple's not the, they're a big company, but they are not the majority holder in this market.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:05.800]   You know, and so I think that that becomes a little bit hard and EU is a little bit more loose about that in the United States.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.800]   So the EU can kind of do whatever they want. They don't have any rules.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:14.800]   So they, they just kind of decide what they don't like and they go and, you know, have a latte and do their thing.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.800]   So make your life miserable.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.800]   Yeah, I mean, they're, they're just like, oh, I do not think this is a good idea.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:26.800]   You know, and so, and they kind of, it feels like, I always feel like the EU just kind of decides what they feel like, and they don't like, and they think this is bad.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:40.800]   And so they do it. So I think that they might be able to do something that wouldn't happen in the United States because without having a real true market leadership position, Apple should be able to do, you know, should be able to be competitive and buy that.
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:47.800]   You know, they're not, you know, they're not leveraging anything right now that would, that would push the other ones out.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:52.800]   And just, and it's not a similar business. It's complimentary business. It does discovery not playback.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:55.800]   So it doesn't increase their market share just by doing it.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.800]   Right.
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.800]   What's your take?
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:12.800]   I am my default position on EU action to protect the interests of consumers is generally positive because I envy it.
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.800]   I envy it like I envy Canadian healthcare.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:23.800]   I think there is no service that's advocating for consumer digital rights in the United States of America.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:28.800]   I'm sorry, no formal agency. They're all like citizen agencies that are doing that.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:40.800]   I am a little bit worried that if they start to raise the red flag on every transaction, it will make almost any sort of acquisition that will help lots of people in lots of companies kind of fail.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:49.800]   But I do see their point. There's no, I don't think that Apple would use, would use Chazam to steer people towards Apple music.
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:58.800]   That's probably not what they're, that's not something we've seen them do in the past as far as I can, as far as I can think of.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:07.800]   However, they are correct in not necessarily trusting Apple and making, they are correct in making sure that let's at least take a look at this before we allow this to go through.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:12.800]   As the only practicing musician here, Lori, do you have any concerns?
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:21.800]   I don't have any concerns for my band being able to get discovered on Chazam because I'm sure that Chazam wouldn't know what that is.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:44.800]   I see the problem, which is if Apple were to acquire Chazam and then either made Apple music at the exclusive link through Chazam's discovery interface, or if they even just put them at the top of the list,
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:56.800]   that does kind of make it harder for the other streaming music services to get that kind of feedback from users.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:13.800]   It may not be such an issue though. Different people use Chazam in a different way, but when I use Chazam, I ask, what song is playing.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:35.800]   I might actually click on a link to go see that music in Spotify or iTunes or something like that, but it doesn't affect whether or not I'm going to subscribe to Spotify or subscribe to Apple music or whether or not I'm going to purchase that music through a different digital music source.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:42.800]   That already exists for me. Who I subscribe to has nothing to do with Chazam, for example.
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:54.800]   I don't think in the end that this would negatively affect any of the streaming music services that are already listed in Chazam's discovery options.
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:13:03.800]   I think the scarier version is that Apple incorporates the Chazam technology into Apple music and then gets rid of Chazam.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:08.800]   Or leave Chazam exactly the way it is, but it's incorporated so you just use music to open it up.
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.800]   I think that if I was buying Chazam, that's what I would look to do.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:17.800]   I would have been incorporated in Syria for a couple of years now. I don't know how many people use it that way though, but if it was just part of Apple music, you open it up to identifying.
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.800]   Go ahead.
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:25.800]   I use Chazam through Syria all the time.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:37.800]   I don't see that as being something. I see what you're saying acquiring Chazam and then just removing it from everybody else's ability to use it like they did with Beats radio, for example.
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:51.800]   I don't think this would happen though because Chazam is such a large company, a preexisting service that to take it away from everyone who doesn't own an Apple product.
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:57.800]   I just don't see that as something that would happen. I don't see that as something that Apple would do.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:02.800]   Again, we don't know what they're going to do. We're not behind those closed doors with them having those discussions.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:10.800]   Even if they weren't going to do it now, that doesn't mean they wouldn't do it for 10 years from now. I get that fear. I understand that.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:17.800]   Apple is in a pitched battle with Spotify. They're coming on strong. They're increasing their subscriptions. Did any of you follow the new Spotify news?
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:27.800]   I can't remember who it was today or yesterday because when you travel all time, it just blends together, but they announced a change to their free tier that we hope would be more attractive to people.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:43.800]   I was reading about that. I haven't tested it out yet, but it actually doesn't really seem like that big of a deal because they're allowing you to listen to certain playlists without having to shuffle the music in a mobile capacity, meaning not on local Wi-Fi.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:54.800]   They're not opening it up to all music. They're just opening it up to certain playlists that will show up in your discovery or recommended for you sections.
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:00.800]   I think there's 12 different playlists that will be come on to you.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:06.800]   There's a low bandwidth mode too for you if you want to. It's not quite downloaded, but it's low bandwidth streaming or something.
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:20.800]   For me, when I use Spotify, I use it at home. What I love about using it at home is that I don't have to shuffle, that I can listen to music on demand.
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:32.800]   But if I am outside of my local, my home Wi-Fi and I am using it globally, it's the shuffle. Who cares?
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:39.800]   Especially when it comes to playlists, because playlists aren't an album from first song to last.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:50.800]   If it's just a playlist that was curated by somebody anyway, it's not what the original artists intended to have their music played in a particular order.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:16:04.800]   For me personally, the reason that I like listening to music like an album from the first song to the last song is because that's what the artists originally intended for that music to sound like.
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:11.800]   There are some albums that are just perfect the way their songs are structured from beginning to end.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:22.800]   That is negatively affected when your songs are shuffled. Outside of that, it doesn't matter when the song appears in the playlist.
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.800]   So it doesn't really seem.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:38.800]   For me, the only albums that I think of as a continuous thing that I have to do are a variety of prog rock kind of stuff, whether it's Genesis or Yes or some of these ones that are even rush,
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:42.800]   where you have this kind of progression, the wall.
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:52.800]   I really feel like, and if someone that was my job was to listen to music all the time, I was a music director a long time ago.
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:17:03.800]   There was definitely some progression and there were some albums that you got that, but I think for the vast majority, they were stacked up to try to, I mean, a lot of them were stacked up based on singles and so on and so forth.
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:11.800]   I was a singer where they wanted them and back in the day when I was doing it, they were literally designed around the two sides of an album of what you listened to first.
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:14.800]   It was just a very fascinating process.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:22.800]   I do think that I love playlists. I make a lot of playlists. I probably should share something, but I don't do it.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:23.800]   Do it, Alex.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:24.800]   Sure.
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.800]   Maybe I'll start posting some playlists.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:33.800]   I was making mixtapes from the time I was 10 years old.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:39.800]   My cousins and I would get together and we try to literally think about the next great song that would come after this song.
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:44.800]   It was us designing that. It was funny. I had this one that's almost done.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:48.800]   It was called a curiously good mix that I made when I was 16 or something like that.
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:55.800]   Over Christmas, my brothers and I tried to drinking a lot of whiskey.
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:56.800]   You mean cool.
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:57.800]   What?
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:58.800]   You mean cool.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:17:59.800]   Now I think you guys.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.800]   We were sitting around drinking in the middle of the night.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.800]   It took a look at the morning and we were trying to all remember.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:09.800]   We had to pull our sisters in and my mom in and try to remember this one mix.
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:14.800]   We've got it almost all cobbled back together because if you listen to it, you could hear the next song coming.
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:19.800]   That's this thing I love about all of the stuff.
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:22.800]   Just being able to just randomly just grab all this stuff.
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:31.800]   I think one of the things that's really missing for Spotify and for Apple is really making that mix tape experience even better.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:34.800]   I used to actually cross fade all of my stuff.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.800]   I was used to be a DJ too.
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:37.800]   I had a little mixing station.
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:42.800]   I would play all the songs and literally do a live recording of all the songs from one side to the next
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.800]   and beat mix everything and pull it all together and everything else.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.800]   When I get someone to tape, that's what I made.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.800]   The fact that I can't do that with Spotify, that everything has to stop.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.800]   It drives me crazy.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:59.800]   You do it with the DJ app because it pulls Spotify songs on so then you can do it with the DJ app.
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:01.800]   You could do it but when you want it.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.800]   What you want is you don't want to output it.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.800]   What you want is to have those songs like I can define overlap between those.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:07.800]   Not some random.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:10.800]   You can't just have it be, "Oh, there's going to be a second overlap" or whatever.
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:16.800]   It's like I can overlap them and create a little bezier that says, "This is how I wanted to go from one to the other."
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:21.800]   If you just did that, then you still have all the Spotify stuff and you wouldn't be breaking any rules by sharing it.
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:22.800]   All that stuff.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:23.800]   AI mix it, Alex.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:24.800]   I have an AI crossover.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:25.800]   No.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:27.800]   AI won't understand.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:28.800]   This is an art.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:29.800]   This is an art.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.800]   You can't just do that.
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:34.800]   I can have a thousand artists train the model.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:38.800]   I think that there's a lot that AI could do.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:51.800]   One of the things I think that is missing in what a lot of these do is they try to figure out some algorithm that connects you but they don't give the users any chance to make their own connections.
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:57.800]   What I mean by that is what I really want is to be able to, and I think I've said this in some show a year ago or two years ago or five years ago.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:58.800]   I remember.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:03.800]   You really want to say, "Okay, I want to know everybody listening.
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:04.800]   Here's the stuff I like.
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:05.800]   I say that I like this stuff.
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:15.800]   Then I want to know how big of a group, if I say I want a 100% correlation, they listen to exactly what I want.
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:16.800]   It'll say, "There's one person like that."
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:21.800]   As I scroll down to .1%, it's almost everybody.
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:24.800]   I find this area where I find my tribe.
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:29.800]   My tribe of people that listen to music that's 60% correlation or 70%.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:34.800]   Then I say, "I want you to build a playlist where the correlation between our playlist, when they say they are all in the world, they say they are all in the world."
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:40.800]   When they say they all like something, I want it to show up in some playlist that is when 70% of them say it or 20% of them say it.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:44.800]   It gives you a little calculation that says, "This is how many songs you're going to get if you do that."
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:54.800]   Allowing the user to play with that creates this interactivity and this involvement that could help the AI a lot rather than having...
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.800]   There's so much of trying to have the computer.
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:03.800]   This is something you could be one of those things like you hold down an option key and scratch your right side and do something else like it's hidden in there.
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:07.800]   The people like us could play with it, but I think that this kind of hidden...
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:18.800]   This ability for the users to play with that a little bit could be invaluable because now you're incorporating tens of millions of people to be your AI rather than just depending on the computers.
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:23.800]   Because the AI by itself is okay, it's a work in progress.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:29.800]   The mix is the playlists I get are okay from Spotify and from Apple Music.
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:35.800]   We are going to visit Leo one last time from Sunny Tokyo.
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.800]   I'm not sure where he is, but he has awesome news for us.
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:41.800]   Can we talk just to you and me?
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:45.800]   Let's just bring the band down behind me, boys, because I want to talk about something kind of very personal.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:50.800]   I know guys, gosh, our egos are really tied up in all this.
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.800]   We don't go to the doctor anyway.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:22:03.800]   It is a statistical fact that married guys are healthier and I convinced it's because their wives nag them to go to the doctor.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:05.800]   I know that's true for me.
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:08.800]   It's just a broken leg.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.800]   I'll stay at home.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:10.800]   It's not...
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.800]   Honey, you're getting in the car.
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:16.800]   You're going to the doctor.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:24.800]   There's just things that you don't...
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:32.800]   People don't usually want to talk about, but it happens to every guy, especially as you get older, ED, erectile dysfunction.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.800]   It is a curse.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:41.800]   It is a curse because, well, I think you probably already know all the negative consequences of this.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:51.800]   The last thing you want to do is go to a doctor, and I'm sure your wife is saying, "Honey, the last thing you want to do is go to a doctor and talk to them about..."
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.800]   It's embarrassing.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.800]   I got a great solution for you.
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:23:01.800]   A company that's focused on helping men take care of themselves, fix things.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.800]   It's called Roman.
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:10.800]   Roman is a way to get the medication you need.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.800]   It's really good stuff.
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.800]   It really works.
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:20.800]   For every step of the way, online diagnosis, you will actually get diagnosed by an actual doctor.
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:24.800]   You'll get a prescription, and then they deliver your medication in a...
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.800]   What do they call it?
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:30.800]   Plane brown wrapper to your home.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.800]   It's so easy, and you know what?
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.800]   You're going to breathe such a sigh of relief.
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:37.800]   I promise you, you will say, "I should have done this years ago."
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.800]   All it takes is five minutes.
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:40.800]   Now, I know some of you are not worried.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:43.800]   In fact, some of you right now, I know how guys are.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:44.800]   There's so much ego involved.
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:45.800]   They're saying, "Oh, I would never use..."
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:46.800]   I'm not chat room.
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.800]   I bet you're already saying the chat.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.800]   "Oh, I'm never..."
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:50.800]   Yeah, well, okay.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:51.800]   You don't have to admit it.
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:52.800]   Don't have to talk about it.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.800]   Just keep this in mind.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:56.800]   All it takes is five minutes.
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:57.800]   I'm not talking to you.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:58.800]   I'm talking to the other guy, okay?
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:02.800]   Five minutes to do an online survey about your medical history.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:03.800]   You can say what your preference is.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:05.800]   There are some really good choices.
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:08.800]   Different kinds of medication.
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:12.800]   US licensed physicians will review your treatment requests within two hours.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.800]   They will write a prescription.
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.800]   This is all the US too, by the way.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.800]   And then the medication is delivered free.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:21.800]   No shipping charge to your door.
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:25.800]   It comes from Roman pharmacy network.
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:29.800]   And in a discrete package, it's marked RHP.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:31.800]   So nobody knows what's in there.
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:36.800]   And, and you're going to want this, refills happen automatically every month or every quarter.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.800]   Because if you forget, you'll be sorry.
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:46.800]   Most guys will admit that either they or maybe someone they know just won't go to the doctor for any reason,
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.800]   but especially this reason.
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:52.800]   Roman is the right way to handle this, okay?
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:55.800]   Look, this is just a conversation between you and me.
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:02.800]   You know, when I talk about with anybody else, just you and me, trust me, you will be very glad.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:05.800]   You went to get Roman.com/MacBreak.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:08.800]   You get $50 off your first month, by the way.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:13.800]   Get G-E-T-R-O-M-A-N.com/MacBreak.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:18.800]   I want to get too personal here, but I can tell you right now.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:23.800]   Next month, there will be a smile on your face and hers too.
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:27.800]   Get Roman.com/MacBreak.
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:28.800]   We thank Roman for their support.
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.800]   Okay, take your hands off yours now, guys.
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.800]   You can get back to MacBreak weekly.
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.800]   Are you turning red?
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:37.800]   Oh, greatly.
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.800]   Now that nobody's left to watch us, they're all busy over there.
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.800]   They turn the show back to us.
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:46.800]   We're going to try to, we're going to try to be, to bring everybody back by going to our picks of the week
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:52.800]   and give everyone a second to think about it as I just thank Andy and Aco as always for being here.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.800]   Alex Lindsey for joining us again.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:01.800]   And Lori Gill, who's making, I think it's your second appearance on the show, back to back.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:04.800]   Yes, I'm not back to back because my second time.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:06.800]   Okay.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:11.800]   Back to not back to back, but one of those things, and I'm going to go to,
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:18.800]   should we do Alex first just so that nobody has any money left to spend on the rest of the picks?
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.800]   I actually, it doesn't cost anything.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:24.800]   Well, not exactly.
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:28.800]   So this pick is for my kids.
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:35.800]   So I have to say that I just have to, you might, my kids, they play a lot of, on the iPad,
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:38.800]   and they started off with Minecraft and they had a good time with it.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:42.800]   They have gotten into the game Roblox. Have you guys played Roblox?
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:43.800]   No.
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:44.800]   Oh my gosh.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:47.800]   This is like this crazy culture.
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:53.800]   I barely understand it, but kids can really, you know, build their own bits and pieces.
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:57.800]   This is kind of like the next generation of mine, of Minecraft.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.800]   That's how it feels.
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:00.800]   Like they're like, "Oh yeah, Minecraft's fine."
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:04.800]   And they played a lot of Minecraft, and they just dug into this little world.
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:07.800]   And I can't believe my eight-year-old daughter is like, I was like, "Who's that?"
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:09.800]   "Oh, that's just a non-player character on the server.
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:10.800]   I'm going to use this server for a little while.
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.800]   I'm going to go over to this other server."
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:16.800]   They've got this all figured out, and they're building stuff, and the other kids are building things.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:21.800]   And whenever you talk to, I was at a dinner last night, and there's another ten-year-old boy,
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.800]   and I started talking about Roblox, and he just was like, "Wow."
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.800]   You know, just do all this information about it, and everything else.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:29.800]   And I don't understand, I don't know what they're doing.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.800]   But what I love about it is, is that they're doing it together most of the time.
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:36.800]   So the two of them will be sitting there next to each other on their iPads.
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:42.800]   And the iPad interface looks a little funky to me, but from a design perspective,
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.800]   but they're typing with their friends, and they're going back and forth, and they're moving all of them,
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:48.800]   and they're working together, and putting all these things together.
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:28:00.800]   And my understanding is, it is that eight to twelve is kind of the age range
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.800]   that most of the kids that are playing.
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:06.800]   I don't know if it's really there for a lot of people who play it when they're older,
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:11.800]   but man, it's an addictive... I'm warning you, if you're a parent,
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.800]   it's a very addictive game for the kids.
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:18.800]   And so I've had to start pulling them back a little bit, pulling away.
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:22.800]   But if you're trying to look at something or think of what the next thing is,
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:25.800]   I had never heard of it, and I didn't quite understand it.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:30.800]   But it feels like a take-off from Minecraft, but then they did a lot more,
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:33.800]   and there's just tons of interactivity, and they're talking to...
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:38.800]   They're interacting with lots of folks, and it's a little bit more graphic than Minecraft, as you can see.
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:42.800]   But my kids are... They just love it.
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:49.800]   So I thought that's the... That's my pick, but it really comes from my kids.
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:50.800]   I don't understand it at all.
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.800]   Awesome.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:53.800]   Awesome.
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:56.800]   Lori Gill, how about you? What do you have for us this week?
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:09.800]   So my pick this week is the Prince Estate last week uploaded a video of a studio recording of Prince singing the song that he wrote,
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:14.800]   "Nothing Compares To You," which was later made popular by Sinead O'Connor.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:19.800]   You can watch this five-minute video on YouTube and listen to the original recording.
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:23.800]   The footage that they're showing is different than the song.
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:26.800]   They're not linked together.
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:40.800]   But what's so incredible about it when you watch this video is how professional Prince and the Revolution are when it comes to practicing and rehearsing everything that they do.
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:48.800]   So not only are they practicing this music, Prince is always fully dressed in this incredible outfit at any given time,
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:52.800]   and the entire band is doing dance moves.
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:58.800]   They're rehearsing dance moves while they're playing, while they're practicing, and it just blows my mind.
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.800]   The song is gorgeous. His version of it is absolutely beautiful.
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:11.800]   But if you just watch how professional this band is and their ability to play these songs, I can barely move while I'm playing an instrument.
[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:14.800]   And they're doing full-on dance moves and practicing constantly.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:18.800]   It's absolutely beautiful and really inspiring to watch them do this.
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:27.800]   I had band practice last night and I was begging my bandmates, "Please, let's practice some dance moves because it's so cool."
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:31.800]   Oh, game blouses. I want some pancakes.
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:34.800]   But instead of pancakes, Andy, literally all the money has been left to you.
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:37.800]   You can get us to spend anything now.
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:42.800]   Well, unfortunately, I got something that's kind of budgety, but kind of awesome.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:46.800]   This is, and I can't really nominate a brand name for this.
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:52.800]   Something I'm going to call this a cheapest, free Chinese LED light panel made recently.
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:59.800]   The last time I bought a little panel like this, it was a couple hundred bucks and there are boxy and stuff like that.
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:05.800]   And recently I found out that, again, the Chinese manufacturers have found a way to make this super slim.
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:15.800]   It will run off of a regular standard Sony camcorder battery or off of line voltage 12 volts.
[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:20.800]   And they're dirt cheap. I won't tell you how much for now, but mechanical switch.
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:25.800]   And it's not just that, "Okay, great. I've got a light that turns on and off."
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:33.800]   You can see that it's actually on the back. It has an LCD panel that will show you exactly what the brightness level is, your battery level.
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:41.800]   And also, if you, this is a, I'm getting back to physical tactile interfaces, this is actually a clicky button knob.
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:48.800]   So if I click the button, if I leave it as is, I'm adjusting the brightness, but if I tap it, there you go.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:56.800]   I'm now adjusting the temperature and making it warmer or colder, just like that.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:06.800]   And these things cost, I bought this one for $36.99. They are, you will find like a dozen of these that look exactly the same with like different stickers on them.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:15.800]   This one is called the Supon LED-L122T RA CR195 that would look good on a bumper sticker.
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:21.800]   But you'll see, you'll see the same features that if you shop, or if you shop around for ones that look exactly like this,
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:31.800]   this one, because this one comes with a battery, it also comes with a mount so that you can use it as a light on top of your camera, plug it into your hot shoe.
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:35.800]   It also does, but it does have like a standard tripod mount on the bottom of it.
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:44.800]   I've got like the heel, the shoe from my GorillaPod here, so that like when I travel or something, I can just stick this somewhere as a light.
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:53.800]   As a matter of fact, this is the second one I own, the first one I own is like now permanently mounted as like my side fill light for podcasting.
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:33:03.800]   But it's really, really cool, not just because of what it does, but also when I travel, I'm often doing kind of, I'm a big, I love photography.
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:06.800]   I often do things that are kind of weird with my photography.
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:15.800]   And the number of times where it's been so useful to have a light that could simply add a little fill to a certain amount to a certain subject.
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:24.800]   And that's the difference between a phone picture that looks like, okay, that's a decent phone picture, and people saying, "Wow, what did you shoot that with?
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:30.800]   You shoot that with the cannons?" Like, no, I shot that with my iPhone 7, I just had a $30 Chinese little light on it.
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:40.800]   And so, yes, and also if you're taking pictures of plastic cows in basic tourist places, again, a little bit of fill will help you out a lot.
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:44.800]   So, once again, I've only had this for about a month.
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:55.800]   I held off on recommending it until I made sure that, again, being a Chinese no-name manufacturer, that didn't, you know, explode after using it for about a couple days.
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:01.800]   These, both of these seem to have, the first one held up so well that, again, I bought a second one just for travel purposes.
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:05.800]   So, I mean, buy one, check it out. It'll make your home videos look so much better.
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:08.800]   It'll make even some of your travel photography look so much better.
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:22.800]   And if you podcast, I've got a whole bunch of lights around here giving me studio lighting, but for less than 100 bucks, you could, for about 100 bucks, you could get three of these lights and probably get within 80% of what my studio lights look like right now.
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:33.800]   It's really, really, really good to play with. Had I had these been around for this price seven, seven or eight years ago when I bought my studio lighting, I might have just decided I'm going to buy a bunch of these instead.
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:42.800]   All right, so it feels like in order to maintain the honor of this grouping, I have to pick like an iMac Pro or a red camera just to get us back and back on budget.
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:47.800]   But we should have a total at the end of each Mac, Mac rig, like this is what we recommended.
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:51.800]   So far, we're only at $35.
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:35:04.800]   That is so brilliant. Andy Enoco, I wanted to also thank you for being on vector with me and Georgia Dow and going over our experiences, our tragedies and our triumphs of moving houses and setting up studios. Thank you so much for doing that.
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:12.800]   Yeah, it started off as a helpful thing for listeners and it ended up as a support group for three people who are still picking up the pieces.
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:18.800]   And this terrible decision we learned, but yeah, no, thank you. I hope I get to be on the show again. I really enjoyed talking to you guys.
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:24.800]   That was fantastic. And if people are interested in your other podcasts or finding you on social, where can they go?
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:35.800]   You have to spell my last name, unfortunately. I H and as a Nancy, A.T. is in Tom KO. My blog is at anacco.com. My Twitter is anacco. My Instagram is also anacco.
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:44.800]   And you do that Android podcast. We do not speak the name of fairly regularly material exactly for the mighty relay.fm network.
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:50.800]   So that's it. I'm off this week, but so this is a good time. This is a good week to sample it because you won't have to listen to me.
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:54.800]   No one's going to hold that Russell accountable, though. It's going to be terrible.
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:36:03.800]   Actually, I think Russell might Russell is Russell and I were both be in New York City tomorrow night and it might be just flow.
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:07.800]   So which is great because Flowion is amazing in and of herself.
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:12.800]   Flow monologue. It can't get any better than that. Alex, are you streaming or?
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:19.800]   I've been showing everybody your podcast, by the way, all the video people I know is watch this podcast because Alex will tear you down right in front of you.
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:26.800]   I'm giving everyone a little bit of a break. I had to do a little bit of traveling, but I'll have some more up soon.
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:34.800]   And having a lot of fun with it, the tear down has been a good time. You can find it on the PIXCOR YouTube page, which is pretty easy to find.
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:39.800]   And it's just me complaining about other people's work.
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:44.800]   And most stick with other people's work. I feel like my work, then I have to talk about clients and don't want to do that.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:49.800]   So otherwise I would. I complain about everything, but most people will tell you.
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:52.800]   I mean, I've constructed criticism about everyone.
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:37:00.800]   So anyway, but otherwise you can find me on Twitter at Alex and then I just complain there in front of.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:04.800]   It's dependent on how about you, Lori, go. What are you up to?
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:10.800]   Well, you can find me on the Twitter's at Apoholic, a P P A H R L I K.
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:15.800]   I like to say that as fast as possible so that anybody who's trying to find me gets super confused.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:19.800]   I'm at Lori Gill at most of the other social things.
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:29.800]   I write a lot at I'm more. So you'll be actually a Nintendo Switch just recently got a public hack.
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:35.800]   Well, Nintendo didn't do it, but a public hack has been officially released and I've been waiting for it.
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:40.800]   So I'll probably be spending the next couple of weeks digging into hacking your Nintendo Switch.
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:42.800]   So check that out. That's going to be fun.
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:43.800]   Homebrew with Lori Gill.
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:44.800]   It's going to be fun.
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:45.800]   I like it.
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:48.800]   And you can catch Mackie with me.
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:54.800]   Totally. You can catch Mackraig weekly. It streams live 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:38:01.800]   I'm not smart enough like Leo to know what the Zulu time is for that, but I'm sure it's somewhere on the website.
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:06.800]   And if you miss it, you can catch up with it at any time on any of your favorite podcast,
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:08.800]   clients or video clients.
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.800]   Mackraig is literally everywhere.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:16.800]   They're Mackraig is on services that we don't know exist yet. So just look for it. You will find it and you will enjoy it in the meantime.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.800]   Thanks you all so much for watching.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:22.800]   Next week, Andy gets to host. So I get to be the person lobbying the spitballs instead of him this time.
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:25.800]   And Leo will be back soon thereafter. Thank you all so much.
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:30.800]   Mackraig is broke. Mackraig is over. Back to work. The Generates.
