[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.600]   What will the screen resolution look like?
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.680]   And which camera phone is the best?
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.680]   It's coming up next on Mac Break.

[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.200]   I should just go slow.

[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.440]   That's Andy Inaka from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.640]   Hello Andrew.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.480]   >> Hello Leo.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.320]   Lovely shirt today.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.440]   >> Thank you.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.800]   >> Lisa bought it for me in Hawaii.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.880]   It's a Tommy Bahama you can only get in the islands.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.440]   >> I know you're a big fan of the black Tommy Bahama.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.480]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's Alex Lindsey.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   What your name is, but I.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.480]   >> I love Tommy Bahama.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.080]   >> I have lots of different colors, but I don't have that one.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.200]   >> You're the one who took me to the Tommy Bahama store in San Francisco at Nordstrom Center.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.880]   >> Because we were short shorts.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.320]   >> And I bought a bunch of black shirts.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.480]   >> Yes.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.720]   >> Thank you.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.040]   >> The one, the blue one is very nice because you can change the color in post.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.400]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.600]   >> With the blue over the green screen and then you can key it and then change it.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.240]   So you've moved to Pittsburgh.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.120]   >> I have over the weekend.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.120]   >> Well, I'm over the weekend.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.640]   >> Over the weekend.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.520]   >> Yeah, over the weekend I moved to Pittsburgh.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.120]   The kids start school on Wednesday, so I had to get them there.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.880]   So then come back and finish up the packing and then go back again this weekend.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.480]   >> Unless I go to Italy tomorrow.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.520]   >> Next week.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.520]   >> I always like to say that unless I go to Italy tomorrow.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.240]   That could be any.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.680]   >> Next week.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.120]   >> Next week.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.280]   >> I might go to Italy tomorrow.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.240]   I feel like I should.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.440]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.200]   >> I'd like either Italy or Montreal.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.800]   >> That's where Renee Richie is of iMour.com.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.080]   Hi Renee.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.320]   >> I woke up to where that Burger King was buying Tim Hortons and
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.920]   moving the whole shebang to Canada.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.240]   I don't know what to do with myself.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.760]   I call shenanigans.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.960]   >> I don't want to do that.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.480]   >> What was it too?
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.720]   It was a huge amount of money.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.320]   It was billions and billions.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.640]   It dwarfs the acquisition of Twitch by Amazon.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.080]   >> I don't do.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.280]   >> It's like 11 billion.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.280]   >> I don't.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.320]   >> For a donut shop?
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.840]   >> I like Tony Horton so much and I don't like Burger King so much.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.320]   >> Tony Horton.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.760]   >> His favorite hockey player.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.280]   >> Yes.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.120]   >> Tony Horton.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.480]   >> Are going to be a thing.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.400]   >> Tony Horton.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.240]   >> So the thing is is Tony Horton.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.760]   >> Tim.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.920]   >> And Tim Horton.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.560]   >> Are we the brothers?
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.080]   >> Tim Horton takes your belly and pushes it one way.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.360]   >> Tony Horton pulls it back in.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.120]   >> So I try to stick with it.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.880]   >> 11.4 billion dollars.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.640]   It is a sacrilege.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.840]   It's something akin to Budweiser buying molesons.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.480]   >> It's good for neither of our countries, Leo.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.360]   >> What's weird is that they're moving Burger King to Canada.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.680]   We already have a queen.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.680]   We're okay.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.680]   We're good.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.520]   >> We're a king and a queen now.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.920]   >> Look forward to seeing more drunken people at hockey fights wearing those paper freak
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.920]   pounds.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.160]   That's a good visual.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.160]   >> Free advertising.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.160]   >> We're Jim Dalrumpel.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.160]   It's not even here and he's being made fun of.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.440]   >> Every scott born gave us that gold card at Burger King.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.440]   >> It's not a word at Tim Horton.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.440]   >> Unlimited Burger King.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.440]   I guess it's all over for Scott and his unlimited Burger King card.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.120]   Doesn't he have a card that he can eat free forever?
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.120]   >> Something like that.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.120]   That was the story anyway.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.120]   >> I don't buy it.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.240]   >> I think it was just a good story.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.080]   >> So apparently this is a, when it came across the wire, they said it was a tax inversion.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.080]   >> Yep.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.080]   >> That's painful.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.080]   >> That's how it's that.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.760]   >> Any tax in Canadian dollars must be cheaper.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.760]   >> It is.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.760]   >> That's like something.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.880]   That's the language they use in the first reel of a sci-fi horror movie to explain the
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.800]   thing they can't explain that caused the Diet Monster to visit upon this.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.840]   It was a tax inversion.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.800]   We thought it was impossible in this dimension, but look at what's happening right now.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.960]   >> I think that's what cars shark made.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.960]   >> It was a tax inversion.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.960]   >> Isn't it?
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.960]   >> Very well.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.400]   >> Several inversion, according to- >> The tax in Canadian beaches first.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.840]   >> Any beaches pretending to be US beaches.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.520]   Several inversion deals have developed this year alone.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.200]   US-based Abvee bought Irish drug makers Shire, and then they moved Ireland, right?
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.920]   The idea is you move out of the US because the taxes are, the corporate taxes are so
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.920]   higher.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.720]   I think we're pretty generous in our corporate tax structure.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.280]   >> I don't know.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.520]   >> You say no?
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.520]   >> No.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.280]   >> No, no, it's fine.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.280]   >> That's fine.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.040]   >> Corporate taxes like the Canadian civil taxes are redonculus.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.120]   I think the United States is pretty close to the highest corporate taxes in the world.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.120]   >> Really?
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.120]   >> That's why everyone's doing this.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.120]   That's why it becomes a big business.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.120]   >> It must be.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.120]   I mean, that's proof is in the pudding.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.120]   >> Right.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.120]   >> So you should go to Saskatchewan instead of Pennsylvania, Alex.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.760]   >> I don't have any families to scotch away.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.760]   >> I-
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.760]   >> I-
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.560]   >> I'm not really- >> I'm not moving to Pennsylvania for tax inversion.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.560]   >> Doesn't-
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.600]   >> Like kind of practically a socialist nation with things like universal healthcare.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.480]   How could the taxes be lower in Canada?
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.040]   >> I think that- >> None of this makes sense to me.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.040]   >> I think it's higher for individuals though, isn't it?
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.040]   >> Yes.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.040]   >> Oh, I get it.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040]   >> Huh.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.320]   So that makes them a capitalist, communist country.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.080]   >> It makes us very cold in winter and very happy in some-
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.560]   >> Now, I should point out that Tim Hortons, I don't know why we're going on and on about
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.840]   this, but Tim Hortons was owned by Wendy's.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.120]   >> And theoretically, and I'll argue that they use Max.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.800]   >> That's why- >> There you go, that's why we're talking about it.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.800]   >> They have an app, they have a-
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.960]   >> And they were in Delaware until 2009, and then they moved back to Canada shortly after
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.120]   the conservative government.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.120]   Thank you, Mr. Harper.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.360]   >> We were repatriated.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.400]   >> Lored the corporate tax rate.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.440]   The new company will be based in Canada.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.360]   It'll be called Burger Hortons.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.360]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.120]   >> There must be a lot of tax on burgers.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.560]   >> I think there are a lot of people who are going to whimsically drop the last syllable
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.560]   off of that.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.560]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.000]   >> Hey, man, what a good dinner burger whore.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   >> Talk about your wokker.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   >> Whoo!
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   >> No, we should restart this show, I think.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.400]   >> This is called as the brie show.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.680]   >> I'm just pissed off.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.560]   I'm waiting for the gosh darn iPhone.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.320]   Now my daughter has broken her phone.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.040]   My son has broken his phone.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.360]   When is Apple going to release that dang thing?
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.280]   >> Can I give you an example of how bad the news cycle has been this week?
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.280]   >> Yes.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.280]   >> You know the Verge?
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.280]   >> I've heard of them.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.280]   >> Okay.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.400]   Normally on their front page, they have tiles that show how many stories are kind of in
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.400]   the news.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   >> Yeah, that shows you the grass.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.280]   >> There's like seven of them normally.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.280]   >> There's three.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.280]   Three tiles.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:04.040]   And on top of that, the tiles are kind of funny with the Verge back to school guide 2014.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.720]   The rise and fall of virtual reality.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.080]   >> There's nothing to talk about.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.560]   >> Yeah, there's very little.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.880]   >> And there's Oculus Rift helps man with 2D Vision C3D.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.320]   >> That sounds like a made up story.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.920]   >> But this is their video pane.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.720]   So anything below this bar is all video.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.720]   >> It's just stories.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.360]   >> And that's not their headline carousel.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.480]   There's only three stories in the carousel.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.480]   >> Wow.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.480]   >> Okay.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.760]   >> That's gonna change.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.400]   At least they're having some pity about the last week before Labor Day.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.400]   >> Right.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.600]   >> I'm gonna get in one beach day tomorrow because September is gonna be all travel for
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.000]   me and I've got marked off of my calendar.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.080]   Okay, iPhone announcement, Motorola announcement, Samsung definite announcement.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.080]   There's a Dell.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.600]   It's like, oh man.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.320]   >> Well, I never thought I'd say it, but thank goodness for the ice bucket challenge, because
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.760]   that's really giving us endless, endless news.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.960]   >> Endless stuff to talk about.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.080]   >> So September 9th, we still on track.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.080]   >> Sounds like.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.160]   >> Sounds like seems to be.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.520]   >> Looks like there's two, 4.7 and a 5.5.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.520]   >> 128 gigabit.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.160]   >> I'm gonna get a 4.7 for the kids and a 5.5 for myself.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.160]   >> 128 gigabit.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.160]   >> Daddy.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.840]   >> I don't need 128 gigabytes.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.440]   The kids do because they put all their music on it.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.920]   So the kids is gonna, I don't think, I think 64.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.920]   >> I bet it was.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.920]   >> They still have local music.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.840]   Or do they stream now the kids?
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.760]   >> You know, I was surprised because I, you know, they have spot, Henry has Spotify.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:38.200]   Abby, I can't remember what she uses, but she puts music, she, well, I'll give you an
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:43.120]   example, you know, her MacBook Pro was four years old.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.000]   So she went, she goes off to school last week, I buy her a new MacBook Pro, and she says,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.840]   can you move my music over?
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.680]   There's several gigabytes of music.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.680]   So I guess she still has music on her.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.320]   That's the age gulf between a 20 and a 22 year old right there.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.800]   Generation gap.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.200]   She still has physical bits.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   I'm sorry, physical.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.000]   >> Back in my day.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.320]   She went, she was little.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.560]   She used to burn CDs.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.240]   I had a stack of, you know, burned series of handwritten stuff, not anymore.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.160]   Now it's all on the hard drive.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:18.480]   It's time for the back to school guide here at.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.440]   >> I understand there's a trapper that has, trapper keeper that has a built in calculator
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.240]   with square root.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.240]   >> Ooh.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:31.480]   >> But I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll,
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.960]   I'm, I'm curious to see if Apple changes their online backup, whether iCloud backup offerings,
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.120]   because as it is, they're really not giving me enough storage just to, you know, back
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.200]   up my simple little phones as it is, as it becomes sort of an annoying thing of every,
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.520]   always having to dismiss this.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.600]   I know, I know, like it has been backed up for a while.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.200]   It's because I don't have enough storage and I, okay, fine, fine, fine.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.800]   I have to dig in and turn off those settings.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.600]   So they actually increased to a 128 gig maximum.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.680]   Are they going to have, they really should have like a, they should be able to sell you
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.280]   a package that will just simply tell you if you press this button for $4.99 a month or
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.800]   for $2.99 a month, we will give you enough storage.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.200]   You can do a complete backup of this phone wirelessly and not even worry about it.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.240]   >> I don't understand why we don't, I, I still, I really don't understand why Apple doesn't
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.760]   give us the option to, you know, make it as big as we want or at least, you know, one
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.280]   to two terabytes, I think with iOS eight.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.800]   >> But how would you put that much memory in the phone?
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.920]   >> No, no, no, but I have a bunch of devices.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.200]   It's backing up a whole bunch of different iPhones and iPads and like, you know, there's
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.560]   a lot of different backups going on.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.400]   So that's the, that's the issue.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.200]   >> I probably put on iOS eight beta and I switched to test out all the new stuff and
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.800]   now I can no longer back up my stuff.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.760]   I had just enough room previously, but now I don't have room anymore because I'm using
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.600]   the iCloud Drive, but you can't buy the new room yet.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.440]   So I'm caught in this weird dimension.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.120]   >> Just don't have anything really unique happen in your life for the next week and a
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.560]   half or two weeks that would require it to be backed up before you lose your phone.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.560]   That's all.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.560]   >> Well, it's camera roll stuff.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.680]   It's like, I think it's 32 gigabytes of camera roll that I don't want to move like an animal,
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.640]   but I want to, I don't want to lose anything.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.640]   >> That's the problem.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.400]   >> I made the photo out library will fix that eventually, but it's not here yet.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.640]   >> Maybe we're losing a little something.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.040]   I have that problem myself too.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:27.960]   I was working with my iPhone 5S last week and realized that I wanted to capture some pictures
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.200]   off the camera roll and put them in an aperture or whatever.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.480]   And that's when I realized that, wow, because Apple makes it so easy to transfer all of
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.320]   your stuff from one to another every time you move to a new phone, I truly have photos
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.080]   that go back to 2011, 2012.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.240]   And I'm talking about thousands and thousands of photos, including ones that I absolutely
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.200]   don't need anymore.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.960]   Maybe the next really great step for Apple to do is not to make sure that all this stuff
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.280]   gets backed up and restored to every single phone you use, but to make it very, very easy
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:01.720]   to triage the phones that the pictures that you have and kind of guess that I think that
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.080]   we're backing up everything that we're backing up Andy's phone completely to iCloud.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.800]   I'm guessing that we don't need to have all thousands, thousands of these photos.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:15.800]   We're going to figure out which 130, 140 he's actually going to be interested in and keeps
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.880]   looking at.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.120]   And if he asks for the others, we'll make it very, very easy to transparently put those
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:24.680]   back on the phone because now I really do have to go and weed in and make sure that I'm not
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.240]   deleting stuff that has been backed up at least twice elsewhere and also making sure
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.920]   that I've got things organized into albums, which is still the biggest pain in the butt
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.920]   imaginable.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.080]   They are sort of doing that.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.480]   I mean, Apple's going big into near line storage with iCloud photo library.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.560]   And that basically means the photos that you access the most recently that you favorite
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.680]   or that you look at the most or take the most recently, sorry, will get stored on your
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.840]   device and they'll have a certain amount that they'll store on the device.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.240]   The photos that are older or that you haven't looked at in a long time, or that they think
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.880]   you just don't care about as much will be kept on Apple servers.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.200]   And you'll have the option of only downloading device specific sizes for those photos to
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.960]   save even more space because I think universally photos are taking up just tons and tons of
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.960]   space on iOS devices.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.360]   Not only that, but photos are taking up, I'm guessing at least 40% of people's idea
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.760]   of why they have this phone and what they use it for.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.800]   I don't think it's any accident that Apple is doing a complete floor to ceiling revamp
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.960]   of how their entire attitude towards photos cross platform because they know that this
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:23.000]   is a device that captures photos and is used to share photos with people in the analog
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.240]   way of saying, hey, man, I did you see this?
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.240]   Well, statistically statistically statistically.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.240]   You said right.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.240]   You said right.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.240]   Then I went back to it again.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.240]   Don't go back.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.960]   It is the number one use for your phone statistically photos.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.960]   Really?
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.160]   Yeah, they pulled all those.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.160]   There's search.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.200]   It's on a couple of different polls have shown that the number one thing people do with their
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   phone is take a picture with their smartphone.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.200]   I agree.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.200]   I think that's probably the number one thing I do.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.680]   I definitely do it a lot more than talking on talking.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.000]   My number one thing is staring at Twitter.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.920]   What's funny is they have battery shaming now on iOS 8.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.160]   God, see what apps use the most battery.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.040]   But it's not well explained yet.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.400]   For example, you can see a phone low signal or some app.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.960]   It's because there's a low signal.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.440]   It's ramping up the radio to try to get it.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.440]   That's understandable.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.160]   But if it says tweet bot or Twitterific is using excessive power, that might just be
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.720]   because you never put Twitter away.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.760]   It's not because it's being wasteful of energies.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.800]   It'd be nice if they made that apparent because Paul had died from tap lots who makes tweet
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.120]   bot is already prepping himself for a deluge of tech support when that goes live just because
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.440]   it's featured up there so much.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.000]   Are you sure statistically camera?
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.520]   I mean, I'm sure it's top five.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.520]   What about text messaging?
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.280]   Phone calls email social networks.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.920]   It's not measuring what people actually doing.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.680]   It's asking what do you do with your phone?
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.840]   Number one answer.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.840]   Take pictures.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.640]   So the family's view version of this calls are text because that's what you do with your
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.560]   phone and that's obvious.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.840]   The family feud version of this is photos number one answer.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.040]   Number one, survey says.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:07.280]   The line I heard from Apple is that they want to make photos sort of like the part of the
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.280]   EchorOS experience.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.360]   They believe they're important enough to everybody that it should be taken care of in
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.360]   a system level.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.800]   You should never have to worry about it.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.200]   And that's also why they're bringing photos to Mac.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.960]   They're not abandoning aperture or eye photo yet.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.240]   Those are still going to be in the Mac App Store.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.200]   They'll be pulled after photos from Mac launches and they'll have ways to migrate everything,
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.080]   including your edits and your captions and all that kind of stuff from aperture to photos.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.280]   But once that's launched, they really want it to be totally seamless from iOS device
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.800]   to Mac and photos will just be taken care of.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.200]   Steve C and Mike ER in our chatroom both point out that Snapchat would be considered photos.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.680]   That's certainly a big social.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.600]   Instagram is photos and that's big social.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.200]   Is the iPhone still the best camera out there?
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:55.240]   Don't some of the Nokia phones have for photos I think?
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:01.480]   My opinion is that it's a dead heat between a Nokia PureView camera and the iPhone 5S.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.960]   They're just really, really good at two different things.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.040]   iPhone 5S still has the best.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.040]   You see this button?
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.400]   Push it and it will take a really good picture.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.960]   That's the best solution of any phone that's out there.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:19.800]   The Nokia with PureView, the 1020 that I still have actually, I'm not buying it because
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.120]   it was just such a good thing to have in my pocket.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:28.080]   It has the advantage that it's the only phone that's a real phone that breaks through the
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.480]   limitations of phone photography.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.200]   With a 5S, there is still a binary state of either it's capable of taking a picture in
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.080]   the situation or it is not capable of taking a picture in the situation.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.920]   In low light, this is one of the Achilles heels of the iPhone I think because it goes
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:50.960]   into this weird separate mode where it just boosts up the power to the sensor.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.320]   It just all kinds of noise.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:59.000]   It will take a decent photo but very muddy and not very clear whereas the Nokia has an
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.720]   optical stabilization which is something that I really think the iPhone needs to have.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.720]   It also has a flash.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.040]   It has that more detailed sensor that uses an actual zoom.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:16.000]   Yes, it's a digital zoom but they kind of think where you can create an 8x10 print that
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.320]   you digitally zoom that looks like it was the native resolution.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.320]   All these other things where you can definitely come away with any scenario with a beautiful
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:29.000]   picture of your kid running around the room not blurred out like hell in a darkened room
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.360]   where it's not completely full of noise where you didn't have to get within 3 inches of
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.720]   the person in order to get their picture.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.040]   That's why I think it shares that stage with the Nokia.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:44.920]   Remember, in most cases, blowing these pictures up to big sizes.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.400]   Good enough is good enough.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:51.240]   Well, though, I think that the issue that you get into is definitely for Instagram and everything
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.360]   else that doesn't make any difference.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:58.040]   I think that I do consider when my kids are graduating something or competing something.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.040]   Bring a real camera.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.280]   I'm going to bring a real camera but if my lens was just a little bit better, I might
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.280]   be...
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.280]   We're close.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.720]   It's not the megapixels because...
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.720]   Nope.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.720]   I mean, you can do it.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.720]   It's fine.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.360]   But that is something worth considering.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.960]   You do have this phone in your pocket and that's going to be the camera that you're going
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:21.000]   to take so many great pictures of your kids growing up in the moment of your life with.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.640]   When I reviewed the HTC One and it has that 4 megapixel but bigger pixels, so better
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.160]   pictures, sort of camera, that's what I really dinged it for.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.320]   Maybe there's going to be a time, 10 years from now, where you wish you did not have
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.640]   this crummy Instagram resolution copy of this picture.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:44.560]   It's the same reason why I dinged Apple for not refusing to say that we could do it.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:49.480]   We could do video in this version of the iPhone but it would only be 15 frames per second
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.480]   video.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.640]   That's not good enough.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.400]   We are serving you by saying no, which is what we do very well.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.920]   And I'm sure that 20 years from now, people are not going to write a thank you letter
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:04.320]   to Apple saying, "You know, I don't have any video of my now 24 year old kids first
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.840]   step because I was there and I had the phone there and thank you because I realize now
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:13.600]   that if I had 15 frames per second video of this once in a lifetime moment, I would just
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.600]   be kicking.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.960]   I would be ashamed to show it to anybody.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.200]   So thank you for not putting that feature in."
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:23.360]   So that's why I think that you shouldn't settle for a camera phone that has poor performance
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.320]   because you've got my bites in the butt 10 or 20 years from now and you should really
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.760]   think about that sort of stuff.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.400]   I'm doing an experiment right now, my children, much like Facebook in an experiment on the
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.000]   last few months ago without telling us.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.680]   Both of them have broken their iPhones, right?
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.920]   So they are both.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.480]   They both are currently used because I'm not going to buy them a new iPhone now.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.920]   That'd be crazy talk.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.920]   Yes.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.160]   Although you can get a pretty good deal at Walmart apparently.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.720]   We'll talk about that.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:55.840]   So I gave him both Moto X's because I had two Moto X's and I'm not using them anymore.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.880]   And we'll see because the one thing Henry wanted, he wanted the new iPhone because he
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.360]   wanted slow-mo.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.880]   And the Moto X camera, by the way, crap.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.880]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.880]   Crap.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:14.360]   So if they say to me, "Oh, yeah, so far nobody has the pictures or, but I don't think they
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.480]   even notice because they're Snapchatting Instagramming.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.920]   Maybe in five years they'll be mad at me when they're...
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.360]   They're selfie-fine.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:27.160]   But I also look back at old pictures I've taken with my first digital camera.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.520]   And they're not look good either.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.360]   Those were three and four megapixels.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.360]   But I have them.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.360]   And they're okay.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.360]   Remember, I mean...
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.720]   Well, and I think that's one of the most important things about all of this is the fact that
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.880]   we have everything is so well documented now.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.720]   I mean, I use my camera half the time just to remember something.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.120]   Like, if someone hands me a business card, I immediately set it down and take a picture
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.120]   of it.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.120]   I don't care about the paper.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.120]   I just need to get that...
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.120]   Does it be good enough to do that?
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.320]   Yeah, that's be good enough to do that.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.920]   I mean, well, the thing is, is that for me, I guess the thing I'm constantly frustrated
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.440]   with is low-light performance is the number one thing.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.720]   I really like, you know, I have an HTC, the M8.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   If I'm taking pictures at parties, I almost always have that with me because I like the
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.320]   little soft... the soft tip of the field.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.320]   I like being able to adjust that.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.320]   That's cool.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.320]   I'm posting it.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.320]   It's just like...
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.920]   And I know that if I don't take it with that camera, it's going to be really a pain
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.320]   to get that effect back.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.400]   And I really like that effect.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.720]   And so that kind of stuff is worth it.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.960]   Is this an opportunity for Apple to really upgrade the camera and the iPhone 6 and just
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.760]   really knock us all on our asses?
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.160]   I would be very surprised if they do anything other than incremental.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.760]   I think it's an opportunity for Android makers to really like...
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.240]   I mean, HTC may not have hit it all the way out of the park, but continue to really do
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.240]   outrageous things.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:38.400]   And it got me to go buy an Android phone was a camera that did something other than just
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.600]   whatever other camera did.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.240]   Well, Apple has been hiring Lumia engineers.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.760]   So right now, Nokia and Lumia do great capture level photography.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.040]   Apple does great on-device processing level photography.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.320]   And Google does great server-side photo processing with their auto-awesome and things.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.320]   And no one's really crossed over those boundaries yet.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.120]   But Apple has been hiring those Lumia engineers.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.840]   There are rumors that they're actually going to increase the Z index.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.120]   So the camera comes a little bit out from the casing, which they've been reticent to do.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.640]   But cameras want depth and Apple wants to make thinner phones and those two things have
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.640]   constant tension.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.640]   Oh, good point.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.000]   So interesting to see what they're going to pull this time.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.160]   Yeah, Apple's go-to solution is always to...
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.640]   What can we normally to get this type of image quality, you would have to have the lens
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.840]   bump out a little bit.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:27.120]   You would have to have optical stabilization, magnetically stabilized, optical stabilizing
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.120]   lenses.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.560]   We're opening up with ways so that we can actually...
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.080]   Our solution to that is to put an even better processor and even better code into the phone.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.680]   So it's, quote, "not necessary."
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.400]   And sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:42.520]   But as we've been discussing so many people, they really don't think in terms of taking
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.640]   a picture that's so good, it can be your Christmas card photo or taking a picture that's so
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:49.480]   good that 20 years later, you will have absolutely no regrets that you shot it with a phone
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.720]   instead of going back into your bedroom and grabbing your camera out of the closet to
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.240]   take a picture with that instead.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.200]   So where is the motivation for them to really push the lens like that?
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:04.920]   That's why the Lumia 1020 is such an impressive camera because nobody was asking for 40 megapixel
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:10.120]   sensor, no one was asking for on camera flash, no one was asking for this simple thing where
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:15.000]   you can suddenly get access to every single manual control on the flight deck.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.520]   And yet they said, "No, we want to take the greatest pictures that you can ever take with
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.520]   a camera."
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.440]   And I swear, when I go through my flicker feed, sometimes I have to remind myself that
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.880]   no, that was not taken with my $500 micro four thirds camera.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.320]   This was taken with the Nokia with a damn phone, as I like to say.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.280]   So Apple must be very carefully balancing the need for a thinner phone with the need
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.480]   for a better camera.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.880]   I guess focusing on software.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.560]   The desire for a thinner phone.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.560]   Exactly.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.400]   You know, I would say their desire for thinner phone.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.400]   Mine's never.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.400]   You know, I always have a battery on it.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.840]   I don't really think about that.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.840]   You're right.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.840]   I have it.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.840]   The phone is so thin.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.840]   Does not.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.720]   Well, the phone fits so well into my battery pack that the thing is.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.800]   Isn't what they mean.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.640]   The thinness translates into weight and for them lighter is better.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.480]   That's why when everyone picked up the iPhone 5 said, "Oh, this feels so light.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.480]   It's not real."
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.040]   And that's what they were after and thinness is a side effect.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.200]   I think that's wrong too.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.600]   We got a Xiaomi here.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:14.560]   This is the big phone in China, the company that Hugo Barra left Google to go run.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.040]   This is the, now look at this.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.040]   The Xiaomi.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.640]   This, first of all, this is the company that's copying Apple, right?
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:23.160]   They even say one more thing in their presentations and everything.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.880]   This is the Mi 4, not the Mi 2.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:33.400]   So it feels very light and I thought it felt kind of cheesy because of that.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.960]   And by the way, that's because my MA, your MA as well, is a heavy phone.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.960]   Yeah, it is.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.440]   I don't think heavy is bad, especially if you get better battery life.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.000]   Yeah, I do feel it's my Scottie best.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   You do feel it in the front.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   You're like, "Whoa!"
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   I don't put something else in the other side.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.440]   I remember the guys are flirting my back.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.640]   There has to be a happy medium though between a phone that's so thin and light that it lasts
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:57.720]   10 seconds on battery and takes two pixel photos and something that is thick enough
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:02.480]   to stop an assassin's bullet if you keep it in your chest pocket.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.840]   It's like Alex was saying.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.840]   That's a good metaphor.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.720]   The family feud quiz.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:12.560]   I don't think there would be any people in that quiz would say, "If the question were,
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.360]   what do you want your next iPhone to have as a feature?"
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.520]   "Oh no, this is too thin.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.520]   This is too heavy.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.760]   It's probably not a complaint that's going to register on the board."
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.760]   No.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.840]   This has a customized Chinese android.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.920]   I just took a picture with it.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.200]   By the way, the screen on this is really nice.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.280]   It's fantastic, Jason says.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.280]   Amazing.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.280]   The picture is not great.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.360]   Partly that's because I'm kind of...
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.360]   That's a big thing.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.680]   It's the same cameras in the OnePlus.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.040]   Everybody's using the same sensors now.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.800]   In fact, everybody isn't Apple still using Sony sensors?
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.800]   The same kind of...
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.120]   I think the color is very good on that, don't you think, Alex?
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.120]   It's a little blurry.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.600]   You either moved or I moved.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.600]   I think...
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.200]   Yes, yeah, there's a little...
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.200]   But I think...
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.200]   That's all blurry.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.200]   It's satisfying.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.200]   It's okay.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.280]   I wouldn't use it anywhere though.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.280]   That's the problem.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.240]   For me, if it's a little blurry, that's the end of it.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.240]   Well, let me do another one.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.240]   Maybe it could just be me.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.280]   We're going to use it to remember Alex on set.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.280]   Okay.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.280]   I'll hold very still.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.280]   Stop moving.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.280]   Don't...
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.280]   This is pretend.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.280]   We're in...
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.280]   This is a...
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.640]   Are you hyperlapsing, Emilio?
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.840]   In the 1880s.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.840]   And I'm taking...
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.840]   You can't smile because you can't...
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.000]   Now that's much better.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   That's scary.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   That's scary, Alex.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Now see there...
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   You know what?
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Now the detail is very good on that.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.560]   I'm going to use that.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:38.360]   That is exactly like those 19th century pictures where the person is just so irked to have
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.000]   to say and still that's always the expression.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Exactly.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.240]   Edward Muybridge here.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.400]   I think that looks quite good.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.400]   The colors...
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.120]   You know, so there's a couple of things that Apple does really well.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.120]   One is color, right?
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.120]   Fidelity is excellent.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:58.120]   Tomapping and white balance are fantastic on every iPhone over the past two or three
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.120]   years.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.400]   That's something like...
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.120]   My daily carry is the Nexus 5.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.120]   I like it a lot.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.360]   The camera is good, but it's not great.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:11.440]   It's the sort of thing where I have to spend a few minutes in aperture fixing...
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.240]   Not fixing but improving.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.960]   And those three minutes amount to what I get when I just simply tap that one button on
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.960]   an iPhone.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.960]   Well, okay.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.960]   There's one area.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:26.400]   Now we are seeing Mac rumors is publishing pictures of the iPhone.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.240]   This is the 4.7 inch version.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.360]   Finally assembled.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.440]   And we're going back to the...
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.840]   I think these are accurate.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.720]   Renee Richie, you're my rumor-veter.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.240]   Historically, they have been accurate.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.840]   Fettle folk?
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.840]   You never know what Apple is doing as a prototype run or a test manufacturing run and what they
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:48.480]   change before final production, but historically these have been accurate.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.980]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:55.080]   It's back to the kind of rounded edges of the earlier iPhone.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.080]   Well, that's what we heard.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.200]   Like when iOS 7 came out, I heard that they were going to be making it rounder just because
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.400]   you start to have bezel gestures and things coming off the side and it feels more comfortable
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.640]   when it's round again.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.640]   This is a good...
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.800]   This is also from Mac rumors size comparison.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:14.280]   If they do in fact a 4.7 and a 5.5 compare the 5s all the way on the left of the iPad Air
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.640]   all the way on the right, I like that 5.5 inch.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.320]   That's feeling good to me.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.320]   John Gruber used the Pythagorean theorem.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.320]   And I...
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.120]   I'm sure he did it.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.560]   I'm sure he did a regular expression.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.560]   I'm just...
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.800]   He gripped it.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:41.800]   Well, in fact, Gruber's speculation is kind of not being borne out by iOS 8, you know,
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.800]   mitten.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.800]   It's hard to say because numbers don't mean what people...
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.200]   Numbers are easy to misunderstand.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.400]   They're very similar to statistics.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.400]   And I'd also...
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.680]   Dave Whiskis, who's John Gruber's partner on Vesper, he did a screenshot of Vesper using
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.280]   the dimensions that Gruber put out if he wanted to see what it actually looks like as in his
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.280]   Twitter timeline.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.800]   But the important thing, a lot of people talk about resolution, a lot of people talk about
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.440]   density, but for Apple neither...
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.680]   Those things are sort of byproducts.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:11.320]   What they care most about is tap target size because that's how people use their devices.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:16.920]   So for example, when they were making the iPad mini, they had to hit 7.9 about size.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.920]   And they...
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.120]   The only question about whether they could shrink the display down, the current iPad
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.120]   interface down was whether the tap target size was big enough.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.680]   It wasn't whether the resolution was this.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.120]   The Pixel count was that it was...
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:34.360]   Could human beings reliably consistently hit the buttons on that phone?
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.400]   And when they bring this up, it's not going to be a matter of like there will be technical
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.440]   things like there will be 3X, there will be densities, there will be super retina, all
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.440]   these technical terms.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.360]   But at the end of the day, Apple's going to make sure that on a 4.7 inch phone and a
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:50.480]   5.5 inch phone, you can easily hit the same 44 point button that you can hit on an iPhone
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.640]   today and everything else is going to be a byproduct of that.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.520]   And if that happens, a lot of developers are going to have to guess as to how that's going
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.880]   to feel, but it's not until they get a device in hand and they can actually put this code
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.960]   on those devices that they're going to realize what mistakes they've made and how they need
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.680]   to re-engineer this for this other screen size.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.600]   I don't think it's conceivable that you can have a true universal app.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.280]   You really do have to find to the interface for every screen that you anticipate you're
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.520]   going to have to hit.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:20.800]   So Gruber speculated doing the math.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.600]   He says, now this, he says, I have no information, but I have spent the last month trying to
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.240]   figure out pixel counts for the displays.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:33.200]   He finally comes to the conclusion that if you do a even multiple of existing displays,
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.880]   developers are going to hate you less.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:39.960]   So he predicts the 4.7 inch will be 1334 by 750.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:47.440]   That's double and 326 pixels per inch, which is a nice anything over 300 is, I think.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.120]   And we used to print resolution used to be that.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.480]   But even when we thought about, like, yeah, that's the current.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.680]   So that's you can't see the dots at a normal of doing it.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:04.960]   He said for the 5 inch, and I actually really like this, 2208 by 1242, much more than 1080p
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.120]   and 461 pixels per inch.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:11.560]   He says that's three times the, and put it in.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:15.960]   Just put that in perspective if that actually happened, that is higher than an art magazine.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.280]   It's beautiful.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.240]   His numbers are based on so for the 4.7 inch.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.360]   He's keeping the at 2x size of the current iPhone and increasing the pixel count.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.080]   There's two competing sort of preferences here.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.240]   Some people want everything to be bigger.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.600]   Like if you're hard of sight, you want the text to be bigger, the graphics to be bigger.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.800]   You want to have the space to see the same stuff only bigger scale.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.040]   And other people want more pixels.
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:40.720]   They want to be able to actually fit more stuff on the screen, keeping it the same size.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.880]   In the world of dynamic text and adaptive layout, maybe you'll be able to eventually
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.880]   choose.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.800]   But right now you've got to pick one of those things.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.960]   So for the 4.7 inch, he's saying that it's going to stay 2x.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.600]   So it's going to stay the same resolution, 326 pixels per inch.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.000]   They're just going to add pixels to it, much like they added pixels to make the iPhone
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.640]   5 4 inches instead of 3.5.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:04.240]   And then for the 5.5, instead of just adding pixels, they're also going to go to add 3x,
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:09.040]   which means what, you know, one point on the original iPhone back in 2007 is now divided
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.000]   up into three points, so a grid of nine pixels.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.160]   And that will mean that, you know, it's going to stay sharper when you get to those bigger
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:19.040]   sizes, but everything will also get bigger, almost like on an iPad Air.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.360]   It's bigger than the iPad Mini.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:25.440]   3x is a little bit more problematic for developers though, because 2x, everything still landed
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.680]   on the pixel grid.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.920]   One became two.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.560]   Now if one becomes three or three becomes one, then you start to fall off that grid.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.120]   And that's where things like aliasing happen.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.080]   So you don't get the clean edges anymore.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.680]   So there's a little bit of angst in the designer community already.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:41.200]   So would it be better instead of 3x to have 4x double double?
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.840]   It would, but that's such an obscene.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.920]   I'm not an exclusive kid even.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.640]   You know, when we think about those pixels, it's not just, it's not just the design of
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.640]   all of those.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.800]   It's also the display of those and the GPU required or whatever they're going to call
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.760]   it that's firing it to the screen.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.960]   I mean, I think that's one of the reasons that I really felt like the retina didn't really
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.120]   perform as well as it could have when it first came out was because the processing behind
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.840]   it didn't keep up with what they did with the pixels.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:05.840]   Retin attacks.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.840]   Right.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:12.200]   And then, and then there is iOS 8 evidence.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:19.280]   This coming from Mark Gurman 9 to 5 Mac in the new Xcode 6 beta 6.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:30.800]   And in the in the P lists in iOS 8 that there is an iPhone with a resolution of 414 by 736.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:38.480]   And there is a, I don't know, he's he's guessing or estimating.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.480]   I don't know.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.480]   I can't.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.480]   I can't parse this.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.840]   It's between Gruber and Gurman on Twitter.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.080]   If anyone wants to go.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.480]   Are they going back and forth?
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:50.960]   Yeah, because it's hard because points and pixels, you know, points are constant.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.400]   One point on the screen is a constant thing.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.400]   How many pixels that point is made out of can change original iPhone.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.040]   It was one pixel per point.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.880]   Now there's four to in each direction.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.640]   And you know, we're using Gruber's math article and Gurman's earlier reports, there'll be
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.640]   three.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.200]   So nine by nine making up each of those things.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.120]   So what those numbers mean is that, you know, 700 is that the total size of the screen
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:13.760]   is at the number of points, is that some half ratio for an iPad app for a half screen
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.760]   iPad app.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.760]   It's really hard to tell based just on Xcode.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.120]   There's just so many possibilities that those numbers can plug into.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:27.880]   I do have to say they use a, a website called is this retina, is this retina.com, which
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:33.640]   is kind of fun to play with all these possibilities and what it would look like, what the pixels
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.560]   per inch would be, etc, etc, etc.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:43.680]   So if you want to, you know, you can see what the existing resolutions are and, and then
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.680]   play with it a little bit.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.720]   So this would be a five S would be 11 becomes retina.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.160]   If you're more than 11 inches away, it's 325 pixels per inch.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.400]   It's a function of distance.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.920]   That's why an iPad Air is under 300 pixels per inch, but it's still quote unquote retina
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.160]   because you hold it further away.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.160]   Right.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.480]   iPad mini with retina display three 24.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:07.240]   It's kind of, this is actually kind of a useful calculator if you want to play with
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.240]   this a little bit.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.640]   But now we're getting into the same sort of malarkey we used to get into when we talk
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.040]   about CPU clock speed.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.040]   I know.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.440]   Where it's like, okay, this number is better than that number.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.440]   It's malarkey.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.480]   Unless you're betting money on which number was going to be bigger when both phones are
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.440]   released, it's more like, you know, what, what happens when you actually look at this
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.440]   thing?
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.040]   What kind of visual impact does it create?
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.200]   And I've got, I've got the tablets in my office that have just insane levels of detail.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.600]   Then I think, wow, this is really nice.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.600]   This is really great.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:39.440]   Then I will get out like my iPad Air, which has the quote inferior screen resolution.
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.200]   And I realized that no, I wasn't reacting to the detail I was reacting.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.200]   The fact that the screen brightness was a lot higher on this one or the way that this
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.560]   video was tuned.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.920]   So it's, it's an interesting debate, but it's, it's the sort of thing that Apple divorced
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.760]   itself from years ago, I think.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:57.280]   And we'll get to a point where the resolution is just high enough that no human can discern
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.200]   pixels and they'll be able to do what they did on the Mac.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.200]   And that is render it whatever size is easy for designers and then scale it down to whatever
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.200]   size fits the device.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.200]   That's what you want.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.200]   Right.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:10.720]   But really the key is that you want to make sure that you scale it high enough so that
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:15.400]   it can be detected by analysts.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.400]   But that's what you want.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.400]   Don't you?
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.400]   You want high DPI.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.400]   And then these are all fine.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.960]   Well, I think we're getting to a point, anything over 300 DPI I think is, is great.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.600]   I mean, I, I, I, it's what you've been looking at in magazines for a long time.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.680]   I don't know if it, I have a hard time believing it needs to get any higher than that.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.840]   So when we start seeing 400 500, I mean, this gets into that whole, that's what your
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.840]   I made is for 25.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.840]   Right.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.840]   But I mean, it doesn't matter.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.800]   I mean, it doesn't, at that point, you're.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.480]   The Android devices are using a conventional squishy.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:46.400]   They're using 1080p or they're using 2k and it's just easy if everyone buys the same
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.400]   panel size.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.400]   Right.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.120]   So if they're going to make that then any manufacturer can get it and they'll be different
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.000]   technologies, but at least they're a standard.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.360]   Apple has not so far in iOS device history stuck to any standard resolution.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.880]   So they can make anything they want.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:06.000]   But you did see, I'm sure you did the Android fragmentation graphic that was generated by
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   open signal.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.800]   And of course, there's the fragmentation of different Android devices, but this is the
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.240]   various Android screen sizes.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.960]   But you're making good point.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.960]   That is deceptive because if they're 1080p, doesn't matter what the screen size is, the
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.760]   resolution is fixed.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.760]   Right.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.200]   And their whole system is so different anyway with fragment is it's not the same kind of
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.680]   design part at all.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:31.320]   And fragmentation is to Android fear and certainty is doubt as compatibility used to be for Macintosh
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.400]   fear and certainty and doubt.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:37.520]   If you want to make a BS argument that will scare somebody off, there are a lot of reasons
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.440]   to not get Android, but fragmentation is not one of them.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.120]   It's the opposite side of flexibility.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.920]   If you want to have a bunch of different devices, then the price for that is a little bit of
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.280]   extra work for developers.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.680]   You want only one device, then you can have everything nice and consistent.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.360]   But you know, some people want more than one kind of thing.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.560]   Well, and that's the funny thing about using the word fragmentation.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.800]   You could show the same graphic and say, Android choice.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.560]   And then say, oh, wow, look at all the choices I have.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:06.480]   So yes, it's fragmentation and orch.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:10.200]   It's like, it's also, yeah, that's that's that is always been the defining difference,
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.000]   I think between Android and iOS.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.120]   It's someone who's very, very smart and thinks a lot about this will make all the decisions
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.120]   for you.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.120]   And that works out great.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:22.720]   Or you can basically have about 12 to 18 different rational options and pick the one
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.520]   that you like, which also it has its strengths.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.800]   So, so as always on a non-newsday, we've ended up spending 45 minutes talking about
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   nothing.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.120]   We're not done.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:36.240]   There's more about nothing coming up in just we're going to speak.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.400]   We're going to speak more and more about lesson lessons and we're talking completely about
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.000]   nothing.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.920]   I love it when we're about get all you know, just days away from an apple.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.640]   And we haven't even started talking about Lena Dunham's Emmy dress.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.640]   When are we talking about that?
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.120]   Was she wearing a tutu?
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.120]   Was that a tutu?
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:58.440]   Bravo for anybody who wears something different.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:02.200]   Sometimes though, you see a dress that you wonder if it's intentionally provocative.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.480]   It's like if it's oh, you know what?

[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.860]   So I'm just going to watch this five minutes about how to use this new tool in Photoshop
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.260]   that I haven't seen before or you know that's the.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.220]   Some of this by the way, we're focusing on how it's good for your work, but some of it's
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:44.740]   just good because you're interested in learning like I always I don't have any reason to use
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.860]   to do typography, but I've I'm fascinated by it.
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:54.980]   So I would you know, learning typography from a professional typographer is just awesome.
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.220]   You know, they have great classes and that kind of thing.

[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.260]   They have classes on that.
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:07.740]   So it doesn't just have to be to get, you know, better, deep McClellan's techniques on Photoshop
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:08.740]   and illustrator.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:09.740]   Deaks great.
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:10.740]   I love him.
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:14.060]   Pixel playground with Bert Monoroy and on and on and on.
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:15.060]   I'm sorry.
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.060]   I am going on and on and on.
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:21.100]   Linda LYNDA.com/MacBreak.
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:25.420]   Should I run over to Walmart and get a 5C for Henry for 97 cents?
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.420]   Holy smokes.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:27.420]   Holy moly.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:28.420]   An iPhone 5S 79.
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:29.420]   Sorry?
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:32.140]   It's a contract that comes with it.
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.860]   It's not the upfront price.
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:34.860]   Damn.
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:36.260]   There's always a there's always a catch.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:37.260]   I said, I get some.
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.260]   I get some.
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:39.260]   Change from a balla.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:44.020]   Actually, that raises the issue that will this new iPhone be more expensive?
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:48.420]   Some are saying you may see it be, you know, 900 bucks.
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:52.300]   The theory is that the iPad Air is a hundred bucks more expensive than the iPad Mini.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:56.100]   So if Apple has two sizes of iPhone, the one that's bigger could theoretically be, you
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.020]   know, some number, maybe a hundred dollars more than the one that's smaller.
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:02.380]   But I think a loaded iPhone 5 now is or $1,000.
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:03.380]   Is $1,000.
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:04.380]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.740]   So you could go there.
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:07.740]   Yeah.
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:08.740]   Yeah.
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:09.740]   I've been there.
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.380]   I mean, like Apple has a people get upset because Apple charges a hundred bucks for
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:16.380]   the difference in storage, which is ludicrous because storage doesn't cost that much.
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.300]   But what Apple realizes is that there's there's only certain things people will actually
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:23.020]   pay more money for and screen size is something they've been trying on the iPad now.
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.260]   So it's a bigger screen.
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.260]   That's worth more money to.
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.260]   Okay, great.
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:29.340]   So they have one that they sell at lower margins, one they sell at higher margins and
[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:31.660]   hopefully in the middle is what everybody actually buys.
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.940]   It's a typical sort of marketing thing.
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:39.300]   But I think one thing that you often see is that Apple buyers oftentimes do buy the more
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.300]   expensive ones.
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.780]   I mean, when you look at the trajectory of what gets sold out and maybe they just make
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.940]   less of them, but usually it's hard to get the iPhone that's hard to find the top of
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.900]   the line ones.
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.620]   They seem to go very quickly, at least in the early days.
[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:53.380]   I don't know if that might apply.
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:57.780]   Remember, we're talking about one model that has just different capacity options, the different
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:00.420]   options like that.
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:05.260]   I think that most of the people who buy iPhones aren't quite so locked into the idea of getting
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.340]   an iPhone or even getting a premium phone.
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:12.460]   I really do think there are people who come in expecting to spend $199 on a two year contract
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:16.220]   phone and then buying whichever one strikes their fancy the best that seems to have covered
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:17.780]   all the bases that they want.
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:23.060]   So I do, I think that's the whole reason why they came out with the iPhone 5C to begin
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:24.340]   with, that they can't.
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:29.180]   There's less, there's more room to play at the lower end of the higher end at this point.
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:33.220]   But I think that if they came up with a larger screen phone and they charged $100 extra for
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:37.580]   it, I think they would definitely get it because they wouldn't be selling it as a jumbo sized
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:41.700]   phone, which is really the only way that Samsung can sell the Galaxy Note.
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:46.820]   They would sell it as something between a phone and an iPad and they would find no shorter
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.740]   people who want that.
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:53.580]   We've been horny for a larger screen phone since 2012 at least.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:57.820]   There is a lot of pent up anxiety and there are a lot of people who are going to like,
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:02.140]   "Son, I'm taking your mannees jar full of lawn care tip money.
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.100]   I'll get it back to you in a couple of months.
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.140]   Daddy needs 5.5 inches of phone."
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:08.980]   All right, well how about this?
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:17.580]   Bloomberg now, just now reporting that Apple is preparing a 12.9 inch iPad for early 2015.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:22.420]   They've been working on that for a while.
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.020]   There's some thinking, I don't know if this is going on in Apple or not, but there is
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:29.820]   some thinking that right now people have a four inch iPhone and the iPad Mini is really
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.820]   popular.
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:35.540]   But when the iPhone goes to 4.7 and 5.5 inches, what will that do to the iPad Mini because
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:38.300]   that phone now is really close to the iPad Mini size?
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:42.060]   So will that cannibalize the iPad Mini a little bit or will it push people back towards the
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:46.060]   iPad Air because now they have something that's large that they can travel with.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:48.420]   Maybe traveling with the iPad won't be as big a deal anymore.
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:52.460]   Maybe having one at home will be more important and then we'll, what if they have a 13 inch
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:53.460]   iPad at home?
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:54.460]   Is that even better?
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:57.740]   So before you went from two small devices and now there's a possibility we'll go to two
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:58.740]   larger devices.
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:01.820]   I think that they give up the religiousness about no keyboard.
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.860]   I mean, someone can build a keyboard, but I think that Apple really ought to think about.
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.820]   I mean, I want to have something that's really as a business traveler.
[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:09.660]   I really want something that's operational.
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.780]   You know, if I'm going to get something that's that big.
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:13.900]   Does the surface, I mean, I look at the surface as.
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:14.900]   The surface as.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:15.900]   It does.
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:16.900]   It does.
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:20.740]   I look at those ads and I look at Photoshop on a surface and I, you know, the Photoshop
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:24.340]   ad has been very effective with me thinking not so much that I want to surface yet, but
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.700]   that I really want Apple to build something that's really a computer that I can touch,
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.900]   you know, and having the mixture of those things.
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:34.700]   I think would be very compelling and I'm hoping that we, a bigger one means they're
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:35.940]   kind of bringing that together.
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:36.940]   Those ads.
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:37.940]   I agree.
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:38.940]   I agree.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.820]   100% because I really feel as though I need something between the, something a little
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.700]   bit more than an iPad, a little bit less than a MacBook.
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:49.700]   And if Apple were to create a third and given all the things we're seeing about iOS 8,
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:53.020]   about how it's going to solve a lot of the problems of people like me who try to use
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:58.660]   an iPad, a full size iPad as a business travel computer that G. I don't want to have, I
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.780]   don't need to have nine overlapping windows, but it'd be nice to be able to have two things
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.100]   side by side.
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.780]   One, one in a small tile, one in a larger tile.
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:10.620]   It'd be nice if things, if apps work together a little bit more harmoniously, if they have
[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:14.740]   a 13-inch screen that not only would accommodate that kind of stuff with what's extra real
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:20.620]   estate, but also if they simply said, we're not going to create something as vulgar as
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:26.700]   an attached keyboard like we see on the surface, but we'll put mounting points inside this
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:31.500]   so that, so that's to make it really, really easy to make really, really cool integrated
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:35.340]   keyboards that make it look like a super, super slick notebook.
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:39.540]   The only question in my mind is which, I think they would have to delete something for the
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:44.980]   MacBook Airline to avoid the, again, Samsung, Samsung, the product line.
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:49.460]   They don't just simply, you know, spray a hose into the market, into the marketplace and
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:53.740]   say, "Pick up off the floor the device that you want and then come here and pay me for
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:54.740]   it."
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:58.540]   It is always, we have decided which three we want to sell you, pick one of these three.
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:04.060]   I think that in some ways that the 12.9 could be that where we really see this merger of
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:09.100]   the two OS's, you know, at some point where there are, where I can really run some of
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.100]   those things.
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.500]   Because, I mean, for me, it's, you know, my 11-inch, the way I use my 11-inch, I look
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:16.940]   at it and I think I could, this could be an iPad if I just felt like I could do what
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:21.100]   I do with that 11-inch, you know, on a plane, mostly.
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:26.140]   This is the, I actually point out, Microsoft does not compare the Surface to an iPad.
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:27.540]   They compare it to not anymore.
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:29.940]   Yeah, they compare, I mean, because of the cost.
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:32.140]   Well, also, they were unsuccessful.
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:33.140]   Well, they were unsuccessful.
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:34.140]   Yeah.
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:40.700]   Mostly because the price, I mean, you're talking $1,200, $1,300 for a Surface Pro with
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:41.700]   a keyboard.
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:45.140]   I mean, they try, they were totally unsuccessful in marketing it against the iPad, so now they're
[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.140]   trying to MacBook Air.
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:50.420]   And that's the only concern I have is that Microsoft has not been able to prove that enough
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.260]   people want this as a product category.
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:56.020]   Maybe Apple could, but so far, it's like either they didn't do it right or it doesn't exist.
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.780]   And I'm not sure which one that is yet.
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:58.780]   Yeah.
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:50:59.780]   I feel like you just-
[00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:00.780]   I feel like you just-
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:01.780]   Go ahead.
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:04.420]   Or they have customers that really want something very similar to whatever the last
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:05.420]   thing that they had is.
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:09.900]   I don't think that Windows users are nearly as adventurous as Mac people and they're not
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:13.500]   willing to deal with a phone that doesn't do cut and paste for a year, no matter how
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:17.780]   good and how clearly the next thing the first iPhone was.
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:21.980]   Well, I think for Microsoft, their market we always have to remember is so big that all
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:24.460]   they really have to do is retention.
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:25.460]   You know, and they make it-
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.460]   They are the hot butcher of the world, literally.
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:28.460]   Sorry, not literally.
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.460]   They are the hot butcher of the world.
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:37.360]   Figured to their role of serving the business needs of people who just need to keep the
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.340]   gears of industry greased and turning.
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:40.340]   Right.
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:45.780]   You see Steve Palmer after he left Microsoft did a marathon of The Good Wife, watched 100
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:47.860]   episodes of The Good Wife in two weeks.
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:48.860]   I just love to say.
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:49.860]   Steve Palmer.
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:50.860]   Why?
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:51.860]   Because he-
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:52.860]   Why would you do that?
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:53.860]   Sounds like a man who's doing it.
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:54.860]   He's severely depressed.
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:55.860]   Why?
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:56.860]   Don't understand.
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:57.860]   100 episodes of The Good Wife.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:58.860]   Or maybe because he-
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.100]   Now, Homeland, I understand.
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:01.740]   24, I understand.
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:02.900]   The Good Wife, I don't.
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:03.900]   I don't go on.
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:04.900]   You don't want the Palmer watching 24.
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:06.900]   We just not end well, right?
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:10.300]   Think about the first day you had when like maybe you were in the world.
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:15.420]   You were 18 or 19 or 2021, your first day where I'm not in school.
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:16.420]   I'm not in college.
[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:20.620]   For the first time since I was four years old, I can do whatever I want with this one
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:21.620]   day.
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:22.620]   Did you do-
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.780]   Did you see- I'm going to seize this day by the horns and be productive and make good-
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:26.780]   No.
[00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:30.620]   It was like, no, I'm going to enjoy the fact that I can just sit all day and do this and
[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:32.020]   watch my hands doing this.
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:35.380]   Because for the first time, this can be number one on my agenda.
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:39.940]   So good for him after being a CEO for the most abuse, one of the most abused CEOs for
[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:44.820]   the past 20 years, that he can now say, "If I just want to sit on this sofa and have
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:50.660]   pizza delivered and watch a marginal series, simply because I don't have to solve anybody's
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:52.820]   problem or be anybody's whipping boy."
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.980]   You're not going to have bomber to kick around anymore.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:59.020]   They don't mention a bong in this story, but I have to think the bong was involved.
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:02.020]   100 hours in two weeks, 50 hours a week-
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:03.020]   100 hours in a week.
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:05.460]   That's a whole-time job.
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:08.100]   More than a full-time job.
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.260]   That's part-time at the Pick School.
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:10.260]   50 hours a day.
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:14.580]   I just watched all the Doctor Who, so I can't say anything.
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.580]   That's a lot of-
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:17.660]   How many Doctor Who did you watch?
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:18.660]   The modern eras.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:23.260]   I watched seven seasons waiting up to the new episode last week.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:26.260]   A lot of Doctor Who I speak a little bit British now.
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:27.620]   Sorry, so sorry.
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:30.500]   I have a lot of catching up to do.
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:33.100]   When I get fired from this job, I will watch.
[00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:34.540]   When you fire yourself?
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:36.260]   When I fire myself.
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:37.740]   Which I'm about to do, by the way.
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:41.260]   I'm just fed up with myself.
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:42.780]   Battery problems with iPhones?
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.260]   There is a replacement program if you're having them.
[00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:48.500]   I do remember that some iPhones just-
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:52.940]   We have a couple of those on our company that actually have problems with their iPhones
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:54.260]   dying very quickly.
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:58.500]   A very small percentage of units may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to
[00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:02.500]   be charged more frequently, like every hour.
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:07.140]   But the good news is there's a support website you can go to.
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:11.620]   The iPhone 5 battery replacement site and you can go and enter your serial number and
[00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:15.180]   see if this is essentially a recall.
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:20.300]   You know, when the trade press is very nice to Apple because they could really have that
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.940]   big headline.
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:25.860]   Apple recalls iPhone 5 for battery problem.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:26.860]   And that would be bad.
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:32.180]   These recalls almost always are not always, but almost always a small percentage.
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:35.620]   But it's still millions, trying millions of people that have to sell a lot.
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:42.260]   It's iPhone 5 sold between September 2012 and January 2013 for just one quarter.
[00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:44.820]   And there is a limited serial number range.
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:50.740]   So you have to go and get your serial number and enter it in and see if you qualify.
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:52.540]   But if you, you know, it's worth doing it.
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:56.660]   If you've been noticing how bad is it the bad battery life?
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.540]   I know that I'm complaining about mine all the time.
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:00.540]   But that's normal.
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:02.740]   That I can play about my battery.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:03.740]   Yeah.
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:04.740]   I feel like my bad.
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:05.740]   It's a phone.
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:06.740]   Is it a five?
[00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:07.740]   It's a five, right?
[00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:08.740]   It's a five.
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:09.740]   That's what I have.
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:13.100]   And I feel like this is the worst battery I've ever had in a phone.
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:14.100]   But like what?
[00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:15.740]   How soon do you charge it?
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:17.500]   I'm just constantly plugging it in.
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:18.500]   I think you should go there.
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.740]   It's like, I'm just not normal.
[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:23.140]   It's just like, and I don't know.
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:29.260]   I mean, some days it'll go ironically, not ironically, interestingly enough, different
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:32.340]   locations I find it to be very, very different.
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:38.380]   So in Pennsylvania, which I just move to the last a lot longer than it does in San Francisco.
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:41.380]   I understand a little radio hunting, but it's.
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.380]   Do you have it with you?
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:43.860]   Yeah, I'm going to check it right now.
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:44.860]   Let's let's let's enter it in here.
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:45.860]   I was in New York last week.
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.540]   My battery drained in front of my eyes is because roaming is so terrible.
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.420]   Yeah, New York and I'll do it for you.
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:56.780]   You go to the settings general and you'll see the about section and then you'll find
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:57.780]   your serial number in there.
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.580]   Let's just do that right now.
[00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:00.580]   The only thing is the other one.
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:01.580]   You're doing that.
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:02.580]   Go ahead.
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:03.580]   I'm sorry, Alex.
[00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:04.580]   You don't want to say that loud?
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:05.580]   No, I'm paranoid.
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:07.380]   What people will like, I don't know.
[00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:08.700]   I don't know what you look.
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:09.700]   I don't know what you're going to do.
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:12.920]   If you turn off Facebook auto refresh and a bunch of other Facebook stuff, you might
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:13.920]   get double the battery life.
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:14.920]   I always turn.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:19.020]   I in fact, I have now started deleting Facebook from my mobile devices and just say I'm going
[00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:22.100]   to do it on the desktop because it is notoriously a battery.
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.100]   A Facebook Skype.
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:24.540]   There's a few bad quotes.
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:25.540]   Yeah.
[00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:28.780]   And that's why sorry you're not eligible.
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:29.780]   It's not our record show.
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:32.980]   Your battery has already been replaced or it's not one of the.
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:33.980]   In fact, fine.
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:35.380]   I do use Facebook.
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.780]   So take it off, but I like it.
[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:39.780]   No, no, but don't do it on your phone.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:40.780]   Do it on the desktop.
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:41.780]   I like it on my phone.
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:43.780]   I don't want to use Facebook on my desktop.
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:44.780]   I don't want to use Facebook on my desktop.
[00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:46.980]   I auto refresh stuff and then it'll still update when you go to the app, but it will
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:47.980]   always be turning in the back.
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:53.220]   I have the auto refresh off on Facebook and I the.
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:56.660]   You don't want to when they first released the Facebook app, I was like, this is stupid.
[00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:58.340]   Why would you ever use it on this on the little phone?
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:00.660]   And now I don't even I never go to Facebook.
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:01.820]   I have a problem.
[00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:02.820]   You should stop.
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:04.860]   Oh, I don't go that often.
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:06.500]   I just that's what I that's where I look at Facebook.
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:07.500]   What are you looking for?
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.260]   I'm just looking at stupid things.
[00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:11.100]   Mostly I mostly ice bucket challenges.
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.100]   Stupid things.
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:14.300]   That's like when I need to relax.
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:15.300]   Just look at Facebook.
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:18.020]   I did a nice book of challenge for an iPhone last week.
[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:19.820]   I felt bad about myself, but I did it.
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:21.100]   You did it for an iPhone?
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:25.100]   Well, so Samsung put up that commercial where they showed a Galaxy S5 doing the ice bucket
[00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:27.900]   challenge and challenging the eye challenging the iPhone.
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:31.660]   And it offended me as a product marketer because it was it wasn't very creative, but
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.660]   also it didn't ice bucket challenge.
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:37.220]   And this is a waterproof phone in a way that any normal phone could survive.
[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:40.660]   I mean, if they'd thrown it in a bucket ice water, that would have been fine game over,
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:43.460]   but they kind of just poured ice water on the top and none of the ports were visible
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:44.460]   and nothing else.
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:48.980]   And I looked at it and I said, I'm fairly sure an iPhone would be perfectly fine doing
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:49.980]   that.
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:52.980]   So I wanted to see if it would be and turns out it was perfectly.
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:58.100]   Excuse me, chills, I've had such bad experiences doing stuff like that.
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:01.460]   Remember I'm the one to put an iPhone in a glass of water.
[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:02.460]   How'd that work?
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:03.460]   Not well.
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:07.220]   I then I brought it because it stopped working, right?
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:08.420]   This was I was testing liquid pelle.
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:12.820]   You remember this liquid pelle was that thing that you that they process your phone and
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:13.820]   then it magically resisted.
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:14.820]   Right, right.
[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:15.820]   It didn't it didn't survive.
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:17.820]   But then so then I brought it to the iPhone repair place.
[00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:21.060]   He says, I've never seen anything like this.
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:24.820]   He replaced all the components and he said, look at your sim tray.
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:29.140]   There's even burn marks from short circuiting on your sim tray.
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.460]   I mean, this is nothing.
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:31.660]   It could get it back.
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:36.340]   And then I brought it to the Apple store and the guy says, I saw what you did.
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:37.340]   The mark.
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:40.180]   The video in the chat room.
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:43.060]   I saw what you did.
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:44.420]   Two hundred bucks to replace it though.
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:45.420]   That was nice of him.
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:46.420]   You didn't have to do that.
[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:49.820]   That was the genius being nice to me.
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:50.820]   Let's take a break.
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:51.820]   Come back with more.
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:53.940]   We've got there you go.
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:54.940]   Ice bucket challenge.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:55.940]   That's you Renee?
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:57.740]   Yeah, that's my iPhone.
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:00.940]   I guess you have phones to the the iPhone nominate Renee.
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:03.100]   My challenge Samsung's design team.
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:05.780]   Oh, you are you even serrated in response.
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:10.140]   Yeah, I challenge the I was I kind of regret that by challenge the Samsung design team.
[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:12.140]   And then at the end I said, if they have one.
[00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:14.620]   Oh, oh, snack.
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:16.940]   So what's snack?
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:17.940]   Snap.
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:22.380]   I was trying to adopt the vernacular of the younger generation.
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:23.380]   Smack.
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:26.460]   Don if it didn't smack my little backside.
[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:29.060]   Oh, gauntlet throne.
[00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:33.140]   Leo, your face looks marvelous.
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:38.580]   You might think I'm applying a very lovely face cream to myself here.
[00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:42.860]   But in fact, any Rogers act.
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:47.620]   This is in Las Vegas brings to you the Kenny Rogers experience.
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:50.940]   This is the I got I hope there's a razor in this.
[00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:55.460]   Oh, this is the Harry's shave cream, which is like a.
[00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:56.780]   Oh, it smells so good.
[00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:57.980]   It's magnificent.
[00:59:57.980 --> 00:59:58.980]   You use it?
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:01.940]   Yeah, they sent me one and it's it's all natural.
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:03.260]   It smells great.
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:05.180]   And the unboxing experience is positively.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.180]   Yeah, it's Apple.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.180]   How are you using it?
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.180]   What do you mean?
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:09.660]   I shave once in a while.
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:10.660]   Okay.
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:11.660]   All right.
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:12.660]   Everybody has to shave some part of their body.
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:13.660]   Right.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.260]   This has natural Marula, which I don't know what that is.
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:19.340]   Apparently people do and coconut oils.
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:21.740]   Marula is like a nut, I think.
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.140]   And then oh, it smells so good.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:26.220]   And then watch because now this is this is the proof is in the pudding.
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:29.140]   I I'm not even using any water.
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:33.460]   I'm just I did not prepare my beard in any way for this shave.
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:34.820]   He's not even cutting himself.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:35.820]   There's very dangerous.
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:40.860]   I have used I've been using Harry's razors now for and blades for a I don't know, six
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:44.060]   or seven months and I have never cut myself not once.
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.060]   How about that build quality?
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:46.060]   Look at that handle.
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:50.660]   You know what part of the secret to Harry's is the guys who started Harry's.
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:53.980]   Jeff was one of the guys who started Warby Parker.
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:58.780]   He did a lot of research before he did the startup and he said what makes a great razor
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:02.460]   blade and he and he actually found out that there's only two factories in the world,
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:07.860]   both of them in the same small town in Germany that can make a razor blade this perfect.
[01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.300]   Most companies by the way do not want you to have great razor blades.
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.060]   They want you to keep buying more, right?
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.660]   And so they actually bought the company.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:16.660]   That's why I do it.
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:17.660]   They bought the factory.
[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:20.980]   They made so much money with Warby Parker that we decided to buy the all the razors.
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:21.980]   Well, I don't know.
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:24.740]   No, I think they took investment money.
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:31.820]   So the idea was just like Warby Parker, they wanted to kind of use the internet to disenfranchise
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:33.660]   the really established monopolies.
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:35.140]   I mean, you look at Gillette.
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:37.740]   It's just the other day at the drugstore.
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:39.660]   You can't actually buy it.
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:44.740]   You have to get a clerk to come over and unlock it because the blades are so damn expensive.
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:50.580]   I spent $60 on Gillette blades because I wanted to do a head to head comparison.
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:51.580]   And I did.
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:54.460]   I shaved one half of my face with the Gillette, one half with the Harry's.
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:55.460]   And it was amazing.
[01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:56.740]   Very different.
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:57.740]   You wouldn't think there'd be a difference.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:58.740]   Look at that.
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:03.300]   I have just shaved entirely without water just using that great Harry's shave.
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:05.900]   And it's soft, like a hovercraft for your face.
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:09.180]   It is like a with blades.
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.180]   I like it.
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:11.820]   Go to Harry's.com.
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.220]   The way they do it is every other month you get a delivery.
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:17.900]   So I get four tubes of the shave cream every other month and eight blades.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.660]   Once a week I change my blade.
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:20.660]   And it's perfect.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:24.980]   And it's just fabulous that you can get the Winston kit, which is this one I'm using.
[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:25.980]   It's got the nice metal handle.
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:29.780]   And of course I had it monogrammed Leo.
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:33.980]   Heather Haman got one for her dad, my phone screener on the radio show.
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:36.860]   And because it already has an H for Harry's on it, she said I'm going to leave it at that
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:38.860]   because Haman, right?
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:43.300]   So if your name begins with an H, you don't need to get the monogram.
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:45.660]   It's a little pro tip.
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.580]   It's got an H on it already.
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:48.580]   H apostrophe.
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:49.980]   See Harry.

[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:03.700]   They also have the Truman kit.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.580]   That's actually the one Steve Gibson wanted because he, for some reason he just liked
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:08.300]   that orange handle or something.
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.020]   I don't remember why.
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:13.500]   Stop, not because he was cheap, but it is less expensive.
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:14.820]   Get the kit for 15 bucks.

[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.460]   I just shave with her kit.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:42.300]   Should have read the inscription before I did that.
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.060]   And thank you Harry's for your support of Mac break.
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:45.060]   We went at it.
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:50.340]   I just shaved no water on air enough for Leo made for a second feel that.
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:53.660]   No, that's all right.
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.220]   Did you you you were in Pittsburgh for the earthquake?
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:58.180]   You didn't feel the earthquake in Montreal.
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:03:59.180]   I missed it.
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:00.180]   No, I saw your tweet about it.
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:01.180]   That's why I found out about it.
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:02.180]   I tweeted it.
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:03.180]   In fact, that was the interesting thing.
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:04.660]   I woke us up.
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:06.020]   Those of us in the Bay Area.
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:09.460]   I was actually strong only about 30 miles from here in Napa.
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:13.900]   And I leapt from the bed and shouted earthquake.
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:15.700]   As one does as one one.
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:17.260]   As one does in California.
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.260]   We're trained.
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:21.740]   It's actually a class when you when you come to California, we show you how to jump out
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:23.100]   of your bed and how to say earthquake.
[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:26.460]   I thought kind of dopey afterwards, but that's that's what I did.
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:29.380]   And then I get back in bed and and this is the this is it.
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:34.260]   This is me in the next four hours because you can't go back to sleep after a big earthquake.
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:35.260]   Right.
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:37.620]   Twitter and it went it did it went crazy.
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:38.700]   I got a lot of text messages.
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.700]   Are you okay?
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:40.700]   I'm like, I'm just fine.
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:43.900]   I'm standing over a lake in Pennsylvania.
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:44.900]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:48.020]   So it didn't it didn't affect us here in the brick house.
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.260]   We just want to pass that along.
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:50.260]   Everybody's fine.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.620]   You have our employees had any trouble.
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:52.620]   Nothing fell.
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:55.540]   Many of our friends who are vendors had problems in Napa.
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:57.580]   A lot of wine lost.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:58.580]   But I love this.
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:04.980]   Do you wear actually I have I mixed feelings about this the job on published a graph of
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:10.100]   their users and you'll see the red line is Modesto Santa Cruz very far away.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:12.580]   They barely woke up.
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:17.740]   The blue line is the folks in Napa Sonoma, which is where we are Vallejo and Berkeley.
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:21.380]   74% of them woke up immediately.
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:23.500]   And then it's a little lower number.
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:27.900]   But you know, my takeaway from this is wait a minute, they're aggregating my sleep data
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:30.420]   at job on these are job on upwares.
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:33.620]   Oh, these are all right.
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:36.260]   So apparently just a little tip.
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:38.620]   They're aggregating your data.
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:39.900]   I'm sure it's anonymous.
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.900]   That's what everyone always says.
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:46.980]   I was curious about drop cam users who have their cameras set to automatically record
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:48.060]   remember the tech movement.
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:51.140]   So I was wondering what kind of traffic they were getting between those cameras and the
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:52.140]   servers during that time.
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:53.140]   Oh, I bet.
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:06:00.140]   Well, we have I have the video you want to see our video of where was it?
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:01.140]   I have it.
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:03.100]   John sent me a link.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:04.100]   It's not very dramatic.
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:06.420]   I'll be honest with you.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:07.660]   Like a big truck road bike.
[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:08.660]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:14.020]   In fact, you have to really look hard to see anything anything happening.
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:15.020]   You got it?
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:16.020]   There it is.
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:17.940]   This is the thank you, Chad.
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:18.940]   Get ready.
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:20.020]   Oh, the excitement's beginning.
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:21.020]   That's it right there.
[01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:22.220]   See the disco ball?
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:23.660]   A slight tremor.
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:27.860]   Yeah, but you know, that's that's enough.
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:28.860]   We have a puzzle though.
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:29.860]   This is the mystery.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:30.860]   Oh, this.
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:31.860]   Oh, watch this one.
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:36.380]   It's really bad because the camera is just sitting there.
[01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:38.380]   Oh my God.
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:39.380]   Earthquake.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:43.740]   Oh, he's playing on the start.
[01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:47.100]   But that really it wasn't you can see the little lamb on the camera going a little bit
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:48.100]   like that.
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:51.820]   So even though it was a strong earthquake, 6.0 and we weren't very far from it.
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:52.820]   It wasn't.
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:54.540]   We're glad you're all safe and sound.
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:07:00.540]   We're all safe and sound and maybe you want to consider if you're wearing a jawbone up.
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:02.700]   This is this is the mystery one, by the way.
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.620]   This is my office and watch a light comes on and then goes off.
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:11.380]   Okay, so now that light came on the minute it started shaking and then a minute stops
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:14.420]   shaking about 20 seconds later.
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:15.420]   Light goes off.
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:21.940]   Is it a you do have a motion detecting light?
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:23.700]   We cannot we still right, Burke?
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.420]   We still have no idea what happened.
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:30.660]   Burke has a theory that I find far fetched that the light switch that's attached.
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:33.020]   We think it's that it's a big soft light right above me.
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:36.940]   Softbox right above me that I use for my key light that the light switch on that must
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:37.940]   have been right.
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:41.340]   There's loose or something, but that makes no sense.
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:44.020]   First of all, we never leave it there because it's a fader.
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:46.860]   It'd have to be right there and say, why does it go on exactly?
[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:50.300]   Okay, I understand why we're going exactly with shakes because it shakes in position.
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.460]   Why does it go off when it stops shaking?
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:53.460]   Have you figured that out?
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.380]   Scared and then the ghost went away.
[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:59.740]   Perhaps there is a staffer or an intern who's being underpaid who can't afford to live in
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:00.740]   the Petaluma area.
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:03.820]   He sleeps under your desks when I'm pronounced to you.
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:07.860]   He heard the tremor flipped on the light and realized it was go OK, flipped the light back
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:09.740]   on when I was asleep.
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:14.660]   And then somebody else actually Burke also has he thinks it could be ball lightning.
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:16.500]   So just ball lightning.
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.980]   I think it's aliens.
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:18.980]   Yeah, invasion.
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:19.980]   That's our theory.
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:21.780]   Hey, good news.
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:27.100]   And this I think it's a California story, but I think it applies to everyone because as
[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:29.580]   California goes, so goes the nation.
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:34.540]   Yeah, this is this is the governor signed the kill switch bill.
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:40.460]   And so by July 2015, all smart funds have to have built in kill switches.
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:46.100]   The idea is this would be as an anti theft technology that would make it less desirable
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:47.100]   to steal smartphones.
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:51.740]   Apparently, that's become a big business, especially in the big cities of California.
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:54.420]   There was a huge drop after Apple put the kill switch in.
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:55.700]   I don't know what the percentage was.
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.180]   iPhones already have kill switches.
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.180]   Right.
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:08:59.180]   They already have.
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:00.180]   Well, you have to turn it on.
[01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:02.180]   You have to turn find my iPhone on, right?
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.780]   It's not on by default.
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:04.780]   Right.
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:06.500]   But there was already a big drop.
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:07.500]   Right.
[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:12.500]   And the fact that they do it in California, I think this is Jermaine because nobody's
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.060]   going to make a smartphone just for California.
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:17.580]   So if you're making a smartphone, you're going to say, well, if I'm a cell in California,
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:19.420]   I have to do this.
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:21.500]   California emission standards on cars.
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:26.220]   And it's kind of like vaccination where even if most people are doing it, it takes the
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:30.500]   fun out of stealing it because your percentage on succeeding is much lower.
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:37.260]   It's chiefly Samsung and Microsoft that have, you know, there is, I think the current version
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:43.180]   of Android has an Android device manager that has that capability.
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:44.180]   Yeah.
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.980]   And also a tracking system that a lot of people don't know is actually there.
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:51.700]   So not only can I tell you where your iPhone is, it can also tell you where iPhone has
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:55.340]   been for a long, for the longest time.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:59.660]   But yes, actually, as long as Apple gets on board and Samsung gets on board, really,
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.220]   that's almost every phone in America.
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.220]   Right.
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:05.020]   So it's good.
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:11.340]   I think I don't know why the story was that the original bill was killed in the California
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:14.860]   legislature due to opposition from the cell carriers.
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:17.940]   I'm not sure why they would care because they because they're making money on you.
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:18.940]   You're replacing them.
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:19.940]   That can't be really.
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:20.940]   They can't be.
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:22.660]   They couldn't be that crass and greedy.
[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:23.660]   Could they?
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:25.660]   Verizon, crass, greedy?
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:28.220]   Maybe they're worried that some burden will fall on them too.
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:29.220]   I think it's more like that.
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:30.220]   Yeah.
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:31.460]   I think they're more worried about liability.
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:32.460]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:35.420]   Liability or if they have to change their infrastructure in any way to keep that function
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:39.380]   working, they're certainly going to be responsible for sending out the pulse of death to kill
[01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:40.780]   the phone.
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:45.500]   So basically because Android has it and iPhone has it, I presume that the what you'll see
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.540]   in July is they'll be as part of the setup.
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:48.540]   Would you like to turn this on?
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:49.540]   It already is on the iPhone.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:50.540]   Right.
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:51.540]   Very sister on iPhone.
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:52.540]   And you should turn it on.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:53.540]   You should.
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.340]   That reminds me, and going back to the job one thing from a minute ago, I was looking
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:59.980]   at health in iOS 8 and health kit and the privacy settings in there.
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:00.980]   And they're actually really cool.
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:05.020]   They go beyond the normal privacy settings and they have whole privacy sheets for them.
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:08.940]   So basically, it's not that you'll enable or disallow an app or an accessory to use
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:10.900]   health, but you have granular control.
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:14.380]   You can say this app can use steps, but it can't use sleep.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:18.020]   And you could say it can write to health kit, but it can't read from it.
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:20.860]   And if you say it can't read from it, it won't even disclose that you did that.
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:25.140]   And the example they use is, for example, if you have diabetes, you could deny access
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:28.540]   to your blood sugar levels, but it's not going to report back to the app, which could
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:31.820]   come from your health insurer that you deny that access.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:34.620]   And you can manage all of that at any point in time.
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:35.620]   It looks really well thought of.
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:41.020]   Renee has an excellent, very detailed article he published yesterday and I'm more health
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:43.220]   and iOS 8 explained.
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:46.180]   I would recommend it if you want to know what you to expect.
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:51.500]   The story, of course, we knew that they had met with the FDA.
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:56.820]   We're not sure to talk about what now they're apparently meeting with big insurers like
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:00.700]   Humana and United Health.
[01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:02.180]   This is from nine to five Mac.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:08.100]   So it feels like Apple's pushing have health kit be more than just a repository of stuff
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:09.340]   from other people.
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:13.860]   To get FDA to, for instance, to make health recommendations, you have to get FDA approval.
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:19.380]   If you want to interoperate with the patient data, you'd have to get approval from the
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:22.740]   big insurance companies and the medical companies.
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:28.780]   And we have to remember that the market above 55, when you're talking about insurance and
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.460]   everything else is massive.
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:37.940]   So having something that was really focused on providing health care advice or just interoperability
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:44.580]   with physicians could be just a massive growth without really, because there's nobody else
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:45.580]   competing.
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:49.580]   Everyone else is looking for geeks who are quite healthy and I don't know, healthy, but
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:55.140]   younger and statistically better off in that respect.
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:13:02.660]   And I don't think that the current tech watches are really attracting the plus 55.
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:03.660]   John.
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:07.020]   I think it's still, I mean, there was that thing that Gruber said September, but you
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:10.660]   said that he was joking, but I haven't heard anything different than October either.
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:14.060]   I don't know if that's the launch or that's just the announcement because Apple sometimes,
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:31.860]   especially for new products, gives people more time between the announcement and the launch.
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:42.700]   So iPhone in a couple of weeks and availability, I think it's pretty safe to say will be constrained
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:49.060]   as it always is when there's a massive redesign with the iPhone 5, the iPhone, you know, the
[01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:52.140]   talk of the tick or the tick of the talk.
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:57.420]   But also apparently these in cell screens that are needed to make it much thinner are
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:04.580]   tricky to make and a lot of people reporting that Apple's having supply constraints.
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:10.220]   Would you say this would be, are we going to be lining up for this?
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:11.820]   I don't know if I'm going to line up.
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:12.820]   Well, I probably line up.
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:13.820]   I might line up.
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:16.700]   I mean, I remember other years as much more exciting for me.
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:20.820]   You know, so, you know, great, but I think you could, I hope you'll be able to and Apple's
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:24.380]   done it both ways, but I hope you'll be able to preorder online and have it shipped to
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:25.380]   you.
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:26.380]   Yeah.
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:29.780]   I got to say to this someone who's been carrying an Android phone for the past two years, I'm
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:32.340]   really excited about the new one.
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:37.220]   If I like what I see, you know, that it's going to be, I'll certainly wind up buying
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:38.220]   one.
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:41.820]   This is everything that I've, everything I was complaining about a couple of years ago.
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:45.940]   And so it really, between the OS and the new, these new size devices, I think it's the
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:49.700]   most exciting year in iPhone since practically year one.
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:50.700]   I agree.
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:51.700]   I agree.
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:58.220]   I feel like they've solved my two issues, which are screen size because I like a bigger screen
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:00.340]   and I will get the big one.
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:04.660]   And keyboard and the third party keyboard is going to make a big difference for me.
[01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:09.580]   And I think now with extensions, there won't be much that Android can do that the iPhone
[01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:11.620]   can't so much you can do with extensions.
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:15.060]   Every time I think about that, I hope developers do that.
[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:16.060]   Yeah.
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:17.060]   Yeah.
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:18.060]   They're working on.
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:19.060]   They're working on, I'm sure.
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:20.060]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:25.820]   Also, also just for me, I'm selfish when it comes to photo features and just the ability
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:31.060]   to finally have apps that take absolutely fine grain control of the camera hardware now
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:35.700]   is such a big deal for me because that's the reason why there are options on even Android
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:40.780]   phones for taking a picture that are unavailable to the iPhone where it's a great one.
[01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:44.340]   It's a great one tap button, but either it takes a good picture or it does not take a
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:45.340]   good picture.
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:48.460]   And if it does not take a good picture, put it back in your pocket because it is not capable
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:51.020]   of taking a good picture in this situation.
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:55.500]   Speaking of one tap butlins, buttons, Model S owners can now start their car with an iPhone
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.220]   if you have a Tesla.
[01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:01.180]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:04.820]   Now we have a new kind of butt dial, the E-But ignition.
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:05.820]   Oh, man.
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:08.820]   Well, you could control the Tesla in various ways for a long time with the original app.
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:09.820]   They just added the starter.
[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.900]   I'm sure to do it.
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:12.900]   Why is your car running?
[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:14.580]   Oh, I must have butt ignited it.
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:15.580]   He is the...
[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:20.500]   It's not like my old car where it's got a starter motor that has to crank, crank, crank and
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:23.180]   a cranky case oil that needs to warm up.
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:27.740]   Really, why do you need to start your car remotely unless it's just to gloat to other
[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:28.740]   people?
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.580]   Hey, look what I can do with my car with my app.
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:32.340]   Well, when you're in Boston...
[01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:33.340]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:34.340]   Yeah, you're in Boston.
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.780]   I mean, there are good reasons in Montreal with Ray.
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:39.860]   There are good reasons to start your car a couple of minutes before you get there.
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:40.860]   Electric car, no, because...
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:41.860]   Oh, well, it's different.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:42.860]   It's different.
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:43.860]   I don't know.
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:44.860]   Well, but that's the thing.
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:45.860]   You don't want to put your...
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:48.260]   If you have an electric car in Boston, you're nuts.
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:49.260]   You're just driving around.
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:52.700]   But while it's plugged in, you don't want to walk out there.
[01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:53.700]   It's still plugged into the wall.
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:54.700]   Oh, it's still plugged in.
[01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:55.700]   That's what that meant.
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:56.700]   But I'm just going like this.
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:57.700]   It's plugged in like this.
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:58.700]   It's plugged in like this.
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:16:59.700]   It's plugged in.
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:00.700]   Okay, you're right.
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:04.140]   I mean, the difference between starting the car and simply turning on the heater.
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:07.020]   I mean, it is a great app.
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:10.620]   I have a friend who has a Tesla and a really lovely dog.
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:12.860]   And sometimes the dog will have lecture something.
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:17.500]   The dog will stay in the car and unbeknownst to passersby, the car, the air conditioning
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:18.500]   is on.
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:21.420]   He's monitoring the temperature from like 20 feet away.
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:23.260]   And I've always set as a gift for him.
[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:26.780]   I should make this really nice placard that says, "Hi, this is a Tesla or the air..."
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:30.460]   Please, before you smash the window to, quote, "rescue my doggy," please put your hand on
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:32.780]   the glass to feel how cold it is.
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:33.780]   Yeah.
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:34.980]   Actually, you guys are very good point.
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:39.380]   If it's already plugged in, that is the time to heat up the car.
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:41.220]   Because you don't want to do it when you're on battery.
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:43.180]   So now you get the car nice and warm toasty.
[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:44.180]   Why you're making your coffee?
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:46.420]   Which you start the coffee maker with your iPhone.
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:47.420]   And then you walk over.
[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:50.340]   And you just turn everything on and you walk down.
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:52.140]   And yeah, it's great.
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:55.020]   I wonder why the car even has an off switch.
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:56.500]   Why don't you just let it sleep?
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:57.500]   I'd be pretty neat.
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:58.500]   But to sleep, yeah.
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:17:59.500]   It was funny.
[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.780]   I saw, I have an auto starter in my car and I use it every winter and I would not give
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:03.780]   it up for the world.
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:06.980]   But I went to CES and I was looking at, and this is before Android in the car.
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:10.940]   And they were showing off an Android powered car and it was Android 2.0 something.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.980]   And they said, look, we have a couple different modes.
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.300]   Now you can keep it on, but that'll drain your battery.
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:16.300]   You can put it in sleep.
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:18.140]   But after eight days, that'll drain your battery.
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:19.620]   So we automatically switch it off.
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:22.460]   When you start it for the first time, it takes about 10 minutes to boot.
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:24.660]   So maybe it was five minutes, I don't remember.
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:29.700]   But the litany of things there made me realize that sleep when it comes to cars is not only
[01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:30.700]   that blessing.
[01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:34.940]   I'm just waiting for the one that will come down from the parking garage and pick me
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:36.220]   up in the valet section.
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:37.220]   That's the public base.
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:40.220]   There's some other things to worry about with these things.
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:46.140]   Alex just got, Alex and Renee started talking about how this Facebook app is draining the
[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:47.900]   battery of Alex's phone.
[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:51.940]   Now that there's like Facebook in the car, well, how would you like to come back after
[01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:55.340]   eight hours of work and find out that Facebook basically killed your car battery?
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:57.980]   Sorry, I couldn't come home.
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:00.180]   I couldn't come home because of Facebook.
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:01.700]   I'm stuck in the city.
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:04.140]   They want to update.
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:14.860]   Yosemite OS 10 Yosemite public beta two pushed a couple of days ago and feels like it's ready.
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:16.500]   Yes, Renee, you agree?
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:17.860]   I mean, they haven't to locked up.
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:19.340]   I'm guessing they haven't until October.
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:20.420]   So there's still stuff.
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:24.220]   I mean, it's stuff that may not hit consumers, but things like provisioning and other things
[01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:25.220]   that they still have to shoot out.
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:29.140]   Don't you want to push it out when iOS eight comes out because of continuity and the hand
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:30.140]   off and all that?
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:33.540]   I mean, maybe they didn't do that from Mavericks and there were features you have to wait for.
[01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:38.820]   There's usually a Mac and iPad event later in October and last year's.
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:39.820]   Maybe they could.
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:40.820]   I don't know.
[01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:43.460]   I tend to think I would rather have it good than fast.
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:47.780]   I agree with you on that, but I just feel like the timing would be good to release it
[01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:48.780]   with iOS eight.
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:49.780]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:53.140]   If it's ready for continuity, it feels pretty stable, I have to say.
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:57.460]   They really, it almost feels like they really have to be able to demonstrate that one feature,
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:58.460]   at least.
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.460]   Right.
[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:04.140]   It wouldn't be the chimes of doom if they didn't, but what a shame if the one of the
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:09.460]   coolest things to do with iOS eight is something that they have to say, come back in January.
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:10.460]   It will probably be ready.
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:11.460]   Yeah.
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:12.460]   At the point.
[01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:16.660]   It's been running on my production machine and I'm loving it.
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:17.660]   Haven't had any problems.
[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:21.860]   There are a couple of apps maybe that aren't compatible, but very few.
[01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:24.740]   I haven't had any serious issues at all.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:26.580]   The new auto signing is out now.
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:29.140]   So hopefully people will update to that because a couple of apps you try to run them and
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:31.140]   they say, you know, this app has been changed.
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:32.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:33.140]   What do we do for that?
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:35.340]   Did we have to download something or to turn switch on?
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:38.540]   The developers have you can still do the right click thing and give it all give it
[01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:39.540]   man.
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:40.540]   Yeah, that's what I do.
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:41.540]   Yeah.
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:43.380]   But developers have to update to support the new type of right because basically it's
[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:46.020]   that gatekeeper and gatekeeper lets you run apps that aren't there.
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:48.900]   Still signed by developers, but not in the app store and they changed the way gatekeeper
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:49.900]   works.
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:50.900]   Mm.
[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:55.220]   Let me pose a question to the panel of people who are running iOS eight on a daily basis.
[01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:58.300]   I'm nearly at the point where I feel as though I'm going to now that we're close to what
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:20:59.980]   might be a launch date for iOS eight.
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:02.180]   I feel like I have to start using this every single day.
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:05.940]   So I know what so I can not only think about and talk about it, but also write about it.
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:08.260]   Is it safe enough for daily use now?
[01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:12.620]   Yes, I would have said up until now up until the latest beta would have said no, please
[01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:13.620]   don't.
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:14.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:16.820]   But if you're a reviewer or developer, not a normal person because their voice of Apple
[01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:18.540]   care and you should never do that.
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:22.700]   But for a developer or a reviewer, I think yet safe now after a complete backup in which
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:26.140]   you decide that anything on this phone is subject to be deleted be deleted permanently.
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:27.140]   Yeah.
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:28.140]   It's a pre-D resolution.
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:29.140]   Yes.
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:30.140]   You've been D Rezzed.
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:31.140]   Try it.
[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:32.140]   Try it.
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:35.940]   It's for some reason I don't mind doing Yosemite beta, but I really reluctant to do
[01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:36.940]   iOS eight beta.
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:42.940]   I don't know why because I don't know why the iOS when iOS betas are 10 times more painful
[01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:43.940]   than the desktop betas.
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:44.940]   Yeah.
[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:46.940]   When iOS doesn't work, it really doesn't work.
[01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:47.940]   Yeah.
[01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:53.340]   I mean, this is it's like it's like a smell that pervades the entire house and there might
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:57.380]   be one dead skunk that's causing it, but that doesn't change the fact that this house
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:59.460]   is now incompatible until you deal with the skunk.
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:02.540]   There's nothing worse than having someone call that's important and you're sitting in
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:04.140]   and you can't get the thing to work.
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:06.860]   You're like going, open, open, open, open.
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:09.780]   I had a beta, not this one, but I had a beta previously that just didn't let the phone
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:10.780]   work as a phone.
[01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:12.380]   The phone calls would just not come in.
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:15.420]   You know, that normal people shouldn't have to worry about that.
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:16.420]   Yeah.
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:21.420]   iTunes 12, I'm a little disappointed that you'll get when you get the beta two of the
[01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:26.420]   public preview for Yosemite, you'll get iTunes 12, build 97.
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:29.980]   They really want to get rid of that gutter on the left, the one that shows, you know,
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:33.180]   my music and my playlists and all that stuff.
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.100]   They really don't want that there anymore.
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:36.860]   If you hide it, the bloat's not there anymore, Leo.
[01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:38.980]   If you hide it, the bloat's not there anymore.
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:40.700]   Oh, geez.
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:43.060]   The good news is I hardly ever use iTunes.
[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:44.060]   Yeah.
[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:48.260]   That's funny how it's come to that because it was something that all of us used all the
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:49.260]   time.
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.260]   Right.
[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:52.860]   And it usually opens up by accident when I plug my iPhone in.
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:53.820]   That's the one I see it.
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:55.220]   I've been buying a high.
[01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:56.220]   Go ahead.
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:00.540]   iTunes has become like a like a corded phone in my life where there are times when I have
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:04.540]   to seek one out and use it, but otherwise it's totally irrelevant.
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:08.300]   And now when I actually have to use it, I almost have to retrain myself because it's
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:10.460]   been so long that I've kind of forgotten.
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:14.220]   I've been buying a high def music because I'm getting the Pono player in a couple of
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:17.900]   months and I want to have a lot of high def tracks.
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:24.260]   And iTunes will not play the higher def stuff, the 24-bit.
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:25.260]   I think it's really.
[01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:26.260]   Yeah.
[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:27.260]   Some of them are too small.
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:28.620]   They're not up on yet either.
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:29.620]   Yeah.
[01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:30.940]   And I wish they would.
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:33.620]   So I download, I could download Apple lossless.
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:34.620]   This is where I buy HD tracks.
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:40.220]   It does offer Apple lossless, but I buy Flack for just kind of, I don't know why.
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:42.900]   But I've just converted it to a high bit, right?
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:43.900]   Right.
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:44.900]   MP3.
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:45.900]   And then I've got it.
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:50.900]   I treat the original like a precious item.
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:51.900]   Yeah.
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:54.900]   Because it is.
[01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:57.300]   I wish iTunes would support that.
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:01.420]   I can't hear a conversation between Chris Leeschio, who does the capo stuff and Don
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:05.420]   Melton, who did all the safari stuff about audio because they're both huge audio codecs
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:06.420]   and nerds.
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:09.180]   And they were saying that the lossless to them is way more important than the 24-bit
[01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:10.900]   because most humans can't tell the difference.
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:11.900]   I agree.
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:15.380]   But the lossless, especially with certain instruments, especially in classical music, you can really
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:16.380]   tell them.
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:17.380]   Yeah.
[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:22.580]   So here, for instance, is a 96 kilohertz 24-bit, which is plenty by the way, version of Dylan's
[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:23.580]   Blood on the tracks.
[01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:26.740]   You could get it in AIFF, which is completely uncompressed.
[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:28.460]   And that's going to be a little bit big.
[01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:33.940]   Apple lossless Flack or Wave, which they say several times we don't recommend.
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:34.940]   So cute.
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:37.940]   So cute.
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:40.340]   Apple lossless and Flack are probably identical, right?
[01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:46.780]   They're just kind of using lossless compression like Level Ziv to, I'm sure that they're
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:47.780]   easy to transcode.
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.780]   I don't know why.
[01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:50.780]   I just buy Flack.
[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:53.940]   It's just kind of like, to me, that's going to be the permanent standard.
[01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:56.420]   It's a safety, I mean, it's an archival format.
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:57.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:24:59.020]   It's like anything that's not proprietary.
[01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:01.020]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:03.220]   It's, these are kind of expensive.
[01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:04.220]   This is $18.
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:06.220]   It's just like a CD.
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:07.700]   It's like buying a CD.
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:09.340]   But you don't have to deal with all that plastic.
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:11.220]   But I buy the classics, right?
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:14.900]   Miles Davis kind of blew and stuff like that.
[01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:16.740]   Is that another generational problem?
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:20.820]   Because I can sort of deal with the fact that a new book costs almost as much as a printed
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:21.820]   book.
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:25.540]   I can deal with the fact that an electronic republish comic costs about as much as a comic.
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:29.020]   But the generations under us could say you didn't have to manufacture this.
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.180]   You didn't have to ship this.
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:32.100]   You didn't have to inventory this.
[01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:36.620]   All you had to do was move some files from A to B. And why are you charging me $399 for
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:40.340]   this comic that cost me the same amount of money at the corner store?
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.020]   It's not that that bothers me.
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:45.980]   It's because I like the what bothers me is that there's no place for less rights.
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:47.220]   Like I can't lend it to somebody.
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:48.220]   I can't do all these.
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:49.220]   I can't resell it.
[01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:50.220]   There's no work.
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:51.220]   There's the second sale rights.
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:54.420]   That's the part that I shouldn't pay as much because I'm not getting as much as is my only
[01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:55.420]   company.
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:57.620]   But you are you're getting more bits for your dollar.
[01:25:57.620 --> 01:26:00.060]   I had all the bits in analog.
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:03.260]   But not only that, but only for the first play.
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:04.260]   And I could lend it to Andy.
[01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:06.340]   I could lend my entire collection to Andy if I wanted to.
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:11.060]   I feel like that's a trade off because I can actually have now I bought this comic for
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:12.060]   $399.
[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:15.900]   But I can now make six copies of it for all my devices and not have to walk into another
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:18.100]   room to get the one copy that I have.
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:22.500]   And I instantly felt also I have to amend what I said because it's not just bits.
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:24.220]   The cost is more than just printing.
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:25.940]   The cost is more than just shipping inventory.
[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:29.740]   The cost is the talent that they have to have to be paid for all these books and the editorial
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:31.780]   that has to be put into it.
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:36.700]   But still I wonder if we're for this is the last opportunity that publishers have to have
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:42.460]   an audience that does not find it absolutely galling that a $19 set of bits is going to
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:47.260]   have to say they chose that price because that's how much a full CD should cost.
[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:52.580]   So should I pay four bucks more for the 192 kilohertz.
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:54.380]   I think I went for going down that path.
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:55.380]   You might go all the way.
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:57.180]   That's that's what I would do.
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:00.740]   But this is I mean look this is recorded in what the 60s.
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:04.380]   You're going to hear all the tape has all the all the compression.
[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:11.460]   You should be able to ask okay was the singer still an active smoker while he recorded this.
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:18.460]   So if I download Apple lossless Anthony W saying I will be able to play it in in iTunes.
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:20.220]   So there you go.
[01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:25.740]   And I'm I found a program that converts you know batch converting so.
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:30.260]   It would be nice if Apple supported the flak and they supported Web RT and all that emergency
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:31.260]   stand.
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:35.140]   There's an app Vox V O X. It's a player that plays back all these files and it's a decent
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:39.820]   little player reminds me a lot of what was the app that Apple bought to make iTunes in
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:40.980]   the original sound jam.
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:41.980]   Sound jam.
[01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:43.460]   It's a lot like sound jam.
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:48.180]   And I think the big thing is once you start buying these though then like the Pono player
[01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:49.180]   you need.
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:52.180]   Pono is a Pono or Pono I know it doesn't sound right.
[01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:55.340]   Yeah but but the you're going to have to think about the entire infrastructure that goes
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:58.380]   with it you know like what are you going to play with it and what headphones are going
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:27:59.380]   to use.
[01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:00.380]   Have you picked your headphones for that?
[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:01.940]   I have some pretty good headphones.
[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:03.420]   I'm not too worried about that.
[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:07.860]   But actually what I want is an optical I guess you don't want optical optical because the
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:11.220]   DAC in the Pono player is supposed to be a really good DAC.
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:16.100]   So that has analog out and I'm going to put that into my stereo right right so that's
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:19.340]   going to be my high depth because I can't figure out how to get these tracks out of the
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:20.340]   stereo.
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:26.340]   The last inch.
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:28.020]   Alright let's take a break when we come back.
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:29.420]   You're picks my friends.
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:30.980]   You're picks.
[01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:32.820]   Prepare them now.
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:38.900]   Our show brought to you by LegalZoom.com not a law firm oh no no much much better.
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:43.460]   LegalZoom does the legal work you need to do that you can do it yourself your self help
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:44.460]   stuff.

[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:51.460]   big cost of a law firm.
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:54.820]   If you're starting a business it's a hundred it starts at a hundred forty nine dollars
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:59.740]   plus filing fees to do an LLC or a chapter S or chapter C corporation.
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:03.220]   Now go to just do you know call a law firm go to the white pages.
[01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:06.260]   Hey how much would it cost for a chapter S?
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:10.980]   Thousands of dollars more than ten times more twenty thirty times more.
[01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:14.460]   I'm planning to use LegalZoom for a corporation this week.
[01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:15.460]   See?
[01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:20.620]   What does is it empowers you not only to do the stuff you probably should do like your
[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:26.380]   trademark and your LLC but also kind of encourages you to start businesses right.
[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:29.940]   Maybe start multiple businesses sometimes the nice thing about an LLC is you can spin
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:32.460]   off little businesses you can do a lot more.
[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:35.180]   Well and what I'm doing is pretty simple it's like a simple thing I just need to build a
[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:38.860]   corporation and I just need to but I and I and I don't really know how to do it and
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:42.140]   file all the stuff and here I can just get it done.
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:45.580]   Just will and test me you know August is national make a will month and I think this
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:49.380]   is a good cause there are a lot of parents who would just say well I'm going to be fine
[01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:52.780]   I don't want to it's too much trouble takes too much time is too expensive to make a
[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:57.180]   will I'm not going to die it'll be fine but you know what if anything happens to you
[01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:01.700]   the courts decide what happens not only your property but to your kids you don't want that.
[01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:07.060]   You should for sixty nine bucks you can make a last will and testament.

[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:39.220]   it's a $1.00 what's the pet protection agreement it it's a simple agreement that allows you
[01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:42.180]   to name a pet guardian take care of your pets.

[01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:37.940]   I think I'm a very useful one.
[01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:41.620]   So so we in the same thing we were talking about the iPhone batteries we were really
[01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:45.980]   looking at what is wrong with some of our computers and we we plug them in and unplug
[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:51.180]   them and we're like what is the actual health of our of our and there's ways that you can
[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:54.460]   do this kind of in a geeky way but one that we've kind of started to install on some of
[01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:55.900]   the machines is one called battery health.
[01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:56.900]   Yeah.
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:32:00.540]   It's just a Mac program and it's a great little you know I click on it it goes up into your
[01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:05.100]   menu and I click on it and I can see what my current max is my original max my health
[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:10.420]   my you know my health of my battery is starting to wane 82 percent.
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:15.700]   If I know exactly how many cycles that it's been charged when it was created and again
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:20.020]   these are things that you can hack out but it's it is a free application.
[01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:25.980]   So and it's really really easy and it it you know just shows you everything you need
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:32.740]   to know about your about your about your battery and for many of us who who are traveling
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:36.380]   it's nice to know where you're going to start making decisions like at 82 percent I'm starting
[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:39.300]   to think that maybe I'll we have somebody else that has one that we tested it was like
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:45.580]   64 percent so we're going to get a new battery for that computer but it also tells you once
[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:49.220]   you unplug it it'll tell you you know you're gonna have seven hours of internet browsing
[01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:51.140]   is it pretty accurate.
[01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:56.540]   It's pretty accurate so more so than the Apple kind of generic this is how much time is left
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:33:01.420]   and it's a nicer set up and it's more convenient and the and the generic one I mean this is
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:04.900]   it's free it's not like I'm paying three dollars or four dollars or five dollars for
[01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:09.700]   it right so anyway I think it's a it's worth having on your computer.
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:19.740]   Very nice battery health from FipFap or something yep FipLab limited that's cool.
[01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:25.140]   My battery is at 98 percent it's very healthy actually it's interesting because you're so
[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:28.020]   healthy because it's a couple years old.
[01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:33.220]   Our mind is 2.2 years is 2.2 we got it we got them within a month of each other oh you
[01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:36.300]   know why because you have a hundred and thirty five cycles and I have five hundred and seventy
[01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:43.660]   I keep mine plugged in see I travel a lot so originally this this was 8460 milliamp
[01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:50.500]   hours is data 7901 which is 93 percent but that's partly because I haven't 135 cycles
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:55.500]   in two years see it's kept plugged in that's useful.
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:34:01.860]   I like it Renee Richie what do you got for us so my we just had the birthday for my eldest
[01:34:01.860 --> 01:34:06.140]   God Sunday just turned nine and he asked for some hue lights because like me they have
[01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:10.900]   the hue light system at his house but his parents weren't first eager to have him control
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:15.940]   their lights and also they restrict how much time he could spend using his iPod touch he
[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:20.700]   gets he gets used just for a few minutes every day and most of that what what is what are
[01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:27.380]   they they don't want to either you know yeah they mean they're raising that kid and but
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:31.020]   so what they did is they got in the hue tap which came out a little while ago but it's
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:35.700]   basically a remote control for your hue lights it's designed so that if someone's busy with
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:38.820]   their phone or tablet or if you've run out of batteries you can still control the lights
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:42.900]   in your house and it's a big circle it looks like a big button and it's got three small
[01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:47.620]   buttons on it and what you can do is set up a different theme or something for every one
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:51.700]   of those buttons so one can be off one could be pure white light one could be red one could
[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:55.980]   be blue you can set that up using your phone or your tablet whatever you use to normally
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:35:00.820]   control your hues and then when you hit this it's really neat when you hit this it changes
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:04.220]   the scene there's no batteries is powered by kinetic energy so you don't have to worry
[01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:08.140]   about charging it or plugging it in or putting new batteries in it a really small control
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:13.540]   for your light color it's if that was and for him I mean they they set it up so that he
[01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:17.140]   has this in his room and he can hit the buttons and change the lights between you know all
[01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:20.740]   the different presets and when he does have time with his iPod touch he can change the
[01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:24.500]   presets you know to make them different add some variety to it but it means that he can
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:28.620]   still have really cool lighting in his room that he can control and without having you
[01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:34.620]   know constant access to a to a computer I just got the hue lux bulbs which are white bulbs
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:39.260]   how do you like them well they're white I don't understand when you want the color I
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:45.860]   want the color yeah so I have a ton I have I think 15 of these oh and I'm getting I have
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:50.580]   them behind me like all the light behind me is I only have nine they're great I mean
[01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:54.820]   you could like I said you can watch Star Wars while the lights are set to Tatooine sunrise
[01:35:54.820 --> 01:36:00.700]   I mean it's just it's great you did you see the Netflix hack I did not so Netflix has
[01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:06.100]   a day a yearly hack day and this was one of the hacks it was to hack the hue to match
[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:10.620]   the Netflix movie that you're watching it's awesome and you see you can't see my screen
[01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:17.700]   is that what's going on oh there you go okay so as you're watching a movie the lights will
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:24.420]   match the background of the movie now unfortunately this is not available unless you work in Netflix
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:29.540]   ah so I've been thinking about this because I was thinking about this whether this was
[01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:33.820]   an if that if this then that type of thing that you could do the problems you need to
[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:39.940]   get the data from Netflix of what color there was a TV after three and a half hours is the
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:45.060]   problem well I so there was a TV that did this they had lights in the back again who
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:49.940]   made it and the idea was it's you know you're focused on the screen but it's as if the room
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:54.820]   is kind of part of the movie a little bit we had that Xbox thing to write the Illumirov yeah
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:37:00.860]   yeah yeah you know I I think I think it can be done though I think it can be done outside
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:03.980]   of Netflix we'll work on that I think I can do it with actually conduit because I think
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:06.260]   what you do is you take the output that's going to the computer and you send it into
[01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:10.060]   conduit and then you and then we blur it so that we get the overall hue and then we use
[01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:18.060]   that sample that and then send that out over if then it's simple the key is to start saying
[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:21.820]   it simple right yeah right the keys to get the color it would only work if you're watching
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:25.180]   on a computer not on a TV no no because what you do is you take the output and you send
[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:30.020]   it to the TV and the computer so then you so then you send it to both of them but you
[01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:35.380]   do the processing on the on the but you have to get a something that will defeat the copyright
[01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:40.860]   which they have hardware that will solve that problem.
[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:45.540]   I'm just that would be fun for about a minute I don't know just think it's like action
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:50.500]   film and the whole room is going that's example Netflix gave like your Tom Cruise you're on
[01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:55.020]   a boat and it's sunset so the room is that color and then you dive into the water and
[01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:58.220]   suddenly it's dark blue because you're in the water a lot of fun but that's but that's
[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:02.780]   the problem so you're not you're not in the water you're in a living room that has like
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:09.980]   bamps and books and unopened amazon.com boxes and they're blue that's like when I don't
[01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:12.820]   know I think I could never have a holodeck it just these are the things that break my
[01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:18.340]   heart. I see that Andy Naco has his Burger King hat at the ready with the Canadian flag
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:20.300]   on it that's nice Andy.
[01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:28.300]   What is your pick? Actually I have a one pick and one selfish pick. You know how like you
[01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:34.820]   go on to iTunes or Amazon mp3 and because you want to buy the gene gene wilder singing
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:39.700]   pure imagination from Charlie and the chocolate factory and of course the only track off the
[01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:44.700]   soundtrack you cannot buy individually is the one track that everybody wants. So once
[01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:49.620]   I ran into this and I tweeted that you know if Apple and Amazon were good sports about
[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:53.180]   this they were really honest they would make instead of saying album only they would just
[01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:58.140]   actually have an image of a middle finger because that's how you feel when that happens
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:03.620]   and of course a few short months later Jack Amoratus Twitter said okay that's not like
[01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:06.940]   a good idea so I actually wrote that as a Chrome extension so if you install this Chrome
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:11.900]   extension any web page that has album only in text will be replaced by a graphic of a
[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:17.100]   middle finger being extended to make you feel just as unloved by the commercial music industry
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:22.500]   as you actually are.
[01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:27.300]   I love this because this is exactly the sort of thing that would win back hack if they're
[01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:34.500]   still doing back hack. Not an apple I don't think. Oh that's hysterical. But I also want
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:39.980]   to do I'm doing a little experiment. I hate doing YouTube videos because I don't know
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:44.260]   how to do them very well and I get too obsessed with editing them and I know I need to add
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:48.260]   this effect here and I need to get this shot right here and I realize that well you know
[01:39:48.260 --> 01:39:53.740]   you haven't really done a video a real video since the Kindle one got released perhaps
[01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:57.980]   you should try it again just to make sure you really do hate it as opposed to you just
[01:39:57.980 --> 01:40:02.540]   are not doing it because you're afraid to learn how to do this. So I made I issued myself
[01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:08.260]   a challenge to do videos Monday Wednesday and Friday for an entire month. The first one
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:13.180]   was posted yesterday. The next one actually shot the video for it this morning and it
[01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:20.220]   will have to edit it tonight. So it's I'm only promising 12 of these and the other thing
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:24.580]   I'm promising is that I call it the very least I can do because I'm telling myself that even
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:29.420]   I if I do the very least I can possibly do to say that I posted a video when I said I
[01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:35.940]   would that counts. So the idea is not to at the end of 12 to learn how to do video as
[01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:42.300]   well as quit does video but to figure out a way to even if it involves you know talking
[01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:46.540]   like this into my phone and talking for only two minutes and then posting it straight from
[01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:51.580]   my phone being comfortable and happy with video or saying goodbye to this form of communication
[01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:57.180]   forever. So what will the content be of the very least you can do? It's a different topic
[01:40:57.180 --> 01:41:01.420]   every time it's going to be mostly tech stuff. The one I recorded this morning is just all
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:07.140]   about in broad and broad strokes. Here's how to pick your next camera going through the
[01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:11.460]   different types of cameras that there are not specific models but here's why maybe if
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:16.020]   you are happy with your phone you should aim above your phone or if you think that you
[01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:22.700]   should be spending $2,500 on a Canon Mark Mark 3 5D Mark 3 maybe that's overkill for what
[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:28.380]   you want. Just stuff like that. I start every one of these ideally to just have an idea
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:32.980]   of what I want to say and then as you saw a little bit there instead of editing in or
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:36.580]   I should have said this or I forgot to say that I will just put a little caption up here
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:40.660]   to fill in what I should have said. The idea is to make it as painless as possible so I
[01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:46.060]   will actually be able to do 12 of these without saying oh man do I really have 12 hours to
[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:50.020]   paint the room green and make a little animated elf that hops on my shoulder. I don't want
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:55.460]   to do that. But before the end I'm going to invite Andy down to Pittsburgh which is
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:42:00.700]   a short flight now and then maybe we'll do one down there.
[01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:09.580]   I just, you're a vlogger. I want to, I feel the first video explains the whole count,
[01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:14.260]   all my thoughts on this but to make it very, very quick I feel as though what I love about
[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:19.660]   the modern landscape is that there are people that are not terribly interested in sitting
[01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:22.740]   down and reading a thousand to two thousand words on a webpage which is how I like to
[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:26.180]   express myself when I share my point of view. There are people who like to simply watch
[01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:30.580]   a five minute video or a ten minute video or even a two minute video and I feel as though
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:35.060]   I'm leaving those people on the curb if they're interested in what I have to say they don't
[01:42:35.060 --> 01:42:41.220]   get to see that sort of stuff. So as a banker or as a business person you don't like to
[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:44.860]   leave money on the table and if you're in the business of communicating with people you
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:48.700]   don't like to leave a part of an audience on the table especially if the only reason
[01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:53.220]   why you're not doing it is because I don't want to do video this.
[01:42:53.220 --> 01:43:00.500]   So I feel like I should be doing this too. I just video Leo. Oh yeah. I can listen to
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:05.580]   hardware that I recommend. Oh wait, no you are actually in a working production TV studio.
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:09.940]   That's actually what stops me from doing anything more personal. It's like, oh yeah
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:14.620]   I think I have a problem with I start doing it and get one of those healthy hand handles
[01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:18.980]   and you can I do I have a stick that you could put your phone on and I will say that this
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:25.260]   I don't I don't intend to make this like a personal video blog. I do it's it's mostly
[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:30.060]   going to be tech stuff. I do I do have a broad outline of what I wanted to do with these
[01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:34.620]   12 shows and one of them is that I want I want to shoot video of me trying to take pictures
[01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:37.740]   of squirrels with a test camera that I'm working on right now because I think that would make
[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:42.180]   me look really dumb but people would enjoy seeing it but it's not going to be you know
[01:43:42.180 --> 01:43:48.020]   me with the Edward R. Murrow lighting the cigarette going and saying it's just parish. It seems
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:55.140]   as though Don is coming a lot colder and earlier these days now that I want it. Can you make
[01:43:55.140 --> 01:44:02.740]   it black and white? I want that. So Instagram introduced a new app today a free app called
[01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:08.220]   hyperlapse. It's actually pretty cool. It is iOS only they say we can't really do it on
[01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:12.820]   Android because they have to modify how the accelerometer works. The idea is it allows
[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:18.500]   you to do time lapses but it will automatically smooth the video. Here's their example of
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:23.220]   video at their Instagram blog and I think it's really cool if you look at the before
[01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:28.220]   and after they've they've really got a quite an interesting technology. Microsoft showed
[01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:33.420]   something like this a few weeks ago from the Microsoft lab and and everybody said well
[01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:37.860]   that's neat must take a lot of processing power. Well no you could do it on iPhone but
[01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:42.740]   even better on the new iPhone I imagine with a new processor. So Microsoft made a research
[01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:49.380]   paper Instagram made an app. Yeah it's not funny. Oh we could do that. So I made a hyperlapse.
[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:55.140]   It I recorded this show and it took by the way I should point out rendering it took some
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:45:03.180]   time. So let me let me go to I could share this but I want before I share it let me it's
[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:10.100]   a little bit obscure. I guess I've put it in my camera in my in my gallery I guess.
[01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:19.140]   I don't know. Let's see. Yeah there it is. So this is my hyperlapse. Okay and in true
[01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:25.340]   to my true to form I've recorded it sideways just to work all of you because I'm of the
[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:29.420]   opinion that the new one looks so bad. Can you flip your iPad to be always? There you
[01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:35.340]   go. It was intentional. It was in purpose. I don't know this old man get with it. I'm
[01:45:35.340 --> 01:45:39.180]   not talking about the person who's complaining about this doesn't really show it off because
[01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:43.700]   it wasn't moving. Right. I think the power is the real power is walking down the road.
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:52.820]   But anyway you can do a time lapse was very easily. It is only iOS and it is and yes you
[01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:58.180]   should record vertically. Dang it. Are you real pushing that now? It was good enough
[01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:03.100]   for for for for for 2001 a space out of these computers. That's right. Who are you to judge
[01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:09.020]   anybody? That's right. I suppose Stanley Kubrick was wrong about that and he's just one of
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:14.140]   the smartest people who ever hold a camera. So let's do a new hyperlapse here. I'll just
[01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:22.340]   jiggle it a lot. Okay. Here's a much lighter. Find a brighter spot. This is studio lighting
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:31.660]   hyperlapse. What the hell you want? I'm moving around. You don't have someone walk through
[01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:37.860]   the studio. Listeners be ready to capture this as an animated gift. I will I will I will
[01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:41.500]   do a walk through the studio and I will post it after the show. How about that? That's good.
[01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:49.340]   And so here's my hyperlapse now. You gave it a bit of a challenge. I can slow it down.
[01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:57.580]   I could slow it down. Let's go all the way. You're in low thing in Petaluma. Okay. Now
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:03.500]   if I press the checkbox now it's going to render it. Now watch the new improved hyperlapse.
[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:09.940]   I don't know how to do. I don't know how to get to it. That's my my problem here. The
[01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:14.420]   D'Appley is a little bit to be desired frankly. I don't know. I do I have to go to my life
[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:21.980]   here. It's for the kids. So here is this slowed down. That sucks. Okay. Yeah. It's
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:25.540]   you broke the laws of time and space. It's worth the price. What I do think it's interesting
[01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:29.740]   is there's a hyperlapse by somebody else. And then there's a hyperlapse by Instagram. I
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:33.460]   wonder. Right. No, there's many hyperlapses. Get the hyperlapse by Instagram. It's just
[01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:38.460]   a name collision. A popular thing on the app store I find. Ladies and gentlemen, we have
[01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:44.300]   come to the end of this fine program. I thank you. My friends for joining us for an a rich
[01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:50.780]   chief from imore.com and don't forget the debug podcast at imore.com/debug. Must listen
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:55.780]   to you have a number of other podcasts. You really did actually reduce the amount. Oh,
[01:47:55.780 --> 01:48:00.100]   good. So we merged the TV show and review into one show called review and we merged
[01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:03.900]   Zen and tech and vector into one show called vector and made it a panel show. So now it's
[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:08.980]   me, Georgia Dow, Guy English and Dave whiskus talking about stuff every week instead of
[01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:14.260]   excellent. Excellent. Did you redesign imore? It looks like you did.
[01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:18.380]   So we used to do big redesigns, but it took so long. We're now doing it step by step.
[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:21.700]   So we've got a new header up there. And if you go into one of the articles, we've got
[01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:26.980]   a new comment system as well. So there'll be other stuff coming, but it's easier to deploy
[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:35.260]   small bits at a time we discovered. Yes. And cheaper. It keeps your sanity. You pay less
[01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:39.260]   price in terms of sanity this way. Yeah, we're doing a redesign on a twit, which won't
[01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:43.580]   debut till the early next year. But we're doing something kind of different with it. We're
[01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:49.660]   doing a headless design, which will allow us in future to modify the site much more easily.
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:55.860]   So we're doing a back end that's Drupal and as an API, right, the root, the thinking being
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:49:00.980]   that we could have the website called the API, but also apps call the API. And that with
[01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:06.260]   simple changes in Drupal, when we publish a show, it could be propagated to all the different
[01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:09.540]   forms. That's what we do. It works really well. Do you do that one? Yeah. And then we're
[01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:12.700]   going to do an API that comes out and goes to our app as well as the Drupal front end.
[01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:16.940]   And then the front end will be probably no JS or something like something more modern
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:22.500]   than Drupal. So we can keep it. And the thing is the web changes, like every four months,
[01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:28.900]   the standard, what everybody like. Quartz just did their fourth redesign in like two years.
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:33.020]   It's it's and it's because the standards are always, you know, are moving target. And so
[01:49:33.020 --> 01:49:35.980]   I think this is probably the better way to do it. And you don't want to keep up because
[01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:39.220]   I know no one knows how to use your site. It's always good to do something people are familiar
[01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:45.820]   with. Yeah. Mr. Alex Lindsey, fresh from Pittsburgh. Yep. Perhaps going to Italy. We
[01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:51.260]   don't know. Maybe tomorrow. But yet and by the way, September 10th, we didn't plan this,
[01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:56.900]   but September 10th is going to be the next final cut pro user group or virtual user group.
[01:49:56.900 --> 01:50:00.420]   So we'll put that up by next week. Some people get signed up and get it. But we're going
[01:50:00.420 --> 01:50:07.300]   to do it in the afternoon. So one PM, as opposed to our previous six PM. And that is mostly
[01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:11.620]   because we had a lot of complaints from Europe. Yeah. So if you're in Europe and you and you
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:14.660]   go, we see a big stat that a lot of people are watching in Europe, we'll keep it in the
[01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:18.620]   afternoon. If like four of you watch from Europe after complaining is the, you know,
[01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:23.700]   then we'll go back to six PM. So that's that's that I'm thrown down the gauntlet. It's September
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:28.460]   10th, 1 PM. And where should people go to find out? We'll post it. Just follow me on Twitter.
[01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:34.020]   But otherwise, it's, you know, it'll be on YouTube. It'll be on the YouTube channel.
[01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:37.860]   It's the best way to pixel core YouTube channel. Subscribe to that and you'll see it pop up.
[01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:42.060]   It's going to be streaming live there. And then also we'll have it on hazu because we'll
[01:50:42.060 --> 01:50:45.620]   be doing the question and answer stuff that we're doing a big upgrade on right now.
[01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:49.620]   Yes, we didn't use it today because it's in the, it's it's it's trying not to distract
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:53.380]   Andy because there's a lot of big upgrades that we're doing right now. And so I'm just
[01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:59.220]   trying to keep from having to worry about anything until we finish the big push. So.
[01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:02.540]   That's Andy and I go over there. He's from the Chicago Sun times.
[01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:08.340]   And you there's little Lego family behind him. Is that the village people? It's it's
[01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:16.860]   village people. That's that's Lego queen, man. Queen. I see Freddie Mercury and the gang.
[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:23.580]   That's fine. Oh, it's fine. Lego. We are not expecting seeing them in Lego form. So you
[01:51:23.580 --> 01:51:29.340]   are to be forgiven. I think that the base figure on that one is a Lego Luke Skywalker.
[01:51:29.340 --> 01:51:34.860]   But it's still working. He does seem to be wearing a Dernville, the original arms.
[01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:41.020]   Oh, I think this I think this whole thing is CG, but yeah, a good idea. Lego queen.
[01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:48.380]   Yeah, a little. Now I see everything even even in Lego for Freddie Mercury has an incredible
[01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:55.180]   four active range. We do Mac break weekly 11 am Pacific two p.m. Eastern time 1800 at
[01:51:55.180 --> 01:52:01.900]   UTC every Tuesday. I hope you'll tune in live and join us as many in the chat room have,
[01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:10.600]   including Tolly who sent us his his video from hyperlapse. He says he shot it during lunch
[01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:19.100]   hour of a traffic light in Decatur. Here you go. How exciting is that? Thank you, Tolly.
[01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:25.140]   If you can't watch live and you see what you miss if you don't watch live. Traffic hour
[01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:29.940]   in Decatur. You can also get on a man of audio and video. We put that up on the website to
[01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:35.740]   it.tv/mbyw and also wherever you can find finder net cast, including iTunes, of course,
[01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:40.420]   and our fine apps all created by third party developers who do such a nice job for us.
[01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:47.460]   Thank you. I'm Leo LaPorte now back to work because break time. So.
[01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:54.460]   One.
[01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:57.040]   (upbeat music)
