[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   which means we have a massive studio audience.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   That's your cue to cheer a massive studio audience.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   There was mild chuckling.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   There you go.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Massive.

[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   We will give you snacks.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Wow, Andy and not com from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Looking marvelous.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Thank you, I've been eating more fiber.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I don't think it's that.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I think it has to do with more bandwidth.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Fiber optics that is.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Oh, well played.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I get it now.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I get it.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   So you got Fios.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   That looks really good.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   For five years, you died to get things going.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   It's weird.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It turns out that when you actually sign up for Verizon Fios and then you don't take a look
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   at how your thing could be upgraded within over the course of five years.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Five years later, you can actually get much better bandwidth for very little extra money
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   if you actually have Fios all this time.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I've had Fios all this time.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It was the kibble.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   It was quite the quill back in three, four, five years ago.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   But now it's essentially like the worst broadband Fios you could get with my knowledge.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   What's your bandwidth now?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I'm getting six to down.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I'm getting 20 up, sir.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Wow.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It looks like it too.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   You look like you're right here in studio.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   In fact, for the first time ever, I noticed that that lamp actually has Wonder Woman fighting
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   the Kraken built into the base.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And I've never noticed that before.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I know.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Wow.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   No, no, no, it's like I might actually have to like put a little time on the camera.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   You have to like put a little top on her or something because now you can actually see in detail, you know, exactly how
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   ambitiously she is dressed for her close combat with a serpent.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Yes.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Wow.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   She looks like she's winning.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Thanks for joining us, Andy.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Andy's not in the Bay Area for iWorld Macro, but look who is Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Gathering the rumors, absolutely.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Gather the rumors while you may.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And you kind of let me join you here.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Thank you for letting me let you get thrilled.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Are you kidding?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I'm not up here.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   You guys are real.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   You're not just renders.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Can we go down?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Did you notice cows, chickens on the way up, rolling hills?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   We're in the country.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I did.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   I saw the Marin sign.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I thought of Star Wars and then I thought immediately off to it.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   That's right.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   You didn't know it, but you went by Skywalker Ranch on the way.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   It's hidden in the hills.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   It's not the salt cauldries.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   This guy knows, Mr. I.L.M. himself.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Hi.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Are you back again?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Welcome.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   You excited about JJ doing the next Star Wars?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   I'm very excited.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Alex worked on episodes three.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Lots of lens flares.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I actually worked on episode one.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I always do them in order.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Yes.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   They're not in order.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Do you work on episode one?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Yes.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It's the fourth movie.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Correct.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   You did Princess Leia's starship.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Not Princess Leia's, but Princess Queen Amidala.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Queen Amidala, right?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   The silvery one.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I mostly just did Chinese ships.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Chinese ships.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   He's the man of China.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   So you think JJ will make a great one?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   I think I'm excited.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   There's very little that he's done that I haven't liked.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Between alias, lost, the mission impossible, Star Trek.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I mean, I can quibble about little bits and pieces.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Yeah, isn't it weird to have the same guy doing it?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   The geeks, the geeks say, "I'm sorry."
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   It's a conflict of interest.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   You can't do Star Wars and Star Trek.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   I think it's awesome.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   You think...
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   But we know that we now know that...
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   We know that...
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   We'll show up in the Star Wars...
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   The green girl.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   There could be some fun ones.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I mean, but there's always those things.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I mean, you know, there's...
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I'm holding Mentos in episode one.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   So anyway, so...
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   You're holding Mentos in episode one?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Just...
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's a very...
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   It's so much in the...
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   It's so much in the world you can ever see.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   You're seeing your life way in the distance in the ground.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   No, I'm seeing going...
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   No, I was in a curiously refreshing...
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   No, I thought it was a Mentos moment.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   So...
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   You can't see it in the film.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It's too motion blurred.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   So...
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   We used Mentos as an example of why people should buy ads on Twitch.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Did you know that?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Because before Mentos...
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   When Mentos started, it was like grandma candy.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Right.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   For grandma mints.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And then when MTV launched, they bought a huge campaign.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   That's where everybody knows the fresh maker.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Because they bought a big campaign and it made it hip.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Even though it was still grandma candy.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Right?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   It is really.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Let's face it.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Grandma McCandy.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   But because it was on MTV, it got hip.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   And we say, "Look, you could have sold a little of that glitter could rub off on you when you buy ads on Twitch."
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Exactly.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Just like the Mentos.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Yes.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Exactly.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   We're still looking for the Mentos of the win.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   The...
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   The...
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   The...
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   I think...
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   We know that with JJ Abrams, we know one thing on a Star Wars, there'll be a box inside of a box.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Do we know?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   He always does a box.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   The mystery of a box.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Yeah, his TED talk.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   He was always talking about the importance of the box inside the box.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   There's always in a mystery inside of the mystery inside of the mystery.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   So which Star Wars often had already?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   So I think that because of that, because of his mentality.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And lots of lens flares.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Yes.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   But there's been a lot of lens flares in.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I used to make them from scratch.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   So there's a lot of lens flares in Star Wars.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   There's just going to be a few more.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   He said he was making Star Trek more like Star Wars and now he's actually going to get to...
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   I can't wait.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I can't wait.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I can't wait.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Do we know what part of the Star Wars universe it'll be?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   We know anything about it.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   He does sequels.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   I think he's getting the sequels, isn't he?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   He's going to be...
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I think he's going to be in Star Wars.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Can he do Clone Wars?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Do a whole trilogy on Clone Wars alone?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I think that Episode 7 is supposed to come after 6.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   So I think we're talking about older folks.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Mark Hamill, Walking Stick.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   There's a lot of prequels that are available though before Episode 1.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   In other words, you're saying before Mark Hamill dies.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Yes.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   We should make another movie with him.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Yes.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   He's raging rapidly.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   But he's great.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   He seems like he's the opposite of Dorian Gray.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Like he has a big...
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   He makes Yoda younger.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I don't know.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   I mean, that's a really mean thing to say.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   But I guess we always see him in Episode 3.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   We always see him in 1977 Mark Hamill.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   The cool lateral move would be to have Mark Hamill but not have him play Luke Skywalker.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Ooh.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Not even any makeup, not even under a mask, but he gets to play a totally different role.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   And all of us are waiting for him to reveal, "Oh, by the way, I am Luke Skywalker."
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   No, no, he actually is.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Oh, you're not.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Plus I know him.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   He's a judge.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Chief Constable of 9.20.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   That's what he means.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   You're committing to this, really.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.800]   I remember he brought Leonard Nimoy in his Star Trek and it was great to see the 153-year-old
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.400]   Leonard Nimoy in that role.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:19.000]   And I would love to see 153-year-old Camill in a cave going, "I've been here for a long
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   long time."
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Don't ask questions about how your sphere pod happened to land right next to me.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   The one person who you, these lights are meeting.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   It's not such a big universe.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   It's the Force.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   We're on Tatooine again.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   We're on Tatooine again.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Yes.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Anyway.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.680]   It's not really Mack Talk, but it's good to start with something.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.680]   I like that.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.000]   Star Wars Talk and Star Wars Talk has to be at least 0.9%.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   0.9 is as good as the fact I can.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.200]   Someone there will have an iPhone on set and we're fine.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.200]   Eyeworld.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.200]   Mackworld Eyeworld.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.840]   Now, the fact that they call it Mackworld Stroke Eyeworld implies to me that this will
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.240]   not be Mackworld much longer.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.000]   That Eyeworld is the new name, right?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   That's where all the booths were.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I mean, that's what you want when you go to it.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   No, no, no, don't just think Apple's saying, "Hey, guys, can you get rid of the Mack
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   it?"
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Because we really aren't there anymore.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   I don't think they really talk a lot.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   They don't care.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Mack breaks.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I break weekly.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   I break.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   I break.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   No, sorry.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   No, you're not going to do it.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   They haven't talked to us.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   They haven't said us.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   No, Mack break.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   But we still cover Mack's.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.800]   Mackworld really is an iPhone case show now.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.800]   It's a fan show now.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   It is.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   You know what?
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   I'm being a lot of seizures.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   But it really is a fan show.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.600]   It's really about the community.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.600]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.840]   So are we really just like maybe 2014, we're going to see our first cosplayers?
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.400]   What are you dressed as?
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.200]   I'm Clarice, the dog.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   Wow.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.000]   I'm also dressed as an Apple genius.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.200]   Your dress is an Apple genius too.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   Great.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.000]   That's not good.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   That's no.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.600]   I think that we should actually start like a fundraising campaign.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:58.160]   I'm willing to kick in $20 for a nice gift for someone who shows up as a stormtrooper
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.920]   apple genius at iWorld.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.920]   I'm serious.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.560]   How about Greedo?
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.560]   No, no, no, no.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.560]   Stormtrooper apple genius.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.840]   And not one of these half baked ones where you're in like, you know, you're in like white
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.840]   poster board.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:18.600]   I'm talking about the full stormtrooper gear articulated as an Apple genius.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.120]   What would you, I guess you have to bear the big shirt.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.000]   Get a custom shirt for this.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.880]   Something that says, unspeakably, that everybody, if Twitter and Tumblr and everything is filled
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.560]   with Facebook filled with photos of people saying, hey, I got my picture taken next to
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.160]   stormtrooper apple genius, then they've definitely hit the mark.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.160]   I'm not Steve Jobs.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.960]   I'm Ashton Kutcher playing Steve Jobs.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.960]   Please get it correct.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.320]   Oh, did you see, first of all, let's play the clip.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.560]   I was playing the clip.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.560]   Let's just play the clip.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.560]   I think we have our own Liz and Dick made for TV movie here.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.200]   It is kind of that.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.520]   It's worse than Liz and Dick.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.440]   So Ashton Kutcher is starring in the first of two Steve Jobs biopics in progress right
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.440]   now.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.280]   Actually, this one's already debuted at Sundance.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:05.000]   The first clip was on entertainment weekly and if it hasn't been pulled down yet, I'll
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   play it.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.680]   Well, I've been personally ripped off the internet.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.480]   Was says this is nothing.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.160]   Was and you know, was is never mean.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.160]   Was never said.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.160]   Right.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.160]   That's the whole thing is.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.560]   So when you say was say something negative, you know that it really was inside.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.440]   You know, you know, fuming.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.040]   Because it's exactly the opposite of was and jobs.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.040]   Real role.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.000]   Here's here's well, let's wait and see if there's a long ad or something in between.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.240]   But here's the clip.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.120]   Yeah, this is from entertainment weekly.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.120]   Here you go.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.120]   Can you see this?
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.120]   How about the sound?
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.120]   Do I have to?
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.040]   Oh, I probably should unplug this speaker or something.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.560]   Can you hear anything?
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.120]   It's the dialogue we really care about.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.520]   It's the industrial revolution.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.600]   No more decks.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.600]   No more mainframes.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   That changes everything.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   It's pretty cool.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   It goes like a much rolling cool.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.600]   I mean, I should.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   He's in the HP.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.600]   We should explain that.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.600]   He's in the HP garage.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.960]   Where's your phone?
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.960]   For you.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.960]   It's what you wanted.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.960]   It's what you got in your instinct.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.120]   Warning, your big vocal brain wanted something that didn't exist.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.120]   So you just.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.120]   That's supposed to be.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.120]   You didn't exist.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.120]   And it was what he calls it.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.120]   I think he belongs in the operating system.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.120]   He operates at any time.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.120]   He's like, "I'm just joking."
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.320]   The weirdest I can hear is a definite bold move.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.120]   You can see what you're working on while you're working on.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.120]   Okay.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.400]   Go back a little bit, Chadd.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.000]   Because this is the funniest thing.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.920]   He's explaining what the operating system is.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.920]   Not all the way.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:26.920]   It's just shows.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.480]   It goes to real time display for an operation.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.560]   First of all, I have named it thusly.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.040]   It was the operation as long as it was born.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.040]   But okay, yeah.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.040]   This is free.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.960]   I have called it the operating system.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:42.000]   And you could see what you're doing with the operating system.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   You're overreacting.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.400]   Even if you were developing this for free.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.600]   That's the point which I started laughing.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.600]   Who wants to buy a computer?
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   Who wants to buy a computer?
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.600]   Somebody knows what it was.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.280]   I've never even seen it.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.240]   Please Steve Jobs, explain to me how a personal computer works.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.240]   I'm only Steve Wozniak.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.400]   I know a little of such things.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.400]   I'm a corporate drone.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.600]   As you can tell by my necktie in my briefcase.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.520]   To his credit, if all that could work, I'll say.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.520]   It's only one clip.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.520]   Maybe the movie's good.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.600]   But he did have to say that's kind of not.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.280]   It was written as if somebody didn't know what a computer was.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.160]   I mean, it's bizarre.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.720]   And of course everyone, and I think Woz, said this fairly eloquently, knows that it was
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.640]   Woz in fact, who believed that everybody wanted a computer.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.520]   It was Jobs who need to be convinced.
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.920]   But Jobs, and Woz, I remember he said this every time he talks about these stories.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.520]   He says, "All Steve ever did was want to make a business out of it."
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.000]   He said, "With the blue box, I can make a business out of that."
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.120]   With Apple won, I can make a business out of that.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.920]   He wasn't going to Woz saying, "Woz, is we going to change the world?"
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.360]   Apparently from the reviews of the movie, that's really, Asha Kutcher is about 70 or 80%
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.680]   of the movie, and mostly about how we're going to change the world.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:51.000]   For the sake of humanity, Woz, it's really mythologizing.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.240]   And you know something, Woz, I don't want any of the credit for any of this.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.280]   When you tell this story, and I hope you will, I want you to give yourself credit for coming
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.280]   up with this idea.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.120]   Because I'm just here to for duty and humanity.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.680]   You're what we call a frontman, Woz.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.000]   I mean, in the reality, Woz, I've come with this hand, I've got to work on it a little
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   bit.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.560]   I think this shirt is a little too busy as a background for this hand gesture.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.440]   I think there's great promise in a lot of this.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.440]   Oh Lord.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.360]   I'm probably not even going to see it in the movies.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.600]   It looks like a terrible movie.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.600]   It looks like a terrible movie.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.600]   Everything else aside.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.840]   Yeah, I think that if they had made a good movie, I mean the reality is that the reason
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.040]   that we are complaining about this, because we actually know the people.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.040]   I mean Henry V or Braveheart, they're just as inaccurate as these are.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.240]   It's just that they were well made.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.160]   It's just going up against an Aaron Sorkin version of the movie.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.160]   So it's not...
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.240]   Which will be probably equally misrepresented, but at least it's here in Sorkin.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.240]   But it's going to be fantastic.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.560]   You have a lot of great Sorkinisms.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.280]   It's just like a man of all seasons.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.480]   Only a man of all seasons was actually good.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.520]   Well imagine that dialogue written by Sorkin.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.520]   Yes.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.520]   Even if it's here shortly after...
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.520]   They are walking and talking.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.320]   At some point he's going to...
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.320]   Because Woz...
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.560]   People don't like me after the first couple minutes.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.560]   That's right.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.200]   Woz over 12% think that I'm a rhyme repulsive at the beginning of it.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.280]   That's down from 8.9% of the 1971 to 1972.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.080]   Do you realize there were only 400,000 people?
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.400]   I'm a rhyme repulsive at 3 people who could actually start to sort of like me but still
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.400]   buy things from me.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.600]   If the price point were...
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.840]   We should point out, I mean the chatroom just said this and it's true.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.400]   There is a good movie already made called Pirates of Silicon Valley, which was a very
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:28.920]   good, I thought, accurate description of not just Apple, but Microsoft and others.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.320]   And to my knowledge it's fairly accurate.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.400]   It certainly didn't have the fictionalized pieces that some of these other movies have.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.400]   And the end is fantastic.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.560]   With Bill Gates and Steve Jobs arguing about who stole what from Xerox first.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.560]   Right.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.560]   Much better movie.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.000]   But still, I mean, as any Apple fan, you just don't like the ending where they made
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.440]   it out as though, "Oh, well thank God that Bill Gates rescued Apple, which was about
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.440]   ready to die."
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.440]   Well...
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.160]   If not for essentially 12 cents in pocket change and a written agreement that they're
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.560]   going to still make very successful software that was making Microsoft a lot of money,
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.480]   "Oh, what would have happened to Apple?"
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.920]   Well that's when it ended, right?
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.880]   It ended at the $100 million investment.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.880]   And that's where it ends.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:08.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:09.880]   The sequel ended.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.880]   The sequel.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.880]   They needed a sequel.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.880]   The return of...
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.880]   And I think that's kind of what both of these Jobs movies are trying to do, which is show
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.200]   the comeback kid, right?
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   Because this one...
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   Well, no, not really.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   Because this one ends with the iPod.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.880]   And the sort of one is only going to be three scenes.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.880]   The iPod launch...
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.880]   He's going to start with three scenes.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.200]   The Mac launch, the next launch, and the iPod launch.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.880]   But I'm sure there'll be flashbacks from that point.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.520]   Well, it's going to start right before and build up to the launch.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.840]   He loves the behind the scenes stuff.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.280]   So apparently it's going to be three big acts.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.280]   He said that.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:42.600]   Is there going to be the let legendary beatbox showdown between Jobs and Larry Ellison?
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.800]   Because I've always wanted to see that in the form of a movie.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.800]   Really?
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.800]   Is that true?
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   Is that true?
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.920]   They threw the linoleum down on the floor as they started building.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.440]   How do you think Steve's hair ended up like that?
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.440]   Steve's...
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.640]   Larry's the guy who invented that, like, hold the microphone out, drop it, and then walk
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:59.640]   away.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.080]   That was a Larry Ellison move.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.840]   He was wearing sound right when he did it.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.360]   You wouldn't need the device anymore because all of your audio would be in the cloud.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.360]   That was the gesture.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.400]   This just was re-appropriated by the hip-hop movement.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.400]   I know very much about hip-hop.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.240]   Mainly people don't ask me about it.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.240]   From now on.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.200]   In the hat-back Andy, spin that hat back.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.200]   See?
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.880]   Once is what I'm saying.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.280]   Microsoft has put its new office on sale today.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.560]   Now there's not a new office for the Mac, but a new pricing structure for the Mac, which
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.560]   I kind of like.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:40.840]   Microsoft Office 2013 is now available.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.680]   You can install five copies of office.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.680]   Any number of which could be office 2011 for the Mac or office 2013 for Windows.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.080]   You still have to use office though, don't you?
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.080]   Yes.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.320]   Is that part of the subscription?
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.240]   That's actually more expensive than the $99 a year.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.240]   I agree.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.240]   Hate them.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:00.040]   However, I'm sure still the number one Mac app was for many years anyway.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.040]   Oh, that was so painful.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.040]   Because people need to use it.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.280]   And I think that at least you can now put it on five machines.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.280]   Sure.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.280]   It's better.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.280]   So here's-
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.280]   You get to say the first time we started making updates.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.160]   The first time that we stopped using office was specifically overpriced.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.560]   So we were like, okay, well, we can buy the pages and everything else.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.560]   It's a lot cheaper.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.560]   They still do everything we need.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:26.240]   Then when we got used to using, for instance, numbers specifically, we never wanted to-
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.600]   I like pages and numbers, but I think that there's still friends-
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.600]   And Kino.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.600]   Music sell in the business office.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.600]   There's a point in embarrassment.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.400]   Business people want to use Excel.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.400]   They want pivot tables.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.400]   They want pivot tables.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.400]   And here's the thing.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.640]   Also, it's like driving a car in which it has a better sort of a steering system and
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.480]   braking system that works better, but everybody is trained to use what everybody is trained
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.480]   to use.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.480]   So if you learn on the-
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.480]   You've got an accelerator with my left foot.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.480]   And it is true.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.640]   I mean, because we have this even in our company where the business folks are still using Excel.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.480]   For heavy lifting, Excel is a lot more.
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.280]   It's just quicker.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.440]   Everything else that you would do with a spreadsheet.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:05.560]   So organizing stuff, making lists, making groups, everything else, numbers is so much
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:06.560]   better than Excel.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.520]   It is not even worth having the conversation.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.280]   For presentations, Kino is better than PowerPoint, too.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.720]   When you see someone on a Mac using PowerPoint, you were like, "What is wrong with you?"
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:20.680]   But I still get a lot of documents in DocX format.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.360]   I can open it in pages, but it doesn't look right.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.360]   I mean, it's just-
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.960]   I don't use Word, like if I have to write something, I'm not going to launch Word, I'll
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.520]   watch pages or nicest or any number of great processors.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.960]   I'll use VBEdit or InDesign, but I'll use nothing in between.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.160]   You still kind of need, if you work with the outside world, the non-Mac world.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.920]   Isn't the subscription model their dream?
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.800]   They've always wanted to have subscription revenue where you're paying them in perpetuity.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.560]   Now CS6 is subscription and Office is subscription.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.560]   It seems cheaper.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.560]   Because it's a hundred bucks a year.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.560]   It's a low barrier.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.560]   I don't think so.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.400]   Well, if you're getting constant upgrades, though, and you were paying the upgrades,
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.600]   I think they're really doing the math.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.080]   It's the same thing that we do with our phone.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.560]   We don't want to pay the big upfront cost, but we don't really calculate the fact that
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.200]   we're paying a subscription every week, every month.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.320]   So in some ways, by taking down the threshold, same thing with Photoshop, by taking that
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.120]   threshold down, we're, "Oh, I'm only paying 30 bucks a month or $50 a month."
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.120]   That's much easier for people to get into.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:24.400]   And I know that for us again, we're now moving much more to our subscriptions for Photoshop
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.560]   because I don't want to cope with 600 bucks because it's much harder for me to justify
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.800]   against my budgets on a monthly basis, where it's much easier for me to just say, "Well,
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.560]   it's $50 a month for these copies."
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.440]   We, too, we had a bunch of us just arrived.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:45.480]   Also, we're traditionally 9,000 time zones behind Redmond, Washington because we get
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.160]   our updates a year after the Windows version does.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.920]   But the Windows version does some cool things.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.280]   Like you can actually stream the app to any PC that's running Windows 7 or Windows 8.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.440]   So you can just sit down in front of any computer, sign in to your live ID, and it will simply
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.960]   send an actual working binary of Word or Excel or whatever you need to that desktop.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.720]   And it disappears when you sign out again.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:12.040]   So there's some value that's the subscription, but it's a weird thing.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.640]   It really is kind of a weird thing to the idea of, "I'm going to spend $99 a year for access
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.560]   to this software suite."
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:23.120]   If you really need the full suite, it can actually, and you have a lot of people in your household
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:28.480]   that can really pay off, but otherwise it's going to be, "Yeah, how much does pages cost
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.480]   15 bucks?
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.320]   How much does numbers cost?
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.320]   $15?"
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.400]   If you're in a business environment, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.400]   Exactly.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.400]   To do that.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.400]   I do agree with that.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.400]   I think that if you're at home thinking about it.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.640]   You also get 20 gigs of sky drives.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.320]   But it saves my default to sky drive, which is interesting.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.320]   That's kind of the wave of the game.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.640]   Sky drive is great.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:53.520]   I'm considering, I like iCloud and I use iCloud, I still need to have Dropbox because
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.560]   I need to have automatic syncing cloud storage, which I can actually have exposure to my documents
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.880]   where I can get it outside of the Apple ecosystem.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:07.040]   And Sky drive seems to be a nice hybrid between what iCloud does, what Dropbox does, and
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.760]   what Google Docs does, because they also offer an office compatible online editor for it.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:18.560]   Now, question is with Word, can you have multiple people editing at the same time?
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:22.320]   Simultaneously, that's the big thing for us is we'll get on a call.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.840]   You can if you're on a share point.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.960]   You have to kind of then install a collaboration.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:32.720]   I mean, for us, we'll get on a call and either on the phone or hang out or Skype and we'll
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.240]   sit there be talking and we're working on a document and we're all over the world in
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.240]   Google Docs and that's-
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.280]   Oh, you'll get an hour, a month of Skype free.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:48.480]   And here's the other thing.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.400]   I mean, I don't think you can do that collaboratively in Sky drive, but in Sky drive you have exposure
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.280]   to the document so I can move the document into Google Docs.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.640]   We can edit it, but I can put it back in the Sky drive.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.160]   Rest with iCloud, if it's there, it's there until I figure out a way to break it free
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.160]   from that.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.760]   It's even worse because with iCloud, for example, let's say I'm editing something in
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.480]   one text app and then a few weeks later an even better text app comes out and I start
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.360]   editing something in there and I delete the old app and then I realize, oh, all my documents
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.680]   were only shown in that old app.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.240]   And now I have no idea what app that was.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.080]   I can never find those documents again.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.520]   I have no clear view of all the documents I've ever put into iCloud.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.520]   Right.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.520]   That's a really bad scenario.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.320]   It's totally app dependent and that's not scalable.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.320]   They got to fix that.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.120]   I just don't understand why Apple has such a hard time with it.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.120]   It's not in their DNA.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.120]   It's not their hardware.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.120]   It's not their hardware company.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.880]   And they're a local software company.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.160]   We're going to take a break because I want to talk in just a bit with a article that
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:44.880]   just was published about OS X and how horrible it is, which kind of ties into this a little
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.880]   bit.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.280]   This is not the Bash Mac show though because we're going to have lots of good stuff too.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.160]   Like you can finally get porn on iOS through Vine.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.960]   I'm excited about that.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.560]   In six seconds.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.000]   Well, sometimes six seconds is all you need.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.040]   I'm just a fine.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.560]   And 500 PX is back.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:08.080]   So I gave Apple a really hard time for censorship, but they've worked it out.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.080]   It does.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.440]   So you can get it back.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.520]   But before we do that, let's talk a little bit about squarespace.com.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:18.680]   The secret behind some of the best looking, best performing websites in the world.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.520]   Now, do you not see my screen chat?
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.160]   Is that what we would have?
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.160]   Oh, yeah, you do.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.160]   There it is.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.160]   Okay, good.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.160]   Because I had to change my...
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.160]   I just wasn't getting audio.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.800]   Oh, well, heck with that.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.920]   That's because I had these little speakers which I'm going to talk about attached.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.640]   Squarespace is a hosting service plus software.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.960]   So it's the two things you need.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.320]   If you're going to create a website.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.800]   And by the way, this would be a great choice if you wanted to make a gift website.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:50.720]   You can go to squarespace.com, click the Get Started button, get a 14 day trial, set
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:55.480]   up the site, the template, everything, pay nothing, and then give it...
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.360]   They'll even if you sign up for a year, they'll give you the free domain registration.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:04.520]   They'll register the kid's name or if it's a wedding, the Veronica Belmont Ryan Block
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.520]   wedding.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.520]   You could...
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.520]   What do they call that?
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.520]   The Bell Block or the...
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.520]   Bell Block wedding.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.600]   Something like that.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.280]   You could create bellblock.com.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.720]   I think they actually did that.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.720]   Ryan was telling me...
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.720]   Tell them what?
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.720]   You're a block mod.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.720]   That's right.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.520]   Ryan was telling me that they went and they got an expensive...
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.920]   There's companies that do wedding sites and they got this expensive dedicated wedding.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.080]   It was terrible.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.320]   So they just went to squarespace and they set up a block mod.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:33.600]   I think this is a really great thing for one-offs, but then also if you're a heavy dude, let's
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.680]   say you're a photographer and it's important to show your portfolio, for instance.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.680]   My sister uses it.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.680]   Oh, what's your URL?
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.680]   Show it.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.680]   It's a familiar light.squarespace.com.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.760]   She hasn't even changed it yet.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.200]   Familiar light.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.200]   That's squarespace.com.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.760]   Now, by the way, people are saying, "Oh, don't everybody go there at once?
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.760]   Yes, you can.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.320]   You cannot bring a squarespace site down."
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.320]   It's the best hosting.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.080]   And I got to tell you, my sister is one of the best photographers I've ever met ever
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.080]   before.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.080]   She does your family a lot.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.640]   Yeah, and she's not technical when it comes to web stuff.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.760]   She built this all by herself in squarespace.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:13.520]   If you want to see great, incredible photos of kids, that's my sister's site.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.880]   So, photographers love it because you can do portfolios.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.200]   She's not really using a portfolio template.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.160]   I don't think she's using a blog.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:26.760]   It's a blog, but the point is that the fact that she really isn't technical and she's
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.400]   able to put this little blog up and show what she's doing, yeah, it's just--
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.800]   Well, the other thing that's cool about this is this site, now I'm looking at it on a Mac,
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.920]   but if you looked it on an iPhone or a tablet would automatically scale, I guess if I--
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:45.320]   you know what I could do is maybe if I squench this down, it will automatically scale-- I
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.520]   guess it doesn't do that because it knows it's still on a desktop.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.360]   But if you go on an iPhone, for instance, it's going to rearrange itself automatically.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.480]   Actually, you know what?
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.120]   She's not using the new--
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.120]   She may not have moved anywhere.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.120]   She may not have moved anywhere.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.120]   That's what it is.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.120]   So, that's the neat thing.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.680]   If you're going to Squarespace 6, which is the new version of Squarespace, you're going
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:09.360]   to get some great features that are new, things like mobile responsive design, the great new
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.600]   portfolios, they have widgets to tie to every social network.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.120]   So, you get automatic content pumped in from all your social networks.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.720]   I just love these templates.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.080]   Now, here's the best part.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.080]   Try it free for two weeks.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.920]   You need to offer code or credit card even.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.440]   You just need to set that up.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.160]   And if you decide you like it, look at the pricing.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.120]   There's two different plans.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:34.480]   Basic standard plan $8 a month when you buy an annual contract.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.520]   Unlimited is $16 a month with annual.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.640]   You're going to want to get the annual because that includes the custom domain, automatic
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.920]   hookup and everything.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:46.120]   And you can use our discount for your first purchase, Macbreak 1, if you're a new customer,
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.000]   for your first purchase, 10% off.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.560]   So that's going to really make a significant difference in the price overall.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.560]   What do you get for $16 a month?
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.560]   Unlimited.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.880]   Unlimited pages, galleries and blogs, great for a photographer.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.280]   Unlimited bandwidth.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.280]   So if all of a sudden you become the most popular site in the world, no big deal.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.920]   You don't get a bandwidth bill.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.920]   Unlimited storage.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.360]   You don't have to ever worry how many files you've got on there.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.320]   Even unlimited contributors, which means you can make a massive kind of newspaper site
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.800]   or I'm surprised more newspapers don't use Squarespace.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.200]   Really fantastic stuff.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.440]   Squarespace.com.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:22.000]   If you decide to buy, make sure you use the offer code Macbreak1 to save 10% on your first
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.840]   purchase on new accounts.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.360]   We love Squarespace.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.840]   We use it for our inside Twit blog.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:31.080]   It's the one part of the Twit empire that doesn't go down on a lot of traffic.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.280]   It's kind of frustrating.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.800]   Inside.twit.tv, that's our blog and it's running on a Squarespace blog.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.160]   Familiarlight.squarespace.com if you want to see Jennifer's pictures.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.120]   Get to see your nieces on here that's neat.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.120]   And nephews.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.120]   Denise.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:53.680]   Denise and the nephew.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.360]   I am by the way downloading office just because I like the idea of, you know, I could
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.480]   put it, I am in a heterogeneous environment.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.320]   I have some windows machines and Mac machines.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:06.600]   For me, 100 bucks is a really good deal for years worth of that stuff.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:13.000]   But moving along to some other stories, Macworld, Iworld, what do we expect this week that
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Iworld?
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.800]   One of those tiny little booths from CES fit into Moscone West.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:24.200]   I feel horrible saying that with the eyelash pavilion at CES now and with.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.760]   The eyelash is as big as Macworld, probably bigger.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.760]   It's bigger I believe.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.760]   Yeah, it's CES.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.720]   Because Macworld, at least when I used to go, it was two halls in Moscone.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.000]   I'll give you a little tip though.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.480]   There's a Mac company, I think it's HyperX.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.360]   They make external drives and battery back and stuff.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.240]   I don't know if they'll do it at Macworld, but at CES they had naked women.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.240]   Body paint.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.240]   Body paint and naked women.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.240]   Just a tip.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.240]   Dancing.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.240]   Just a little something.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.240]   They were originally camouflage.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.240]   They were originally part of the wall.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.480]   They would look identical to the wall, then they started moving and went inside.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.800]   So it was almost like a predator thing.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.800]   It was very scary.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.000]   It was creepy.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   And I'm not sure.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.200]   It would be very interesting to see because this is a different crowd.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.360]   It was really on the edge at CES already.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.360]   And I don't know.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.560]   I think people will throw stuff at them if they do this at Macworld.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.280]   But I'll be very curious.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.760]   We shall see.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.960]   Nobody makes announcements at iWorld anymore.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.040]   I heard that they were going to make announcements, but I haven't heard any of the announcements.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.040]   I see them worse than that.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.600]   Originally, Apple said they didn't want to be held to the schedule of Macworld.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.600]   So what did they do?
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.600]   An ounce something to be.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.760]   But then two years ago they did the Verizon iPhone right after Macworld.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.960]   And then last year they did the education event right after Macworld.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.000]   And today they announced 128 gigabyte iPad.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.960]   Like I mean, come on guys.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.840]   It's almost rubbing salt in the wound.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.840]   Are you waiting?
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.840]   And they move.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:44.160]   They moved Macworld to the end of January, early February and still Apple does it.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.600]   It almost as if they're there.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:50.280]   I mean, they can't be possible if they're considering this, but I don't know.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.280]   Is it a coincidence?
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.280]   I don't think Apple cares.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.280]   I think Apple has an ounce.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.280]   I don't either.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.280]   But it's just off.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.640]   I don't think they care at all.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.800]   But iWorld is actually a pretty good.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:04.680]   I've talked to several from PR people and they all think that iWorld is a really good bargain
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.480]   for them and their clients because it is a it's a focused show.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:13.680]   Not only that, but every person that you would want to have right about your kind of like
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.680]   niche esoteric product is definitely one haul in the same place for two or three days.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:22.600]   So it's a good opportunity to basically talk to 20 or 40 people that would take you about
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.440]   two weeks around ups to get at before.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.040]   So I hope this translates into, you know, this show continuing to be able to sell booth
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.400]   space and continue to operate and put on programs year after year after year.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.240]   I'm sure it will because the community really is.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.080]   I mean for me, as you know, I like to do my fun little coverage like I did at CES with
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:43.560]   my little iPhone, my little phone coverage.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.600]   And for me, it's just great to have some kind of conference, especially that's local to
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.560]   me that I can just go down there with my iPhone and just shoot a whole bunch of little pieces
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.240]   and put them up on YouTube and call it a day.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.160]   Well, it's easy for us because it's in San Francisco.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.800]   But if you're not, if you're from Montreal.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.800]   Well, the thing for me is like, Matt, last year, Mackerel was as fun as it was when Apple
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.840]   was there because, you know, they didn't have the big Apple keynote.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.200]   They don't have the huge booths that are now at CES.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.640]   But it turned out to me that didn't matter.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.840]   I liked seeing all the people from the Apple community.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.960]   I liked meeting all of it because at CES, it's you have buyers, you have press, and then
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.160]   you have some people who like consumer electronics.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.400]   But at Mackerel, do you have people who just love Apple?
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.400]   And it's a fun game.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.880]   I was saying Mackerel has always been even now.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:24.600]   Just what you're saying is always been a show for enthusiasts and not all the other interests
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.280]   that oftentimes tie these up.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.280]   And you know what?
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.640]   No one has a Steve Jobs keynote at their event anymore.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.640]   Right.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.480]   In fact, I think now we can look back at Mac, those days at Mackerel where Moscone West
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.760]   was jammed in the buzz and the excitement were palpable and you knew Steve was going
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.160]   to come on stage and knock everybody.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.160]   Those we can look back with some great nostalgia because those were amazing, heady times.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.600]   And I don't know if you really appreciated it.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:53.640]   It's going to be hard to explain to people later on that when I went to back when Steve
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.560]   Jobs was keynoteing in Mackerel every single year, I would be getting calls from friends
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.160]   a month in advance saying, "Duke, you get me into the keynote?"
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.160]   Right.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.960]   I'm going to talk about people who are planning on going to Mackerel there being a serverless
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:05.960]   guy.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.400]   I'm talking about people who are going to make a special trip because they just wanted to
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.400]   see a Steve Jobs concert.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.080]   They wanted to see all of us in the Beatles on stage.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.800]   And maybe Randy Newman afterward.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   Yes.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.320]   You never know because the iTunes announcements.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.080]   But that's how big the thing was.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:23.120]   I mean, arguably that 2007 iPhone event was one of his best keynote ever.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.320]   I think of that keynote where he goes.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.320]   An internet device.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.320]   What were the three things?
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.160]   An internet, a breakthrough internet communicator, a phone.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.160]   A phone.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.160]   And a phone.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.160]   Are you getting it yet?
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.160]   It's communicator.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.160]   Phone.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.160]   iPod.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.160]   Communicator.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.160]   Phone.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.640]   That was master showmanship stagecraft.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.760]   We were all excited.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.240]   It was you, me, Scott Borne.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.720]   We're sitting in a row there.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.240]   And we're three inches off of the chair with excitement.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.800]   And Scott, then you throw his trio down and start stomping on it.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   I don't even know what to say.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   Scott knew he wanted that iPhone.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.200]   He was the first in line of the Apple Store.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.840]   Scott jumped up and said, "Steve, I'll give you $50 million for that device right now."
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.000]   I'm not a vet to make.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.120]   Well, and remember, you couldn't get it.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.280]   It was announced in January.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.920]   You couldn't get it till months later.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.920]   June.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.560]   Then it was $600 for an on contract device.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.200]   It didn't hurt the demand then.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.200]   I'll tell you that.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.400]   Let me see if I can find the Steve Jobs iPhone announcement.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.400]   The other thing is I don't think anyone ever--
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.400]   This was that Mac world, right?
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.400]   And part of it, of course, what made this work in a lot of ways.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.280]   I don't think anyone ever spent as much time preparing as well.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.640]   The thing is, there was nothing random about what Steve did.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.640]   Do you have my audio at all?
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.640]   No.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.920]   You're going to have to go into system preferences and change it.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.920]   I wonder--
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:41.560]   I mean, that makes me now think again about some of these Steve Jobs biographies that
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:46.600]   you do patent-- when they do the biopic about patent, you start off with, you know, Georgie
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:51.840]   Scott taking the stage and delivering a patent address as patent and making you believe he
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.840]   is he.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:57.040]   I'm wondering if the filmmakers of both-- either those movies are going to have the guts to
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:02.000]   have their guy try to be Steve Jobs in that context.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   It might be--
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.400]   No, why they tried it at the end.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:10.000]   I think that's why Sorkin is focusing on those events, but it's backstage because there's
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.840]   no competition with the actual presentation we saw.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.960]   You're seeing something behind the scenes that you could credibly say this is what Steve
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.280]   was doing behind stage.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.280]   But you can't--
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.280]   And it would be--
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:25.360]   And also me, no, no, no, while he was portraying Steve Jobs when he was still in the phase of
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.360]   the band where they were playing intimate clubs.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.560]   I can see no way else, Steve Jobs.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.560]   This is--
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.560]   Yeah, we need arena jobs.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.560]   You know?
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:40.000]   We need-- it's going to be-- I think you're setting up any really even a good actor for
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   man.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.180]   If you are-- if you are not at the best of your possible game today, if you are not
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:51.520]   like playing the lead in "Sid and Nancy," you know, if you're not Gary Oldman in "Sid
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:56.080]   and Nancy," that good, you-- why don't we find a plan B here?
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.440]   I still don't have audio.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.480]   But I have video, right?
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.480]   And you don't-- you don't hear any audio?
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.480]   Yeah, I'm not hearing anything.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.480]   Nothing, huh?
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.480]   It's crazy.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.480]   Tri-cast is on.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.480]   So low.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.480]   Yeah, let's do it.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.480]   We can just all do it together.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.480]   Here we go.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.480]   I'm getting it.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.480]   Are you getting it yet?
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.480]   It's getting it.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.480]   It's getting it.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.480]   It's one device.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.360]   Boy, you know, it's so funny.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.920]   You don't appreciate it when you're sitting there.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.720]   I mean, we did appreciate it.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:28.120]   But now I was telling Steve Wozniak in that parking garage in 1974, it's a device that
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.120]   everybody wants.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.720]   Everybody wants it, Steve.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.400]   Why are you holding it back?
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.400]   Don't keep it to yourself.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.400]   It's a phone, Woz.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.400]   Don't you understand what it's all about?
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.400]   It's a phone.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.400]   It's a phone for people.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.400]   No, Woz.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.400]   I guess I can't be all tied up in wealth and material.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.400]   It was also--
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.400]   It's like you are.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.400]   The last time Steve was really healthy.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.040]   He looked a little frail, but he was really-- he was--
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.200]   He was the height of his powers.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.760]   It was Sinatra at 50.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.360]   You could see the years taking a little toll, but he's still at the height of his powers.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.360]   It's just a really amazing--
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.240]   Boy, I would love to play this.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.240]   Nothing.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.240]   No.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.760]   Try restarting your computer.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.760]   It's an audio issue.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.760]   It's because you have to be plugged in.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.760]   He restarted a reset.
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.800]   All right, we're going to restart.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.640]   In fact, while I'm restarting, because I do want to play this, we'll do a little break
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:14.160]   and then come back and we'll talk-- we'll play this Steve Jobs clip.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.400]   Because I know people can hear it in their heads.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.400]   No people are seeing it in their minds, but we've got to be turned into her.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.400]   We've got to do it again.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.480]   We've got to do it again.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.080]   Our show today brought to you by the friends-- we got a new sponsor.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.480]   Are you ready?
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.200]   Like the name of Resumeita.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:37.320]   The Resumeita-- streamline hiring and increased traffic to job postings.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.480]   It's a hiring solution for small and fast growing businesses.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.960]   We've actually started using it to post jobs.
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:47.200]   The Resumeita-- if you're a hiring manager, an HR professional, a business executive,
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:52.560]   like me just trying to get some help, you'll reduce the time spent on hiring tasks by 50%.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:58.840]   The cost per hire by as much as 85% by replacing your HR inbox or applicant tracking system
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.480]   with the Resumeita.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:04.080]   So we're not just talking like a website, like a job posting website.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.440]   We're talking an end-to-end hiring package.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:11.480]   It manages the entire process of hiring from attracting great applicants to selecting your
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.960]   next employee.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.600]   Otherwise, Twit grows, we've been looking for a solution that helps us manage this because
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.960]   it's kind of the irony of it.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.320]   We haven't done the hiring yet, so we need to do the hiring.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.880]   We don't have the people to do the hiring.
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.200]   So we need something to streamline it.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.400]   And this is huge.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.400]   We're not alone.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.800]   You know who else uses the Resumeita?
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:33.840]   Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, have all used the Resumeita to manage hiring.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:34.840]   It helps you with the sourcing.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:39.680]   You can attract applicants to your jobs using your website, free job boards, social media
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.480]   connections.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.920]   It helps you screen applicants so you can track, rank and discuss resumes.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:50.240]   By the way, this is becoming really important nowadays with this new committee hiring process
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.520]   where you don't want to just, I'm not just going to let Lisa hire.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:57.400]   We actually have our hires go be interviewed by the other people in the department.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.240]   It's really team hiring nowadays.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.840]   This helps you with that.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:04.520]   You can schedule meetings with candidates, collect feedback from your entire team, and
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.240]   of course it helps you hire.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.640]   You can collaborate together.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.280]   Our team will collaborate together and compare and help us select the best person for the
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.280]   job.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.280]   I just sent it to Carlita.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.280]   You need this.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.120]   We got a 14 day trial for you.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:20.440]   If you're a business owner, hiring manager, HR professional, check it out.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.440]   14 day trial.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.560]   Let me get the URL for you.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:31.840]   The Resumeita, T-H-E-R-E-S-U-M-A-T-O-R dot com slash Mac break.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:38.440]   Theresumeita.com slash Mac break and after the free trial, the base package is $100 a
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:43.480]   month, $99 a month and it covers five open jobs and five users.
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.960]   There are other packages as you grow.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.960]   Lisa really loved this.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.400]   I have a quote.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.480]   The Resumeita helped us figure out the best way to manage recruiting and track applicants.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:00.800]   It was awesome to stop the flow of resumes coming into my email inbox.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.800]   We have an email address.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.800]   Jobs@twit.tv.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.360]   Good luck.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.040]   This is a much better system.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.880]   Using the Resumeita, all the resumes and questionnaire responses get centralized into
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.880]   one place.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.000]   I want you to try this one.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.440]   Brand new, we're really happy to welcome them to the Mac.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:22.040]   They particularly want to be a Mac break because they said those people are smart.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.040]   They understand.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.520]   They're the kind of people we want.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.400]   Because Leo, we've seen that show and we know that you're going to be looking for new
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.200]   staff, new audio hosts very soon.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.200]   We are.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.200]   We are.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.200]   We are.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.200]   All right.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.200]   Now, do you hear audio from me now?
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.200]   The Resumeita.com/Macbreak.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.800]   Do you hear audio from me now?
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   No.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.800]   It's you.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.800]   It's your fault.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:42.800]   I don't know.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.800]   I'm Tri-Kasters live.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   I'm soloing the correct.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   You have an email output.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.800]   You have an email output?
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.400]   Yeah, I can try to play it.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.400]   Let me find it.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.600]   And do you have an output set to HDMI?
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.600]   Of course.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.400]   That's the first thing I checked out.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.400]   I was just checking.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:03.400]   You don't think I'm wearing all this 49ers gear for nothing, do you?
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:07.800]   I hear you've got people in New Orleans this week too.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.000]   You're not going though, huh?
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.640]   I'm not going.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:11.640]   I am.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.400]   Now, now I've lost control of the computer entirely.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.400]   It's just the O8.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.000]   You know, thinking about it?
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   No, O7.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   It wasn't.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.400]   It was the iPhone O7 announcement.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.720]   You know, we could recreate another great Expo keynote event.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.240]   We could just have you like throw the computer at Chad and say, you know, you know so much,
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.440]   you fix it.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.440]   Giant screen.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.440]   Here we are.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.440]   Now you hear it.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.440]   No.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.440]   Welcome again to another episode of the--
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.440]   That's not the one I want.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.560]   Jonathan Stark is his name.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:42.960]   I don't care about that guy.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.400]   I want Mr. Steve Jobs.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.400]   You've heard of him.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.400]   I have.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.400]   I have.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.400]   I'm a lovely man.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.800]   In New Gene's Black Turtle Neck.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.800]   Genius.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.480]   If you could paste the link to that video in the doc, that'd be great.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.480]   All right.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.480]   You don't hear anything.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.480]   Nope.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.480]   I'm sorry, folks.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.480]   I didn't mean it.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.280]   All of you folks in the audience, do anybody know like rope tricks like close up magic?
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.680]   We could use a similar right now.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.720]   Actually, somebody got up from our studio audience is trying to help them.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.960]   I love that.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.960]   It's a team, man.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.960]   Community minded.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.960]   Team.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:13.960]   They got up and pushed.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.400]   I'll paste it right under the ad thing there.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:20.160]   Look like Amanda Effing Palmer here.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.120]   An iPod.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.120]   Here we go.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.120]   Turn that up.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.120]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:31.000]   Just got a gun of pauses because I think you can hear Scott born in the background.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   Go back a little bit.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Go back a little bit.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   This is 2007.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   This is the iPhone announcement.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.480]   And by the way, a pirated video.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.640]   This is not Apple's official video.
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.960]   I don't know who would do that.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.960]   An iPod.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:44.960]   A phone.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.960]   The audience is getting it.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.960]   He's having a couple of times.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.960]   I know.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:57.320]   These are not three separate devices.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.320]   This is one device.
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.320]   Now pause it again.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:03.240]   Because remember, in 2007, we knew that they were going to do the iPhone.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.040]   We were pretty sure that it was the iPhone.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.880]   But it's only a rumor at this point.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:12.520]   But everybody, I mean, Scott Born spent on this show three months talking about the iPhone.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.520]   Right.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.520]   We'll throw it.
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.520]   Yeah, click wheel.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.520]   Phone.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.400]   We'll do everybody who's convinced.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.280]   And we just wanted to see it.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.680]   And so you sit in the end, of course, Steve starts with, "We're doing really well.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.960]   The stores are doing really well.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.960]   We sold a million, man."
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.400]   We're like, "Shone up and get to the universe."
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.400]   In your career, if you can do just one great thing, we've done three great things.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.400]   Go ahead.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.400]   Now you can finish it.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.400]   The crowd is so excited.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.400]   And we are calling it iPhone.
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.400]   Which is cool.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:53.040]   Today, today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.040]   And here it is.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.120]   That's what everybody thought, right?
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.440]   We were waiting for that.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:00.960]   It has a dial on it.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.960]   It's an iPod with a dial.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.880]   You don't dial anyone with Zeros.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.440]   We're going to leave it there for now.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.040]   Oh, that was talking about teas.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.040]   He had it in his pocket.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.320]   The mobile device.
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.480]   This is what everybody else was using.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.480]   This is what I was using.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.480]   A blackberry curve at the time.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.480]   I had a trio.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.880]   No, it was a trio.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:15.880]   That was a trio.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.880]   A giant screen.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.880]   Here it is.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:18.880]   First time we saw it.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.400]   How are we going to communicate this?
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.520]   We don't want to carry around a mouse, right?
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.040]   So what are we going to do?
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.840]   Oh, a stylus, right?
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.000]   We're going to use a stylus.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   No.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.120]   We're going to use the best pointing device in the world.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.800]   We're going to use a pointing device that we're all born with.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.000]   We're born with 10 of them.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   We're going to use our fingers.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.600]   This was huge, by the way, because everybody else was using a stylus.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.560]   In fact, the stylus is back with a Samsung Galaxy Note.
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:47.320]   But Jobs was really clear.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:50.520]   They were going to solve this without a stylus.
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:54.520]   And they were using resistive styluses to put pressure to make the contact.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.160]   I just take my finger in high school.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.240]   Fairly revolutionary.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.840]   Inertial scrolling, rubber banding.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.120]   You can see why Apple wants to defend these patents.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.120]   Right.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.720]   This was breakthrough stuff.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.440]   This is scu-morphism done right.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.040]   Let me show you something else.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.440]   I just take my unit here.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:12.440]   It is.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:13.440]   It's gimorphism.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.440]   Oh, look what you're looking for.
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.080]   I'm in cover flow.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.080]   [CHEERING]
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.080]   Remember, cover flow.
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.440]   Wouldn't it be great if you had six voicemails?
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.440]   If you didn't have to listen to five of them first, one of them--
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.440]   This was huge, too.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.440]   Visual voicemails.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.440]   Right.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.440]   Wouldn't that be great if you had random access voicemail?
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.120]   Well, we've got it.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:36.240]   Just like email, you can go directly to the voicemails that interest you.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.560]   You can see the buttons change to merge calls right there in the middle.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.480]   So I just push that right here.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.480]   And now I've been--
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.000]   Again, we're used to this now.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   All phones do this.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.400]   But at the time, this was--
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.400]   Right.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.400]   We were using Blackberries.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.400]   This was huge.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.400]   It would crash every time I made a call or received a call.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.560]   Anyway, I just-- I wanted to play that because those were the days, my friends.
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.280]   We thought they'd never end.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.280]   We'd laugh.
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.680]   We'd sing and have a song, but times have changed.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.760]   So now we've moved ahead.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.120]   Once upon a time, there was a tap waiting.
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.120]   You used to do it.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:13.400]   So I just couldn't leave it one or at least started singing.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.400]   Thank you, sir.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:15.400]   Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.960]   I was hoping that you would start off.
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:18.960]   That's a great song.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.480]   You have a lovely radio voice.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.480]   We should do it.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.280]   You know, I am building a sound studio.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.280]   So when we finish it--
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.280]   Do you like recording studio?
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:26.280]   Really nice one.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.280]   You're like from music.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.280]   Here?
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.280]   In this building?
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.280]   I'm not in this building across the street.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.280]   Across the street, you've got more space.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.280]   I'm working on it.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.280]   I'm not in this space.
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.280]   So you're going to have a recording studio for all of your recordings.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.280]   Do you like a music?
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.280]   Like a band?
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.080]   What?
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.080]   Is this a new business for you?
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:44.000]   No, it's actually mixed with the business that I have now.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.800]   Always amazing, Alex Lindsay.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:49.000]   So what I was going to say is we're going to get-- we'll have to make it--
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.200]   Andy, I could do a duet.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.200]   Yes.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.440]   We could do it like Sinatra duets, where you could be on the east coast.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.440]   I'll be on the west coast.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.440]   Those were the courgette tracks.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.440]   Those were the courgette tracks.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.440]   No, we'll bring Andy out.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.440]   I was just emailing--
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:03.880]   I was hoping for more, but you know, darling Barbara Streisand thing, like interspecial.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:04.880]   Oh, OK.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:05.880]   Whatever.
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.080]   You want to lie on the piano?
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.520]   I think we should do a duet.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.160]   No, I'd rather lie on the show.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.160]   Hey.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.160]   I don't remember.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.360]   I was emailing with Steve Martin who's done a new album.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.040]   He's going to come on to talk about it in April, but the way he's recording it is with
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.760]   Edie Brickell.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:26.840]   And the way he recorded it, he would play the banjo into his iPhone and record the audio,
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:32.520]   send it to Edie, who would then sing the song into GarageBand and send it back to him,
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.360]   and then they'd mix it down.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.360]   That's crazy.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:40.080]   Anyway, we'll have them on in April to talk about that.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.600]   So Apple did make an announcement today.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.480]   They took this-- actually, not this, but you can't tell the difference, so I'm going
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:46.640]   to hold it up anyway.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.320]   They took this, which is supposedly an iPad fourth generation.
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.080]   This is a third generation.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.240]   And they put 128 gigs of Ram in it.
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.840]   Yeah, hey, Crowd goes crazy.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.920]   $4, $7.99, $800.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.640]   That's without-- that's Wi-Fi only.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.640]   Yep.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.640]   Really?
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:02.640]   The crowd goes crazy.
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.640]   This is something you've been demanding, you've been wanting.
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:04.640]   Yes.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.640]   I've been working for gig limit all the time.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:07.640]   You do?
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:08.640]   I used to.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:09.640]   I don't--
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:11.880]   Now with iCloud, you need music to match.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:15.040]   But here's the thing is, I travel a lot, and I don't have a great connection all the
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.040]   time.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.040]   No, I don't want every-- believe me, I don't want everything on there.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.040]   I just want--
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.040]   Is it more than music?
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.040]   It's movies.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.040]   It's an ego thing.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.040]   I think it--
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.040]   I think it--
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.040]   I started to get--
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.840]   I'm sorry, I've started to get a lot of, you know, iBooks as well that I'm starting
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.840]   to download, and some of these are like--
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.840]   Those can be big believe or not gigs.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.840]   Text books, like Kindle books are small.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.840]   But these have lots of multiples.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.840]   Even games are big these days.
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:38.840]   Well, I think that--
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:41.040]   I think we see the writing on the wall that eventually these iBooks, the limit, I think
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.000]   which is now two gigs, is that right?
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.640]   Is it two or four gigs for the iBook?
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.040]   But either way, you know, I think that the writing on the wall is--
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.120]   Oh no, they're much bigger than that.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.360]   But I think that limit's going to go up.
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.360]   And so as we look at--
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.360]   No, they're much bigger than that.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.360]   I've seen five gigs.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.360]   Maybe they're multiple files.
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.360]   Maybe multiple files.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.360]   But I thought it was only--
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.360]   I thought it was--
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.360]   Author will only make a two gig.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.360]   No, no, no, I thought there was a limit there.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.360]   We'll find out what it is.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:08.320]   But I think that 16 gigs is a great number for a fully featured iBook.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.320]   So I think--
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:10.320]   Because we're building iBooks right now.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.560]   So as we deal with this number, trying to keep the number low.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:19.080]   But when you really start adding video interaction and all this other stuff, and it's more than
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:22.680]   10 pages long, you start to really want to have a lot of--
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:28.080]   So if you're looking at this as a way to have that kind of information local for schools,
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.360]   for corporations, those things become an issue.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.320]   I think it's more of a--
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.360]   I do think it's more of a vertical thing than anything else.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.360]   Oh, interesting.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.360]   You are going to--
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:37.360]   You are going to--
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:41.040]   For the textbook market, all these other markets, which they--
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.360]   I think that it's a lot like--
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.120]   When I was reading about this morning, I thought the--
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.320]   Where the pop in my mind was McRib.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.040]   And not just because I was hungry for a McRib sandwich.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.040]   It's like--
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.040]   Come on, tell it to us.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.040]   You'd think that all the time.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.040]   Yes.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.040]   McRib.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:00.920]   There were a couple of articles trying to explain the economic theory behind why the McRib comes
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.840]   out just so sporadically.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:03.840]   And the explanation is--
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.560]   This is disgusting.
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:06.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:09.400]   I'm going to break Andy's heart.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:10.400]   That's fine.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.760]   I was playing with my McRib analogy, but that's fine.
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.760]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.400]   No, there's another reason I'm sure.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:22.240]   I'm saying that there's a complicated calculus that says that here's what the component parts
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.800]   are priced at.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:24.920]   Here's how much we can deliver.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:25.920]   I think part of it--
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:30.480]   I think there was a complicated calculus involved here in which they had been hearing
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.720]   I know from-- excuse me.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:37.320]   There have been some vocal groups that have been saying, hey, we don't necessarily need
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:43.120]   more storage on the iPad, but boy, if you came up with a 128 gig iPad, our market right
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.040]   here, we would know exactly what to do with that.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:48.560]   You couple that with prices on ram dropping.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.680]   And without having to make a big deal about it, without having to say, we're going to now
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:55.840]   give you 128 gigs for the price of 64.
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:51:01.360]   It allows you to put this on the price list and reach out to other markets without really
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:05.320]   having to really stick their tongue out and stick their tongue with flag poles, so to
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:06.320]   speak.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:11.520]   I've been kicking around with a bunch of people, talking to a developer this morning who was
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:16.720]   speculating, but it was an interesting theory that maybe this is at least partly a nod towards
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:23.360]   iOS 7 or iOS 8, having a feature for developers that allow us to swap memory for disks for
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:30.240]   storage space like a can on the desktop OS, so that if you have an application that needs
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:35.440]   to process lots and lots of data, that it will be able to essentially create as much
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:40.480]   application space as it needs to for any given app, simply by paging memory to storage and
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:41.480]   back again.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.280]   I don't think-- I'm not sure if I'm 100% convinced, but it was an interesting idea.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.360]   I just think it was the sort of idea where they've been aware for a long time that there
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:53.120]   are a bunch of markets like Education that would definitely be able to exploit extra
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.880]   storage on the iPad.
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:59.840]   Prices of RAM or in their stocks of RAM are now at a level where it allows them to do
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:06.760]   this as a top level thing as a special device without any real pain by maybe selling some
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.880]   more devices.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:13.920]   John Syracuse, when I was talking about this on Twitter, also came up with the idea that
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:19.800]   maybe it's a way to have an additional super high margin product on the price line because
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.800]   it's the same product.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:25.160]   All they have to do is add more RAM of which they got plenty, which costs a lot less than
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.960]   the markup for this device.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.320]   So maybe that was part of it too.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:30.520]   I think there's a lot of variables here that went into play.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:33.680]   I think for a lot of people that is the distinguishing factor, I didn't buy a 4 because
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.240]   I was like, well, I got a 3.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.240]   Now with 128, I'm like--
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.240]   I was sitting and getting a 4.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.880]   I was like, OK, now I need more to get the 4.
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:45.240]   And I got to say that I am the biggest fan of the iPad in the world.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.560]   This is my regular computer.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:48.240]   I don't travel with a MacBook.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.400]   I travel with this.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:54.520]   And even I'm like, gee, if I'm running out of space with 64 gigs on this, that's because
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:56.880]   I'm not being in any way disciplined about this storage.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.880]   I ran into storage errors about a week ago.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:04.320]   And that became-- well, that means that I've got these 13 gigabytes worth of raw files
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.600]   that I imported off my camera like eight months ago that I haven't done anything with because
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:09.600]   I have 64 gigs.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.040]   So I simply tidy up a little bit, then I'll simply be all the way back to where it was
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.040]   before.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:17.600]   So I don't think they're saying that 128 gigs is now the new normal for in any way or even
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.600]   the new maximum for normal users.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:20.600]   I just let you be sloppier.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:24.680]   I think Andy hit it exactly on the head though when-- because there's only so much
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.800]   room inside, even an iPad, it's mostly battery.
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.440]   There's very little space inside it.
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.000]   And that RAM slot is the RAM slot that they have.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.120]   And last year, there was rumors about--
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:36.080]   going to 128, but the price of double density RAM was too high.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.720]   They wouldn't get the component pricing to do it.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:42.800]   And this year, it's cheap enough that they can take out that 64, put in a double density
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.440]   128, and sell it--
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:45.440]   100 bucks more.
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.440]   Yeah, for 100 bucks more?
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.440]   And it costs you 20 bucks more.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:50.880]   It's not as high a margin for them as going to 64 because that's still cheap RAM for them.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:51.880]   Remember the big bucks are?
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.800]   You have to upgrade your iCloud storage to back up this thing.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.200]   They're trying to get some money out of iCloud storage.
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.080]   I'm already maxed out and I have too much.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:01.960]   I mean, that's another failure point of iCloud.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:07.440]   The first time I've been able to back up my iPad in about a month was just this weekend
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.840]   because I bought a bigger hard drive for my MacBook because iCloud just does not give
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.520]   you enough storage to have two devices and back the load.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:15.520]   And no option.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.520]   You turn off--
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:20.880]   Unless exactly, unless you say, well, this data isn't important to me or I'm going to
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.920]   get the smaller capacity device and you're not supposed to be able to do that.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:27.880]   You're supposed to have, look, everything that I do in this device is wirelessly and automatically
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:28.880]   backed up to a cloud.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:29.880]   I don't have to worry about it.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:33.360]   If it's always telling me-- sorry, that you're going to have to increase your storage.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.360]   Okay, let's go.
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:35.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:36.360]   You're not allowed to increase your storage anymore.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.320]   Well, we saw is that photo stream is free, but camera rolls not free.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:43.160]   A lot of people just leave camera roll on and then every video and every photo you take
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.000]   gets put up to iCloud.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.280]   And then by the way, that's where you start running out of room is where you never delete
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:50.840]   photos ever or videos ever.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.800]   And you're going to go around Mac world to make videos and now you have enough storage,
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.800]   you could do 20.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:58.640]   No, I have gotten into habit of leaving those ones that are on YouTube.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.680]   It's like that's where there's a huge chunk of stuff.
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.640]   We should mention-- I think it's clear.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.120]   We're not talking about RAM, obviously.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:05.960]   I still have 512 megs of RAM.
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:07.480]   I think in there I've got it.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.800]   It's NAND flash storage.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.640]   It's your drive and this thing.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:15.920]   And it's interesting because the pricing is you double for every 100 bucks you add, you
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.720]   double the NAND flash.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:19.520]   So you go from 16 gigs at $4.99.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.360]   This is on the Wi-Fi model.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:24.760]   32 gigs, $5.99, 64 gigs, $6.99.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.760]   And for 100 bucks more, $120.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:27.760]   So the price of the gig drops.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:28.760]   Kind of interesting.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:29.760]   You're doubling it.
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:30.760]   It's kind of a hockey stick.
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:31.760]   Now, I'm looking.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.360]   It's not on the Apple store yet.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.360]   It's coming soon.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.360]   They lost to a sale.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.120]   Do we get 256 for $8.99?
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:40.040]   Now I've actually decided, yeah, what's next?
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.040]   $8.99?
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.480]   It's also-- it's fun to speculate.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:47.440]   And the other thing that you think about is, what if they're going to be upgrading the
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:48.800]   camera and the iPad soon?
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:53.440]   And it's going to be starting to be able to record-- to take higher resolution pictures,
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.360]   taking better definition videos.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:56:00.480]   And they figured that they can either fix some very, very incredibly hard problems on
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:03.960]   how to compress this down and storage onto existing devices.
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.360]   Or they can simply say, it's going to be painful to use this feature on a 16 gig machine.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:11.720]   It will be acceptable to use it on 32 or 64.
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:15.360]   But those who intend to use this iPad as a capture device for this new audio or video
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.560]   or photo, we have a new option of 128 gigs.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:21.200]   I don't think it's designed to solve any one problem.
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:26.120]   I think it's just, again, a calculus with lots of variables and the price of storage
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.120]   going down so far.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:28.120]   They said, OK, let's just do it.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.720]   One of our writers, Georgia, did the math.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:34.720]   And for 16 gigabytes at 329-- this is for an iPad Mini, you're paying 20 bucks a gigabyte.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.960]   And you got a 64, you're paying 8 bucks a gigabyte.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.960]   Do you know what Apple's cost on this is?
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.800]   About 50 cents a gigabyte.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:44.160]   So that's good money.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.160]   Take it in.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:46.160]   We'll play it.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.160]   We'll play it Apple.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:50.160]   We'll play it.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.400]   And new Apple TV update too.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:53.400]   What?
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.400]   Bluetooth.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.400]   We got Bluetooth keyboards.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.400]   Bluetooth keyboards.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:59.240]   Why would I need a keyboard on my Apple TV?
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:01.000]   The only thing I would do is search.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.080]   If you wanted to turn an Apple TV into a computer--
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.600]   To a IOS device.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:10.160]   Or into a computer for about 80% of the population, you would first make the keyboard work.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:14.200]   Now, are you telling me that the Bluetooth-- I'd have to buy a new Apple TV, right?
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.200]   It's not built in the old--
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.800]   No, they already have Bluetooth.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:17.800]   The latest Apple TV.
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:19.680]   They have it in there and they didn't turn it on.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.680]   They unleashed the Kraken.
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:22.200]   They unleashed the Kraken.
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:24.000]   Wow.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   That was sneaky of them.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.200]   Did we know there was Bluetooth in there?
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.200]   Yes.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.200]   We knew that you could look in there.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:29.200]   It should look in the board.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:31.200]   So the thing-- there's no good reason.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:34.200]   I mean, sure you can enter all your passwords, but you can already do that with your iPad
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.200]   or your iPhone.
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.200]   It's not really necessary.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:37.200]   What really--
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.200]   That's an open-sport.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.200]   You can use the remote on your iPhones.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:40.200]   It's great, by the way.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.200]   If you don't have a-- if you haven't done that, you know, you get the remote for your
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.200]   iPhone.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.560]   And then you can type all your passwords in and all your searches and everything else.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:51.720]   But having a keyboard, what that really opens up is a lot of us who use our-- instead
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:58.880]   of using Apple TV, we use a mini as our-- to run on the TV so that we can surf the web,
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:02.280]   so that we can do-- you know, do all the other things that we want to do.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:08.200]   Well, now all Apple has to do-- I mean, we have a fully operational iOS device sitting
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.520]   connected to all of our TVs.
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:14.800]   If we make that, have a lot of the features that we would normally have on an iPad or
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:18.280]   iPhone, people like my parents, it's like all they use there.
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:22.920]   I mean, you know, checking their email, surfing the web, you know, doing those things is--
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:23.920]   all they're doing.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:27.560]   And so the thing is the Apple-- now we really start looking at a post-PC world.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:28.560]   Turn on FaceTime.
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:29.560]   And--
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:32.960]   You turn on FaceTime on, and you really start.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:33.960]   Is that a--
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:34.960]   There is a USB now.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.440]   There's a USB in the Apple TV.
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:37.440]   Yeah, it is.
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:38.440]   We're not using that either.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.440]   No.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:40.440]   That's a merely a service port.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:44.920]   Apple TV is confusing because it runs iOS 6, but they call it software version 5.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:48.200]   So it's the Insolator software version 5 update, 5.1 or 2.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.200]   And available today.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:52.480]   It was available when iOS 6.1 came out same day.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:53.480]   It was also available today.
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.840]   So we're going to take a break and talk about iOS 6.1.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:01.440]   What is in this new iOS and why are they announcing it?
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:04.120]   I just updated it and it's a big splash screen.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.400]   Wow, I have iOS 6.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.680]   I thought I had that before.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:08.920]   Well, let's find out when we come back.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.160]   But first a word.
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:13.720]   For those of you about to register a domain name, I know it's one of the fun games we all
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.280]   play is-- oh, that's a great.
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.880]   I wonder if that domain name's taken.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:23.200]   I just found out that freepants.org, one of my sites, is now up for renewal.
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.200]   And I have to decide.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:25.200]   Freepants?
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:26.200]   That's an awesome site.
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:28.600]   Should I save freepants or let it go?
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.760]   So you can get some money for it.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:32.760]   I should put it up on Hover.
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:34.240]   You just have that thing where you have to sell it.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.240]   I see how much someone's going to pay you.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.240]   Somebody might want freepants.
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:37.240]   $350.
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:40.520]   They say the site's not free, but the pants are.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:46.600]   Hover.com is a wonderful site for domain name registration made simple.
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:47.600]   These are the folks at 2CAS.
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:50.680]   I told you before that one of the things 2CAS specializes in--
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.720]   nice Canadian fella, LA and Moss.
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:59.200]   One of the things they specialize in is finding businesses that suck, that are run badly,
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.760]   like domain name registration, and doing it right.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.600]   They've done the same with cell phones with Ting.
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.000]   You guys can't get Ting in Canada.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   It's kind of a shame.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.480]   We can get Hover and I use it extensively.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.480]   Hover is great.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.680]   I moved all my domains over because--
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.680]   I'm here.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.760]   A, because I didn't like the company we were with, but B, because I just wanted something
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:14.760]   simple.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.560]   And now when you get new domains, it says, you know, you don't get all the up-by-body
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.560]   upsell.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:21.560]   In fact, you get automatic-- they know, for instance, they don't upsell you on who is
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.560]   privacy.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.560]   You know, that's built in.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.560]   It's part-- because they know.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:28.200]   You don't want your address all over the internet.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.320]   Hover makes it easy and affordable to create a memorable email address.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:36.040]   Another thing if you have friends who just had a kid or you got a kid, get their name
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:39.880]   as an email address, give them a permanent for lifetime email address.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:41.800]   Would be such a great thing to have.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:42.800]   You could do that at Hover.com.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:52.000]   They've got 23 top-level domains like .com.net.org.tv.pro.b.biz and the country codes too, like
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.880]   US, CA, Asia, UK.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.080]   You know, one of the things they wanted to let you know, because .com addresses, all
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.120]   the good ones are taken, that you might want to take a look at .net as well.
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.760]   There are a lot of unusual .whatever choices out there are more coming, but .net is really
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:10.520]   a pretty good alternative to .com.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:15.120]   People online support, help tutorials.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.120]   It is just great.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.400]   Also, if you do have a problem, and I hear this all the time, people are tweeting me all
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.200]   the time saying, "You know, you were right.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.880]   I called the Hover tech support.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.360]   They fixed the problem right away, and they never put me on hold.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.000]   They have a no-hold policy.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.400]   Call during business hours Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.240]   You'll be talking to a live person who is empowered and eager to help and who will not
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.720]   put you on hold or transfer you or anything.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.000]   They're just going to get that fixed, and they do.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.560]   They're really great about that.
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:43.320]   I want you to try it right now to register your domain name.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.880]   Go to Hover.com/MacBreak.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:48.640]   You'll get 10% off when you use the offer code MacBreak.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:53.400]   Hover.com/MacBreak, and that 10% off your standard domain name registration when you
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.360]   use the offer code MacBreak.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.520]   I just moved everybody over.
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.440]   By the way, very easy.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.200]   If you do want to transfer all your domains over to Hover, it's $10 for the transfer.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:08.480]   You get a full year of that domain name renewal and all Hover features, and they have a concierge
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:12.000]   service which you should take advantage of because I did it myself and it was a huge
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.200]   mistake and it took six months because the other guy locked the domains and made it really
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.840]   hard to move.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:18.840]   They'll do it all for you.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.840]   You don't have to deal with these guys.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:20.840]   Just do it.
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.520]   They charge $25, but I have been told if you just say, "Hey, Leo said you'd do this for
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.520]   me."
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.480]   They will just throw it in for free.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.320]   Just transfer your domains.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.320]   Just get it done.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.440]   I should have done it.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.440]   Hover.com/MacBreak.
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.440]   Get off of that other guy.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:37.440]   All right.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.440]   Why, Renee?
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.440]   Is this -- no, I was asking Renee.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:42.560]   I did the iOS 6.1 update, right?
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.480]   I've done it on my iPhone and my iPad mini.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.000]   I just did it on my third generation iPad.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   What do you get?
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.920]   You get a splash screen that says, "Whoops, that announces you're using iOS 6."
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.560]   They've never done this before, right?
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.560]   It's new.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.560]   Maybe this is it.
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.360]   Your iPad was updated successfully.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.960]   There are just a few more steps to follow.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:00.960]   Oh, here it comes.
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.960]   You're done.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:05.280]   What they want you to do is sign in with your iCloud account.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.120]   Now I'd already done that.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.120]   Why are we doing that again?
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.120]   I have no idea.
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.120]   Reset it.
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.320]   Sometimes it does that on the Apple TV.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.320]   It drives me crazy.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.120]   Oh, you think that the update --
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.520]   Unless they change something in the subsystem that requires you.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.520]   Maybe -- okay.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.520]   Authenticate.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:23.520]   So that would explain the new splash screen because they need you to re-authenticate.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.000]   I wonder if it has any new tools.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   Oh, and this is another thing.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.720]   They want you to add security questions.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:29.960]   Yeah, for the Apple ID.
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.960]   Yeah, but that was before, right?
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:32.960]   Yeah, they were doing it.
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:34.960]   They would challenge you.
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.200]   That's only if you hadn't done it before.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:40.080]   I upgraded my iPad the other day and it didn't ask security questions.
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:46.800]   What it did do was show me after I entered my Apple ID, it reset up iMessage and said
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.680]   iMessage can reach the Sapphire the following addresses.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.120]   Which ones do you want them to use?
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:55.880]   I think part of it is part of just that revalidation process of reconnecting your identity to this
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.640]   device.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.360]   Every time I add one now, all of my devices go off with these six addresses are --
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.600]   Yeah, I've been adding that too.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.600]   It's annoying.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.240]   You log into your Mac and all of a sudden you know have 18 now, 18 new phone numbers
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.240]   and addresses on your app.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.240]   It's like just what I want.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:14.280]   Apple gets yelled at whenever there's any whiff of a privacy concern.
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.200]   Apple's adding addresses without telling me.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.200]   Right.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.840]   And then suddenly the Wall Street Journal has that on the cover.
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:19.840]   Right.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.680]   I think it's nice that they let you know.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.000]   Okay, one more question.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.520]   What is the name of the street where you grew up?
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.040]   I just use one password to generate random gunk and I put it in there.
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:29.040]   You should.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:33.760]   Because if you use real stuff, that's a real security flaw.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.760]   Right?
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.320]   Okay, and then add a recovery email address.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.720]   Don't watch this.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.080]   Okay.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.480]   So this is all good stuff that people should -- they probably should encourage people to
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.640]   do all this, right?
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.040]   And they would when you try to do other things occasionally they would ask you for security
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.040]   questions.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:52.120]   So they were trying to do it in updating iCloud settings.
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:56.000]   So it's adding that the security questions I added which I'll of course -- oh, now it's
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.480]   showing the new addresses and phone numbers that people can reach me out on my message.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.480]   People can kind of -- Your iPad is now set up.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:07.520]   You ready to start using the most advanced iOS ever because it's the next one?
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:08.520]   6.1.
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:10.120]   And what is new in here?
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.480]   Well, for user-facing features, they did rewrite a bunch of stuff on the developer level
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.200]   and a bunch of private Apple stuff.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:18.800]   But on the user level, they added LTE support in a bunch of new countries.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:23.040]   You have the original iPad 3 that won't help you because the LTE chipset wasn't very advanced.
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:28.640]   If you have an iPad 4 or an iPhone 5, you will now get LTE in 30 more countries -- 30
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.000]   more carriers, not 30 more countries.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.160]   They also added in the US you can get movie tickets via Siri.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:37.520]   So you can ask Siri to book you movie tickets via Fandango.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.280]   So you just say Siri, get me tickets to see Django and Fandango.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.200]   Siri, I want to see -- Django and Fandango.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.200]   And then -- Showed to be awesome.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.200]   Very don't do that.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.200]   And then what?
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.600]   It will put them in your passport?
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:53.360]   It'll do exactly what it does with restaurant reservations where it will eventually kick
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.320]   you off into the Fandango app to complete your purchase.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:00.200]   And the last thing is they've restored, thank God, the iTunes matchability to the leader
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.880]   download individual songs which disappeared previously.
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:03.880]   Thank you.
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.280]   So you can swipe and delete the individual.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.440]   My son likes hip hop.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:12.440]   I know Andy Inako is a fan of hip hop, but I don't really want all the hip hop on my
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.440]   iPad.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.280]   Even with 128 gigs that is not enough room.
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.280]   My question is are there location services?
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:22.200]   So like in Colorado and Washington State, you can say Siri, get me some doobies.
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.200]   Tells you.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.440]   You mean the doobie brothers?
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.440]   Of course.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.440]   Of course.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.440]   Siri, like chat.
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.880]   I found some pot near you.
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:32.280]   Why is there no William Shatner series commercial?
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.760]   That needs to happen immediately.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:36.200]   Please get me to the nearest galaxy.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.200]   Siri, Fandango movie.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.200]   The Django.
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.200]   And dango.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.200]   And dango.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:44.760]   If you double tap the lock screen, the music progress bar color is changed from blue to
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.000]   steel.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   And they did read it.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   They read it.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   They read it.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   Thank you.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   The artwork stuff.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.840]   So new artwork, no less pewmorphic.
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.640]   No, new artwork.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.360]   Although I did as an experiment I took because when people say skeomorphism really they mean
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:01.400]   often skinning like a game center.
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.400]   And so I did an experiment.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:07.200]   I took all the game center iBooks and find my friends screens and I re-rendered them
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.760]   in just the plain aluminum theme.
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:09.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:10.760]   And they're indistinct from any other app.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.240]   So if you see me screen, you have no idea what app you're in anymore.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.240]   Ah, so it helps.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.240]   Yeah, you lose all sense of the game.
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.960]   The green bays felt table.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:18.960]   Let's me know.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:19.960]   You're playing a game.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:20.960]   It may be overdone.
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:21.960]   Like you can argue that it's way too much.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.600]   But there's a reason for it.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.600]   All right.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:25.600]   That's good.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.280]   You're the first person I've ever heard given a coach in a reason.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.840]   I stole that from Craig Hawkenberry, the icon factor.
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:31.840]   He responded to my--
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:32.840]   He's great.
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:33.840]   I actually like Craig Hawken.
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.640]   There's a master's of skewn or fizzin's on it.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.640]   Yeah, they're beautiful design.
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:40.960]   Oh, we didn't talk about the quarterly results.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.480]   They came out right after Mac break weekly last week.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.480]   They waited till we finished.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.800]   Yeah, they waited till we finished.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.640]   So, oh, shocking.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.640]   Apple made--
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:53.640]   Apple made-- Apple made a-- it was like a record breaking quarter.
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:55.480]   And of course that was a horrible thing for fun stuff.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:57.280]   And that meant the stock tumbled.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:01.360]   More money than companies that have oligopoly control over scarce fossil fuel resources.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.360]   Better than Exxon, baby.
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.280]   Earnings of $13.81 a share, by the way.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:09.120]   They are going to give you a nice little dividend.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.640]   A couple of bucked dividend.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.640]   Dividend?
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:15.960]   Well, so what's interesting about that is it's a dividend and buyback.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.840]   So they give you money and then you lose your stock?
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:18.840]   No, no, no.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:21.080]   They're giving some dividends and they're giving some buybacks.
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:23.840]   And one of the big-- one of the questions that I have related to that-- and I'm not
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:27.800]   the financial whiz that some people are, but when you start seeing--
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.360]   When you start seeing-- he could explain it.
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:32.980]   When you start seeing buybacks, the other question is when you have a company that stock
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:38.520]   is going down and the revenue is very, very strong, as strong as apples, you could--
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:39.780]   You could chance for them to buy back.
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:40.780]   Buy themselves back.
[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:44.280]   Well, I mean, there's a chance if they decided to buy themselves completely back.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:45.280]   Go private.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:46.280]   And-- And-- And-- And-- And-- And-- And-- And--
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.120]   And-- And-- And-- And-- And-- And-- And-- And--
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.120]   And-- And-- And-- And-- And-- And-- And-- And--
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.120]   Which massively opens up for Apple.
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:52.640]   You know, a lot of the antitrust regulations, a lot of the-- you know, the Starbucks-- you
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:53.640]   know, all that-- Exactly.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.720]   So on-- So on-- So on-- So on-- So on-- All that stuff, you know, changes really dramatically.
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:00.920]   And if you want to see what Apple can do with a fully operational battleship, you know,
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.840]   what they are when they're private.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.480]   You know, you know, you know, you know, making that kind of revenue.
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:06.280]   You know, they don't have to tell anybody anything.
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.280]   Ever now.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.200]   Unfortunately, their market cap still with the depleted stock is $430 billion.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.200]   So it's not like--
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:14.700]   No, but they have $137 billion in the bank.
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:15.700]   It's not something they could do now.
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:16.700]   The loan?
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:17.700]   No, that's not something they could do now.
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:19.880]   But the point is that it's-- I got the down payment.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:20.880]   Can I buy myself?
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:21.880]   It's something that they could do over time.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:22.880]   Over time.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:23.880]   It's by bit.
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:24.880]   Right.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.880]   It's not unheard of.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.880]   Usually you do a buyback when you're distressed rather than--
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:28.880]   Right.
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.400]   The earnings of $9, let's see.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.400]   Let's go back.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.400]   I always started saying all of this.
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.920]   So let me say it again.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.360]   Revenue of $54.5 billion.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.160]   This is in there first quarter of the year, which is the Christmas quarter.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.920]   And this quarter was one week shorter than last year or quarter.
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:44.920]   Trunk-kitted.
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:49.120]   $13 billion in profit in three months.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.120]   I'll take it.
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.120]   Yep.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.120]   I wish I was that doomed.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.080]   That's more than $4 billion a month.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:58.800]   More than a billion a week in profit if my math serves.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.800]   I'll take it.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:01.360]   47.8 million iPhones.
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.120]   That's up 23% over last year.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.320]   But that makes sense because maybe-- I don't know.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.320]   They had a new iPhone.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.320]   Yep.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.960]   22.9 million iPads.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:12.520]   That's up a third year over year.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.520]   Four point now.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.320]   This is interesting.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.320]   Sales of the max down.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.320]   22%.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.320]   4.1 million max.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:24.280]   Although they're heavily constrained because new iMacs weren't shipping in numbers prior
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.280]   to the holidays.
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.280]   That's their excuses.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.280]   We couldn't make enough.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.280]   You buy that?
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.280]   I do.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.280]   I mean, if you tried to buy, I couldn't buy one.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.280]   You managed to get one.
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.840]   I did get one, but I didn't get delivered to January until after the quarter.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.320]   And Apple's very good.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:38.760]   There are some companies that the minute they decide they want to put it on the factory,
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.320]   they count that as a sold unit.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.320]   Right.
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.320]   Where Apple, unless it's at your door--
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.320]   Has to be sold.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.320]   --has to be sold.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.320]   Okay.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.160]   We're thrilled, said Tim Cook.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.160]   Thrilled.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.160]   I tend to score that.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:55.560]   Thrilled with the record revenue of over $54 billion in sales of over 75 million iOS devices
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:03.840]   in one quarter, $23 billion in cash flow, all-time quarterly records for iPhone, iPad
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:07.840]   sales, Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:11.040]   And the stock market said bad Apple.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.560]   Tank the stock by a significant amount.
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:19.600]   Although it's starting to come back a little bit.
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.840]   Beat Apple's beat its own guidance even.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.240]   So you can't say they disappointed the analysts because they even said, "We're not going to
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.880]   do as well," and they did better.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:30.960]   They didn't reach Wall Street forecast, though, which is part of why they got punished.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:36.600]   But again, one week, shorter quarter, they still could not make enough iPad minis, could
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:39.160]   not make enough iPhone 5s, could not make enough iMacs.
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:44.400]   And I think part of it is that Apple is pushing the envelope so far on manufacturing.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.400]   There's a lot of manufacturers.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:51.240]   The reason that a lot of other devices don't have the same feel that Apple devices have
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.880]   is because Apple is pushing the envelope of every little bit of how that's made.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:58.600]   They went from just in time to almost in time.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.760]   Sort of in time.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.560]   But it's later in time.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.360]   They're having higher failure rates.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:04.360]   They have higher...
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:05.360]   A lot of those things.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.360]   I know it's tougher to make new stuff.
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.360]   It's even harder to manufacture.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:11.240]   I was told when they first started shipping these...
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.240]   Retinas?
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.400]   No, the new track pads.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.200]   The failure rate was 60%.
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.200]   Wow.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.200]   It was just because it was just so hard to make.
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:22.360]   So, the supply constraint could be not merely parts, but also...
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:26.680]   One of the craziest things is if you look at Apple's design team, part of the time that
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.840]   they spend doing things is designing the machines that make Apple products.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.560]   They get all new technology and then they pay for it to go in the factories.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.720]   And it's always cutting edge, bleeding edge stuff.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.400]   Well, and this is one of the things...
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.400]   Go ahead.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.960]   You got to ask it.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.120]   How are they managing that interaction between...
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.120]   They want to...
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:47.400]   Obviously part of the appeal of any Apple product is how well it's designed.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:51.000]   The fact that they're using a manufacturing technique that allows them to get a line,
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.680]   to get an angle, to get a shape that no one else can create.
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:58.200]   But on the other hand, if they're routinely leaving money back on the table because they
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:03.760]   went for something blazingly blisteringly unconventional when it's not...
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:09.120]   Do they have a real good metric on how much that kind of design contributes to the bottom
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.800]   line and how much it's costing them to do that?
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.800]   How do you think so?
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:13.800]   Tim Cook is a supplier guy.
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:14.800]   They keep it for a couple of years.
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:18.240]   It's expensive to make that new iPhone right away, but then the 5S leverages everything
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.600]   they made in the 5.
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.880]   The iPad design now is three years old.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:24.480]   They get huge economies of scale going down.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.560]   And because they're paying for the machines, they're essentially living two or three years
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.040]   in the future from other manufacturers, which gives them a lot of...
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.440]   I don't know what the right word is, but a lot of cache in the market.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.520]   Two million iPhone 5s ordered in the first 24 hours.
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.320]   That's twice as many as the iPhone 4S.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:44.760]   It gives a little lie to the thought that maybe iPhone 5 isn't as successful as its younger
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:46.760]   brother, older brother.
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:48.360]   It's basically an insane amount.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.360]   Horace.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.920]   It's just like we think about the number.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:55.080]   As some co has talked a little bit about how much Apple spends on infrastructure, that
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.840]   they spend a lot more...
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:02.080]   They spend comparable to Intel more than Intel even, which is building billion dollar fabs.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:06.800]   And part of the reason is that they are buying machinery for these Chinese manufacturers,
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:11.360]   but that's something that's of value to them going forward, that they will have an advantage
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.360]   going forward.
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:15.280]   They spend way less on advertising than for example Samsung.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.280]   Like incredibly less.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:17.280]   I believe that.
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.240]   You see Samsung everywhere now.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:23.560]   And that might be one of the reasons Galaxy S3 and the Galaxy Note are selling so well.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:27.440]   You see, you can't watch a football game without seeing 15 Samsung ads.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:28.440]   Absolutely.
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:29.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.480]   And also, they still own Boston South Station.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:36.880]   I'm talking about you step off a commuter train or an Amtrak train.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:40.040]   I'm not saying that you see lots of ads for the Galaxy Note 2.
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:45.560]   I'm saying every ad space is occupied from the little stand up kiosks.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:51.080]   You walk past with your rolling luggage to the one pillar of the west side of the hall
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:55.120]   to the other pillar of the east side of the hall with one big banner.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.520]   Apple has done that in the past too.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.480]   In San Francisco, there were times when you'd get to Powell Street and you would get out
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:01.960]   and it was all I've had.
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:04.120]   Why is it not doing that?
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.720]   Do they feel they don't need to, you think?
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.560]   I don't think they need to introduce anything at the moment.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:12.560]   If you look at Samsung compared to other Android vendors, I mean, they are almost becoming
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:16.640]   synonymous with Android at this point based on the amount of mind share they have in that
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:17.640]   community.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:18.640]   Yes, Samsung is.
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.600]   People recognize the device I take out of my pocket.
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:25.760]   They wouldn't recognize other Android devices.
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:30.880]   It really does make you want to take at least half a step back and think about those of us
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.120]   in this conversation.
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:35.840]   I'm sure almost everybody listening to this conversation understands all of the technical
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:39.360]   advantages and all the architecture advantages and all the software advantages that make
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.040]   the iPhone great.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:45.240]   You have to take a half step back and wonder how much of the iPhone success is the fact
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:50.160]   that Apple managed to create such a seductive brand that there are people who didn't understand
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:53.640]   any of what makes it great that it's realized, "Ooh, it's shiny, it's wonderful, it's what
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:54.640]   everybody's talking about.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:55.640]   I went ahead with it."
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:59.800]   They create an emotional attachment to a device which very few people have done before.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:04.440]   And yeah, Samsung's starting to do that and successfully and starting to look sell in
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:05.440]   iPhone numbers.
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:08.440]   I think that there's a lot of hard work that Samsung's doing to do that and a lot of that
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.120]   has to do with incredible amount of phones.
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:11.120]   Oh, I think they are.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:15.040]   I think that making great phones and also really, really heavy advertising campaigns,
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.240]   I think does make a difference.
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.000]   Yeah, you have to have the product to get up to it.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.920]   Android is more competitive because there's a whole bunch of people making Android products
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:25.600]   where Samsung has to distinguish itself not only from Apple but from all the other Android
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:28.040]   developers where Apple is just Apple.
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:29.040]   Right.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:34.440]   At least give Samsung credit for stealing every good Apple idea.
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.440]   The advertising too.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.440]   Come on.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.640]   You know, it's really stealing Apple's advertising is Microsoft.
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:41.840]   The Surface ads look just like iPad ads.
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:42.840]   Click ads.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:46.720]   Look, just and in fact, I even saw one.
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:49.320]   I don't know what MERS watching, but there was a there was the Surface ad.
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:50.920]   Then there was an iPod and it was obvious.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.920]   They were like stolen.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:54.800]   It was funny is that CBS does a lot of product placement for Microsoft.
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:57.360]   Like they even have the Microsoft computers, which don't really exist.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.360]   Right.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.200]   Only in CBS, but they were using Homeland or something.
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:02.360]   One of those shows that they have Windows logos.
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.360]   A lot of shows Apple logos.
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:05.360]   They have Windows.
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.360]   There's no such thing.
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.640]   I was watching Hawaii 5.0 and they used to use iPads and they would just pull an iPad
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:10.640]   and do something.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:14.280]   And in this one, they pull out this thing, put it down on the car, pull up the other thing,
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:15.520]   click it in place on the car.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:17.000]   It's going down the hood.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.800]   Like the worst product placement is Hawaii 5.0.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:20.800]   It was so awesome.
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:24.520]   Let's find an excuse for us to to pull out a Windows phone and put it in front of the
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.520]   camera for how I search for it.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.520]   Hold on 10 seconds.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.520]   10 seconds.
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.880]   It's exactly the same thing.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:35.840]   James Bond has the $180,000 watch best watch made has the half million dollar car best
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:41.280]   missed car ever made $5,000 tuxedo best suit every made and he's got to make a phone call
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.560]   so he pulls out a Symbian phone.
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.560]   For the slider.
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:49.000]   Nokia in the dashboard.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.440]   But it does point out if you don't have the product to back it up, you can have all the
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:54.920]   product placement and ads in the world and it's still on sale on surface.
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:55.920]   No, absolutely.
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.840]   It looks so awkward in that placement.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:58.840]   Yeah.
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:17:59.840]   It's not fun.
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.080]   Surface is, surface is complicated.
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:04.800]   I don't think it's just the product itself.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:05.800]   It's a complicated thing.
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.800]   I don't think it's complicated.
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:08.800]   It's complicated.
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:09.800]   It's complicated, right?
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:13.880]   I think Windows 8 is getting a resounding beating in the marketplace.
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:14.880]   I really do that.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.920]   Like, you know, they have XP and Vista and then seven and then eight and then nine will
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:18.920]   be fantastic again.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:19.920]   Yeah.
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:24.760]   Well, because well, this is this is in the Windows show, but the only so I'll close my
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.880]   comments just by saying that Windows works differently the way they sell it.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:31.760]   They don't have to have a huge success right up the gate.
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.600]   It's very, very true that all the numbers from the first quarter sales at Windows 8
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:38.960]   are disappointing compared not only just to Windows 7, which was a huge success, but
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:42.080]   also to Vista, which was their previous big failure.
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:47.440]   But the thing is Microsoft doesn't have to have their big success for the first quarter
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.920]   because not everybody upgrades their first quarter.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:53.800]   Most of the people upgrade, excuse me, individual users definitely upgrade when they buy a new
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:59.800]   PC and corporations are, it takes them a while before their IT department will even certify
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:01.280]   a new operating system.
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:08.200]   So let's not diminish that Windows 8 is not selling nearly as well as Microsoft would
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.500]   like it to.
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:13.120]   But let's also say that the fact that they're not nearly as good as the, they're not nearly
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:19.040]   as the uptake rate is not as good as Apple gets by selling an operating system that self
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:22.280]   installs on every single PC, F for 30 bucks.
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:26.440]   And in a culture where everybody wants to upgrade update their operating system on the
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.960]   day it's released, that's not, that's not, that's not, this new in Apple's oranges.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:33.480]   Also, I would say it's kind of brave and bold because they went with the Metro layer.
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:37.200]   It just almost reminds me of when you had Windows on DOS and you'd run, type in win
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.240]   and run it and then you'd quit it and go back.
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.040]   You're in between two different worlds.
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:44.960]   And it's the next version that actually nailed the next world.
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:45.960]   Right.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:49.480]   It's a good, it sets the stage nicely for 2014.
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:55.120]   The fact that I see Microsoft's plan for 2014 and 2015, I don't necessarily see Apple's
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.480]   plan for 2014 and 2015 yet, but that's the way Apple works too.
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:00.280]   You were able to say about any.
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:01.280]   Say about you.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.880]   Well, Tim Cook has something to say about that.
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:05.600]   See that dead fossil.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:12.040]   After the Apple took a stock dive, Tim Cook released, actually was he speaking somewhere?
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.040]   The town hall.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.040]   It was a town hall.
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.120]   I want to take a moment and make a comment.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:19.920]   I don't want to comment on any particular rumor, but I question the accuracy of any kind
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:21.640]   of rumor about our plans.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:23.000]   You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.440]   You there in the third row on the left.
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:30.080]   I'd stress that even if a particular data point were factual, it would be impossible
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.480]   to interpret the meaning for our overall business.
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:33.920]   Yields can vary.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:35.080]   Supplier performance can vary.
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:39.000]   There's and this really sounds like Tim Cook almost saying, it's okay.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000]   Calm down.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.040]   There's an inordinately long list of things that would make any single data point, not
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:47.160]   a great proxy for what's going on.
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:52.400]   They asked if they asked the question I would ask, which is screen sizes.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:56.240]   Are you going to do any other screen sizes?
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.880]   He said, we're not doing a fablet.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:01.800]   See, I want an iPad mini with a phone and I'm really in my way.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.440]   I was has he defined fablet though.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:08.280]   It's four point eight inches used to be defined as a fablet.
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.240]   Now we think that is the note too.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:14.800]   So the iPhone five with its four inches play has quote, a larger screen size without sacrificing
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:15.960]   one handed ease of use.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.920]   He's sticking with the company line.
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:21.400]   As if that's all it matters.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.480]   We put a lot of thinking into screen sizes.
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:25.320]   We believe we've picked the right one.
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:28.880]   We're not interested in revenue for revenues sake.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.840]   We could put the Apple brand on a lot more stuff.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.840]   We don't want to do that.
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:33.840]   Yeah.
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:38.240]   Well, but that's even that sort of an interesting comment.
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:41.760]   If he's saying we're not interested in revenue for revenue sake, he's saying, I know that
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:45.360]   if we did a larger phone, a lot of people would love it and they would buy it.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.360]   I mean, we're not going to do it because it's wrong.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.360]   Even though you all want it.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.360]   Is that wrong?
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.360]   You're wrong.
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:53.160]   Apple never, Apple says everything's a bad idea until they do it.
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.160]   So they have to.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.880]   I forgot my lightning cable when I was traveling here.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.400]   So I had no iPhone battery.
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:02.160]   So I was walking around with my iPad mini as a phone for most of yesterday.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.160]   How was that?
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:04.160]   It was fantastic.
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.160]   I was holding it in my hand.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.160]   I was playing letter press.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.480]   I was doing iMessage using Skype.
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:08.480]   How are you?
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:11.080]   Yeah, I used Skype because I was on Wi-Fi and it was pretty nicely.
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:12.080]   Didn't it?
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:15.000]   It was really, really a good experience.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:21.160]   But when you look at Apple doing something like a larger phone, they tend to be things
[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:22.160]   step by step.
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:26.320]   They had the regular screen, then they had the retina screen, then they had the 16.9
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.320]   screen.
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:31.520]   And if you look at the next step, maybe that's a larger 16 by 9 screen.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:37.080]   I still think just refining what they already have with FaceTime and iMessages and just allowing
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:38.080]   us to call.
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.080]   I think that's the strategy.
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:43.160]   You flip that switch and suddenly all the devices, your computer, your iPad, your iPhone,
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:44.160]   everything can call each other.
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.160]   Or your play.
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.160]   They just make it, yeah.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:49.200]   To play devil's advocate though, if you look at the results from Verizon and AT&T, which
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:54.960]   also came out almost 9 out of 10 people on AT&T who bought a smartphone, bought an iPhone.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:59.800]   And that is everyone else who wanted a larger phone, all the iPhones sold are 4 inches or
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:00.800]   smaller.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.200]   So either there's two ways of looking at it.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:04.920]   Either people don't want large screen phones by any large number.
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:06.760]   It's just us nerds that want them.
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:11.680]   Or people want iOS so badly they're willing to put up with a smaller display to get it.
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:14.520]   And eer those things, Apple's only going to do a larger screen when they think they'll
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:17.360]   sell more device than they do currently by doing it.
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.160]   That's their only real message.
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.080]   It's a complicated list of variables.
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:25.680]   Another possible metric is when you interview the people and ask, did you come in the store
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:29.600]   to shop for a phone or did you come into the store to buy an iPhone?
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:33.360]   If you buy an iPhone that you have very clearly fixed in your mind the reasons why you want
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:37.080]   an iPhone and not something else and you're not going to be swayed by something, the fact
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.920]   that something is by a different piece of hardware.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:42.920]   As opposed to I'm coming in, I just need a smartphone.
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:43.920]   My contract is up.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.560]   What do I want to get?
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:50.320]   When I talk to, this is all, this is not a statistic driven or anything else, but I've
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:54.840]   asked people at AT&T, I've gone into buy other things and asked folks at an ATD store,
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.520]   so what are people really buying here?
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:00.200]   And all you see when you walk into an AT&T store is Android phones everywhere.
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:03.920]   That's all they have and then you just go, oh, buy an large just iPhones.
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:05.920]   You know, that's just fine.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:09.120]   But it's funny that they don't show anything.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.120]   They don't show the iPhones they want.
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:15.040]   They're trying to sell Android because they've tried like Verizon tried not to sell iPhone,
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:17.680]   Sprint tried not to sell iPhone and it cost them severely.
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:20.120]   So they sell iPhone because that's what people want to buy.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.920]   They want to sell Android because they can customize it, they can put anything they want
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:24.760]   on it, they can drive the margins.
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:27.480]   And that's also why it's hard for Windows phone and maybe it'd be hard for BlackBerry
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:31.800]   10 because in between half to sell and want to sell, there's this very tiny little space
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:36.160]   in space left because out of those 9 out of 10 phones or iPhones, almost all the last
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.440]   one were Android.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.760]   And now they're going to get squeezed because I mean, we know that Google is going to go
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:45.640]   to a point where you're doing voice calls over Android and if Apple does the same thing,
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:48.520]   you really put a lot of these cell carriers in a--
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:50.280]   With the other side message but for voice?
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:53.480]   Well, 2 billion iMessages a day.
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:55.360]   And if you didn't have it unlimited, that's--
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.920]   2 billion a day, wow.
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:02.360]   And if you don't-- if you compared that to the non-unlimited version of your iMessages
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:05.720]   of SMS, that's like $200 million a day.
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:08.960]   It removed the financial barrier of entry to using quick messaging.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:09.960]   Right.
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:11.960]   Hardcore porn back on the iPhone.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:12.960]   Glad to see it.
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:13.960]   Woo.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:14.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.200]   First 500px is back and it looks like what they did is they added warning may contain
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.640]   if, you know, adult stuff.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.000]   Which they didn't want to do but--
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000]   They didn't want to do.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.600]   But that's Apple's rules.
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:27.480]   So I take it back every-- all the mean things I said about Apple's censoring.
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:29.480]   They just wanted that one announcement.
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:32.920]   Now you can get your peanut shots in vine the way you could get it in Nintendo.
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:37.200]   Well, and that's the interesting thing because really 500px was tasteful nudes.
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.960]   It was real art photography.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:42.000]   500-- I mean, vine is porn.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.280]   It's a chat rule that's recorded in a six-second loop.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:47.960]   Now they seem to have fixed this.
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:52.120]   Vine is the new product that Twitter came out with on Thursday.
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.120]   That actually is great.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:58.880]   It lets you do kind of weird but six-second videos.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:03.200]   And the thing that's the most interesting is that people are editing within it.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:08.920]   So you can do animation, you know, because you press and hold the screen and then it
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:10.280]   stops when you let go of it.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:13.120]   So you can-- even with six seconds you could do many cuts.
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:18.320]   And there are people who are doing-- if you go to the vines explore page and look at
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:21.240]   the editors picks-- people are doing basically what is animation.
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:25.520]   This is Philippe Intragi who's essentially doing animation with vine.
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:26.960]   Now I've tried it.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:27.960]   It's a lot of work.
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:31.400]   And they don't make it easy because you can't switch to the fun-facing camera for portraits.
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.720]   You can't load a video that you already recorded for a clip.
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:34.720]   You can't stop.
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:37.200]   So as long as you're doing it, you're taking over your phone.
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:40.360]   Nick Bilton's been doing some fun stuff but I just think Nick didn't have his phone for
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:43.360]   four hours while he was doing this animation.
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:44.960]   Things like this, which are really cool.
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:49.480]   You know, they're showing their car being cleared off from a snow.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:50.960]   And that's a neat thing.
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.200]   I have to say, I love vine.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:56.200]   But one of the problems was even the editors picks were starting to have porn clips in
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:57.200]   it.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.200]   Vine says that was an error.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.800]   It's a little bit of a mistake.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:07.000]   Apple kind of pulled the editors choice on Apple and they pulled that.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.160]   However, I think porn free vine even is going to get very cool.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:13.480]   You look like one password on iOS has to have the 17 plus warning.
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:15.880]   There's a web browser in it.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.960]   And they just wanted the same thing for photo apps.
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:21.280]   And I think that's not a bad idea because then you can use the parental restrictions.
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:24.440]   You can use everything in Apple's-- if you are a parent, you can use everything in Apple's
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.200]   ecosystem to control the content.
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:31.400]   Vine also took the hashtag porn out, the hashtag boobs out.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.480]   I've been searching for other things, but--
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:34.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.480]   Elves.
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:36.480]   Elves.
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:39.640]   Free toes gone.
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:42.640]   So you can still find stuff on there.
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:45.760]   But of course, anytime you're going to have a site with pictures or--
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:46.760]   It wasn't just porn.
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:50.400]   It was ads for porn companies and six second loops, which is more problematic than--
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.480]   It was pretty shocking.
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.480]   It wasn't user-generated content.
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:55.200]   It was being used for spam, basically.
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:56.200]   I was spam.
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:59.360]   But some of the stuff people are doing, this is an animated one that's really kind of cool
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.360]   with cutouts.
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:04.120]   Again, you've got to think they're taking all day.
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:08.920]   And they're not losing use of your iPhone for a day to do this, but still very cool
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:10.320]   stuff.
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:11.320]   I like Vine a lot.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.320]   I think it's good.
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:15.160]   And I hope that the porn label doesn't hurt it in the long run because I think there's
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:16.160]   potential to--
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:17.160]   It's getting up to something great.
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.160]   [SINGING]
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.640]   Anything else to talk about?
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:22.880]   Phil Schiller announces.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:26.800]   There are now 300 million devices using iOS 6 and above.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:30.560]   Really strong adoption of the new version of iOS.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.640]   That's a good sign for Apple.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.640]   It means its users are upgrading.
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:34.920]   It's a heck of a target for developers.
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:39.800]   Didn't they say 240 million now active users of iCloud?
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:40.800]   Yes.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:41.800]   That was the other thing.
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:44.080]   And doesn't that make Apple the 30% largest social network?
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:46.440]   Have they actually knew how to do something with it?
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:50.040]   Well, it shows you people want iCloud or maybe that people aren't sophisticated enough
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:52.040]   to know they're not getting what they should be getting.
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.040]   It's like time machine.
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.680]   Everyone should back up, but they made it easy enough for people to do it.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:57.520]   So now iCloud is the same thing for mobile.
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:58.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:02.440]   Yeah, I guess that's part of it, isn't it?
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:06.520]   And then I did see an interesting article by somebody which is not on our list, but
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:10.480]   I'm going to see if I can find it again.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:16.640]   Complaining about the state of OS X. And I think his position was one I've kind of mentioned
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:21.080]   before, which it feels as if Apple is so focused on iOS that they're pulling the best
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:23.400]   people off OS X development.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:27.640]   They've got Craig Fegericki's now in charge before a while they have Scott Forest and
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.640]   Craig Fegericki.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:29.640]   Right.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:30.640]   He's got to do both.
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:31.640]   Right.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:32.640]   I just don't think so.
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:36.800]   He points to iTunes as being just, what's going on?
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:41.480]   I mean, this is maybe the most used Apple product because it's used a block by Windows
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:44.400]   users and it's horrible.
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:49.240]   He says they're adding features, they're taking out features that people use and adding
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.720]   features people don't use.
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.280]   I can't find, unfortunately, I can't find.
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.120]   They're not working on it.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:56.120]   They're not working on it.
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:57.120]   That's the case.
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:58.120]   They just don't care.
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:29:59.120]   They don't care.
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:04.120]   I'm not saying it like I think they should or that I'm.
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:05.120]   Well, I think they should.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:08.480]   But what I'm saying is that I'm not saying that I have business, but I agree with it.
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:12.520]   But I'm just saying that I just don't think that they're putting any real resources into
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:13.520]   OS X.
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:14.520]   The price is getting as much attention as the car line.
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:15.520]   Right.
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:18.040]   I think that the trucks are going to be, you know, we've, you know, I've said this a
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:24.360]   thousand times that when we get to OS, you know, there is no OS 11.
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:30.120]   You know, like, like there is, there is iOS seven and everything will run on it.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.120]   Yeah.
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:32.120]   You know, in 2014.
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:33.120]   It's depressing.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.960]   You know, I just don't, I just don't think I just, you know, and it's going to be, it's
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:36.960]   going to have more.
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:37.960]   You're going to be able to use keyboards.
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:40.600]   You know, it's going to be different, but I think that there's a merge going on and
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:42.720]   I don't, I think that what they're doing is they're bringing those together.
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.520]   They're spending more time bringing those together than they are.
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:48.160]   Taking the truck and making it as nicely appointed inside as a luxury car.
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:49.160]   Thank you.
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:50.160]   Web 8867.
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:51.160]   He sent me the link.
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:58.280]   It's from a performance guide, Apple core rot.
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:01.680]   Having been a professional software engineer for 25 years and used max since they appeared
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:05.080]   in the early eighties, I have a long and deep perspective on OS 10.
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:09.600]   What I see happening is not pretty and it's a long article.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:11.920]   It's well worth reading.
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:16.360]   This general working theory is that OS 10 is degrading into a base for an entertainment
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:18.120]   platform as it stands.
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:20.280]   The trend is entirely downhill for serious work.
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:23.600]   You've said that pros are less happy with Mac than they used to.
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:24.880]   Well, we're less happy with the hardware too.
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:28.600]   I mean, the thing is, is that, I mean, as I said, I think that I think what Apple really
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:30.360]   needs to do, I don't think they need to open source it anymore.
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:33.560]   But I do, and I said this in the last show, I just think that they need to let everyone
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:34.560]   else.
[01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:37.440]   Let us install it on just, just stop looking for the chip.
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:38.600]   Stop looking as an example.
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:44.240]   The existence proof, see calls them iTunes, iCloud, Finder, which can't copy fires reliably,
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.400]   can't do useful things.
[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:50.160]   It ought to do hides, key files, is rife with bugs, iPhoto, where they've arbitrarily
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:55.000]   removed keyboard shortcuts, aperture, so full of display bugs on a dual display system
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000]   as to be unusable.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000]   I didn't know that.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000]   I don't use dual display on with aperture.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.600]   Time machine auto excludes critical data from backup silently.
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.120]   I don't use time machine.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:05.760]   That's the solution.
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:06.920]   No, no, it really is.
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:11.080]   There's a lot of things that Apple does great, and a lot of the stuff I just ignore.
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:13.200]   Time machine is definitely one of them.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:17.120]   Everything's like the old joke, "Doctor, Doctor, it hurts when I do this."
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.920]   The doctor says, "Don't do that."
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:26.000]   I think everybody is mostly happy, but they have those one or two pet bugs.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.360]   I was okay with iTunes.
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:31.440]   I don't think it's quite as clear to use and easy to use as the old version was, but
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:32.840]   I was okay with it.
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:37.240]   Then I encountered that I needed to sort...
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.360]   I was searching for a song.
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:40.360]   The name of the...
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:43.560]   I forgot what the title of the song was, but it was a common word, and so you search
[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:46.880]   for it and there's a million songs of that title.
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.640]   It's also because it's just a one-key word, broad-key word search.
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:51.640]   I'm sorry, it's Harmony.
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:54.120]   It's the name of the song.
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:57.960]   Every song that had the word Harmony in it had a band by the name of Harmony in it,
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:00.160]   I don't know, by the name of Harmony in it.
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:05.080]   On the Amazon IP3 store, it's like, "Okay, there are 1,000 returns, but I'll sort it
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:08.600]   by title name that keeps scrolling until I get to the Hs and I'll be able to see which
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:10.240]   one I actually want."
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:14.840]   With the iTunes, I had one of those moments where you conclude that, "Wow, this doesn't
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:16.400]   work the way I expected it to.
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:19.000]   It must be because I'm stupid and I don't know how to use this.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.640]   I will keep clicking buttons until I figure out how I can sort these search results by
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:23.640]   title."
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:29.120]   Then finally had to email Chris Breen and say, "Chris, I want you to tell me that I'm
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:34.960]   an idiot, that there is a way to sort the results the way I could in the previous version
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:39.040]   of iTunes and I will tell you, "Oh my God, I can't believe I couldn't figure that out
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.040]   myself.
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:41.520]   Aha, aren't I stupid?"
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:45.720]   Because if you tell me that the new iTunes can't do that, even though that's such an
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:50.640]   obviously useful feature, I will be very, very sad for so many reasons, Chris.
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:51.880]   I don't want you to break my heart.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.840]   I want you to tell me I'm an idiot.
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:55.320]   At least tell me an idiot because that's what I mean.
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:56.720]   iTunes 11 is like Windows 8.
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.080]   It's in between two stages of Apple's development curve.
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:02.360]   It's half the old thing with a new wrapper on top.
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:04.360]   The next 30 iTunes is the same.
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:05.360]   2 stages, giving it them.
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:06.360]   I did 12.
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:07.360]   Give it a good day.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:08.360]   It's pure math.
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:12.120]   Because you can tell it's basically got a new skin, but they managed to rewrite a lot
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:15.880]   of the stuff and they've got to get it fully into the new.
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:21.360]   I really think it's going to be interesting to see what we see with a keyboard with the
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:23.920]   Apple TV and you've got to have some kind of magic.
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:24.920]   I'm gone over the thing tonight.
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:28.880]   But the point is, is that I think that we have to see where they go with that because
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:33.080]   we might see them experimenting using Apple TV as a hobby, experimenting with what it
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:38.120]   would look like if people were just operating with iOS device that did all of that.
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:39.480]   You can tell us what they usually do.
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:43.520]   We had that discussion last week about Lisa to the Mac and now is Siri going to be a
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:45.000]   natural language operating system?
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.760]   Is the Apple TV going to be a living room operating system?
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:49.320]   That's where the money is.
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:51.880]   They're chasing the money if nothing else.
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:56.520]   We're going to take a break, come back with your picks of the week.
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:57.760]   Prepare them now, gentlemen.
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:59.120]   I got a great one.
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.120]   All right.
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:03.560]   It's barely any.
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:04.560]   It's barely any.
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:05.560]   Sliver.
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:06.560]   Sliver.
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:07.560]   I got something that's free.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:08.560]   How about that?
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:09.560]   It's called go to meeting.
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:10.560]   And it is a great solution.
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:15.520]   This winter when the roads are closed and people got the flu and it's just hard to get
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:17.280]   the work done during the winter.
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:21.160]   But go to meeting makes it possible to work face to face no matter where you, your employees,
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:25.600]   your clients, or your colleagues are go to meeting has the best green sharing built
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:26.600]   in.
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:33.080]   And now with HD faces, it's got video to crystal clear video that lets you present from an iPad
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:34.320]   if you want.
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:39.040]   Hold meetings from your mobile devices, iPhone, iPad, laptop, desktop.
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:41.480]   If you don't have go to meeting installed on your computer at work, you should do it
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:42.480]   right now.
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.480]   It makes it so easy to start a meeting.
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:45.320]   By the way, that's like 90%.
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:51.120]   Well, not 90, but it's certainly a chunk of the reason I use it is because I could just
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:54.520]   click a button, start a meeting, send out the invitations.
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:57.120]   Everybody has all the information they need in the email to join it.
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:58.360]   It's just very straightforward.
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.240]   It adds it to my calendar.
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:02.120]   And then when the meeting starts, they can see my screen.
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.120]   I can see them.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.120]   It's really easy.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:07.600]   And even if you're using it for, we use a go to meeting as much for bringing people
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:11.200]   in over to the phone bridge because a build of phone bridge has your own phone bridge.
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:14.800]   And I just, you know, it's funny because you kind of, we talk about all these great
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:19.520]   whizzy features, but sometimes just ease of starting and having a meeting is really
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:21.360]   a lot of the work done for you.
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:24.720]   I think the best thing to do is just try it for 30 days free.
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:28.360]   The apps are free, of course, iPad, iPhone, Android.
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:30.240]   And for the next 30 days, so is the service.
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:31.680]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:38.120]   I want you to click the try it free button and use our offer code MAC break 30 days free.
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:42.280]   It's the easiest way to start, join, and the best way to present at a meeting.
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:43.280]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:45.720]   Use the offer code MAC break.
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:47.200]   We thank them for their support.
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:50.960]   They're actually Citrix for their support of all of our shows.
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:53.440]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.680]   Since Renaissance, you're in studio.
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:56.200]   It's so nice to have you.
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:57.880]   Let me let you start.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:04.440]   I am going to start with Jordan McNair's Caratica, which was an Apple game a long time ago.
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:09.480]   He wrote it while he was in college, I believe, and he has redone it for iOS and a bunch of
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:12.160]   other platforms, but it's on the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:14.400]   It is a brand new game and it's very interesting.
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:17.320]   I had a chance to talk to him about it and he's more of a storyteller.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:18.320]   He does graphic novels.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:19.320]   He does movies.
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:20.320]   He did Prince of Persia.
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.040]   I love Prince of Persia.
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:23.240]   He really likes to tell a story.
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:26.280]   So in this game, it's not just like your one character dies.
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:27.280]   You get another life.
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:28.280]   You actually have three separate characters.
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.280]   He started this.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:30.280]   Oh, Jordan McNair.
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:32.000]   In 1984, he started this.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000]   Yes, sir.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]   And he's just redone it for iOS.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.000]   Evil War.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.600]   And it's great because you have your true love has been stolen by the evil warlord again.
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:42.600]   Oh.
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.800]   And you have three characters instead of three lives, you have three characters to try to
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:45.800]   rescue him.
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:46.800]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.400]   You have the monk, you have the brute, and you have the true love.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.240]   And you can finish it.
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:52.200]   If you can finish it with the true love, it's really challenging.
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.760]   The brute so powerful, it's easy to do.
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:57.520]   So using all three lives, you can still finish it probably in one session, but being able
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:00.800]   to finish it with the first, with the main character is hard.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:04.160]   And it's almost like music because the way that they did the multi touches, you attack
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:05.680]   on rhythm, you attack on beat.
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:07.520]   So it's more like playing an instrument than playing a game.
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:09.000]   Well, this is very much like karate.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.800]   You know, the in arcade game.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:12.800]   Yes.
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:15.880]   And well, a lot of people remember karateka from the early days of the Mac.
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:16.880]   And this is an Adam.
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:18.520]   This is the old version.
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:20.480]   So this is this is the Apple II version.
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:21.480]   Now let's let's jump ahead.
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:22.480]   I want to see what it looks like.
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:23.480]   And it's the promo video.
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:25.480]   Is it on Mac?
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:26.480]   No, it's on iOS.
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:28.480]   So iPhone and iPad.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.480]   All right, I'm going to download it right now.
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:32.640]   And it's also another consoles, but it's it's a fantastic way to spend a few hours.
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:34.120]   Now, how are the controls on iPad?
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:38.280]   Because this is my pet peeve is that people are trying to do game, you know, game controllers.
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:39.280]   You didn't do that.
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.280]   There's no fake joystick.
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:41.280]   There's no five motion.
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:42.280]   It's pretty.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.960]   Yeah, you are literally playing music with you.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:45.960]   That's not it either.
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:46.960]   That's not gameplay.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:47.960]   That's the character.
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:50.600]   But it's a promo video where they're combining live action and and.
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:52.680]   Oh, but the game looks fantastic.
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:54.320]   It's got a lot of particle effects.
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:55.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:56.320]   Particle effects.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:57.320]   It's it's yeah.
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:01.200]   And again, he really wanted to tell a story and he wanted to make it an experience, not
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:03.640]   just here to their game.
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:05.840]   K-A-R-A-T-E-K-A.
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:06.840]   Taretika.
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:07.840]   Taretika.
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:08.840]   Istavjava.
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:12.600]   I love Jordan Meckner.
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:13.600]   That's awesome.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.080]   He's one of the best game.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:16.320]   It's a bursches brilliant.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.480]   We got to speak with him for about an hour and we'll have that up next week.
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:19.480]   Oh, that's great.
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:20.480]   On the I'm-More podcast.
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:21.480]   I'm debug.
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:22.480]   Debug.
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:23.480]   It's our developer podcast.
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:24.480]   Oh, man.
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:25.480]   I got to listen to that.
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:26.920]   Does he kind of get the nitty gritty?
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:27.920]   We had it was interesting.
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:31.640]   We had Adam atomic who did a cannonball and hundreds on last week.
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:33.080]   Next week, it's Karetika.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:34.080]   Yeah.
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:35.080]   So it's hundreds is kind of amazing.
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:36.080]   Yeah.
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:37.080]   We showed that on this show yet.
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:39.080]   We Sarah picked it while we were at CES.
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:41.080]   She picked it on the I-5 and she picked it while you showed it.
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:42.080]   Well, we were at CES.
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:43.080]   She picked it.
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:44.080]   Yeah, okay.
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:45.080]   Because that is an amazing game.
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.800]   And these are people who really think seriously about telling a story and doing gameplay.
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:49.160]   It's not just for them.
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:50.720]   Is it iPad only or iPhone?
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:53.160]   I can find it on the I've only had it on my iPad.
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:54.160]   So I don't know.
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:55.160]   I can't find it on the iPad.
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:57.600]   So I think Apple's search is kind of borked.
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.560]   What a surprise.
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:01.320]   Bork, bork, bork, bork, bork.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.160]   It's an excellent way to spend an evening.
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:05.360]   Andy Inaco, your pick of the week.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:06.520]   I will endorse Renee's pick.
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:07.520]   I bought this.
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:11.800]   As soon as I heard the name Caratica and still available, it was Caching.
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:14.840]   I'm buying the style of works.
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:15.840]   Okay.
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:23.320]   My pick is from in case the origami iPad cover.
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:26.400]   You're used to how the regular iPad cover works.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:29.240]   It folds and then you can fold it like that.
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:33.800]   And it lets you use it like this and it lets you use it like that.
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:35.040]   But that's really about it.
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.080]   And also it kind of pops off the hinge when you don't want it to.
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:42.000]   So in case I love them.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.960]   They have I've used the origami keyboard stand for like two years and it's an absolutely
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:50.360]   essential piece of kit for me for the iPad.
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:55.320]   This is, well, they said, oh, so you want Apple, your idea is for like a folding iPad
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:56.320]   cover?
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.320]   Okay.
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:59.080]   Let us show you how to do that for real.
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:00.560]   So this is step one.
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:01.560]   Look at this.
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:04.400]   So it's covered front, back and sides.
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:11.040]   It is no thicker when it's on your iPad than just a layer of thin like rubberized rubberized
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:12.040]   surface.
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:14.800]   It has a nice cover, nice elastic that keeps it closed.
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:18.360]   This elastic also works to like give you something to hold on to if you're walking around with
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:19.360]   it.
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:20.800]   But here's how it works.
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:24.040]   When I got it, I thought that it was nothing and actually didn't even play with it for
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:25.040]   like three or four days.
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:26.800]   I thought it was just really nothing.
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:28.480]   So here's what you do.
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:29.480]   It has magnets built in.
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.920]   So it's a magnetic cover.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:37.320]   All you do is you unfold it like this, unfold it like that and put the tab like that, resulting
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:39.280]   in this pointy thing.
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:41.400]   So okay, that's not very interesting.
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:43.880]   Well, look at how this shape works.
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:48.720]   That means that you can use it as a stand as this angle right here.
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:52.720]   You can hold it like this and have it a portrait, this angle like that.
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:58.320]   You can, if you, if you leave it like an angle like that and you rotate it, now you've got
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.920]   two more angles you can actually use it for.
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:04.520]   It's a simple shape, nothing terribly complicated.
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:10.640]   It goes back to its original position so easily and yet it transforms into six different shapes,
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:11.960]   six different angles.
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:18.040]   So it works both with portrait and landscape and it's just so, it's not only, it's, it's
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:22.520]   just like the origami keyboard cover that I have where not only do you love it because
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:23.720]   it's perfectly functional.
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:24.720]   It's a great solution.
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:28.280]   But also man, they've got, they've got, they, they had clever saw.
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:33.160]   They saw us on top of clever beans for breakfast for like a month to come up with this.
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:34.640]   It's one, it's really, really great.
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:35.720]   It's the great thing.
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:39.360]   Now the price, okay, it's a little bit up there.
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:43.920]   It's a $70 case according to the, according to the website, which surprised me a little
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:46.520]   bit, but it's, it's well made.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:50.840]   And again, it's sometimes you do, as, as apple people, we realize that sometimes if
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:54.640]   you want to get exactly the right thing that you're hoping to find, it will cost a little
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:58.640]   bit more than the cheap piece of plastic that doesn't really work properly.
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:02.720]   And the fact that this is really is the sort of cover that I really, really always wanted
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:07.480]   for the iPad just makes it worth it because this was kind, this is kind of interesting
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:08.480]   too.
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:11.840]   And I like, you know, of course I still like the fact you can fold it around and hold
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:12.920]   it like a book.
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:17.880]   But again, the number of times I've pulled my iPad out of my bag and this came off with
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:21.920]   it and I have to reach in and then put this right back on to the right size just so I
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:24.480]   can turn it back off again and put it back on.
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:28.880]   That's like, I would pay for every, every, every three times I didn't have to do that.
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:31.600]   Over the next two months, I would happily pay $5.
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:35.760]   And so the price difference between these two, I think definitely makes it worth it.
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:38.600]   So it's from in case as called the origami cover.
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:39.600]   Is it?
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:40.600]   Yes.
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:41.600]   Oh, sorry.
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:43.280]   The origami jacket.
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:47.080]   I had the product information page on the page I was using to demonstrate the iPad with
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:48.080]   so I can go.
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:49.080]   Sorry to see it.
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:53.240]   Available in the spring, $69.95 origami jacket.
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:54.240]   Very cool.
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:56.120]   Now you say you got something extra special.
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:57.120]   You actually have two picks.
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:59.080]   So go ahead and fire when ready.
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:00.880]   First is a correction from last week, not a correction.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:01.880]   Yeah.
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:02.880]   A grocery IQ is great.
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:03.880]   But you found something better.
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:06.720]   But, well, the listeners found something better.
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:08.280]   Dr. Mom was saying, I don't use that.
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:09.280]   I use.
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:10.280]   Right.
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:17.200]   So Michael Fessler on Twitter and Brian Mathias on our own G+ community.
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:21.560]   So I'm going to add any list, which I downloaded.
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:22.560]   And it works.
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:23.560]   It does look better.
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:24.560]   Has the Carlita test?
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:25.560]   It does.
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:28.480]   And see now it was much smoother for us to get integrated back and forth.
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:29.480]   So now I'm sitting at the store.
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:30.480]   I was using grocery.
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:31.480]   I clued for a long time.
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:32.480]   So I'm going to get any list.
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:33.480]   So any list.
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:35.200]   And it was super seamless.
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:40.280]   And we were able to, it's really easy to, you know, I'll be sitting at the store and
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:42.200]   just adding things to it.
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:43.200]   So it's a.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.200]   Sure, I want that feature.
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:45.200]   No, it's useful.
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:46.200]   It's better than trying to.
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:47.200]   It's better than turning around.
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:48.200]   Right.
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:49.200]   So anyway, so it's.
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:53.200]   I think it is iPhone only, but that's all I need.
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:54.200]   I'll sit on the iPad.
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:59.560]   But anyway, so that one I think is it actually did work a bit smoother than grocery IQ, which
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:01.960]   I think is still great, but I think any list is probably better.
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:02.960]   Okay.
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:05.640]   So this is from this was a and by the way, thank you.
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:12.920]   I am reading as much as I can from the our Mac break weekly community on Google+, increased
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:15.200]   by like 1200 over the last week.
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:17.360]   So we're almost the 2000 members.
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:18.720]   So we hope that you join.
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:19.720]   There's a lot.
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:23.120]   There's great photos of people's workspace and their screens and everything else.
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.720]   So I would definitely check it out.
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:26.720]   Check this out.
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:32.000]   So Kevin Hanson, who works who works at our company showed me this one.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.360]   He's like, do you have a pick for today?
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:34.960]   And I was like, Oh, I had some ideas.
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:36.440]   I know I had all these things I was going to do.
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:38.520]   And then he showed me this.
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:39.520]   Okay.
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:40.520]   This is called.
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:43.520]   What's going on?
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:44.520]   It's like, are those ISO bars?
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:50.680]   So this is it's called windscape and that is a sample from the last three hours.
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:55.240]   And so it is it's so it's updating every three hours and it is the wind patterns.
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:56.440]   You can move it back and forth.
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:58.240]   So you can see other parts of the world.
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:01.520]   If you just so if you look at what it's doing there, see what the wind pattern.
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:02.520]   Oh, I look at that.
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:03.520]   Look at that.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:06.520]   I mean, so it is just clouds that are right.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:11.320]   So you're seeing a you're seeing the imagery of the clouds and you're seeing samples of
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:14.880]   what's actually going on that's creating those clouds.
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:16.880]   And I just find it.
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:17.880]   I mean, it just mesmerizing.
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:20.160]   They know they look like little nets flying around.
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:21.160]   I don't know.
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:23.080]   I don't know what they're doing to do that.
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:25.320]   But what I do know is that it's cool.
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:28.600]   You know, you can look at these little you can see the high pressure systems, the low pressure
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:32.840]   systems, and you can see the clouds, but you can see the air air currents that are
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:33.840]   creating those.
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:34.840]   This is really neat.
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:35.840]   It is as it is.
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:36.840]   Real time wind.
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:39.840]   And I think that what's happening there might be a name for my quick.
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:43.840]   I think yeah, the name we thought about for a while.
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:44.840]   Real time wind.
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:45.840]   Rounding is hard.
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:51.680]   But I think actually what's happening here is that it is it's sampling is doing a loop
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:53.760]   of the last three hours over every second.
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:56.920]   So what you're seeing because you'll notice that it kind of fades in about every second.
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:00.160]   So so it's not that you're seeing obviously the wind isn't going that fast if it was.
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:01.840]   We'd all be dead.
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:05.440]   But the but you can really see some fascinating.
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:06.440]   Wow.
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:08.000]   Look at this dream of something.
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.040]   Right, but you understand how the how the different flows work when you you know, when
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:14.320]   you see the jet stream and things right.
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:16.160]   You can see it actually happening.
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:20.560]   So it's anyway, I think it's like two ninety nine or something like that or one ninety
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:24.400]   nine and it it you know, I don't even know what to do with it other than it's just fun
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:25.400]   to watch.
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:26.400]   Yeah.
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:29.520]   I wish you could like control the weather like if I get my finger here.
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:30.880]   You want to be a good one.
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:31.880]   Let's go.
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:35.360]   Bear and now let's have a little wind here and report.
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:36.360]   Please stop that.
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:37.360]   No, three fail boats.
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:39.360]   Yeah.
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:40.360]   Some day.
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:41.360]   It's Leo almighty.
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:42.960]   Populous the real world version.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:44.360]   That's the new sim beta is out there.
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:45.360]   Yeah.
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:46.360]   Look at this.
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:47.840]   Look at these little spinning around things.
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:49.120]   It doesn't explain anything around it.
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:51.080]   It just it's just you just watch his pretty.
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:52.080]   It's a visualization.
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:53.080]   Look at that.
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:54.080]   What's going on here?
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:55.080]   There's some is that a hurricane?
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:56.080]   It must be a thing.
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:57.080]   It's a typhoon.
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:58.720]   It's a typhoon building up around Madagascar right now.
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:47:59.720]   Look at that.
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:00.720]   Yeah.
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:01.720]   So you do not want to be in the middle of that.
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:02.720]   Right.
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:05.360]   Well, and I think that this is so one of the things to think about this when we look at
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:08.640]   the future of education too is being able to visualize data like this.
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:13.480]   And then you combine this with videos and discussion and everything else really creates
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:14.480]   great for students.
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:15.480]   Right.
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:18.480]   To really understand what's going on and have a discussion like and talk about what causes
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:19.480]   that and what's there.
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:20.480]   Makes it real.
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:21.480]   Yeah, it makes it very real.
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:22.800]   This is what's really happening here.
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:23.800]   That's incredible.
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:24.800]   Neat.
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:25.800]   What's it called?
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:27.800]   It's called windscape.
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:28.800]   Windscape.
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:31.600]   And it's on the it is for the iPad.
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:32.600]   It's iPad only.
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:35.280]   It looks like that to any list is iPad.
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:36.280]   I apologize.
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:39.280]   I was able to download it and install it in the iPad.
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:43.680]   Well, I'm just going to say thank you so much everybody because I don't even I did
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:45.440]   my pick which was fine.
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:48.720]   I should mention though, a number of people after I talked about mine said well, Cinegram
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:49.960]   is cool.
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:51.640]   Why does it Cinegram get as much attention?
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:52.640]   And I don't know.
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:53.640]   I guess because Twitter didn't own it.
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:54.640]   Yeah, Twitter bot.
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:55.640]   Fine.
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:59.640]   But Cinegram is kind of neat if you know, if you ever played with Cinegram, it's an iPhone
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:01.720]   app also.
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:04.520]   So I guess what I could demonstrate it by.
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:05.520]   Okay.
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:11.160]   So Renee and Alex just do something funny.
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.760]   Okay, that's good.
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:15.520]   I recorded a little video of that.
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:17.760]   Now what I can do that's kind of cool.
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:18.960]   I'm going to select that video.
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:21.680]   You can select a clip from it and you can I believe you can unlike.
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:27.040]   So now what I do is I color the part that I want to move and I the rest of it can just
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:28.040]   stay there.
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:30.240]   So I can just say, I just want Renee's hand to move.
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:34.960]   And now everything all every only his hand only his hand will move.
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:35.960]   That that was no good.
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:37.960]   Let's let's let's undo that's freaky.
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:39.960]   That's kind of scares me.
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:42.360]   Let me just let's see just.
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:43.360]   Hmm.
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:45.120]   It just just just Renee's face.
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:47.520]   Let's just have his face kind of do stuff.
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:52.520]   Well, this isn't the perfect example.
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:54.200]   That is an accurate Canadian Aquinas South Park.
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:58.640]   And you can by the way, the loops you can post it has it's very similar to vine in the
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:00.720]   sense that it has some filtering.
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:04.200]   You know, you can change the filters and then you can upload it to all your social networks.
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:05.600]   It's very similar to vine.
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:06.600]   Great.
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:08.840]   Everyone wants to get into a video.
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:10.000]   Yeah, it's exactly.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.480]   And I actually think in some ways this is preferable, but it won't get as much attention
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:15.240]   because everybody's going to be using by it.
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:16.240]   Cinegram.
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:17.240]   Cinegram.
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:18.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:19.240]   Cinema gram.
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:20.240]   There's a good example.
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:21.240]   Look at that.
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:25.240]   See the kids are still, but their shadows are moving stuff like that.
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:26.720]   The books are moving, but she's not.
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:29.040]   These are much better examples than this than I did.
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:30.400]   Let's see if this one loads in.
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:31.400]   Look at that.
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:32.400]   I like that.
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:33.400]   See, isn't that cool?
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:35.960]   They're standing still, but their shadows are moving and they loop.
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:36.960]   Here's Andy's got one.
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:37.960]   He's done something.
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:39.600]   Oh, this doesn't work as well as should.
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:41.680]   This is something I shot in Times Square.
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:43.640]   So like the people are moving, but Andy's not.
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:44.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:45.640]   Yeah.
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:49.080]   So if this were actually a frame rate would be kind of cool, but as it is, it's kind of
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:52.120]   like a cinema gram.
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:53.760]   Cinema plus the word gram.
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:54.760]   And then of course, vine.
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:55.760]   You should probably have both.
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:56.760]   Three.
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:57.760]   It's probably worth having both.
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:50:58.760]   All the apps.
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:00.680]   All the apps have all the apps.
[01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:02.400]   We thank you all for joining us.
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:06.680]   We do Mac break weekly as soon as Leo gets here after some point after 11 AM.
[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:12.120]   I apologize for my tardiness, but I had a hair stuck in my throat.
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:13.680]   No, I just did.
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:14.920]   Just took me a long time to get in here.
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:20.040]   It's a long story, but I will be here next time exactly 11 o'clock because I'll have come
[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:26.720]   back from a Super Bowl relaxed, relaxed, rested and sober.
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:27.720]   Well played.
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:28.720]   Just honest to you.
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:34.120]   That's my promise to you 11 AM Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time 1900 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:36.760]   Mr. Chad Johnson, our producer, you have a word.
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:37.760]   I do.
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:39.120]   I have two things to bring up.
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:42.080]   One is that Twit this weekend will happen at 1 p.m.
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:46.640]   Ah, very important program note because we know you're not going to watch Twit during
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:47.640]   the Super Bowl.
[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:51.760]   We're moving and because the tech guys prerecorded, we'll be done with the tech guy, but 1 p.m.
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:54.600]   Pacific 4 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday.
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:59.720]   So we will be doing a live Twit not featuring me, Father Robert Balasert, Tom Merritt, Frank
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:01.160]   Abellmann and Brian Brushwood.
[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:03.160]   Veronica Belma and Brian Brushwood.
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:04.160]   Wow.
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:05.160]   Yeah, I'll start.
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:07.200]   You're not going to miss me at all.
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:09.600]   Have fun at the Super Bowl.
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:11.800]   I may be a call in from New Orleans.
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:13.640]   I'm here in the stands.
[01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:16.640]   I've been waiting here since 10 AM.
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:21.400]   Yeah, I'm going to do a fine, I don't know, synagram thing with the Super Bowl.
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:23.520]   We're going to, I'm going to play with social media while I'm there.
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:24.520]   Why not?
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:28.640]   Have some full body paint or just the face and the wind.
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:30.120]   Just like those girls in Super Bowl.
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:31.120]   Yes.
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:32.120]   Hyper Max paint.
[01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:33.120]   I can't decide.
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:35.160]   I was thinking of just shaving 49 in the back of my head.
[01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:36.520]   That'd be awesome.
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:37.520]   I'm just excited.
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:39.800]   And the truth is I'm not a huge football fan.
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:44.320]   I can't lay claim to that, but Lisa is and she's very excited.
[01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:46.240]   This is her birthday to do today, by the way.
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:47.240]   So happy birthday, Lisa.
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:49.360]   And her birthday present is a trip to the Super Bowl.
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:50.360]   That's pretty cool.
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:53.800]   That's her favorite team, the Niners We've been since 1994.
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:58.240]   And then finally, I just wanted to say that we still have that awesome YouTube channel.
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:03.760]   Head on over to youtube.com/macbreakweekly and subscribe if you want to get updates every
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:04.760]   week.
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:05.760]   Yeah.
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:10.040]   And you can go to Twitch to see all of our shows and subscribe to them individually to
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:11.280]   get all of our shows.
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:12.560]   Exactly.
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:14.120]   And that strange video of me.
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:18.000]   That video of you, just that, that face.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.600]   I'm trying to point where the shows are.
[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:22.480]   And I never did quite get it right.
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:23.480]   James Bond.
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:24.480]   You were close.
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:25.480]   That was really good as close.
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:27.280]   Well, there's also playlists down there.
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:30.760]   I just want to point out there's 13,000 views of that video.
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:31.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:33.080]   That's more than most of our shows.
[01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:34.080]   I don't understand.
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:35.840]   Oh, I guess I should have.
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:36.840]   It's that face, Leo.
[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:38.280]   I have more dogs on the show apparently.
[01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:41.200]   You know what you're pointing at.
[01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:44.240]   You know, maybe I will stop by the chat room from the Super Bowl.
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:47.720]   I think I'll have plenty of time to chat.
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:51.440]   We do this show on, as I said, on Tuesdays, come by and visit us live if you can.
[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:52.440]   If you can't, don't worry.
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:58.400]   On-demand audio and video always available after the fact of twit.tv/mbw.
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:02.520]   We have MP3s, but we also have HT video now.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:03.520]   We have SD video.
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:05.280]   We have a whole different number of flavors.
[01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:10.560]   You can also subscribe to your favorite format on the iTunes store.
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:14.760]   Some people have pointed out, and this is true, some of our videos from CTS, the HD will not
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:20.840]   play obviously on an early Apple TV because it won't play HD, but even some of the larger
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:22.040]   file sizes will not.
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:25.640]   And that's just an issue with the old Apple TV.
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:26.640]   The trouble we went through.
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:30.280]   Yeah, I think it's just an excuse to get a new Apple TV and point anything else.
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:31.280]   $99.
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:34.280]   And now you can use your keyboard.
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:36.120]   Thanks for joining us everybody.
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:40.320]   We get back to work now because break time is over.
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:41.160]   Have a great eye world.
