[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   I'm Renee Ritchie, filling in for a vacationing Leo Laporte, who was out flying the Hawaiian
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.120]   Mountains we think in search of 5G.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.840]   I'm joined by Andi Nako and Lori Gill, and we're talking power beats, right to repair

[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.040]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.400]   I'm Renee Ritchie, filling in for Leo Laporte, who is off chasing 5G signals around volcanoes
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.840]   in Hawaii.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.800]   And that's actually real life better than the story I made up for him going in.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.000]   I'm joined this week by Andi Nako, who I think is still joining me in the Eastern winters.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   How are you, Andi?
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.200]   Yes, we are the standing against the wall protecting you from the Southern vortex that
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.960]   keeps you from being able to ski and enjoy ice drinks in Canada.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.480]   So we're taking the hit for you.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.040]   These 52 degree temps, we're taking the hit for you, Renee.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.080]   It's like, it's total whiteout outside, but it is glowing in here because Lori Gill is
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.080]   also with us.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.080]   How are you doing, Lori?
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.080]   Glowing like the sun.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.720]   Oh, that California sun.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.960]   It's about three inches away from the surface of California now, isn't it?
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.240]   You don't want to know how comfortable my weather is.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.240]   I don't want to tell you so.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.400]   It's almost oppressive, wouldn't you say, Lori?
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.080]   You're having so much trouble getting work done.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.280]   Whereas you wish that you were in the climbs of Renee and myself, who can just focus on
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.160]   staying inside, keeping the heater going and working.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.160]   Yes.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.160]   No, no, I don't.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.160]   I just think.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.160]   Give us something.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.160]   I think.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.960]   I just watched Peter McKinnon's video about Adobe adding content aware fill to Adobe premiere.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.160]   And for the first three minutes of the video, all I could talk about was how warm it was
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.720]   in California.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.240]   That's how far we have some content aware fill.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.800]   Super great, but you people have the sun.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.160]   Everybody moved to California.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.480]   No, wait, don't.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.160]   You're already making our rents too high.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.000]   All right, so while Leo is away, we still have some.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.840]   Can we help you with the people's revolution?
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.160]   Because it's actually going to need more bodies for that and it's coming really soon.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.800]   Yes, we mean some hands across America happening.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.400]   No, no, I mean, there is some news.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.320]   We can get to it, but like we can just we can chat for a while first.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.760]   But I want to get Lori's take on this because she spent all week with it.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.080]   And that was the, I guess surprise announcement.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.160]   I'm going to call it that of PowerBeats Pro, which come with the H1 chip, just like AirPods,
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.320]   but heavy bunch of features that the AirPods don't.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.760]   Yeah, this was kind of an exciting out of nowhere kind of thing.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.160]   It's a pretty impressive looking little device beats.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.080]   They're known for making a good set of headphones.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.360]   They're also known for making headphones that are base heavy.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.240]   So obviously that I don't think this is going to change.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.600]   I think they're going to still have that sort of standard base heavy sound to them.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.280]   If that bothers you, you probably don't want to get yourself a set of beats.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.560]   But everything else about these earbuds look fantastic.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.760]   They have the same H1 chip as the AirPods 2.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.200]   So it has the faster processor, the shorter lag time, better connectivity to each of your
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.240]   devices.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.880]   Just the difference of the AirPods for me, the difference between AirPods 1 and AirPods
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.400]   2, it might seem insignificant, but it's those little things about being able to quickly
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.720]   connect to a phone call or quickly switch over to your Mac that have been sort of pain points
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.840]   in the past that are now almost completely alleviated.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.320]   There's still a little bit of lag, but it's much, much smaller than it used to be.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.520]   And these power beats pro have that same H1 chip.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.080]   Plus that means it comes with support for voice activated series so that you can ask
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.000]   Siri to do something like change the volume of your music or change the playlist or something
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.280]   like that without having to do any tapping.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.160]   But if you want to tap on something, Power Beat Pro do come with controls.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.160]   So there's--
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.160]   >> Hard work, crunchy controls.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.320]   >> Yes, there's actual little playback controls right on the headphones that will allow you
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.400]   to press a button to change the volume or fast forward or something like that.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.640]   So you don't have to be sitting in a quiet room and announce that you want Siri to do
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.640]   something for you.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.280]   You can do that with the controls on the headphones without even have to worry about
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.080]   going to your pocket or something like that.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.080]   So they seem really great.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.160]   I'm definitely getting one as soon as they come out, which is sometime in mid-May we don't
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.640]   have any specific date.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.360]   We just know that it's coming out in May.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.800]   So they're about $50 more expensive than the most expensive AirPods.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.480]   They're $249, which the AirPods 2, if you get it with the wireless charging case, is
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.040]   200-- sorry, $199.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.640]   The thing about Power Beat Pro though, they do not come with a charging-- a wireless charging
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.640]   case.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.640]   It's a standard charging case that uses a lightning port.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:00.800]   So you're really spending something closer to-- let's see if I could do the math in my
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.800]   head.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.560]   The AirPods are $149, is that right?
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.560]   So $100.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.400]   $199 with the case, yeah, but I forget what they are by themselves.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.640]   Yeah, so I think it's somewhere close to $100 more if you're getting them sort of spec
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.920]   by spec, the differences between the two.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.960]   Of course, we won't know how good the sound quality is until we get them in our ears.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.280]   I'm excited about the customization and the AirPods.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.640]   AirPods are uncomfortable for me.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.880]   They don't have any sort of flexibility or playability.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.960]   So even when just softly resting them in my ear, it starts to hurt that sort of the
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.160]   outer edge of my ear.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.200]   So I'm looking forward to being able to use the Power Beat Pro because of the customized
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.360]   ear tips that will allow me to kind of decide which size is right for me and maybe push
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.040]   it in a little bit further without feeling the pain points of having something in my
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.720]   ear for a long period of time.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.320]   So the AirTips and I'm also looking forward to the sound quality of this.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.720]   I do actually appreciate the heavy bass sound that comes along with listening to Beats
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.880]   branded headphones.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.400]   I like to just have that sort of extra oof in my music.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.720]   Sometimes it's a negative effect sometimes when you're trying to listen to some older
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.680]   heavy metal guitar heavy music, it kind of muddy the music a little bit.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.560]   For the most part, I've had a good experience with Beats.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.400]   The way they equalize their sound.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.720]   So I think it's going to be a good addition.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.720]   And colors, Andy.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.720]   Colors but not purple.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.720]   But not purple.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.720]   That's it.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.640]   You just go to Home Depot, you sort that out very quickly.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.040]   I was surprised by the price though.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:51.200]   The time you get to $250, you should be comparing it to other wireless headphones that are $250.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.120]   And what are you, it's hard for me to figure out what they're delivering for what would
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:03.880]   be an easy hundred bucks over of any excellent pair of any or completely wireless Bluetooth
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.440]   buds.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:11.160]   And but if all they can do is promise you that there'll be more more resistant to sweat
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.280]   and rain than the original AirPods that are not really good at resisting either one of
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.280]   them.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.920]   I'm sure that there'll be people who want to get it.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:24.560]   There's also in Laurie, that's the exact reason why I just can't enjoy any pair of
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.920]   Beats headphones.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.880]   It's like if I want more bass, I've got a little slider on my phone that will let me
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.600]   give myself more bass.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.200]   But when I'm listening to those pieces of music that it's just so bass heavy that you
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:44.720]   can't focus on anything other than the bass line, it's just really, really bad.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.080]   But the biggest failure I think is going to be with the in-ear design, that is a big
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.520]   feature that you're not the only person who doesn't like, who finds it really comfortable
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.720]   to have those the AirPods in all the time.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:02.920]   All you need is like one piece of cartilage somewhere in your ear that is making any contact
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.840]   with that at a pressure point.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.680]   And you're out after 30 minutes.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.920]   The signature feature of the Beats headphones isn't just the bass.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:17.320]   It's playing your music at a reasonable volume, but still everybody else on the subway car
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.400]   could hear exactly every note that you're hearing.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:26.240]   So I hope that we can still annoy everyone around us while still having Beats headphones.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.000]   I don't know if it's possible with those silicone ear tips.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.640]   >> It's making Dre cry.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.000]   I can just see Dre crying right now.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.080]   >> There's a point to what you're saying, Andy, which there's so many features that
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.320]   I keep forgetting to include in this, which is they are noise isolating.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.480]   So they will- >> So sorry, what's the difference?
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.480]   What is the difference?
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.080]   Because people were really confused about noise canceling versus noise isolating.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.080]   >> Right.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.960]   So noise canceling, I've read this and I'm trying to see if I can get my memory to work
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.960]   right.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:10:06.040]   But noise canceling, if I recall, it actually uses technology inside of the headphone itself.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:11.000]   There's technology that actually under the wire there's secret-
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   >> It's like active, right?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   >> It's massing.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.440]   Well, there is a difference between noise canceling and active noise canceling.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:22.320]   The differences between those two are that you can actually manually make it noise canceling
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.080]   or not noise canceling.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.240]   But generally, noise canceling means that there's actual technology inside the butt itself
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.280]   that is cutting out the sound outside.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.000]   There's a little white noise or something that's hidden deep inside there that's actually
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.200]   cutting out.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.920]   It's blocking noise from happening.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:43.520]   Whereas noise isolating just means that the design of the earbud itself is designed to
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.640]   not allow outside noise in.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.600]   That's the main difference between the- >> Isolation versus computational isolation.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.120]   >> Yes, thank you.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.000]   That's a much more technological term than what I was doing.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   >> No, I was just making a dumb joke.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.640]   >> Can I just, speaking of dumb jokes, let's make an engineering note that technology in
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.280]   the butt should be one of the show titles for today's joke.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:10.400]   >> But yeah, no, I like the, I love the silicone butt earplugs because it's, if you really
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.480]   want to make sure you're not annoyed by other people on the flight or on the train or whatever,
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:20.440]   one way to do it is with $100 worth of technology to up the price.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.320]   Another way is to just turn them into earplugs that will also feed audio of your choice in
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.320]   there.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.520]   So it's weird.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:33.400]   I'm really keen to see what someone like Jim Dahlrample thinks about this, people who
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.600]   are really intense music listeners.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.240]   >> $2,000 air pod listeners.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.720]   >> Yeah, I don't get it.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.360]   I don't think it's silly if there are people who like what they like and they're willing
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.400]   to pay extra if they can afford it to have the best experience possible.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:57.440]   For me, I have to admit that above the, I can tell the difference between a $30 earphone
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.360]   and $100 earphones easy.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:06.920]   I can tell the difference between $100 earphones and $200, maybe $250 earphones if I have the
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   right music.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.920]   It's always, what gets it for me, whether it's a speaker or an earphone, it's not general
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.840]   how good does it sound.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.520]   It's the, I'm listening to it for like three or four days.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:23.040]   And finally, I hear that piece of music where, oh, there's actually a murmur of crowd noise
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.840]   that I should be hearing them not hearing.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:33.800]   Or, oh, these, there's actually a variation in frequency in that note that she's singing,
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.920]   but it's just, when, when there's just a point where the speaker just says, I'm out,
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.280]   I can't keep up, just come back to me in a second or two.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:47.480]   It's hard for me to figure out how to recommend these audio devices that go above a certain
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:54.800]   level because it's like, okay, if, I'm sure that if I've never ever listened to a live
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:00.040]   concert in my life or left the house and didn't damage my hearing above that certain level
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.720]   that everybody above the age of 30 gets their, their, their hearing damaged, it would be
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.720]   significant.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.120]   But let's see how they market this stuff.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.160]   I shall learn, I shall learn mightily, I assume.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:17.440]   I think in the case of these particular headphones, these beats, power beats pro, though they
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.680]   do have the term pro in them, I don't think that you're spending the extra $100 because
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.800]   you're getting a pro quality sound.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.800]   >> What?
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.800]   >> No, no slight on beats of it.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.480]   These are not engineering quality headphones.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.080]   Those are much more expensive than $250.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.520]   I think you're paying that extra money for the brand.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.520]   It's Levi's, it's Apple, it's the brand.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.720]   >> Well, pro means like $50 or $100 more, right?
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.840]   So when you add pro to something, it just, it's like a dark interface.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.680]   If there's certain things you do to a product, we're also friendly about this.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.880]   I want to introduce a lot of controversy just to get everyone off the rails because it is
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.880]   Macquarie Quickly.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.880]   >> No way.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.280]   >> So, Neelie Patel and Walt Mossberg, who are both tremendous, were having a disagreement
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.560]   about these headphones on Twitter and it fascinated me.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.680]   So Neelie's contention was that if Apple were truly brave, it would sell H1 chips to other
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.880]   headphone vendors so they could compete on a level playing field.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.560]   And Walt replied that competition is innovative and is innovative, sorry, competition and
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.800]   innovation are healthy.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.240]   So why should Apple share its wireless earbuds technology?
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.960]   Should Google be required to share its computational photo tech, Amazon, its tech?
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.920]   And then for some reason it got involved down to the point of Kentucky Fried Chicken and
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.960]   I don't know how that worked.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:31.760]   But it was interesting to me because Apple is, nobody likes Bluetooth.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.240]   I mean, everybody likes the consumers, like the convenience of Bluetooth, but nobody likes
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.800]   the constraints of Bluetooth.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.840]   And Apple has worked out a way to engineer around them and Google and Samsung are doing
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.240]   similar things.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:46.600]   But should Apple make the H1 chip widely available beyond just their own headphones?
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:55.120]   Well, I think just like making chargers that are MFi compatible, something that will allow
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:01.680]   the manufacturers to make something that is guaranteed to be of a good quality, I think
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.680]   that's a great idea.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:09.720]   I think it definitely opens up to our ability to have more going for us, more options going
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.720]   for us.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:16.000]   It doesn't mean that crappy companies are going to buy this up and make crappy headphones.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.720]   It would probably be very expensive, which would mean that only the higher quality manufacturers
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.520]   would want to spend the money on something like that.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.680]   I think it's a really great idea.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.120]   I would love to see the H1 chip in a wide variety of headphones just so that we have
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.880]   more options available to us.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.880]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.000]   I think it would be a great idea.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.120]   I don't think that Apple necessarily has any moral obligation to do so because I agree
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:50.600]   with Walthwalt because the solution is to be inspired by Apple's chip and realize that,
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:55.360]   oh, wow, that's right, Bluetooth does really, really stink and anything we can do.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.680]   And if we are making a set of headphones and a phone, perhaps there's a way we can leverage
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:06.520]   that technology to make it better and suck less.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:12.280]   But I think that Apple does do a lot of great work just by being part of the Bluetooth working
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:17.680]   group and the USB working group and all the ways that they communicate with the standards
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.280]   to say, here's something that we're doing that's going to work really, really well.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.800]   So hopefully they're talking to the Bluetooth committee about here's how we're using just
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.520]   a little extra chip to not only soak our users for an extra 40 or 50 bucks, but also make
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.000]   the experience a lot better.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.440]   So I'm sure all that's happening in back channels as it is.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:42.040]   I think any point pain for that any one engineer can understand is something that every engineer
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.000]   at every other company understands.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.640]   And also with headphones, it's very, very easy to know that every single engineer suffers
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.440]   alongside every actual user.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.160]   So they're eating their own dog food every single day.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.400]   To me, a couple of things stood out.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.280]   So I finished reviewing the AirPods second generation.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.480]   I got yelled at for calling them AirPods too by a bunch of people because apparently that's
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.480]   not really a thing yet.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.920]   So it's AirPods second generation.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.960]   And I found the audio to be roughly the same.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.680]   And that's pretty much what Apple said that there's no real change in the audio going into
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.680]   your ear.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.840]   But the audio coming out, the microphone is better because they've spruced it up for Yo
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.560]   Jimbo or Yo Seri, whatever you want to call it.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.000]   And that's resulted in also doing better things like canceling wind better.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.760]   And I'm running out of options because when I say the word thing.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:36.600]   I just realized that that's exactly the problem with Siri because it's exactly like the Yo
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.600]   Jimbo.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:44.960]   It's like, we'll see every single Siri, because Shlomo hears a different story from everyone.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:51.400]   Oh, the way that I experienced it was he said, set a timer not just for the front lights,
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.920]   but for the outside lights as well.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.920]   That's not the same.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.080]   It's doing all of us at the same time.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.080]   Yeah, no.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.960]   But I started saying Yo Seri and then people started complaining to me that it didn't work
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.880]   when they said that to Siri.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.360]   So then I felt bad the opposite.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.560]   So it is a space, space, space Siri.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.600]   That also fixed it up for things like canceling out wind noise and stuff better.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.960]   And overall, I really liked them exactly what Lori said previously.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.760]   If I was using it on one device, I wanted to go to another device, especially the Mac.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.640]   I would have to wait for it to show up, click on it.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.640]   It would fail.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.640]   I click on it again.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.280]   It would feel like it didn't take long, especially because nothing else did it better
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.280]   back then.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.200]   So I would just wait and would eventually work.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.040]   But now I can't remember the last time it wasn't one click.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.960]   It would show up, tap on it on my iPhone.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.960]   It worked.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.960]   Click on it on my Mac.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.960]   It worked.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.840]   Also putting it in for phone calls, especially if you were talking to other people who were
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.440]   on the Apple beat, everybody would spend a couple seconds laughing about, hold on, my
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.640]   airplods are connecting, hold on.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.240]   And now they just, they connect so fast.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.040]   And you were also like, oh, did I miss something?
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.040]   Did I miss what they said?
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.560]   Can I switch to my air pods?
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.560]   Will I miss something?
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.120]   And now you just put them in and you're pretty sure that it doesn't.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.000]   So it took, they're not, they don't change anything about air pods.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.760]   They just take a most of the things about air pods and make them better, including the
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:09.240]   memes because apparently air pods too are just, as meme worthy as the first air pods
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.240]   were.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:15.400]   And that's actually interesting to me because we saw that the iPhone was really popular
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.560]   with teens.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.240]   And I'm betting that's because of the means because, and forgive me for saying this, I
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:26.280]   don't think you can find a flex with your boogies if you don't have the air pods.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.000]   It's just, you'll see like one of the old with your Sam, he Google buds.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.960]   What message boards have you been hanging out on, right?
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:36.800]   I think these are things that people have actually said to him on Twitter, which is
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.800]   funny.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.560]   Yeah, they tweeted me this about air pods and I did, it took me like 20 minutes in urban
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.440]   dictionary to dig because Google translate was no help.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.080]   Apparently it doesn't speak millennial, but 20 minutes.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.080]   I speak Jiveyas.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.920]   About 20 minutes on urban dictionary.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.080]   The only other thing that I'm really curious about is to see if they've done any improvements
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.640]   on the battery because that's another thing that we're finding out now that the air pods
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.120]   have been out for long enough that we can see how long are these things expected to live.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:08.920]   That not only do people who exercise a lot find that it sweat infiltration and rain infiltration
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.080]   can kill these things, that the battery, it's just so small.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.480]   And because of the way these things have to be put together, you can't just crack them
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.600]   open and replace this really, really cheap little battery to get them going for another
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.600]   couple of years.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.520]   I'd be really keen to see what I fix it has to say about how the beats are put together.
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:29.800]   And if it's more likely that after two or three years, I don't have to buy another $200 pair
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.880]   of headphones by just replacing the battery.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.720]   That's tough to nail it because I went through my Bose noise canceling headphones way faster
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.720]   than I went through air pods.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:42.360]   And it was just the same thing is that I charged them so often and their battery was so small
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.280]   that it would just go through charge cycles.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.600]   Because with a phone, not everybody is depleting it, recharging it, depleting or charging it.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.800]   Most of us can make it most of the way through the day and we top it off a lot and the batteries
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.800]   are so much bigger.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.360]   That's why I think you never hear about tablet batteries, even to the extent you hear about
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.200]   phone batteries because they're enormous and they just have so much buffer for just so
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.400]   many things.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.680]   But these are like the tiny stuff and headphones are still tiny and the tiniest of tiny and
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.400]   lithium mic on it's still such a for all of its good points.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.840]   It is still a terrible, terrible technology.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.000]   And unless you make it like one of those things that pop up like my Pokemon don't go plus
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   do not laugh at me.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   I do not go.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.720]   The Pokemon go plus it opens up and I can swap in another one of those round circle watch
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:26.200]   batteries, but that's a big chunky plastic thing that I wouldn't stick in my ear hole.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:32.280]   It just bumps me out that so much of Apple technology and it is a problem with the entire industry
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.280]   I admit.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:38.960]   But it's being coming more notable with Apple tech that you might not get the full life
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.240]   out of the product that there's probably there's parts of it that are going to die well before
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.680]   the rest of it.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.680]   And if that dies, the Apple's not going to use the best.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.680]   That's what's getting it fixed.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:55.800]   And I think Andy you're talking about this repairability, which Apple is just kind of
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.320]   I think we know they get a score of two at the at best for almost everything that they
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.400]   put out from I fix it on their new hold for one second Lori because I have a big story
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.400]   about that.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.160]   But I think I'm going to throw it to Leo first just so that he can get his first taste of
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.200]   today's show and then we'll come back and get.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   No, we're sorry.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.000]   Oh, what's really good.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.960]   I promise this is this is this is this is up to you Renee because you are in the captain's
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.960]   chair.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:26.760]   But do you want to preserve a really slick segue that Lori Lori set up or do you don't
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:33.080]   know or we or we can use that as a teaser like as a cliffhanger like when the when it
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.040]   finds out we find out that oh no there are actually three clings on decloking and now
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.640]   we do the dramatic like or crescent.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:44.840]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.600]   Hold that thought will come right back to you.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.200]   But first we're going to find out if Leo has found any of his cheese.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.440]   Hey Renee, thank you so much for hosting.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.240]   I will be back next week.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:01.160]   But I want to do a little time out because I have to mention WordPress have to want to
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:05.120]   they want me to do their because I am a customer loyal WordPress.com customer.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.720]   I started using WordPress before there even was a WordPress.com when Matt Mullen wake first
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.120]   created it was hosting my own WordPress instance.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.240]   That was a lot of work.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.320]   I spent more time tweaking that than blogging.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.600]   So when WordPress.com came along 12 years ago, I immediately signed up and I'm very
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.480]   happy 12 year user.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.960]   That's where my blog, Leo, report.com lives.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:34.960]   I use WordPress because it's the simplest best way to make a website whether you're an
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.200]   individual or a business.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.520]   WordPress.com makes it easy.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.880]   They do all the tech stuff.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.880]   You don't have to be a techie.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.280]   They keep it secure.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.280]   They lock it down.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.400]   They provide you with all the tools you need to build an amazing site including thousands
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:55.680]   of themes and 24/7 support from actual WordPress users and experts.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.880]   So you're not getting somebody reading out of a book.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:03.240]   The WordPress support staff are avid users and they're actually enthusiasts so they
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.760]   know it.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:11.320]   And so when you have a question at WordPress.com, you've got the answer right there anytime.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.760]   WordPress lets anyone pursue whatever it is they love whether it's their business or
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.640]   their personal stuff by launching a site that's free to start with room to grow.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:25.680]   In fact, I tell teenagers, "Go now to WordPress.com and start putting your best stuff up on the
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.400]   web so that when people search for you, they find that."
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.400]   It's free.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.400]   Do it right now.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.240]   And as you grow, WordPress will grow with you.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.520]   I now am running the business version of WordPress because I love all the additional
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.160]   features I get.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.560]   It's one check mark to make it HTTPS.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.520]   That's true for all WordPress.com sites.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:48.120]   They've got AMP so you can pages load faster.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:54.440]   The best, literally the best comment engine ever with great anti-spam features, they really
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.440]   pioneered it.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.080]   A chismet is amazing.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.320]   I can go on and on.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.080]   WordPress.com is the place.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.040]   No two week trials, no hidden fees.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.440]   You own your content forever.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.480]   That's really important.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.040]   On Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg owns your content.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.920]   On Twitter, Jack Dorsey owns your content.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.400]   There's Snapchat, Evan Spiegel owns your content.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.440]   On WordPress.com, you own your content.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.520]   You can put anything there.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:26.560]   You can upload audio, video, music, text, anything, pictures.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.800]   WordPress.com is built to grow with you and get you where you want to be tomorrow.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.320]   If you're a business and you don't have a website at WordPress.com, you're missing
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.800]   the boat.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:41.280]   Quickly, run to WordPress.com, register your business name, set up that site.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.240]   It'll generate lots more business.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.440]   I don't even trust a business.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.640]   It doesn't have a WordPress site.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.480]   It doesn't have a site anyway.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.600]   You got to.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:55.920]   Millions of people use WordPress.com every day to turn their dreams into reality.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.040]   In fact, WordPress is so successful.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.360]   This almost doesn't sound like it's possible, but it's absolutely true.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.360]   One third of the Internet.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:11.680]   Globally, one third runs on WordPress, including some of the biggest publications in the world.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.000]   They use WordPress for their content management system.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.240]   Fortune.com, Quartz WordPress.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.320]   You should be using it.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.320]   It's great.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.320]   Easy to use.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.320]   Scales with you.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.800]   Go to Word.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.800]   They have a special place.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.360]   I want you to use this to show your support for MacBreak Weekly.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:35.240]   It's WordPress.com/MacBreak, and thanks to you, we'll get you 15% off any new plan purchase.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:40.120]   WordPress.com/MacBreak, 15% off your new website.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.880]   Thank you, WordPress, from the bottom of my heart.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.720]   Thank you, Matt Mullenweg and the entire team, for such a great product.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:51.600]   I've used it for so long, longer than Twitch's been around, and I will continue to use it.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.040]   I am WordPress for life, baby.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.800]   WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.120]   Thank you so much for their support.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.120]   Back to you, Renee.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.120]   All right.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:06.560]   So previously on MacBreak Weekly, we were discussing the PowerBeats Pro when Andy Naco
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:10.960]   cleverly segued us into talking about the reliability and longevity of batteries, and
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.680]   then Laurie Gill began to talk about right to repair and repairability.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.600]   And Laurie, I really want to get your take on this because there was a big Canadian story
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.320]   in the national, which is one of our, I don't know what the right, like 2020 for Canada,
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:28.280]   maybe it's like a news magazine show that airs on television, and they do these investigative
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.280]   reports.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:33.600]   And I don't want to call them gotcha pieces, but they often are, like they're very specific
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.840]   in their narrative with these mustache twirling, evil corporate, you know, entities.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:43.560]   And they did one on this couple, this wonderful couple from Newfoundland, the Dillard's who
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.920]   went on a vacation, Billard's, sorry.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:46.920]   They went on a vacation.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.080]   They went from Greece through Europe to Scandinavia.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.840]   It was months long.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:58.160]   They finally returned home and for whatever reason, they just didn't download the photos.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.760]   Now they don't tell us whether they had iCloud Photo Library or they had iCloud backup or
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.760]   if they sync with iTunes, it's never mentioned, but I'm presuming they didn't or someone was
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.360]   just a real jerk not to tell them to check there.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.960]   But they called up Apple or they communicated somehow with Apple and were told there was
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.840]   no way to recover the photos.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.280]   They went out, checked a bunch of local repair shops.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.400]   They were told the same thing.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.760]   There's no way to recover these photos.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.640]   And they heard about this place called iPad Rehab, which is this legendary repair shop
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.920]   outside of New York with run by Jessa Jones, who's just phenomenal.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:33.640]   And they sent the phone to her and she was able to recover the pictures and she shows
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.200]   up on FaceTime with them.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.800]   She has their logic board in a different case.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.320]   She's had to repair three or four chips that were damaged on the phone.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.080]   It ended up having two separate problems.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.120]   One was water related.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:48.400]   One was from some previous charging incident and she shows them all their vacation pictures
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.360]   and they're super, super happy.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.640]   But the story also then talks about how Apple is lying to people about the ability to recover
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:00.400]   these photos because nobody at Apple, they do talk about Apple forums where some guy
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.440]   named Kiltit Tim on the forums tells them that you can't recover the photos.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.440]   But they don't make it clear that Kiltit Tim is just like another user and probably
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.400]   not Tim Cook's screen name on Apple discussion forums.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:16.680]   But they do talk with Apple Chat and they aren't told about any recovery services for
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.680]   this phone.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.760]   The whole thing was that Apple was being deceitful about not telling people they can go out and
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:27.760]   get hardware storage recovery services done.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.560]   And it led me to think a couple things.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:34.680]   One is how important it is to have all that backup stuff turned on and even especially
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.720]   downloading priceless photos.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.480]   Accidents will always happen but it's really super important to do that.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:45.600]   But also data recovery in general because I've talked to a lot of people about it.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.960]   And for things like hard drives, I've always told them just go, get it done.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.160]   You typically have wedding, never mind vacation photos, wedding photos, photos of your children,
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.520]   photos of people who've passed away that you can never ever get again.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.720]   Literally priceless memories.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:03.800]   And that's also why different topic, I tell people not to encrypt those kinds of backups
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.880]   because you want to be able to get hardware disk recovery done to them.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:15.120]   But for things like your phone, your cell phone, I would be real careful sending it to anybody.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.600]   You know, even Apple because we've all heard stories about best buy geeks copying off
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.640]   all your photos and posting them on some shared community.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.280]   So I wanted to get your take on this.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.800]   Is this a right to repair thing?
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.240]   Is this a thing where you need to be careful?
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.720]   Is this a thing that Apple should make available themselves?
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.600]   What's your answer to this?
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.720]   >> So obviously there's a lot of little things that kind of come along with this as to how
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:43.040]   it was approached and how the couple were told that they couldn't recover their stuff
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.720]   from official channels.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:50.080]   I think Apple is making the right decision by not offering that as an option because they
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.840]   don't want to be liable if something even worse happens to their data.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:00.960]   So for example, if an Apple genius had said, well, we can't do anything about it, but there
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:08.280]   are these repair services that can pull that data off of the phone, physically pulling it
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.280]   out.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:15.760]   Then let's say something did happen where those photos got stolen by a nefarious data
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.800]   saver.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.920]   And then now, because Apple was the one that recommended that you go to someone else to
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.240]   have to pull these photos out, then people are going to start saying, well, Apple recommended
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.400]   that I go do this so it's their fault that these people stole my photos.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:33.080]   So I think Apple is on the right by saying that there's no official way to do it because
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:39.680]   though you can get your photos recovered by using these sort of forced entry type things,
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.480]   it's not official and it doesn't always work.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.600]   Sometimes there's just nothing that can be done about it.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.600]   This couple were lucky to be able to have their data recovered in that way, but you're at
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.080]   that point where you're making that decision on your own.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:55.040]   And I think the couple did exactly what they should do, which is the first thing they did
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.080]   was they went through the official channels trying to figure out if there was a way to
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:03.640]   recover lost data and that being something like whether or not it was an iCloud or whether
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.720]   or not they could plug their phone in and suddenly it would appear on their computer
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.240]   or something like that.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.600]   Those are sort of the official ways to try to find that lost data.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:18.120]   And when they were told that that wasn't a viable option, they as owners of their devices
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:25.560]   made the choice to choose another option, which was to go to a data recovery service.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.600]   That's their option and their choice with their own personal device.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:33.960]   They did what is okay in this sort of idea of right to repair, which is I have the right
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:39.960]   to take my phone to somebody who will manually pull this data out by using the technology
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.560]   and the means that they did to do so.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.520]   That I think is totally right.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.360]   I don't think that Apple was in the wrong by telling them that they didn't have that
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:54.600]   option because that just puts Apple in a position of being liable or possibly responsible for
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.520]   the loss or stolen data from having another company do it.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.560]   They can't control what third party repair companies do.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:06.520]   So why would they tell them go to a third party repair company when this company may
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.200]   or may not?
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.400]   My only moral quandary on this is that in the old days, because I used to work in IT
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.160]   and I used to put together and take apart computers, and we had to do a lot of data recovery
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.400]   because platter hard drives were terrible.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.840]   And I never even considered going to the vendor.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:25.360]   I heard about Spinrite from the Twit Network and also there was a chance, like I lost a
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.760]   bunch of videos once and I had to go to a data recovery service to get them, but they
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.200]   were all on external drives.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.640]   And I never even thought about the privacy issues because it was literally only thing
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.720]   on this drive is videos.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.960]   I need these videos.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.640]   Here's your thousand bucks or whatever.
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.400]   Get me these videos.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:45.760]   But with Apple and the iPhone, there's potential for private information like private messages,
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:53.840]   lawyer, client privilege, HIPAA, controlled data, contact information, personal photographs.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.680]   But also Apple doesn't put an old platter drive in there that you can get at with a
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.680]   screwdriver.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.880]   They've said we're going to make this a managed appliance for you.
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:07.080]   And then I think that along with that, they should take the responsibility for all the
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.080]   maintenance for it.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.560]   And I don't know if that should go down to data recovery services offered at the Apple
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.840]   Store depots, but I think that would be a valuable service to provide.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.480]   Yeah, I do think that Apple has to be honest.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:25.760]   If someone asks a direct question, they need to be given a direct answer.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.760]   And in this case, if someone asks, well, is there someone outside of the Apple Store
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:36.200]   that can do this, they have to at least say that Apple doesn't authorize anybody outside
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.280]   of Apple to manipulate your phone that way.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.160]   They probably do in a more folksy genius partie sort of way.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:47.360]   But they don't have to endorse a certain recovery service without saying that it is,
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:51.040]   there are people out there who will claim to be able to do that.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.040]   We can't evaluate those.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:56.680]   It's not our job, but by all means do it if you'd like to.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:02.520]   And it's also important to know that there are people that are going to go there.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:08.520]   And throughout those people that are going to have the pictures that have been lost or
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.920]   the data that's been lost is so important.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.920]   Like, you never know when you're going to lose somebody and you never know when the picture
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.960]   you take of somebody is going to be the last picture you ever get of somebody.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:24.400]   And also when you factor that in plus the super heroic ability of a company like Drive
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.160]   Savers to recover any data from anything.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:33.920]   This is a true story, the lagoon in the Boston's public garden where you have the Swanboats
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.480]   like it's paddling around.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.560]   The city drains it once a year for about a week, usually just before the Boston Marathon
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:44.160]   so that they can clean up all the trash that got dropped off those Swanboats, grade it,
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.520]   level it, do whatever maintenance they need to do to the water systems.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.040]   And so it's really, really cool because if you happen to encounter it at this time, you
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:56.520]   can actually walk through the lagoon and see and watch the public garden from angles you
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.720]   don't get to watch.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.440]   And so I tend to be this lucky almost every year.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:06.680]   And one year I actually found that somebody had dropped their camera off of the off of
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.800]   one of the Swanboats.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:13.680]   It was just embedded in this mud that was based on not only just mud, but this is salt
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.680]   marsh mud.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.080]   So it's just absolutely horrible.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.680]   And this and pulled it out.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.360]   Try to recover the data off of the SD card.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.360]   I couldn't.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.960]   I sent it to drive savers who agreed for free to do this because it wasn't my data.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.960]   So it wasn't a conflict of interest for anything.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.880]   And they sent me the full report where again, this thing, I have pictures of it.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:40.160]   The thing was absolutely buried in mud and it turns out by the date of the last photo
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:45.040]   on that card, it had been there for not just one season, but two seasons.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:50.160]   But it showed me that the problem was even that the contacts inside the memory card had
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.560]   been corroded by the salt marsh mud.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:59.240]   And so they had to actually do microsurgery to reconnect to connect the memory chip to
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:04.760]   a brand new USB controller and were able to pull all the photos off of that card.
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:09.080]   And I tried really hard to find the people who that belonged to to give them the shock
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.320]   of their life, but I just couldn't find them.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:17.160]   But it goes to the thing is if the last picture I ever took of myself with my parents before
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:22.520]   a tragedy happened was on my phone and Apple told me that no, there's no way to do this.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:26.120]   And then I found out later and so I said, oh, well, I guess you can't be done.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.880]   And then I flashed the phone because I needed to do an update.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.840]   And then I found out that, well, no, there are some cowboys and cowgirls out there who
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.560]   have techniques that are against Apple's policy, but I can do it.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.920]   I would feel very, very minus.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.400]   >> I love that.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:49.600]   >> That's a good point, which is that Apple letting people know about the fact that they
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.600]   exist.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:57.200]   The way you put it, Andy, I think that seems like a legitimate way to allow people to get
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:02.080]   what they need, but kind of leave Apple off the hook for if something goes wrong.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:09.200]   And Renee, to your point, I think Apple having a built-in or an in-house data recovery service
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.440]   would be absolutely spectacular.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.840]   I'm not sure if the reason they don't do it is that it's cost prohibitive.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:21.200]   They don't have the -- you would probably have to hire some pretty well-trained technicians
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.200]   to do this.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.880]   And then when they're not actually doing data recovery, then what are they doing?
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.960]   So maybe they don't have that kind of infrastructure just because it's cost prohibitive to have
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.280]   that going on, but absolutely.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:36.080]   An in-house data recovery service would be absolutely spectacular.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:42.920]   And for a lot of people, it would be a lifesaver because when we have our phones and we lose
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:47.400]   data, we lose our pictures or we lose videos, Apple's the first person we go to because
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.760]   that's where we got our phone.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.840]   Or if we got it from AT&T, we might go back to AT&T.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.840]   It makes sense to go back to that manufacturer when it comes to the phones.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:58.680]   Like I know, Renee, you were saying you wouldn't have gone back to the original manufacturer,
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:04.280]   but when it comes to our phones and today the way we deal with technology, I think we
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.280]   would go back to those sources.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:11.800]   And for Apple to say, "Oh, yeah, just leave us your phone for three days and our in-house
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.520]   data recovery service will take care of it and hand it back to you, done."
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.720]   I think that would be great.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.320]   It included with AppleCare or something like that, I think.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.760]   >> And have like a privacy policy where even they don't look at it.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.760]   They recover it.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.360]   It's like in some blind environment, they don't look at it.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.360]   They send you a USB drive that has both C&A attachments because we're still living in
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.360]   a blended world.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.360]   Thank you very much.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.160]   And then you just get it.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.960]   >> I think- >> Train dolphins to do it.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:34.960]   There you go.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:39.600]   >> I think if that were possible to recover data without looking at it, yeah, that would
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.600]   be great.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:45.000]   >> Yeah, there is that point where you as the consumer are the one who's making that decision
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.160]   of should I be allowing my privacy to be potentially invaded in order to recover my photos.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:56.080]   I think that's a legitimate option that we should be allowed to have.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:03.120]   Even if there's no way to be completely secretive about that data, I think me on my phone, if
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.600]   I lost all my photos on my phone, I would make the decision to allow somebody to look
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.560]   at all of the content on my phone, including my messages, including my emails and all my
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.560]   contacts.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:16.720]   I'd be willing to allow that to happen if I felt that I could trust the person who is
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.720]   doing it.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:22.160]   So if it was directly through Apple, if I felt like I could trust that they wouldn't steal
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.680]   that information, I would allow them to look at that information in order to give it to
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:26.920]   me.
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:31.160]   And then somebody else who had something much more private, really important data, the
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:35.120]   secure data that they really don't want anyone looking at.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:41.600]   They're making that choice there of, well, I don't want anyone looking at these text
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.440]   messages with the president or whatever.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.760]   So I can't have this data recovered.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:51.360]   >> Yeah, no, I think those are all really, really, all the millennials now are going
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.000]   to send those phones in and just all those pictures are going to be everywhere.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.160]   I just, I know what's going to happen.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.360]   >> They overshare anyway.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.360]   They'll be grateful.
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:03.280]   >> All right, so switching gears slightly, this was interesting to me.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:09.360]   Apple has hired the AI and deep learning expert, Ian Goodfellow.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.360]   So Apple's been on a tear lately.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.960]   I mean, they got John G and Andrea from Google who was heading a lot of their search and
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.240]   AI efforts.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:22.800]   And now he, this is another one, Ian's another one of these top Google AI people, machine
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.240]   learning people.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:28.480]   And for a long time, we've sort of, they've sort of been like these two edges of the Apple
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.480]   story.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:34.800]   One is that Siri has just not been able to keep up with and with Google Assistant.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.080]   But at the same time, Apple is savvy enough to three years ago start building neural engines
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.080]   into the silicon.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.660]   And I don't know if that's a result of different teams with different priorities or different
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:46.000]   understandings of where the market is going.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.720]   But it seems like since Jim and Andrea was brought on board, especially since he was
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:54.960]   made a senior vice president, which is the same as like Craig Federicki and Phil Schiller
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:59.120]   and all the other senior vice presidents.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:04.200]   They're sort of tweeting AI the way they treat Johnny Saruji's platform architecture group,
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.440]   his silicon group.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.160]   And that is it's table stakes.
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.160]   It's so specific.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.880]   We're going to make it its own org.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:13.720]   And wow, are we going to recruit some recruit some industry legends into it.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:18.520]   And this sort of like Andy, I'm going to wait until Siri is better than Alexa and Google
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:22.560]   Assistant before I say this is a this is a battle that Apple is winning.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:26.560]   But I like how they're starting to position the pieces on the board.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:32.480]   Yeah, they're definitely making people people people often talk about, Oh, geez, why don't
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.800]   they just buy Netflix Brown?
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.240]   They just buy Disney and it's fun to talk about.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:41.840]   But those aren't you're sort of like buying something that it's you're buying a car that's
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.160]   going to depreciate in value.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.760]   Meaning it's good for a good thing to have right now.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:48.880]   But what's going to do for you five or 10 years from now, they're spending their money
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:54.040]   really wisely by buying startups and buying smaller companies that can provide Apple with
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:58.640]   technologies that will feed into pretty much everything that they build and every piece
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.480]   of software and service that they write.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:07.320]   And they're also working really, really hard to say that, well, you we don't have there
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:11.840]   are people outside of Apple that have certain skills that we don't have and that we covet
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.280]   what we do have is a big checkbook.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:18.520]   And so let us hire away these people who've proven to be not just really good at this,
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:22.280]   but foundational thinkers on this sort of thing.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.240]   Remember, was it just 10 years?
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:30.640]   Okay, just 10 years ago that it was Apple and other companies got sued because there
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:35.840]   was an informal no poaching employees from Google and Apple and Facebook.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.840]   And this is exactly the sort of thing that an open market can provide an artificial intelligence
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.160]   machine learning.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:48.160]   It's as years go by, we can't possibly overstate how important it is to have that club in your
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:53.120]   bag because it is a technology that feeds everything.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:58.720]   Google kind of raised some eyebrows a few years ago at Google I/O, their developer conference,
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:03.120]   when they decided to say, no, no, no, we're not an advertising company, even though they're
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.840]   totally an advertising company.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.640]   We're not a search company.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.880]   We are an artificial intelligence company.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:13.640]   But after a couple of weeks, when you think that over, it's no the fact that they invested
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.440]   so heavily in artificial intelligence, it makes the search product better.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.200]   It makes the advertising product better.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.960]   It makes the mail product better.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:24.920]   Now it's even making the phone product better because it's making the camera better.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:29.040]   So it's not as though Apple has just realized last week that they need to hire some of these
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:35.320]   people, but the fact that they're willing to go after the absolute big guns of this
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:40.640]   industry really says a lot about how well they think about making sure that they will
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.960]   have a future and they can continue to be competitive.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:47.320]   So it's interesting to me, Laurie, is that he's director of machine learning.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:52.160]   So just to back up a step, he's the, they call him the grandfather, ha ha, because he
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:57.800]   began the general adversarial network approach to AI, which I loved from the original FaceTime
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:01.360]   demonstration where they, because basically humans can't program AI.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.120]   We lost that conceit a long time ago.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.120]   You create a little robot.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.920]   If it does better than the past robot, it gets to live.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.720]   If it does, and it gets junk to make the new robot.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:15.480]   And in FaceTime, they have a joker, that's my term, not theirs, a joker AI that just continually
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:20.640]   attacks FaceTime and a Batman AI that continually defends it and they learn from each other and
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.720]   get better and better.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.560]   And we have no idea what they're doing anymore.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.800]   We just trust that they're not going to pop out of the FaceTime sensor and take over the
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.320]   world, at least for now.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.840]   But he's been put in charge of the special projects group, which is an organization within
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:39.160]   the machine learning and AI for the special projects group, which is the part of the company
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:45.760]   that's working on things like AR glasses and like the computer vision and ingestion systems
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.720]   for a potential apple car.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:53.120]   And I think as much as it's important now, I really need an apple car to be smarter than
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:57.560]   people putting stickers on the road and leading me to the ice cream store when I want to.
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:03.240]   >> Yeah, they're definitely working toward positioning the right level, the right structure
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:08.560]   of a team that's going to make sure that what they do in the future is going to be sublime,
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:12.560]   not just with a car, not just with Siri, but with everything that they're doing with
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:16.000]   artificial intelligence and possibly virtual reality.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:23.960]   This all kind of goes together to make a future that's really going to be great for apple.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:28.960]   So starting now, it would have been great if they would have started five years ago.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:33.840]   So that they'd be on par with Google now, but there's a lot of conversations about how
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:39.280]   Google's assistant is better than Apple's digital assistant.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:44.400]   And the arguments have been made that Google stores more of your data, therefore it's
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.560]   assistant is able to provide you with better information.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:51.720]   And Apple doesn't, so it's assistant is basically like getting its memory wiped every single
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.480]   day when it's talking to you.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:47:02.960]   >> So, but that doesn't mean that you can't make Siri as good as you can make the Google's
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:03.960]   assistant.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.960]   You just have to do more work to figure out how to do that.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:13.560]   And I think building a team whose sole purpose is to perfect this AI, perfect all AI that
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:18.440]   Apple works with, including like how to make your photos look better when you hit just
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:22.960]   the one edit button that suddenly makes your landscapes look better, all of that it could
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:28.400]   help increase and make better all of the little things that go on inside your phone, not just
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.160]   the digital assistant, but everything inside.
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.160]   So I think this is real good.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:37.560]   And I think we're going to see a lot of improvements probably under the hood improvements in iOS
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:42.240]   in the very near future, because I think having a team like this coming up with those little
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:47.080]   minor fixes in the back end are going to really improve things for the way we use our phone.
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.600]   Little subtle things about how long it takes after we touch an app that it opens or something
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.600]   like that.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:57.760]   All of this kind of stuff is all kind of intertwined and can really help the features of the phone.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.280]   So yeah, it's good.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.280]   It's a big deal.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.480]   Yeah, it'll make me better at not making bad decisions with my phone.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:06.640]   That's the golden standard for me.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:11.880]   There was also, I don't want to call this news because every time Apple publishes a patent,
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:17.480]   Patonly Apple writes about the patent and then with an interesting headline of course,
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:21.440]   but then every other blog covers it as though Apple is actually doing it.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.000]   And I feel like that gets a lot of people's hopes up.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.680]   But in this case specifically, this is a patent for something that would bring back the MagSafe,
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:32.680]   the magnetic part of the connector that we used to all know and love because you would
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:37.480]   just connect it to your MacBook, some kit or pet or someone really late for their latte
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:41.200]   would run by and hit the cable and instead of throwing your laptop on the ground, the
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.760]   cable would just disconnect.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:47.960]   And while USB-C has given us ubiquity, USB power is almost everything except for iOS.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:52.920]   Both iOS devices these days, it is stuck into the device.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:54.680]   Should I get my hopes up, Laurie?
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:49:00.120]   Should I secretly think that Apple is going to soon announce a new MagSafe or should I
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.760]   just look at this and weep at what's not going to be?
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.360]   I'm going to say not anytime soon.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.120]   Do you remember when Apple had a patent for the slap bracelet?
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.120]   That was a thing.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.880]   And for folding phones.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.320]   Folding phones years and years ago.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:21.600]   I'm thinking with this particular patent, obviously Apple made the MagSafe.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.600]   It exists.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:29.440]   It's a thing that's been used in laptop computers and some people still have their older Mac
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.800]   laptop computer that uses the MagSafe and we love them.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:38.720]   There's no reason why Apple couldn't incorporate something like that in the future, but I think
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.080]   not in the near future.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:45.080]   I think there's probably, if I were to guess at what's going on with why Apple is bringing
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.080]   this back up to light.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:50.520]   Although I think the patent is actually from a while ago, I did it say, I think 2017, if
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.600]   I remember reading about that.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.440]   Yeah, it was originally a five-
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:55.440]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.520]   Two thousand, two thousand, seventeen.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:04.400]   So what could potentially happen in the future being a couple of years from now, something
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:11.040]   along the lines of a MacBook that has three USB port USB-C ports and one MagSafe charging
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.040]   port.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.040]   I think that's great.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:19.280]   This patent is also working on a way that can allow for pass-through for USB-C data transfer
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:23.480]   and be a MagSafe at the same time.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:29.280]   These are great things that Apple is constantly researching and developing things that may
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.040]   never happen in the future.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:35.400]   This one I think potentially could happen in the future just because it comes from something
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.320]   that already exists.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:41.200]   But we definitely don't want to make any assumptions that the next MacBook lines are
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:45.080]   going to have MagSafe on them because I don't think that's what's happening.
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:46.080]   What about-
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:47.080]   Yeah, I think-
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.080]   That's right.
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.080]   Go ahead.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.080]   I was just going to say, what about USB-M?
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:53.280]   Could we just get Apple to sit down with the USB consortium and make a magnetic charging
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:56.200]   standard for everybody?
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:02.280]   If Apple didn't want to keep the proprietary technology for it, which they're kind of
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.720]   known for, is keeping things proprietary.
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:10.760]   I hope they do continue MagSafe because there's so many people that they-
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.080]   MagSafe is like insurance.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:18.760]   You hate to pay the premiums, but the first time that your butt is saved by having insurance,
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.800]   you suddenly become a lifelong fan.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:26.680]   And I have never had my MacBook saved by MagSafe, not yet.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:31.200]   What's happened is that I have been sitting on my sofa and I just-
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:35.720]   And I cross my legs and the MagSafe connector pops out and I have to take it off the floor
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:36.960]   and pop it back in again.
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.880]   But these are things that they can fix and they can improve.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:46.160]   I really hope they mature MagSafe to an extent where even crusty people like me who are annoyed
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.560]   by it become super, super fans.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.000]   Because it's definitely a thing that helps out people.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.400]   And as we have discussed before in this show, because MacBooks are not really easy or cheap
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:52:02.160]   to repair, anything that prevents disaster, everything that prevents me from having to
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:08.840]   replace a slightly damaged component with a brand new $1,100 subassembly is definitely
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.840]   Apple on the right track.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:16.880]   Because we're plugging more and more things in and the devices are getting smaller and
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.320]   smaller and their ability to skip down a floor like we can skip across a lake is not
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:22.360]   going away anytime soon.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:25.080]   So hopefully this is a- I just want it as a standard.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:30.160]   I know they're proprietary, but power should be a standard.
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.440]   Just be a standard.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.760]   Many of us agree with that.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:42.440]   So Andy, with the way you would accidentally pull out your MagSafe, I'm sort of the opposite
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:47.280]   on that in that I like to sit cross-legged on my couch with my MacBook Pro in my lab
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.920]   with the USB-C cable plugged into it.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:53.880]   And I will accidentally yank it out the same way you're talking about pulling out your
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:54.880]   MagSafe.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:58.400]   And one of my four ports is now a little bit loose.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:04.640]   And I think it's because I've probably three dozen times accidentally sideways yanked it
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:10.360]   out because I'm like shifting with my sitting cross-legged on my couch.
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.600]   And that one, the one that I used to plug it into all the time, it's now a little bit
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:14.600]   loose.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:19.600]   So for me, the idea of a MagSafe, let it come off all the time if it means that I didn't
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.520]   accidentally break a port because I've ripped it out too many times.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.840]   Yeah, no, I'm absolutely with you.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:31.320]   I actually have a serving platter that, I guess to my home, think that, "Oh, isn't it elegant?"
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.480]   I bet he has teed.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:37.800]   He has a serving platter on the coffee table because he's so elegant.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:42.400]   It's no, it's because every time that I'm sitting cross-legged on the sofa, and if I
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:48.880]   have a USB key or something in a USB port, it's always at a point.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:53.800]   It's out of the device is plugged into a place where it's definitely going to get bent by
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.000]   the side of my foot or the side of my leg.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.600]   So yeah, this is not a solved problem as yet.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:05.000]   It's weird how we always, we never appreciate little design features that we didn't know
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.880]   were to design features until they were removed.
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:11.400]   If we went back to the 1990s where all the ports were in the back, we wouldn't have this
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:12.400]   problem at all.
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:19.440]   No, but then there'd be the new problem of how you can't set your computer flush against
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:24.640]   a wall, there's always going to be some complaint to be had.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:28.800]   So keeping along with the imaginary but possible products, we have Ming Chi Quo.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.960]   I prefer to call him Guo Ming Chi, but people yell at me either way.
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.120]   So I'll just say both.
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:36.680]   In that way, just like if, just, and gift, I'll get in trouble from everybody.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:41.640]   He came out with a new report, and this one focuses specifically on mini LED, which isn't
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:46.240]   micro LED, which is a separate display technology because why make things super clear and super
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:52.360]   easy to differentiate, but mini LED is a much closer, I think, more realistic technology
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.560]   for larger scale deployments.
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:58.840]   And first of all, he reaffirms that this is what's going to be used in the pro display
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:02.440]   that we've been hearing about for the last two years, that's supposed to come along with
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:09.040]   the new Mac Pro, and it'd be 31.6 inches, 6K resolution, which is just nutty.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:13.440]   It would be one by two by one aspect ratio, beautiful.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:19.520]   He also says that it'll find its way probably by late 2020 or early 2021, which is quite
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:22.920]   a ways from now, and you never know exactly what's going to happen then, but could find
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:27.400]   its way into iPads and into MacBook Pros as well.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:32.960]   And a couple of reasons why that's exciting is one, Apple hasn't gone for OLED in iPads,
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.400]   let alone MacBooks yet.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:39.240]   Other companies have done them in smaller quantities, but Apple seems to feel like OLED
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.240]   because it does have burn in issues.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:45.760]   OLED, again, is a fantastic technology that requires an enormous amount of mitigations
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:49.720]   to make it useful, and we've seen what battle it is like, and nobody wants that.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:55.000]   But it also has an issue with uniformity and equalization of brightness over large surfaces
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.320]   and just a plethora of other concerns.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:03.480]   But mini LED offers many of the same attributes, like wide color gamut, low levels of black,
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:08.120]   high levels of brightness, and it could find its way into what we're waiting for in these
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.360]   next generation iPads.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:13.800]   Some people thought this meant that the next generation MacBook Pro, the 16 inch version,
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:18.680]   would be delayed until then, but my reading, and I think 9 to 5 Macs reading too, is that
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:21.680]   this is for future generations of those.
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:24.920]   Is it too early to get excited about this kind of stuff, Lori?
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:29.800]   Or do you want us to know what toys you can buy on Christmas three years from now?
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:34.360]   >> I think what's exciting about it is just knowing that the technology is in the works
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.880]   that it's kind of in line to be out there someday.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:42.120]   I think for some people it's probably going to be a reason to hold off on buying something.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:47.480]   Maybe they want a new monitor and if they know that in 2020 or 2021 they might have
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:53.720]   a 31 inch monitor using mini LED, which is the next advancement in display technology.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.720]   They might decide I can wait two more years.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:56.920]   >> Well, that one's coming soon.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.040]   That one's for 2019.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:01.000]   It's the iPads and MacBooks that are 2020, 2021.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:01.960]   >> Even better.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:05.400]   >> So we can get the 31 inch display at the end of this year,
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:10.360]   decide how much we love it because it's so much more advanced than OLED and it doesn't
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.000]   have burn in.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:17.240]   So we're on board and then we say, well, two years from now this might be put in the iPad.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:23.640]   Let's wait around and to buy our iPad for two years because I would rather have mini LED instead
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.280]   of OLED.
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:32.280]   So I think just as people who follow Apple technology like we do, we like to hear about
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:37.240]   things that may or may not happen two or three years from now just because we're excited about
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:41.000]   the advancement in technology and we're really interested to find out what's to come.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:46.280]   I think these are great things because there are people working their butts off day in and day
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:51.000]   out to create these technologies and we should be the ones treating them like celebrities for
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.640]   bringing this out to consumers in the future.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:59.800]   So if we can talk about it now and get people excited about it now, then the makers of these
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:02.760]   behind the scenes things are secretly celebrities for us.
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:11.080]   Yeah, this is exactly why we pay extra for Apple hardware for all the other reasons,
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:17.720]   but also because if there's a display technology that's not so well established yet that you can
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:23.160]   get the price of these panels down for volume, but they provide a really noticeable effect.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:28.360]   Apple is the company that's going to own this technology for the first year by buying up all
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:36.600]   the production. And the thing is OLED is great for everything except for strict color accuracy.
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:43.720]   If you're reading mail, if you are surfing the web, if you're taking a look at that really cool
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:49.000]   picture of the sunset that you just took and you're like, my god, that's the best picture I ever took.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:55.240]   Or if you're watching Blade Runner 2049 where there's this wonderful cinematography with the
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:59:04.120]   swirling blacks and whites, OLED will always be more attractive than LCD for the same reason that
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:09.640]   a burger with fat, insult and carbs and it is always going to taste better than a low fat,
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:15.240]   low fat, no carb, no salt burger. But there's Apple is going to have to make sure that they can
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:19.960]   still deliver all the things that they promise that it's going to, you're not going to deal with
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:25.800]   burn in. Like Renee says, you're not going to have to deal with bad power. It's not you're going to
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:31.720]   still be able to read your watch and daylight or use your iPad and daylight. I really hope that
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:36.520]   Apple pursues is because one of the things that Apple does for the entire industry is kind of
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:42.360]   demonstrate to everybody why this new manufacturing technology or why this new style of component
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:47.480]   is so good and they'll put the money into it so that after a year or two, it'll become viable for
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:54.840]   other people as well. Yeah, I like that so much, Andy. It's why we got the IPS displays in the
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:59.400]   iMacs and then a year later, they were everywhere because no one could afford to buy 100,000 of them,
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.080]   but once Apple ordered 100,000 of them, suddenly everybody was making the machines that made them.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:10.040]   All right, we're going to take another quick break because I think Leo found a trace of 5G
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:16.120]   in his office and has instantly teleported himself back through time and space to tell us about
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:21.000]   something else that's wonderful. We'll be back with more Mac break weekly in just a bit, but LastPass
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.760]   knows that I am a big LastPass fan, so they said, "Okay, Leo, we'll let you do the ad."
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:32.120]   Let me thank you because honestly, I even if don't tell them this, even if they didn't pay us,
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:38.360]   I'd be selling LastPass every day because it is nowadays perhaps the single most important security
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:46.200]   thing you can do. For your friends, for your family, for your business, LastPass is the password
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:52.760]   manager. It's number one, most preferred password manager. It's completely secure end-to-end encryption.
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:58.840]   Your LastPass vault is decrypted only at the device level. That means LastPass has no access to it.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:07.240]   Nobody but you does. It runs everywhere you are. Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux even,
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:13.960]   every browser. When I got a new iPhone, the first thing I do is I put LastPass on it. By the way,
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:22.840]   with Android because on iOS 12 and later, and Android, I think, Pyre later, maybe Nougat or later,
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:29.000]   it'll automatically fill in the passwords. I install an app, open it up. LastPass pops up,
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.520]   says, "You want me to log in for you?" You say, "Yes." It's the first thing you do when you're
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:37.560]   setting up a new phone, you put LastPass on it. Same thing with a computer. I'm getting a new
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:42.200]   computer day before I leave for Hawaii. I don't have a lot of time, but LastPass is going to go on
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:50.040]   their very first thing. LastPass is the best way to keep hackers out, to keep an extra layer of
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:56.040]   security. If you're in business, you've got to use LastPass because employees are not notorious
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:01.080]   for security, right? They share passwords. They share it with people outside the business.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:06.680]   They put it on Post-it notes on their computer screen. Of course, I understand why no one can
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:12.360]   remember a good password. Then what they do, they make a bad password. LastPass Enterprise,
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:18.040]   which is what we use here, prevents all of that. Over 100 admin policies you can enforce,
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:23.800]   we enforce, for instance, minimum requirements for your LastPass password, your master password,
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:30.680]   so they don't use Monkey123. We enforce two-factor as well. LastPass has every form of
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:36.120]   two-factor authentication. Personally, I use the Yuba key, but they also support Duo security.
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:42.440]   I've used that. LastPass has its own authenticator, which I like because it's not a six-digit number.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:47.560]   It's approved and I, but it'll work with Google Authenticator, Authy, whatever. But turn on two-factor.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:53.000]   That's another big thing we do require in our business. You get actionable security reports.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.320]   You get password resets because employees forget their passwords all the time. You can
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.000]   automate user management. Here's a really nice tool for business. Actually, we use this at home
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.920]   in LastPass families too, shared folders. If I know there's a password Lisa's going to need,
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:13.640]   or our accounting department needs, or whatever, I just move that account. I move QuickBooks over
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:19.080]   to the ops or over to the, actually, in this case, accounting or business. Everybody gets it automatically
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:23.080]   through the folder. That's great. Great way to share passwords. You can even make it so that
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:26.840]   they don't get the password. They just get to log in and automatically fill in the password.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.280]   They don't see it, which is really good because then they can't share it.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:37.400]   And of course, you can revoke access very easily. LastPass is amazing. It is that
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:45.400]   that key you need in your business to protect your most vital assets. And at home, there's
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:51.320]   LastPass individuals, or actually it's LastPass premium for individuals. As I said, we use LastPass
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:57.320]   families at home, which, by the way, I trust LastPass so much. I don't just put passwords in it. I have
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:03.400]   my driver's license, all of our social security numbers, passports, all of our passwords. When we
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:07.880]   travel, I make sure I've got a latest image of a passport in LastPass because that means it's on
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:14.120]   all my devices. If a passport goes lost, I have a copy of it. Right here, I can go on and on.
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:17.240]   That's how much I trust it. I put my social security numbers in there. And not only that,
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:24.120]   I tell you I do that. That's how secure LastPass is. And it's easy to get family members involved,
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:28.760]   you invite them by email, get it for your business, get it for your home. There's LastPass for teams,
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.600]   which is for 50 or fewer people. There's LastPass Enterprise, which is what we leave. I think we
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.720]   don't need to. I guess we could use teams, but I like Enterprise. And we've been using it for
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:41.640]   years. I think that's because Russell set it up. And that's what he says we need to use.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:46.600]   13 and a half million people have signed up for LastPass and are loving it and trusting it,
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:51.880]   you should too go to LastPass.com/twit. Find the account that's right for you. Get one for your
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:59.560]   business. It's a must. LastPass.com/twit. With that, LastPass for their support. I thank them
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:06.600]   personally for the last decade of password management for me. And I thank you for using LastPass.com/twit.
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:12.440]   So, showing your support for Macbreak Weekly. LastPass.com/twit. Thank you. If you haven't signed up for
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:18.520]   it, go there and sign up. That way we get credit. LastPass.com/twit. Back to the show.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:24.600]   Thank you so much, Leo. All right. So, there's drama. There is drama in the Apple world. I know
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:30.280]   you're shocked. You're probably a little bit concerned. This drama though is 5G modem drama.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:38.520]   We already know that Apple is embroiled in a patent legal. All sorts of things fight with
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.680]   Qualcomm. Qualcomm says they owe the money. Apple says we don't. Qualcomm says we owe this technology.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:47.400]   Apple says they don't. But the point is that Qualcomm does not seem eager to supply Apple
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:53.240]   with 5G chipsets. And that's okay because Apple's been BFFs with Intel ever since Intel bought
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:58.920]   Infineon, the original maker of iPhone Modems, and has tried to crawl their way out of the very slow
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:08.360]   base CPU roadmap into a thriving modem business. But there was rumors that Intel may not be ready
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:13.720]   to have those modems available to Apple in time for never mind this year's launch,
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:18.120]   but next year's launch. Maybe the year after that's launched. I don't know how far out we can go with
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:23.480]   it, but just they might not be ready. Now, there's a couple things to parse here. One,
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:29.240]   Apple wasn't exactly early to 3G. The first iPhone didn't have it. They weren't early to LTE. I think
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:34.120]   it was like a year, year and a half between the HTC Thunderbolt, which was the first Verizon
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:41.800]   LTE phone and the iPhone 5, which was Apple's first Verizon LTE phone. But then also we had Intel
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:45.080]   come pushing back saying, no, we are on, they wouldn't mention Apple, but they're like,
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:49.320]   nope, we are on schedule. We're going to deliver our modems to our many, many, many customers,
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:55.400]   not saying Apple, many customers on time and on schedule. And then we also had Huawei seemingly
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:07:01.640]   out of nowhere, maybe out of nowhere, who knows saying, hey, we've never shared our 5G modem
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:06.840]   technology with anybody, but we'd maybe consider sharing it with Apple. Who are you going to ban
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:12.840]   in the US now, a government? And the whole thing is sort of it bubbled up with a lot of real angry,
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:19.960]   real happy, real concerned, real feisty hot takes. And Andy, is this just part of the fun of launching
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:26.200]   a new wireless standard in the world these days? Well, if I'm not, since I'm not invested in Intel
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:35.480]   or Apple, it's fun to watch because I mean, this is, this goes so much worse than Apple versus
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:40.840]   Samsung, because they've recovered from that. And it really was the animosity was pretty much
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:49.240]   Steve Jobs versus Samsung. He took it personally with a Samsung, let's say finding inspiration and
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:56.280]   homage in the iPhone, it's early Samsung Galaxy phones. With this one, every time you get a new
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:01.400]   news report and every time you talk to somebody who is familiar with the situation, you get too
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:10.280]   tough, angry, middle aged people sitting down at a conference table by a third party who's
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:15.480]   saying, let's solve this problem. And it ends 12 minutes later with both of them saying, I'll see
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:20.600]   you in hell before we solve this problem. I seriously think that Apple is willing to cut off
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:30.600]   its own nose if it would not give an advantage or a pleasant situation for Qualcomm. And this
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:39.160]   is a problem because Qualcomm, for all of its creative licensing ideas, they are really the
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:45.640]   superstars when it comes to phone modems. They will give you one chip that solves all your problems
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:50.520]   worldwide. You will not have a problem with connectivity as related to your modem chip.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:56.280]   And if Apple doesn't want to do business with them or vice versa, they have to go with definitely
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:00.120]   the B team, which is definitely Intel. They don't have the experience. They don't have the
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:05.240]   manufacturing capacity. And frankly, they don't, they have a certain amount of pride in and of
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:13.000]   themselves. Where word from inside Intel is that my God, Apple is a really high maintenance date.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.520]   They will, they, we are spending so much of our time trying to keep this one client happy.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:23.640]   Whereas we have other clients in other parts of our business, where we are more interactive with,
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:29.240]   we are more, we have the capability of designing a hardware reference platform and then finding
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:34.200]   manufacturers who want to actually work with us to develop this platform. Why are we always
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:39.880]   flying to Cupertino to get slapped around by Apple? But the good, the really good news is that 5G
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:47.000]   is not going to be like rolling out LTE or fourth or third generation cell phone networks.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   This is such a transformation on what's gone before that none of the old rule supplies,
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:01.400]   not as though they can, the carrier companies can do an update, a firmware update to their cell
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:06.040]   towers or just hang other antennas on the towers they've got. They really are going to have to
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:12.040]   deploy new hotspots everywhere. It is not even slightly realistic that they're going to be able
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:17.640]   to put 5G all the way across the country, let alone the world. And frankly, they're going to
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:24.760]   have trouble selling this to consumers. Because right now LTE is really good. It's mature, it's fast.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:32.120]   People who create these services have figured out how to pump out HD video on a phone through an
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:38.200]   LTE connection. So how are you going to sell a consumer on upgrading your hardware and possibly
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:45.000]   signing up for more expensive 5G plan for a new network that doesn't initially give them any new
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:52.360]   features and isn't even going to work in the majority of the country. So Apple can certainly
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:59.720]   sit back for a year or two before introducing a 5G phone. Because certainly for the first couple
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:05.960]   of years, all the news about Samsung's first to market 5G phone is going to be why is Samsung's
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:12.200]   5G first to market phone never getting a 5G signal. Even when I'm standing in the Verizon store
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:17.880]   directly next to what they are promising is a demo antenna. There was a really good article in
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:23.640]   CNET, I think it was where I think Verizon had sort of a one day demo where they brought some
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:29.880]   journalists and they gave them their current 5G hardware, which I think was a Moto phone,
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:35.000]   the kind that you can actually put accessory backs on it. So it has a 5G modem accessory back on it.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.680]   And that is, Chicago is one of the two cities where the Verizon says that they are qualified to
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:46.360]   say that we are the first to actually put real 5G in the United States. And just said, go for
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:52.200]   the go around Chicago for the day, use it for real. Of course, they've got PR people on speed dial.
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:56.600]   But the story, I think the headline was it actually brought me to tears trying to get this thing to
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:03.800]   work. And one of the stories is that, again, at this Verizon store, they set up a 5G antenna,
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:11.960]   like right there with the intention of directing press people with hardware that Verizon provided
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:17.640]   to them to see how well 5G works. And she said that even like standing like right next to this
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:22.760]   antenna, they were not getting 5G connections that were stable. So what I'm saying is that this is
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:26.760]   not an easy problem for Apple to solve, but they have a couple of years to solve it. I think
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:32.920]   of course, starts to get embarrassing. Yeah, I think the key here is going to be with marketing.
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:39.160]   So obviously every company that makes a phone that has 5G connection, connectivity, they're going
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:43.000]   to put out all these commercials and all these advertisements that say, we've got 5G, 5G, but
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.080]   Apple still doesn't. So Apple just needs to make sure that in their marketing campaign,
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:54.280]   they point out that 5G isn't really useful for the time being by the time it becomes ubiquitous
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:13:01.160]   across the world. Apple will probably have a 5G modem. So it's going to be, we're going to see a
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.880]   lot of people saying that their phones are better than Apple's phones, because specifically because
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:11.640]   of the 5G modem. And then that will all go away. It'll be a moot point.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:16.520]   Also, Apple is in the unusual position where not only do they, can they wait for a couple of years,
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:24.360]   if it were a question of like, do I buy a Huawei phone or do I buy a Samsung phone or do I buy
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:30.360]   a Google Pixel phone, that's competition. But Apple can simply, as part of their math, think that
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:35.800]   I don't think people are so excited about 5G that they'd be willing to drop iOS and all of their
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:40.920]   apps and all their services and everything, all of their accumulated logic, knowledge about iOS
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:47.240]   in order to get 5G in the first couple of years. So they're in a position that not all companies
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:53.240]   are in right now. >> And that's why it occurred to me when I did see all Apple's do, no 5G modem,
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:14:01.640]   things that, again, people bought, I never know how much modems mean to regular people as opposed
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:06.760]   to nerds, because there are, and I work with some of them, there are people who know exactly the
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:12.840]   bit rate of every different variation of LTE and every band. Sasha Segan is like that, Daniel Bader
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:17.800]   is like that. Brian Clueg, plus him, used to be like that. They would just know every Miriam
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:23.480]   Jaward. There's so many people who know everything about these, but no one else really had any clue
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:27.800]   about it. It was either like this webpage is taking too long to load or this webpage loaded fast
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:31.800]   enough that I didn't notice that I was on the internet. And those seem to be the two extremes.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:37.160]   And we didn't get 3G until the second iPhone, we didn't get LTE till a year or so later.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:42.040]   And we were fine. And I can't help thinking that 5G is hot and it's going to be buzzy and it's
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:48.120]   going to be great for a lot of things, including just broadband rollout. But we don't know what
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:52.920]   the killer 5G businesses are yet. And we're already upset we're not getting the technology to support
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:57.720]   them. So I think it's something that's absolutely of concern, but I don't think it's anything
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:03.640]   that's a crisis yet. Yeah, we can also look forward to Intenigate 2, a really great sequel because
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:10.840]   it's like trying to try not to say you're holding it wrong because the other problem is that the
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:15.640]   that the 5G modem is going to use is going to need its own antenna system that's not necessarily
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:20.520]   going to be optimal for LTE. That was another thing that came out of that really good CNET article
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:28.680]   about how the the Motorola phone with the with the C with the 5G sandwich had its own little bumps
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:33.480]   where they were putting the 5G antenna IR. And part of the problem was making sure that the 5G
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:39.720]   antenna was not interfering with the LTE antenna or vice versa. So it's again, it's just a huge
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:46.120]   problem. It's it's not the same as when Apple delayed getting 3G. Remember, they also delayed
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:52.680]   getting cut and pays for quite a while. Apple was willing to iPhone users were willing to
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:57.800]   forgive a lot to get something that it's a phone. It's an Internet device and it's an iPod.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:02.760]   The thing, yeah, I saw some of the early prototypes. Like I know there are a bunch of other companies
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:08.120]   have them now, but some of the early prototypes from Samsung and especially Samsung, they you
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:14.120]   have to have, I believe, RF transparent areas on four out of the six sides of a phone. If you just
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:19.640]   imagine it being a not a Tesseract, but a cube four out of those six sides have to have be
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:26.040]   transparent for 5G signals. And we complained about notches. These things had full on pirate patches
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:31.000]   on the sides of the phones like giant cookie monster took a bite out of it. Even the Galaxy
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.800]   Fold has that giant eye patch when you when you open it out. And it's like we want the technology
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.920]   because we think it's going to look like our phone, but it's just not there yet.
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:44.920]   Yeah. And if you're playing Mac, break bingo, he did say Tesseract that does count as an
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:48.520]   Avengers reference. So do blood out that square on your bingo card.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.920]   Yeah, I just need some Tesseract powers and I would be okay with this winter.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:17:01.560]   All right. So Apple music versus Spotify. We've already seen Spotify take Apple to the EU
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:09.080]   Accord. I believe they filed the paperwork this week. But Apple now has, according to reports,
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:15.720]   surpassed Spotify in terms of number of subscribers in the US. And they've also lowered prices in
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:21.000]   India, which is proving to be a really interesting, really competitive market. Laurie, where do you
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.360]   I sort of look at Apple music as a harbinger of how Apple's other subscription services
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:32.600]   will be handled, will be deployed, and will be frankly received. So what do you think about this? What
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:37.240]   do you think about Apple versus Spotify in general? And what do you think about Apple starting to,
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:44.120]   at least in the US, pick a bullet over Spotify? Well, I mean, there's a lot of things to unpack
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:48.600]   with those. Oh, I should add there's also Spotify versus artist drama, if you want to fold that in
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:54.760]   as well. Yeah. So first of all, I think that the fact that Spotify and Apple music exists is great.
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:59.800]   It's it's choices for consumers. And I think that's really important. I think both services are pretty
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:07.480]   pretty similar. There's minor differences in the user interface versus, and one company has a
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:14.040]   slightly different library than the other. But for most of us, it's pretty much the same. So
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:18.280]   you have you get the choice, you get the selection, you get to choose one over the other. In some cases,
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:25.960]   you have them both. So I think it's great that they both exist. So with that going forward,
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:33.480]   I think that Apple now becoming more popular in the US than Spotify puts them in a position
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:39.800]   where that idea of them becoming a monopoly is much more relevant and important. They used to be
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:45.960]   the underdog, if you will, in that scenario. And now that they're becoming the overdog, the big dog,
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:51.720]   then those monopoly issues are coming into play. And we've already heard from a couple of big
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:59.080]   government officials out there like Elizabeth Warren that that idea we want to break these
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:04.200]   companies up so they can't be like this. Here's an example of where Apple owns the hardware and
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:11.080]   the software for Apple music. And frankly, they do make it a lot easier for you to work within the
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.160]   Apple music system than they do to work within the Spotify system. So now that they're becoming
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:21.640]   a bigger, a bigger portion of the music listening community, does that mean that they're using
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:28.680]   their advantage to stop these other companies? Like in this case, even though it's not much of a
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:33.880]   difference and it's not worldwide, but Spotify is now the underdog in this situation. And their
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:38.920]   argument, the argument that Spotify made just a couple of weeks ago that Apple doesn't play fair,
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:42.440]   which by the way, I don't think that they're the way they positioned that was very,
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.440]   it wasn't done right. I think that there was a lot of sneaky ways that they were implying that
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:55.080]   Apple wasn't doing a playing fair. But it does call into question that exact thing is Apple
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:20:01.080]   playing fair. And if it is, great, that's great because we still have Spotify. And I think a lot
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:08.200]   of us still want to keep Spotify. But if Apple's, if the way that Apple does its business and the
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:14.360]   way that it protects its hardware and software ecosystem is negatively affecting companies like
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:19.080]   Spotify, then this is something I think that needs to be called into question as to what can make
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:26.200]   this better for competition and stop these larger corporations from kind of gaining monopolies like
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:33.320]   that. Yeah, it's hard to know. It's hard for me to figure out whether this, how good of a piece
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:37.880]   of news this is for Apple. It's certainly a proud day for everybody who works on that team that they
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:43.800]   are actually, at least in the United States having being able to beat Spotify for paid users,
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:48.760]   because that was their that was when they launched their whole their whole week spot of Spotify.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:53.960]   They're trying to say against is that it's easy to provide a service that people will use for free.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:57.000]   We're going to try to build a service that's so good that people are actually going to want to pay
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.560]   for it. And so make Apple music a lot more sustainable as a business than Spotify will.
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:08.760]   However, like Lori said, Apple does have some advantages that no other music company has,
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:16.200]   starting with as Spotify complained to the EU that they Apple does not have to pay itself any
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:23.960]   special money if people if people if people renew or sign up for the paid service through their own
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:30.600]   app or as Spotify has to give 30% for the first year than 30 15% for subsequent years, I think.
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:37.000]   That's a bet. That's hard to compete with. The fact that the Apple music app comes pre-installed
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:43.000]   on the iPhone and people have to seek out and get Spotify is also an advantage that Apple music app
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:52.280]   has. And it's I don't know how how big people are how much people are fans of a specific music
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:57.640]   service. I think that so long as there's a 95% chance that if they search for an album, they'll
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:03.080]   find that album. And so long as the radio stations or the auto playlists are fairly good, one is
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:10.360]   kind of as good as the other. And for the user comes down to, will I have to I kind of am interested
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:15.400]   in checking out Spotify, I'm kind of interested in checking out Google's music offering or kind of
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:19.560]   interested in Apple music. But oh yeah, I'd have to like rebuild my library and rebuild on my
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:24.360]   playlist who needs that kind of noise. So it's definitely something that Apple should be proud of,
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:31.000]   but I don't know how much this is due to the how much work they put in and how they created a
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.480]   unique product and how much it's due to just a simple fact that they have certain advantages.
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:42.680]   And music is not something that people are very, very attentive to regarding the finest points.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:47.960]   The other thought that came to mind as I was reading about this is that they are talking about
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:53.080]   paid subscribers in the United States worldwide. Spotify still has a huge margin. I think it's two
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:23:00.040]   to one in terms of how much money they're making. And to me, this points out not an Apple is doomed
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.720]   sort of thing. But when I look at the list of things that kind of worry me about Apple,
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:11.560]   it's often about how they can really, really kill it in certain markets, including North America.
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:17.320]   But when it comes to, okay, but there are companies that are selling well everywhere, including India,
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:22.360]   including Eastern Europe, including it's a big, big world. It's not just the United States.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:31.000]   And how easy, how hard is Apple willing to work to create loyal fans in a country like
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:37.640]   India, in a country like that's located in Africa, or again, Eastern Europe, or even Northern Europe?
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:42.760]   It's, I would like to see Apple have the ability to create a viable product and attractive product
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:47.240]   for the entire world, not just for the sort of people who tend to appear in Apple ads.
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:54.200]   Yeah, one thing that I find hard is also to sort of parse out correlation and causation. Like,
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:59.800]   does Apple have a large number of subscribers in the US because Apple has a large number of
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:04.680]   iMessage users in the US where other places tend to use WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger,
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:09.880]   or Lion, or something else? And it does become geographically segmented just because of brand
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:15.320]   affinity and what your friends are using, or what works well with your existing predilections
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:19.960]   or ecosystem. And the other thing is that there is no free tier or ad supported tier, which is a
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:25.160]   huge thing for Spotify. You sort of have the option with Spotify not to subscribe, and there might be
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:30.040]   a greater tolerance level for people who want the service but don't want to pay for it. And so
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:35.480]   Spotify has this huge user group that's just not being counted in this, where with Apple, if you
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:39.880]   finished your trial, you have to subscribe. And I'm sure a lot of people don't subscribe, but
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:46.440]   everyone else has to be a paid subscriber. And that probably deforms the numbers, especially in
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:53.080]   markets that have generally given Apple more money than they've given other people as well. So for
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:58.760]   me, it's sort of a complex thing. And I think the Spotify argument is also a bit blended by the
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:03.240]   fact that they never historically got a ton of money from iOS. I mean, they like to talk about
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:10.040]   that. But so much is ad supported. And so much of it comes from people who had Spotify long before
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:15.400]   they had any Apple hardware or found out about Spotify or got it on the web. That I'm not sure how
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.800]   I'm sure they are impacted to some degree. I'm just not sure how much it is. But I think it's
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:25.640]   it's interesting that we have sort of these viable subscription models. And I think I talked
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:30.360]   about this a couple of weeks ago, or even last week, where we're getting these complaints about
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:35.720]   subscription fatigue, when instead of buying every CD you want, every every month as many as you
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:40.760]   can afford, we now have all CDs sort of smashed down into one subscription. And instead of picking
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:45.480]   shoes, which magazine you want to buy or subscribe to like the two or three you can afford, or the
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:50.840]   two or three you can pick up at the newsstand, you have all almost all magazines smashed down
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:54.120]   into one subscription price. And we're going to get the same with video games. And we already
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:58.680]   have it for a large part with videos, although you do have to pick and choose several video
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:02.920]   services because they have not let themselves get smashed down to the extent that music has.
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:09.160]   And it's sort of like, this is a childhood dream for me. We all the music at the command of your
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:14.600]   voice with your assistant of choice. And I don't think title is really still in this, but we have
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:18.280]   we have multiple services that you can go to Lori and they're they're actually succeeding.
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:23.640]   Yeah, I think it's great to see multiple services succeed. And I think in the perfect world,
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:30.920]   this is the way it would continue that title and Google's music service and YouTube music and all
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:35.960]   of this would continue to grow and be a big deal until every single person is subscribed to some
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:41.480]   sort of music service. I don't think that there's any reason to believe that one should be the one
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:46.920]   that everyone uses. I think Spotify is great. I have a family subscription to Spotify and I have
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:52.760]   a subscription to Apple music. I think they both serve very similar purposes. And sometimes I
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:57.000]   use Spotify. Sometimes I use Apple music. I personally don't have a reason why I would
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:03.720]   choose one over the other one in terms of listening. For me, the reason I like Apple music better
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:08.680]   than Spotify has to do with the user interface design and the fact that it folds into my ecosystem
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:12.760]   very well and my Apple ecosystem very well. And then that has a webplane.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:16.920]   Yeah, no, so what I still don't know though, because I've been worried about this for a long
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:22.120]   time is whether streaming music is a viable business because Apple can do it, Amazon can do it,
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:26.600]   Microsoft can do it if they decide to go back into doing it. Google can do it because they make so
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:31.480]   much money on everything else that they can use it as a break even or a loss leader or they can
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:36.680]   afford to do things like Apple did, which is accept the new policies around artist remuneration
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:42.120]   because it is not a critical source of their income. Where for Spotify, it is their income and
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:46.200]   they will live and die based on those very narrow margins. And I know they're binding their way
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:51.480]   into podcasts because they want to start doing original content the way Netflix did and not be
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:56.760]   subject to the whims of catalogs the way Netflix was with stars before they started making
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.240]   so much original content. But that's still my fear here, not that Apple has an unfair advantage
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:06.840]   over Spotify, although they quite possibly might, but that it's just given how little
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:12.200]   artists already make off music. I don't know if there's room for a middleman for many more years
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:18.040]   going forward. >> Well, that's sort of- >> That's our key in that. There shouldn't be somebody who,
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:24.280]   there shouldn't be somebody like manufacturing LPs that get that somebody has to supply the music
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:29.400]   that we're listening to. I think that artists are very underpaid in the industry, but I think
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:35.000]   there needs to be the middleman. So there needs to be people like organizations like Spotify
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:40.680]   and existence so that that music can get brought to the rest of us. So I think they're a very
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:47.320]   important part of that music industry. I think streaming services are the biggest things since
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:52.680]   CDs that have literally changed the way people listen to music and I don't think that's going
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:58.760]   away. And I don't think Spotify is going away. I think it gets harder for Spotify specifically
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:04.200]   and companies like Spotify that do nothing but streaming music services just because there are
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:09.000]   artists out there who are feeling slighted by how much money they're not making off of these.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.400]   >> Right. >> Which honestly, it's probably the original
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:19.480]   contract that they have that it's probably something like Warner Brothers that wants that money more
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:23.960]   than the artist getting any of it. I can go on a tirade about how artists are paying that.
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:27.320]   >> But that's the thing right now, right? That Spotify isn't giving them the more money that
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:31.000]   they've been told they're required to give them and that's created a lot of tension. And if they
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:37.000]   do do that, that makes it even harder for Spotify to keep going. >> Yeah. But I don't think it makes
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:44.200]   it that much harder. I mean, I don't know what Spotify's margins are, but I think that there is a way
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:48.200]   to make this work so that everybody is getting the right amount of money and getting the right
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:53.880]   amount of coverage and things like that. There's just a lot of negotiating and contract
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:59.560]   changes that need to be made in order to make that happen. I don't think raising artists,
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:05.880]   the amount of percentage that an artist gets for the music that's shared on Spotify,
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:09.320]   is going to shut them down. I don't think that that's true. >> Yeah.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:15.560]   >> Yeah. One thing that we never seem to talk about when we talk about music on iOS and the Mac
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:20.760]   is how bad iTunes has become for people who actually have their own music libraries.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:27.080]   And I really hope that Apple turns their attention back to the app that started it all.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:33.320]   I realize that modern humanity is not really so interested in acquiring physical media or even
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:39.240]   buying downloadable media. But there are things that I don't think any streaming service does
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:45.320]   well at all. And that's in giving you some control over how your music is organized,
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:51.480]   how you access your music, how your music is presented to you. And it's kind of embarrassing
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:59.080]   that Apple has an iTunes app that is so aggressively still very much what it was 10 years ago.
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:07.720]   It really does show a certain lack of interest. One of the recurring themes of my thoughts about
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:13.240]   Apple is that there's so clearly stuff that they care about and stuff that they don't particularly
[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:19.320]   care about. >> Like the ISR on. >> Yeah. I mean, even in other companies, like they'll have a
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:23.160]   product that's not really their high priority. But you can tell that it's almost as though there's
[01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:28.280]   a company within Google or company within Amazon that loves this product. >> It has an engineer
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:32.680]   sign. >> Trying to make it. Yeah, exactly. There's somebody who will actually have one
[01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:41.960]   their business card. I am actually responsible for Google+. That is my baby. That is my responsibility.
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:44.520]   And yes, we're trying to get down. >> Remember when a boat caught up didn't have an engineer for
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:48.840]   like a year just didn't get any updates? >> Yeah. And it's terrible because there's just no,
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:55.320]   last week my pick of the week was Plex. And I really wanted to point that out just because
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:00.840]   now that I've been now that I switched to Plex after being really disappointed by what I couldn't
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:05.880]   couldn't do with iTunes for so many years. Now that I've been doing it for three years,
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:13.880]   this library is it would really bum me out. If somehow I lost this library, it was not where they
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:19.960]   got fire got my house. And for some reason all my backups were gone away. I would have to not
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:26.600]   listen to music and just mourn for an entire year because this is like perfectly exactly the way
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:33.720]   that Andy Anaco likes to organize and access and listen to and find his music. iTunes has to and
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:41.640]   iTunes and every other service has to obviously be a piece of software that works okay for everybody.
[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:47.000]   It can't afford to be excellent for any one specific kind of user. But Apple could deliver
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.160]   that sort of stuff with iTunes. And now that they're charging, well, I was gonna say 350,
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:56.840]   but now they're charging $300 for what they promote as a really, really high quality audio
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:33:01.800]   speaker. That would be another way to indicate how much invested they are in making sure that
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:06.040]   your music experience is as good as it can possibly be. >> But they're gonna Marsy Pan,
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:11.080]   all the iOS apps for you, and stuff. >> Thank God. I'll have another,
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:18.520]   every God, a part of me dies every time that Apple quote updates a Mac OS app by turning it into
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:25.800]   an iOS app. It does not make me feel as though I should buy any green bananas when it comes to
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:31.480]   investing in the Mac platform. It doesn't show that Apple loves the Mac again. They clearly,
[01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:36.680]   they're things that they love and things that they don't hate, but they can do without.
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:43.480]   >> All right, I'm gonna throw it to Leo one last time so that he can tell us about one last thing
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:49.000]   that's gonna make all of our lives just ever so much better. >> And now one more interruption,
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.520]   Renee, I'm sorry, then back to Mac Break Weekly. I hope the pics are gonna be good this week,
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:57.240]   and I wish I were there. I miss you guys, but I'll be back next week. Meanwhile, I wanna talk
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:03.160]   to you about one of the reasons we can take a vacation. >> [LAUGH]
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:09.480]   >> Zipper Kruder, I'm telling you, I love having employees. I love having people like you doing
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:15.160]   the job when I'm not there. And of course, the worst thing in the world is when an employee
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:20.760]   leaves suddenly. And now you've gotta do double duty. You've gotta fill for ill and for them,
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:25.480]   and spend the time looking for a new employee. But I don't want you to stand on that because
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:29.320]   I have really learned, if there's one thing I've learned as a small business owner,
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:37.560]   hiring the right people is key. Your business is made of people. That's it, that's all business is.
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:42.920]   A company is a bunch of people with an aligned purpose. So getting people that really fit your
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:50.360]   needs and align with your goals is so important. And Zipper Kruder is a high tech way of doing it
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:53.800]   right now. There's a couple of things Zipper Kruder does that make it unique. First of all,
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:58.040]   when you post a Zipper Kruder, you're posting your listing on Zipper Kruder, of course,
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:04.200]   it's a job board, but not just Zipper Kruder, 100 plus other job boards and social networks
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:09.000]   like Twitter and Facebook, Zipper Kruder posts it everywhere. That's important because it means
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.960]   you cast the widest possible net. Oh yeah, I know that means you're gonna get the most applicants,
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:18.760]   but it's also the most likely that that perfect applicant will be in there. So Zipper Kruder gives
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:25.480]   you some great tools for finding the right person. So for instance, all the applications go into the
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:30.040]   Zipper Kruder interface, not into your inbox. They don't call you, they don't have your number
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:33.400]   into the Zipper Kruder interface. They preform at all the resumes. So it's easy to read,
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:37.480]   they're all the same. You can put in screen questions, eliminate people who just aren't right.
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:43.400]   So really help narrow it down. There's one other thing Zipper Kruder does that is super cool.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:48.040]   So they're a job site. So they have, I don't know how many, I think more than a million resumes,
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:53.480]   current resumes on file that people put up on Zipper Kruder looking for work. Zipper Kruder
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:36:00.120]   uses AI to go through those, look at people's qualifications, note the people that are right
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:04.120]   for the job you just posted. So make sure you really be detailed in the qualifications,
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:08.920]   what you're looking for, and they will invite those people, they don't just put their application in,
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:14.360]   they invite them to apply. So basically Zipper Kruder goes out and notifies good candidates
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:20.280]   that you're looking. That means on average that people who post their jobs on Zipper Kruder will
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:25.320]   get at least one qualified candidate within 24 hours. In our experiences even faster,
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:31.560]   we were, we used, I told this story before I won't bore you with it, but at breakfast, Lisa
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:36.120]   saying, I got to fill this position. I said, Zipper Kruder, she said, Oh yeah, let me put it in there.
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:44.200]   Before lunch, actually within an hour, candidate comes in. What? She's looking at, this is great,
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:50.760]   another one. Oh, this is even better. We had three good candidates before lunch thanks to Zipper
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:57.480]   Kruder. It really works. It's amazing. And by the way, it really reduces stress because when we lose
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:05.800]   a bookkeeper in this case, she does the books. So doubles up on the job. So she was really dreading
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:10.760]   this. It, you know, you could see the load lift off her shoulders. If you're doing the hiring,
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:15.320]   a load will lift off your shoulders. The angels, the heavens will part. The angels will sing
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:22.120]   when you use Zipper Kruder. We've got a great deal. You can try it free at zippercruder.com/macbreak.
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:27.640]   Four out of five employers who post on Zipper Kruder get a quality candidate through the
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:36.600]   site within the first day. That's you. Zipper Kruder.com/macbreak, zippercruder.com/macbreak.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:40.600]   Use that URL to show your support for Macbreak Weekly that way. They'll go, "Oh, look,
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:46.440]   oh, all these people are paying attention." So, zippercruder.com/macbreak. And we thank them
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:52.360]   for supporting the show. Zipper Kruder. These smartest way to hire, believe me, that's what we
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:58.600]   use and we will continue to use from now on. Renee Ritchie, take it away. I'll see you next week.
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:04.760]   All right. So I neglected to inform everybody, Bad host Total Fail, that we were going to be
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:09.320]   going into picks of the week. So I'm just going to talk for a few seconds about how I neglected
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:15.320]   to do that so that cleverly Andy and Laurie can prepare themselves behind the scene. And if they
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:21.560]   need a few extra minutes, I'm going to just go through my pick quickly, which is NSNorth. NSNorth
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:28.680]   is a conference. It's a Canadian conference for iOS, MacOS, for developers, for people who just
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:33.240]   love the community, for designers, for everybody like that. It's one of the grand traditions of
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:40.680]   indie Mac events. And this coming month, April 26th to April 28th, they're going to be in my hometown
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:45.400]   of Montreal. And they have quite a few really cool speakers. They always have some great speakers.
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:50.760]   But this year, they've got Ken Keshinda, who worked on the original Safari project and then
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:56.040]   made the keyboard for the original iPhone. He spoke to Meghan on a previous episode of
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:39:02.200]   Not of Mac Break Weekly. Carson, you can tell me later what he was on, which show, but
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:05.480]   you can whisper to my ear and I'll say it like I actually remembered it. But he's been on a
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:06.840]   lot of shows recently. >> Trangulation.
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:10.360]   >> Trangulation, thank you, sir. It was on an episode of Trangulation with Meghan. It was super
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:16.520]   interesting. He's going to be speaking at NSNorth. Don Melton spoke previously. I'm going to be
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:23.160]   speaking there as well. Matthew Bischoff, Ishmael Shabazz, Christine Molten, the list goes on. Also,
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:31.240]   James Thompson, who famously developed the original Finder and Doc implementation
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:37.000]   for the Mac, until Steve Jobs found it out. Found out he lived in Ireland, was I worked in Ireland,
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:42.280]   and put a stop to that. Guillermo Rambo, who works on 9-5 Mac, also makes some great apps,
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:47.000]   but is the one who you see with all those code deep dives. The one who's really good at reverse
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:52.440]   engineering and finding out what's going on in iOS. So really great list of speakers. They're
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:57.800]   doing their last push on tickets. They'll be available until Sunday. So if you're in Montreal,
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:02.680]   or you can get to Montreal, or you just want to be there no matter what to see all of these great
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:09.480]   people, then you can check that out at NSNorth.ca because it's just a fantastic event. And it's surrounded
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:14.680]   by Putin. And you can't go wrong with that. Laurie Gill, what is your pick of the week?
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:19.400]   Oh, you're muted, Laurie.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:29.400]   I am so good at remembering not to, remembering to undo my mute button when we're between commercials
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:35.720]   and that time I just forgot. I was so excited about NSNorth because I've read Ken Kishinda's book,
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:44.680]   creative selection at your recommendation, Renee. And it's really good. I really enjoyed it. So
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:48.200]   I definitely recommend everybody read that. That is not my pick of the week, by the way. But
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:51.960]   I just wanted to point that out. That's really great that you're going to get to see him,
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:59.320]   and actually participate in this event because I would love to hear more about what he had to say.
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:04.040]   It was actually very interesting. If you haven't read that book, Ken Kishinda, is that
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:10.120]   I'm am I pronouncing it right? Creative selection inside Apple's design process during the Golden
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:16.440]   Age of Steve Jobs. That's his name, the name of his book. My pick of the week is actually the
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:26.920]   Criterion Channel, which just launched officially yesterday. The Criterion Channel, as a streaming
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:33.320]   service used to be film struck, they restarted again. You were able to sign up for a couple of
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:39.400]   months. And just yesterday, until yesterday, the only thing that you could do was watch one of their
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:43.480]   movie of the week picks, which was actually really fun because every week they'd put up a
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:48.760]   different movie, but you could only watch it on a browser as of yesterday. It's now available on
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:56.680]   iOS and on web browsers, on Apple TV, on Roku, on Android, a bunch of different formats. You can
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:42:02.680]   download these apps and stream them from all your different favorite services. There's lots of
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:08.920]   great movies that are already out that I can't wait to see. It just came out yesterday, so I've
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:13.080]   barely had any time to start getting through them. But I've already put on the
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:19.160]   400 blows on my list of things to watch and Mulholland Drive, of course. There's a lot of different
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:27.320]   great films. These are classic films and our tour movies and things that have stood the test
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:35.240]   of time that really stand out and are very special. Criterion is known for creating these. They remaster
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:39.960]   a lot of DVDs and Blu-rays that go out to the public, and they're always fantastically done.
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:46.360]   And they even have a section of their remastered by Criterion, so you can watch these films that
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:51.800]   have given the treatment to make them extra special. The one that's called the Criterion
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:56.680]   Editions, these are all movies that Criterion have gone through and updated and done a better
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:03.320]   transfer of so that these older movies will still hold their beauty and look the way they were
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:11.560]   intended when they first came out. So if you like movies, if you're into art movies and
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:17.640]   classic film and things like that, this is definitely going to be amazing. I think it's
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:25.720]   $9.99 a month. You get a 14-day trial. Actually, I apologize. It's $10.99 a month because if you
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:31.640]   got a subscription in advance, it was only $9.99 a month. But as of now, it's $10.99 a month,
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:38.200]   but with a free 14-day trial. So give it a try. Terrific. Andy Inaco, what's your pick?
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:42.200]   Well, we were talking about Right to Repair earlier, which reminded me,
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:48.840]   caused me to bump my pick of the week to next week because Lewis Rossman, R-O-S-S-M-A-N-N,
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:59.080]   has is a Apple repair guy. He has a shop that does non-Apple repairs so that he,
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:03.560]   sorry, had a little bit too much soda.
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:06.680]   So I was okay for the first two hours.
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:14.840]   Lewis Rossman owns a repair shop. He does component level repairs on all kinds of Apple gear,
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:20.440]   and he has this really wonderful YouTube channel. So that's not only if you want to repair stuff
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:27.000]   yourself, he'll actually show you how component level repairs on all the way down to ICs to just
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:33.720]   simply broken hinges, broken connectors can be done. If you don't want to do that yourself,
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:38.360]   it's fun to watch somebody who knows how to do these things, do these things. But the other
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:44.200]   component that I love about his channel is that he is a really outspoken advocate about Right to
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:51.000]   Repair and about how he feels. And I share this, that Apple isn't doing enough to give people more
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:57.320]   control over their own hardware. About how an $800, sorry, you have to replace this entire
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:04.760]   sub-assembly repair can instead be $75 in labor and a component that costs $20 or $30.
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:09.720]   So it's really, really, really fun to watch him work. It's also occasionally really,
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:14.360]   really fun to watch him rant because he is making really super good points. I think that
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:20.600]   one of the difficulties of modern technology, particularly when devices that have screw holes
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:25.800]   in them are becoming rarer and rarer is that computers and laptops and phones and tablets,
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:31.000]   they're becoming these closed boxes that are filled with mystery. And when you actually see
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:37.080]   somebody take the lid off of this thing and see that we can figure it out, you see this component
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:42.600]   right here, it is bad. Watch me remove the bad component and put a good component in its place.
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:47.800]   You realize that, no, it's not mysterious. You don't even have to work for Apple to be able to do
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:55.320]   a repair of this nature and the ability to have independent repair people like Lewis out there
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:46:00.600]   to go to when you've got a three-year-old laptop that either for your own uses is still
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:05.160]   perfectly good. It just has this one little problem with it and being able to get the full
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:09.880]   life out of the product or as is often the case with Apple stuff, the ability to pass down your
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:16.200]   three or four-year-old laptop to a kid in your family that they can still use it. It's a really
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:20.520]   important point he's making and it's a hugely, hugely entertaining channel.
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:27.720]   Awesome. Yeah, absolutely. Check it out. Thank all of you for your picks. And that will bring us
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:34.760]   to the close of this episode of Mac Break Weekly, Andy and Ocko Boston Public Radio. Where can we
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:41.800]   find you? When can we find you? How can we find you? Most Fridays on WGBH in Boston, they also stream
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:48.680]   my half hour of tech live at wgphnews.org. If you go to the website, you can also see they usually
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:54.360]   have my segments and the other shows up available for streaming and for podcasting. And for my
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:59.000]   Instagram, for my Twitter, for my blog, just spelled my last name, I not go i-h,
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.040]   and it's a Nancy, A-t-s and Tom K-o. You told them that's supposed to be the secret to unlocking
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:09.080]   your social following Andy is the ability to spell your name. No, see, that's the double trick
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:12.600]   about it. I know that someone knows me well if they can spell it in their head without being
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:19.720]   prompted to do so. So you'll get it wrong twice. There's a reason why I'm also i-n-h-a-t-k-o on
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:25.720]   Twitter and other servers. I just look at my junk mail and I know that every single way you can
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:30.920]   misspell my name. And that's how I'll get it. Awesome. And what about you, Laurie Gil?
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:37.240]   You can find me writing at iMore. This week, we're doing a lot of things about
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:43.640]   Siri to just try to get us ready for the future of Siri. You can also find me on Twitter @apaholic
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:49.400]   spelled a-a-p-p-a-h-o-l-i-k. It's harder than you think to try to spell that out.
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:54.680]   And @LaurieGill, at most of the other social things. And this weekend, I'm going to spend some
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:59.400]   time in Santa Cruz just to get away and relax. So while you guys are freezing and snow, I'm
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:04.840]   going to be hanging out on the beach. Sorry, not sorry. No, one of the things that people have
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:10.280]   been asking since the ascent of Laurie Gil on iMore is that how do you get so many articles? And
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:14.280]   this is one of the things that's amazing about you because Apple will announce PowerBeats
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:19.560]   and you'll have like 20 articles answering every possible question anybody could have about that.
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:24.440]   And I knew it was a thing because someone asked me, where's all this Kodak stuff? And I said, yeah,
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:29.160]   I went to CES with Laurie. She saw some Polaroid stuff. She saw some Polaroid cameras. And then
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:32.600]   all of a sudden, literally anything you could possibly want to know about those cameras
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:34.840]   were up on iMore. And it amazes me every single week.
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:39.400]   What can I say? I like to write about stuff. I like to tell people about stuff.
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:44.120]   Just want to get it out there. Get everything excited about it just like I am.
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:52.920]   You can find Mac Break Weekly in your podcast, "Catcher of Choice." That can be iTunes still. If
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:57.480]   like Andy, you love that app. We don't love it, but still have to use it. Or it can be overcast or
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:04.200]   pocketcast or any cast whatsoever. You can watch it live, of course, at twitter.tv/live.
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:07.720]   I'm going to try to do the conversion in my head. Is it 11 o'clock Pacific time?
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:13.960]   I feel like it's 11 o'clock Pacific time. 2 o'clock east. I am correct. Yes. One for math.
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:17.720]   And next week, don't have to worry. I won't be here making all these rookie mistakes because
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:22.920]   you'll be back in the safe and loving hands of Leo LaPorte. Thank you all so much for watching.
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:27.320]   Andy, Laurie, Carson, see you next week.
