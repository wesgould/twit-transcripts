[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.960]   And I don't know what we're going to talk about because frankly, until Friday, we're
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.600]   just kind of floating in the air waiting for the other shoe to drop.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.640]   Andy Enoco to my left from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.000]   His website is www.cwob celestialwaistofbandwith.com.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Hi, Andy.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Hello.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.920]   And to my right, Leander Connie of thecultofMac.com.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.800]   So CultofAndrey, but how much in that?
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.800]   Hey, Leander.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.800]   Good to have you.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.240]   It's more of a study than a cult.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.760]   And neither of you went to a South by Southwest.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.760]   So I don't have to worry about hangovers.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.960]   I don't know how to ride a longboard, so I'm not qualified to attend South by Southwest.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.960]   Wow.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.360]   I was a little nervous because, you know, South by Southwest is a big trade conference in
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.880]   Austin that goes on every March.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.680]   And it's really fun.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.680]   It's just great.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.640]   They started with a music festival, then a film festival, and they added interactive,
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.560]   and it's become, I don't know, 50 or 60 or 70,000 people, all of them from San Francisco
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.920]   and New York, apparently, converge on Austin.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.280]   And it's become just one that Austin becomes a massive party.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.280]   It's basically Mardi Gras for geeks now, minus the toplessness and the beads.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.800]   And it's only 20,000 for interactive.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.360]   It feels like more.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.360]   It feels like more.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.360]   And I was worried that we might miss something, but apparently, according to all of my feeds,
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.840]   the only thing we missed was lots of imbibing and Beritunde, who apparently was stellar
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.880]   in his talk.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.880]   And I missed that.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.880]   I'm sorry about that.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.280]   And the homeless that...
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.280]   That was weird.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.320]   They had the hotspots.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.280]   It seems like that company, I think, was trying...
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.400]   It was actually some of the reports I read.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.760]   It wasn't quite as crass as it appeared.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.680]   They were trying to... they said they were trying to raise awareness of homelessness
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.840]   and try to do something a little entrepreneurial.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.080]   So, and I just...
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.120]   Obviously, it was, I think, clumsily communicated.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.480]   They actually did something in the past in New York, some previous campaigns.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.120]   They have a long history of doing sort of socially...
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.320]   Well, it's a little more complicated.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.360]   Let me tell people what happened here, so people understand.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.960]   During South by Southwest, homeless people were wandering the streets with t-shirts saying,
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.160]   "Hi, my name is Clarence, and I am a wireless hotspot.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160]   Give me some money, and you can use me."
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.680]   And they were carrying 4G MIFI cards, and they...
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.760]   I guess you'd send them a text, and they'd send you back the password and so forth.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.120]   They called them homeless hotspots.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.040]   It was a PR firm called BBH Labs that did this.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.840]   And there was a lot of... on the one hand, it really looked like this is exactly what's
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.680]   wrong with hipsters, South by Southwest, the tech community, callous, heartless.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.080]   And then other people said, as you did, Leander, that, "Well, BBH is raising awareness of the
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.080]   homeless."
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.440]   They had done something before in New York City, but it was four interns.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.600]   They gave cell phones to four different homeless guys, and they didn't give them any training.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.840]   They let them tweet, and then they stopped the program.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.400]   And so what they did before was underwhelming, to say the least, it didn't certainly help
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.680]   these homeless guys in any way.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.880]   Unclear whether this helps people or not, or whether it raises awareness about homeless
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.680]   or not, it just appears crass, I guess, and that's really kind of the...
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.000]   Yeah, you really have to do it carefully.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.720]   I understand that as you attach to the hotspot, it could be wrong, but I was seeing some screen
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.920]   shots that maybe think that when you attach to the hotspot, it has an introductory page
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.920]   on your web browser.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.640]   So here's my name, here's my story.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.640]   That's good.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.640]   That's a situation.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.280]   So, yeah, I mean, it's not quite like Marie Antoinette hiring serfs to serve as end tables
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.480]   in the palace, but you're right.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.920]   It's sometimes just being really, really clear about your intentions is just as important
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.080]   as how you execute the idea.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.360]   Marie said she was just trying to raise awareness of the plight of serfs in France.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.440]   17th century French.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.440]   That's all.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.240]   It was carefully crafted.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.040]   There was a PR milestone when I thought when the rumors got that she was eating her
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.720]   serverence, which is, "No, no, I eat off my serverence.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.480]   I'm not, for God's sake, these people are human beings."
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.400]   Matthew Glasius wrote, "I think this is fairly accurate.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.640]   Think about all the companies involved in one way or another at Southby who did absolutely
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.000]   and nothing at all for Austin's homeless population, which is fairly large.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.760]   How much condemnation did they get?
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.760]   None.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.760]   I'm not a stunt here.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.440]   Offends are a sense of human dignity, but the real offense is that people were languishing
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.240]   in such poor conditions that they would find this to be an attractive job offer.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.840]   The sin BBH is being punished for is less than any harm they've done to homeless people
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.600]   than the way they broke decorum by showing the reality of homeless misery amidst material
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.400]   plenty into the faces of convention goers.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.520]   It's unseemly though when you see some, you know, dot com millionaire given some homeless
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.440]   guy a buck so I can use him as a Wi-Fi access point.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.160]   It just feels wrong.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.440]   But I agree with Matthew that it's, you know, it's just a tricky issue.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.440]   I think we all agree.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.160]   It was just maybe could have been done a little bit more elegantly.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.600]   Anyway, that's not it.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.240]   Not neither here nor there has absolutely nothing to do with Apple.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.320]   I'm sorry I brought up South by Southwest.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.320]   We're not there and we don't care.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.720]   That's like a chant.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.720]   We're not there.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.720]   We don't care.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.720]   We don't care.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.520]   Gina Trapani, it didn't go this year and she said she was suffering from FOMO fear of
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.520]   missing out.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.120]   But I don't, I think we've survived.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.840]   The whole point of companies going there is to get their message out.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.960]   So oftentimes it's a question of do you want to get that drunk and that jet lag to get
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.160]   information about 20 minutes before somebody tweets it out and then.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.160]   Exactly.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.120]   And then you know that the Marvel had Marvel Comics had a really interesting announcement.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.280]   They have a, they're, they're rolling out a brand new digital initiative where it's
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.520]   not just simply doing digital versions of their comics, but a brand new app and a brand
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.480]   new format for digital comics that name any seven buzzwords and I guarantee you this press
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.360]   release had that information in it.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.000]   So maybe, maybe great, maybe not great.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.640]   But the point is that the fact that I was here meant that, oh, I bet that there are still
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.640]   people in Marvel's offices in New York whom I could actually email and call.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.480]   And so instead of again, having to fly, fly all the way to Texas, getting very drunk and
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.720]   very bloated on that really, really wonderful, grilled and barbecued food that they have
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.720]   there.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.640]   And now of course, the huge ironies that Sarah, MG and all the other people couldn't get back
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.160]   to San Francisco because the weather's so bad here and they're stranded in stairs in
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.840]   Phoenix, MG's in Oakland.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.840]   So, so.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:34.640]   See, that's what you get for having too much fun.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.400]   We're going to talk about, actually, I want to talk a little bit about a green light for
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   Apple.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.160]   Also, what the hell is Yahoo thinking?
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:47.280]   All of that coming up as we talk about Apple and the Apple world and really the truth is
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.640]   everybody knows we're just waiting till Friday.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.200]   We're just there's all we can do is think about our new iPads.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.520]   But I do want to get Leander's take on this and Andy too, as we've had a little time to
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.520]   digest.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.320]   So we'll talk about that too in just a second.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.680]   But first a word from Citrix, the folks who do, I just was on a go to meeting.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.160]   I right before the show, we were using HD faces.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.160]   It's so cool.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.160]   Chris Pirlo was on it with me.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.600]   A couple of people from Citrix, a guy named Paul Glenn is an IT professional.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.000]   We were planning an event we're going to do in May.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   And just it's great.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.880]   It's like you're really sitting there and you're seeing the people and it's fun to see
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.440]   like Michael at Citrix, Michael Guarnieri's office.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.600]   He has a, he monitors their social strategy and he has a, it's like a TV painted on the
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.160]   wall with a big screen in it and their tweets are going by.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.160]   It's just so cool.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.240]   Go, I want to visit go to meeting.com and take a look at this.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.560]   Works great on a Mac and, and Windows of course too.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.200]   G-O-T-O meeting.com.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.720]   The product has been around for a long time.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.080]   You're probably familiar with it as a screen sharing meeting program.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.320]   But now they've got HD faces.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.080]   In fact, now they've got HD faces for the iPad.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.640]   I can't wait to see this on the new iPad.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.280]   This is going to be, and you know that, I didn't ask Michael what, you know they're
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.360]   going to be working on it.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.040]   The idea that you are doing these meetings, everybody these days has distributed all over
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.520]   our new, our web design company, Lullaby.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.640]   I don't even know where they are.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.000]   We have meetings every three times a week and they're in Rhode Island, they're in Minnesota,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.520]   they're probably in Australia, they're all over the place.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.000]   This is the way we work these days.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.640]   Go to meeting brings that team together on the screen and it's fantastic.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.560]   I just clicked a link in the email.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.320]   The program launched, it's a little Java stuff.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.960]   It always downloads the latest which takes five seconds and then you're meeting.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.600]   It's incredible.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.360]   You're seeing them in high depth.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.360]   I just love it.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.240]   I want you to try it free for the next 30 days.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.520]   It's great for product reviews, for demos, for sales presentations, training sessions.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.880]   We use them for our weekly status meetings.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.880]   Right from your desk, visit go to meeting.com, click the try at free button.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.780]   Let me show you right here, the orange try at free button and make sure you use the offer
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:00.040]   code MAC break so that Andy and company get credit for this.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:09.680]   MACBREAK, not like a car break, like you're breaking something, Mac break as a promo code
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.080]   for 30 days free.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.560]   From Citrix, go to meeting.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.200]   It's amazing.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:22.720]   So Rockstar consortium, I like the name.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.720]   You know who that is?
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.840]   That's Apple, Microsoft, RIM, Ericsson and Sony.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:36.760]   They joined together to buy 4,000 nortelle patents for $4.5 billion and now the Department
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.280]   of Justice says, "Yeah, go right ahead."
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.640]   The acquisition had already been okayed by the US courts and by antitrust regulators,
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.440]   but the DOJ had a waiting period for review of the patent purchase.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.560]   That period just expired means that's it.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:58.240]   There's nothing more to stop them from getting those patents.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.280]   And in a related story, Yahoo's decided to sue Facebook because it's apparently the
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.320]   only way they can make money.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   Holy cow.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:14.520]   Yeah, foolish me for studying computer science and college instead of law, I thought that
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.560]   the computer science degree would be more useful for writing about technology than the
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.640]   law degree, but apparently I was very, very wrong.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.880]   So let me just, I think this, I think you guys in this audience, you guys, if I tell
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:33.600]   you the patents, you will see how, what a strong case Yahoo has.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.720]   There are 10 of them.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:45.800]   Here's one, US patent 7454509 issued 2008, a method, but by the way, issued 2008, a
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:51.960]   method for entertaining individuals according to a community having similar tastes.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.920]   The derived from user accounts form the basis of a community and collateral preferences
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.920]   allow other subscribers.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.320]   Boy, Spotify, Ping, a lot of companies in trouble there.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.440]   That's the online playback system with community bias patent.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.360]   How about control for enabling a user to preview display of selected content based on another
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.440]   user's authorization level?
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.960]   This, I mean, Facebook's using these.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.800]   There's no question.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.560]   Share an item only with selected friends.
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.360]   In other words.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.360]   A dynamic, oh, get this.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.680]   We're all in trouble now.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:31.640]   Yahoo apparently patented in 1997 the ability to customize your homepage.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:36.160]   A custom page server provided with user preferences organized into templates.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.760]   My Yahoo, remember my Yahoo, my.yahoo.com?
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.360]   That was it.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.320]   They may have, they may actually, they may have something there that might be the first
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.440]   customized homepage, right?
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.960]   How about this one messaging your friends?
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.240]   World, world modeling using relationship network with communication channels to entities,
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:14:00.120]   aka, according to paid content.org messaging your friends, sending an instant message system
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:05.120]   and method for instant messaging using an email protocol.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:13.440]   Yeah, there's and I've been looking at the Yahoo for the past two hours and apparently
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.640]   the stock price is now going way down because of this announcement.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.640]   Really?
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:22.040]   I'm sorry, you can't say whether or not it's because of this announcement, but today it's
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.680]   down to 14.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:31.080]   I'm looking at something from the Mercury news saying this down half of a percent nearly
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.640]   as of 1230 right now.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.640]   I don't know.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.000]   I haven't been able to see anybody that who thinks this is in any way a good thing.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.720]   It really is a following the Kodak playbook that said that if you can't be a success at
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.960]   the cash register and you can't get a success at enterprise, try to get success in the courts.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:56.840]   I'm not sure that anybody outside of a Chinese iPad trademark shark has ever made that work
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.360]   for anybody.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.280]   Compare this though, Andy, to app.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:07.440]   Some people would say the same thing about Apple.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.920]   The rock star consortium, it really does read more of a defensive posture than anything
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.920]   else.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.920]   Everybody wanted this patent portfolio.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.400]   Google tried to get it, but couldn't.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.400]   Google tried to get it.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.600]   There's also there's also been some discussion as to how seriously they tried to get it because
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.400]   apparently there were a couple of kind of joke bids in there.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.960]   But it really is mean.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.520]   I think that maybe we're moving from a posture of being a legitimate patent role to realizing
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:37.000]   that if you have any sort of any sort of viable patent, someone might want to buy it from
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.320]   you just to take it off the playing field, just to keep it out of the hands of the sharks.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.920]   So I don't think anybody.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.480]   I'm sorry, none of the smarter people than I am who are in intellectual property who
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.640]   have looked at the terms of the offer that's consortium made thinks it's anything other
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.800]   than we want to make sure that we have these patents so no one else can beat us over the
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.800]   head with it.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.880]   Although it is notable that it seems as though all these companies were very, very open in
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.280]   trying to bring other people on board if necessary for this.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.640]   Remember that this price was enough that Apple could have bought this whole patent portfolio
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.520]   themselves if they thought it was that important.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:18.440]   But it is notable that this does not include every single mobile manufacturer in the industry.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.080]   It contains most of them.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.320]   And certainly two companies are going to be the biggest players in the next couple of
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.640]   years, certainly the two that you would think that have the most to fight with each other
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.640]   about.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.920]   So the fact that they're ganging together to own this patent portfolio together, I think
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.680]   tells you something about the nature of the transaction.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.600]   Yeah, but Apple's also actively suing companies like Samsung.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.160]   It sure looks like Apple wants to put Samsung out of business trying to get injunctions
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.800]   for against several of their phones and tablets.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.360]   But that's different.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.360]   You think Apple has merit?
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.960]   Yeah, I have to say this is what Yahoo said in its complaint.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:59.760]   Facebook's entire social network model, which allows users to create profiles for and connect
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:05.920]   with among other things, persons and businesses, is based on Yahoo's patented social networking
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.920]   technology.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.040]   They say we invented social networking and we want to be paid for it.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.440]   Apple says we invented the smartphone and we want to be paid for it.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.280]   Is there a difference?
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.120]   There's like all I can say is that there's definitely a difference in these sort of maneuvers.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:26.400]   Again, I check with people who are to do this like on a much on a regular basis and they're
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.800]   telling me that if they were trying to buy these patents to beat other people with over
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.440]   the head with it, they would have made this offer in a fundamentally different way.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.440]   I understand.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.440]   I can't tell though.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.480]   I'm also talking about Apple's existing lawsuits.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.480]   Yes.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.640]   Apple's taking this stuff to court.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:46.480]   Now the difference maybe is that Yahoo is going down the tubes and Apple's clearly doing
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.480]   okay.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.560]   It's also you can look at the iPhone.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.800]   You can clearly see that that innovation came from Apple.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.320]   But you look at Facebook and you don't immediately think, "Oh, yeah, that's a Yahoo ripoff."
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.320]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.040]   Yahoo's been doing this for...
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:06.760]   I think Apple's definitely capable of having a very human-like response to having been
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:13.440]   slighted and thwarted and offended as if it's one person who doesn't...
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.120]   There is a very, very real offense that has been made against them.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.960]   But a company would have like a thousand people on this idea and a thousand different opinions
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.160]   and a very, very moderated response.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:30.760]   Apple sometimes just will react as that one peed-off guy who has a knife and a gun in
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.560]   the car and is thinking about the best ways to use it.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.160]   Samsung, I think...
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.080]   Samsung is like Google in that they take these things personally.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.480]   Samsung, it's not just simply that, "Oh, well, they use the patent that Apple has...
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.720]   Apple owns about rendering an icon that highlights when you touch it."
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.680]   Their Apple is offended because Samsung builds a phone that looks exactly like the iPhone.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.680]   That tries to...
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:59.080]   From Apple's perspective, tries to confuse the consumer into thinking that this phone
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:04.280]   right here, this Samsung phone is the exact same phone you saw your cousin using a month
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.280]   ago that you liked so much.
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.280]   It's kind of a double standard.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.200]   It feels like a double standard to me, Andy.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.720]   It feels like, "Well, it's okay if Apple does it, but not if Yahoo does it."
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.720]   Well, I think there are separate issues in separate different cases.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.520]   You say there's merit in Apple's, but not merit in Yahoo.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.680]   I think it comes down to what is Yahoo...
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.760]   It comes down to the nature of the patent.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:30.280]   If Yahoo was targeting Facebook's like button and said, "Well, look, we actually created
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.280]   that.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.280]   That was something that we built our account."
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.680]   Our entire corporate identity is based on...
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.000]   Matter of fact, for the first two years of our corporate identity, we had that like button
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   as part of the logo.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   It was so intrinsically connected to Yahoo.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.040]   Yes, we patented it and maybe that patent seems a little bit broad, but we have identified
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.480]   ourselves with this property.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.640]   At this point in Yahoo's history, though, they're not attacking Facebook on any...
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.440]   Really, Yahoo identifiable items.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:04.320]   It really does seem like that point in your budgeting process where you are truly looking
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:10.840]   through your sofa cushions to roll enough pennies to get some gas in your car.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.000]   That's what Yahoo's action really sounds like at this point.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.440]   I hate talking about court stuff.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.240]   I really do, but I feel like...
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.240]   I really do.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.240]   Well, you mentioned, talk about it for quite a long time, they're like, "Oh, no.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.600]   I hate it."
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.400]   Let's watch TV.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.000]   Instead, Conan O'Brien.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Last night.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.960]   Apple, as I mentioned, unveiled their new iPad yesterday.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.480]   And one of the big changes that they're touting, because it's not that different than the other
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.480]   iPads.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:44.520]   But one of the differences that they're bragging about is the incredible video quality.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.840]   Yeah, and here's the new ad where they talk about it.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:57.960]   When a screen becomes this good, colors are more vibrant.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.160]   Everything is more brilliant.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:08.560]   Because when a screen becomes this good, it's simply you and the things you care about.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.480]   The stunning retina display.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.280]   The new iPad.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.240]   I'm stunned.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.240]   I'm stunned.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.280]   There was something wrong with that ad.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.800]   I don't know if you didn't see it.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.360]   It seemed like there was something a little different in that ad, but I just...
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.320]   The ad apple should have done that.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.200]   That's why people really use the iPad.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.720]   They don't look at flowers and they...
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.320]   They're looking at bears humping.
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.160]   And guys are falling off of...
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.960]   And crotch shots.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.360]   That's what the internet was made for.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.360]   Crouch shots.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.520]   If somebody had a patent on crotch shots, I would...
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.800]   Yahoo, if I were you, I would search that patent portfolio.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.200]   Because if you had patented that, you got it.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.440]   You own the internet.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.440]   It's over.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.120]   So all right, we're excited, right?
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.880]   New iPad coming out.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.880]   Pre-ordered.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.880]   What am I saying?
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.880]   You guys both have one, don't you?
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.840]   Because you're massive, very important Apple journalists.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.480]   They've sent you some already, right?
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.480]   I got a box with them.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.480]   I was just thinking about...
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.480]   I'm getting the homeless people out here.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.480]   You got a pallet.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.480]   Now that...
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.040]   Thanks to your South by Southwest.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.400]   People wander around with an iPad at a hot spot.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.400]   Like that.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.400]   Right.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.400]   I've already moved on to my 15 inch tablet.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.600]   And you're such a lucky guy.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.600]   Have either of you...
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.600]   Leander, were you at the event?
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.600]   Did you see it?
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.400]   Did either of you actually seen one or held one?
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.800]   No, not yet.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.600]   We are on Apple's chips.
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.600]   You too.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   Really?
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.600]   You too.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.600]   That list is growing.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.400]   I would not say that I'm on any S-list.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.880]   All I will say was that I was not invited to the event last week.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.560]   For reasons for which I'm not going to even guess and aren't really operative to my job.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.560]   Apple doesn't tell you.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.720]   They just don't get the invite.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.200]   Well, it's not important.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.600]   Again, it's nowhere inside.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.760]   Nowhere in Apple's business plan contains the phrase, and it's our job to make Andy
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.640]   and Outgo's job as easy as possible.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.640]   Oh, I disagree.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.000]   Oh, I should be right there in the charter.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   It's like your best friend.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   You knew him for years.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   You grew up together.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.800]   You went to high school together.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.760]   In a few years down the road, he gets married and you didn't get invited.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.760]   It's his decision.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.800]   Well, but break your heart.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.000]   You could cry a tear.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.280]   To continue this analogy, you could be disappointed you didn't get invited, but then you find
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:32.600]   out that, well, the wife has five people in the family that absolutely could not have
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.080]   not been invited.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.520]   It was going to be a small wedding of 12 people inside a courthouse.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.760]   And then right after you hit click send on that angry email, I'll say, "All right, dude,
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.360]   I suppose that this is over.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.360]   But tweet us."
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:49.360]   I said, "Well, unfortunately, because my wife's, my new mother and father-in-law are both
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.600]   in wheelchairs and they both need two full-time aides, that really was all the seats that
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.440]   were available in the chapel.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.680]   So I'm really sorry.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:01.160]   One of the reasons why we didn't invite you was because we thought you would understand,
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:07.200]   but we apologize for not realizing that you'd be childish and churlless about this."
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.080]   Leander, Andy is obviously a much bigger man than you and I.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.080]   All right.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:18.120]   I was, yeah, I didn't take it lightly as lightly as he did.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.280]   Is this the first time you've not been invited to an event or like this or cult of Mack hasn't
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.240]   been invented or has this been ongoing?
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.000]   No, it's been ongoing.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.400]   I mean, we've been trying, we've played, we've played it, we try to make up our friends
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.400]   over there.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:35.920]   When I see who was there, when I see the people who were there, when I see, well, I'm
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.640]   not going to name names, I don't want to insult anybody.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:46.360]   But it's clearly the best way to get in is to be a big Apple supporter, right?
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.560]   You have uncritical Apple.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.800]   I'm not afraid of saying Jason Snow.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:57.240]   Well, they have to invite the editor chief of the last Standing Mac Magazine.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.600]   Well, I guess there's a couple more.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.560]   But they have to invite that guy.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:05.280]   But I would think they'd have to invite the guy who founded Cult of Mack.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.280]   You think so.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:13.000]   The tech writer for the Chicago Sun times.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.520]   Still a great metropolitan newspaper.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.640]   Still I believe operators are standing by.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.160]   Read by people in Chicago.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.560]   I just don't care.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.600]   In Poland, I'm world famous.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.440]   The artificial Apple wed log not invited oddly enough.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.360]   Yeah, that, you know, Apple PR doesn't really have that much interest in the specialist
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.360]   publications.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.160]   We are already part of the choir.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.840]   I mean, they don't need to invite us to the event to get us to cover the event.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.840]   Yeah, I guess that's true.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:47.120]   It's 70 posts that day about the event and the iPad.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.920]   They're looking for the, you know, Apple's always targeted the big mainstream publications.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.600]   They want to get that big mainstream audience.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.600]   Sure.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.680]   And that goes, that's true for where they put their advertising dollars, too.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.200]   You know, they don't go after the specialist publications.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.160]   It's always with the big general interest media properties.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.800]   And that's why John Gruber gets out and invite to every single event because daring
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.240]   fireball is a he works for Apple's PI to palm a bass.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.240]   Right.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.400]   So I'm just saying I'm not going to, I'm not going to, I'm not going to agree with that
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.720]   in any way, shape or form.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.520]   He's fairly uncritical.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.520]   Roopers are very, I think he's a, he's very sensible and very important voice.
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:26.360]   He has a, he has a point of view that Apple knows as rarely Apple knows that their phone
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.120]   philosophy is very compatible with, but I would never say that rumors a fan boy even
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.120]   in jazz.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.160]   Winkler, who doesn't even really write about anything at all anymore.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.680]   He's a VC.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.000]   There's a lot of, and I love MG.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.200]   But I'm just saying you can say it's mainstream.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.200]   It isn't.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.200]   It's unpredictable.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.840]   And anyway, I don't care.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.320]   It sounds whiny and baby is shit.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.640]   I'm not going to go on and on.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:54.080]   I just feel like that's, it's what, what the story is, it really looks like Apple tries
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.360]   to control the coverage.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.360]   Oh, what a surprise.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.360]   Oh, shock.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.080]   Well, I mean, it's, I, I keep, I keep thinking about and not that.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:04.200]   And deciding not to write a blog post about this sort of thing only because it's just
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.200]   so much.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.200]   It just sounds like it.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:11.840]   And unfortunately, during the last round, I was, I was really, really, I don't know,
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.280]   not angry, a little bit more than more disappointed.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.280]   I get hurt.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.040]   But well, no, no, no, no, not bad.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:22.480]   I'm talking about some, some site was doing a piece on how like Apple controls the press.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.240]   And usually when people ask me about, gee, why didn't you get this earlier?
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.240]   Why whatever?
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.920]   I say, well, you know, it's not entitlement.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:28.920]   It's I'm perfectly with it.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.160]   I just do my job.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:34.400]   And so someone quoted me accurately in Twitter, but preface that by saying, and you not go
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.920]   as one of many journalists who believes that Apple uses these techniques to keep the press
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.920]   under his thumb.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.920]   Oh, I don't.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:40.920]   Oh, don't quit.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:47.360]   So anyway, so, you know, it's you're right.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.080]   It's so it's, it's, it's just childish.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:54.000]   See, I don't like I've also, I just wish I'd been able to hold it so that we could report
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.280]   on, on what it looks like.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:01.080]   Now there is a Korean or a Japanese site that has supposedly the first unboxing.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.080]   I don't know.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.080]   Vietnamese.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.360]   Yeah, would you play?
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.440]   So this Vietnamese site and it's in Vietnamese, but they apparently got the retina display.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:14.880]   And we were lucky because we, Ryan Block from GDGT was there and we had him on our coverage
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.880]   last week with, you know, and it looked pretty good even via Skype.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.880]   It looked pretty.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.080]   I just would have liked to have seen it so we could talk about it today.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.080]   We'll talk about it on Friday.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:30.420]   We're actually delaying iPad today, which normally airs on Thursday to Friday afternoon, 4pm,
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:35.400]   Pacific 7pm Eastern so that we will have our new iPads in hand and we can, we can show
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.400]   you.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.560]   This is, this is, we won't, we won't play the audio because it's in Vietnamese.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.720]   Is this credible, Leander?
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.320]   Is that, does that actually, did you watch this video?
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.320]   I think so.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.360]   I haven't seen it yet, but it's odd that a lot of leagues coming out of Vietnam, the iPhone
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.720]   4S that were interesting.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.320]   That was, that showed up first in Vietnam.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.400]   And I'd say there's a...
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.520]   Is Vietnam in between Shenzhen and San Francisco?
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:05.440]   Is it like on the way, like they maybe they fell off the boat as it was going, as it was
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.440]   steaming?
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.440]   By the way, that's the new box.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.440]   We're pretty sure because it's a, it is a different design on the box.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.880]   I think it's fairly credible when you look at it.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.160]   This is a very, very elaborate box.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.040]   Two days before people are going to get it, three days before people didn't get it for
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.040]   real.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.000]   Yeah, I wouldn't, I don't have any particular reason to doubt it.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.360]   This is a lot of work to go to if it's not.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.040]   And it looks, I gotta say, it looks good.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:35.240]   It's even on, even on a YouTube video, the quality is just, is, the text is actually
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.840]   clearer on the iPad that it is on that barcode.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.480]   Yeah, there's kind of a dent in the corner of the box though.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.000]   That's, well, it fell off the boat.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   I'm telling you.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   That's what happens.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   It happens.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   It's dense.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   It bounced.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   It's a very deep, short brief.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.440]   It really guards that we're accompanying the shipment.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.440]   Exactly.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.640]   Well, by the way, we haven't really addressed this.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.680]   And I would like to again, if I had touched, I could have perhaps, will this fit into existing
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.680]   cases?
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.880]   It depends on the case.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.680]   It's only about a millimeter thicker.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:13.160]   So if it was, if the case was designed to not great tolerances, then, and all the, and
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.560]   all the holes are in the same place.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:17.560]   Most leave.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.800]   I'm putting the camera in, I blew the camera in, might be a little bit.
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:27.240]   I was trying to look at some measurements that some people took and sent to me and trying
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.240]   to figure out what was different.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.040]   But I have to admit that when I, this, I did like a roundup of it, like a half dozen different
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.960]   iPad keyboard cases.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.440]   And the first thing I was doing was.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.440]   It's okay.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.440]   There's the two.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.440]   It's bigger.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.400]   It's a bigger hole, but it looks like it's roughly the same place.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.720]   Well, when they came out of the Verizon iPhone 4, that they moved the buttons ever so slightly
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.960]   on that.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.120]   And that didn't fit into most of the cases for the AT&T version.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:58.440]   This LTE version, they showed the LTE switch on or off.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:02.000]   But is it the case that it's only a US LTE or will this work worldwide?
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.720]   And must they wouldn't put LTE in and not have it work worldwide?
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.480]   No, it's a US only because of these different bands.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.480]   Oh, man.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.880]   I believe they said that they're going to have to have multiple devices in most markets,
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.600]   to make sure that they're compatible with the local carrier.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.600]   That's too bad.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:21.120]   Even in the US, there's the 4S was, of course, the one iPhone to rule them all, at least
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.200]   in the US.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.200]   And that's different now.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.000]   If you, the AT&T and the Verizon models are different models.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Is it wishful thinking or does this screen really look a lot better to me?
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.840]   It looks better to me, but is it wishful thinking?
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:33.840]   Am I hoping?
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.840]   Am I dreaming?
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:39.040]   Oh, looking at a, you looking at looking at a video that's streaming to your computer
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.920]   that's then streaming via Skype to my computer.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:46.120]   I can say categorically, that's the sharpest display any human has ever put on any.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.400]   I'm kind of, I'm kind of projecting, aren't I?
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.400]   But I love it.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.160]   Well, no, no, no, because we're all getting ready.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.840]   I mean, I already want to put my camera set up.
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.520]   Like, I got to make sure.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.560]   Last night I was on Amazon saying, now, do I have a good macro lens so I could really
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.520]   get good shots of the differences in resolution between these two.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.520]   Right.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.520]   Right.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:08.640]   Everybody, I know exactly what time of the Friday morning that I will be taking, uh,
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:12.880]   the taking delivery of, uh, of my iPad three.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.840]   And so it's almost as if it's going to be almost like I'll have a crime lab set up in
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.800]   the back of like a rental van so that I can go right from this meeting to the van and
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.080]   start getting forensics on this immediately.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.080]   All right.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.480]   Tim Street said, I think it was Tim Street said it on our coverage of the event.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:33.080]   I wonder what the first TV show to shoot the entire episode in on iPad three.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.920]   A little bit of music video.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:37.920]   Maybe we'll just that time on Friday.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.160]   Let's just do all our shows on an iPad, an iPad threes.
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.240]   Just we'll have to place all the cameras with iPad threes.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.240]   I'll be.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.080]   No, no, I'm not really sure.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:54.840]   I'm sure we'll see some jokers say some TV productions using that as a hook for like,
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:33:00.840]   uh, why they, why a certain character was able to shoot HD video of his point of view
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.120]   during his part of the storyline.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.720]   But yeah, that is going to be your step up.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:09.760]   I mean, one of the reasons why I have to, I have to, I have to take delivery of it and
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:16.160]   then go right to a coffee square in Boston because my standard places for doing test shots
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.320]   of anything camera related is the Boston public library.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.880]   And so I'm going to, so you're going to, you're going to see me like in Bates Hall and iPad
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:30.200]   two and then an iPad three and then it's just right with these big stupid slabs of great
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:34.320]   taking the same picture three times and then, and then a fourth time with the iPhone four
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.920]   S than a fifth time with a standard camera just so I can get an idea of how good this
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:38.920]   camera is.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:44.400]   I have very little pride when it comes to such things.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:51.520]   What according to a nine to five Mac, they got some, some artwork from the Apple store
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:56.360]   frontage from where they're people that says it'll be that the Apple stores will be opening
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.320]   at eight AM.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.720]   So you think they'll be lines?
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:06.960]   I mean, when we ordered when we preordered, you think they'll be, will there be?
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.960]   They're already lining up.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:11.960]   There are any lines?
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.960]   I have to.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.960]   I have to.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:14.960]   I have to.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.960]   Yesterday.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.960]   There's already people lining up.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.960]   Oh, wow.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.960]   That's crazy.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.920]   If you have you tried to preorder one at this point, yeah, what it's like, when do you get
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.920]   it now?
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.800]   And I think it's down to what three weeks?
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.800]   Oh, really?
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.800]   Wow.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.800]   It's a number.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.400]   A number of weeks, I believe, unless there's chances the last time I got it.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.400]   Let me just check.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.040]   I'm going to order another one.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.040]   Okay.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.040]   Select an iPad.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.040]   Okay.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.040]   By the way, the site is much more responsive than once a week ago.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.380]   What?
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:45.680]   Let's just get the 15, two to three weeks.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:46.680]   Two to three.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:49.320]   So it went very quickly from March 16th to March 19th.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:52.000]   By Saturday, it was March 19th.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.840]   And now it's a week later, it's two to three weeks.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:01.160]   And I have to think, we all have Betzlyander on how many they're going to sell in the
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:05.560]   first pre-orders, plus the first weekend.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:09.080]   And I went off in some crazy number, like 15 million.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:14.160]   But I have to think they've made quite a few this time, knowing that their demand would
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.320]   be very high.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:20.280]   So even then, it looks like they've sold out of their initial production.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.280]   Yes.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.040]   Yes, there's two guys in London in line.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.040]   There they are.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:34.920]   Ali and Zohib at the Apple Regent Street Store in London in line.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.040]   I just thought you'd want to know.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.040]   There they are.
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.040]   It's dark.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.040]   It's in there in line.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.940]   But it's not raining as well.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.120]   It probably is by now.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.480]   Folding chairs, they've got them.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.600]   Plenty of warm clothes for the London weather.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.520]   This is from slashgear.com.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:58.920]   There will be a point of pride.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.280]   I was trying to decide whether we should send a crew.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.920]   And I thought, you know, you see one apple line, you've seen them all, right?
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:09.920]   I see them on the Samsung ads every day.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.040]   Let's, you know, you should totally do that.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.480]   You should like stand outside that line with your Samsung note.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.480]   With my Galaxy Note.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.200]   We have that T-shirt.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.320]   And see how many people you can lure out of a line.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.840]   Somebody sent me a...
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.000]   They sent me, did I finally get the T-shirt that says, dude, you're a barista.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.400]   We could just borrow Tony.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.920]   They said they were going to send me one.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.160]   I think Tony stole it from me.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.160]   8 a.m.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.320]   So, but if you pre-ordered, they said you will not be in-store pickup this time.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.200]   So they're keeping all the pre-orders out of the lines.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:45.680]   So these are people who just said, I guess if you went to try to pre-order a few days
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.480]   later and you said, oh, this could be three days.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.520]   Well, I'm going to take my chances and show up.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.840]   Do you think there'll be a bunch of them in the store that you could, you know, the first
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.920]   hundred people will be sure to get one?
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.880]   What is a typical thing, Leander, on something like this?
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.920]   I think in the flagship stores, there's several hundred and they're trying to ship out maybe
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:04.720]   half a dozen, you know, to the smaller stores like the AT&T and the Verizon stores.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.160]   There'll be four in the AT&T store, at least.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.160]   Maybe five.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.400]   I'm actually getting an iPhone 4S and AT&T store.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.400]   I always do that.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.320]   So there's a line there of a good couple of dozen people.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.520]   In fact, they were doing business all day.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.320]   But when I showed up early in the morning, there was a couple of dozen people there.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.320]   Right.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:24.160]   And everyone got one at the AT&T store and it was a lot smaller line than it was at the
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.520]   Apple store, the flagship store, where it was hundreds of people.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.520]   The people are nicer at the Apple line.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:36.520]   I mean, well, I met some interesting mission characters in the AT&T line.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.800]   The Apple store line is definitely a lot more social.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:42.320]   I mean, that's definitely, you know, they got out of, it's a big, it's a big money grower.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.320]   It's a big power.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.320]   They come out, they give you ice cream.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.320]   Although, actually that was, when the iPhone first went on sale in 2007, I was like,
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:51.720]   "I waited six hours in the line here at the local AT&T in Petaluma."
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:57.080]   And the AT&T guys went next door to Cold Stone and brought us all ice cream.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.400]   And I was sitting behind two guys in a lawn chair who turned out they worked for Google
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:04.520]   Reader and they had been up all night rewriting Google Reader software to look better on the
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.680]   iPhone.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.680]   So that was pretty cool.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.520]   And I said, "What are you doing in Petaluma?"
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.520]   They said, "We're going north or something."
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.240]   And they said, "We thought we'd stop here."
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.160]   They probably figured they'd get the good one.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.520]   I don't mean this as any sort of a slide or an insult towards the iPad 3.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:25.560]   But it's sort of like the lines to get tickets for the first Star Wars prequel versus the
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.320]   lines to get in for the third one.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.160]   It's like, it had nothing to do with the quality of the product.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:34.560]   It was more like you had, there was so much pent up excitement for the first thing that
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:40.080]   did not exist before that now the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, or I could
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:45.120]   just sort of sleep or, you know, let's invoke the spiritual aspect.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:49.040]   I can say that perhaps I would be benefiting by having to wait two weeks and having it
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.800]   delivered to me when there are you.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:54.160]   Sometimes, and this has happened to me, you could just walk in like at two in the afternoon.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.840]   The lines are all gone and they're still one or two.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.000]   And I'll take that one.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.280]   It's white with 16 gigs.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.280]   Nobody wanted it.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.280]   I'll take that one.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.280]   Right.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.480]   You'll get to, I get a lot of people.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:07.400]   There's some people on Twitter who will get news about that and we'll put it into my
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.440]   hands and then hoping that I will pass along to somebody else and then not look stupid
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.440]   when I turn to God.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.440]   I made Twitter.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.440]   Yep.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.600]   Well, they're doing a better job as well.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.160]   As you said earlier, I was actually getting a meeting to man.
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.760]   I mean, one of the reasons I was, you know, this, like Andy said, there's definitely
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.680]   excitement for the first product, the first category.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.800]   But they're rolling it out in how many, like a couple dozen countries now.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.880]   It's going to be available worldwide in Lithuania, Sweden, Norway.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.360]   I know it's amazing.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.360]   And that's a massive operation.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:39.400]   I mean, it's really, really impressive because they are going to sell, I mean, undoubtedly
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.400]   tens of millions.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.080]   There's so much excitement for this one, I think.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.720]   I mean, they're going to sell so many more of these and they're going to sell the iPad
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.000]   too, even though people say, "Bare, it's just like a minor upgrade."
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.960]   It's an amazing device for a consumer device.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.600]   It's a sub $1,000 with such a beautiful screen and HD camera.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.360]   There's so much you can do with it.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.560]   And people are adding them as devices now.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:00.680]   But I think this year we're going to start seeing people using the iPad 3 as their primary
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.680]   computing device.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.680]   I agree.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.640]   There was my reaction immediately is that this, if you didn't buy an iPad one or two,
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:11.040]   you probably lucked out, this is the one that's going to change everything.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:19.280]   This is the real post-PC iPad because it finally has great camera, power, incredible
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.400]   screen, you and dictation.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:25.480]   So in many ways, all the things that we're missing for content creation are now really
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.120]   part of it, I think.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.120]   Absolutely.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.000]   Well, whenever something like this happens, I always might.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.400]   What first thought comes to mind is, "I wonder what Gene Munster of Piper Jeffery is thinking?"
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.880]   I always, that's what comes to mind.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:46.360]   Gene, of course, is waiting and he says, "Apple could sell one million iPads on the first
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.360]   day."
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.520]   That's what Gene Munster says.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.480]   So you know it's got to be true.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:55.240]   It would outstrip first-day sales figures for the original iPad and iPad 2.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:01.200]   I have to say, they will sell everyone they have.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.640]   The demand is conditioned totally by the supply.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.780]   It was the first time.
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:06.780]   It was the second time.
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:07.940]   It will be the third time.
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.840]   They sell every single unit they've got.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:11.840]   Right?
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.840]   All right.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.480]   So it's not a question, "What's the demand?"
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.480]   The question is, "How many do they make?"
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.480]   Right.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.600]   Which makes you want to ask the question, "What happens in a year or two when there might
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.400]   be more than one compelling tablet out there?"
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:30.120]   And now you have one company, Apple, that has to try to manufacture enough iPads to
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.120]   meet every single amount of demand.
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.660]   Meanwhile you've got other manufacturers that are running, that are maybe making Windows
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:41.240]   8 tablets, that can basically rent out 8 or 9 different product clients, 8 or 9 different
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.920]   plants, turning these things out.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:49.440]   So it's interesting that I was really surprised by that chart that surfaced was it four days
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.440]   ago?
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:55.400]   I know you showed me in the show notes that showed exactly how much time it takes in the
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:59.800]   product site, in the life cycle of an iPad, to order one through the Apple Store and get
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.440]   next-day shipping that if you're months afterward you're going to have to expect to wait at
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.820]   least a week to get it.
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:10.140]   And that certainly hasn't slowed down people in the past, but it is an interesting metric
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:13.340]   that there are a lot of people that aren't that passionate about.
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:18.340]   If in an alternate reality or an alternate future in which people are not passionate about
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:23.240]   getting specifically an iPad, they just desire one, are they going to be willing to wait
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.060]   a couple of weeks or three weeks to get something?
[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:29.260]   Or are they going to be more willing to pick and choose between other tablets that might
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:33.960]   have a little extra hardware feature like an SD card slot that wasn't enough to push them
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:38.040]   over the edge on their own, but I can get it right now and it has an SD card slot.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.200]   So give it to me.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:44.100]   What you're asking is how long does the Magic Pixie Dust last for Apple?
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.100]   Because it's the...
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.640]   Clearly they're using Magic Pixie Dust at this point.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.640]   No, I don't...
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:54.620]   Actually, it's magical smoke because I took one apart and hooked up to 120 volts and
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:59.880]   I just blew smoke, really beautiful, sweet-spelling, blue smoke.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:04.380]   Try to inhale if you get some of the magic in order to go magical land.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:07.200]   Yeah, the magical land of death.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.700]   Go ahead, Leander, you had something to say there.
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:13.060]   Well, the iPhone 4S, I think, you know, had it...
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:18.580]   There wasn't a big initial rush, but it's considered to sell and continues to sell at
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:19.580]   a healthy clip.
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:20.580]   Right.
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:21.580]   I think it's selling...
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:26.580]   They're still doing massive numbers of units, and even though a lot of people know that they
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.940]   can be updating it in the fall.
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:35.180]   Even though everybody said this thing is a yawn, I mean, it's really...
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:42.460]   I cannot think of a precedent for Apple, except maybe I don't know the Dutch tulip bulb run
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.540]   in the 19th century, perhaps.
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:48.820]   Or no, I'm sorry, that was the 17th century, wasn't it?
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:53.780]   That's the last time I think anything has sold this well.
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:57.620]   I'm just checking mines in Ontario, California right now.
[00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:00.900]   So it started in Shenzhen, China.
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.540]   Most of these, I think they're all being dropped shipped.
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:06.220]   Although somebody told me that hers was in Nashville, but I think that's where FedEx,
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.980]   or UPS or whoever it is, has...
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.260]   It's FedEx has a hub there, right?
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:14.180]   It used to be Memphis, I think they'd have one in Nashville now as well.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:17.500]   As we all know, for the Tom Hanks movie, Lost.
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:18.500]   Cast Away, but yes.
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:19.500]   That's right.
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.500]   That's right.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:24.020]   That's where the volleyball came from.
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:30.740]   So they say they'll have it to me by 3 p.m. Friday.
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:33.980]   I got to notice this morning saying that they tried to deliver it yesterday.
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:34.980]   No, no.
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:35.980]   I wasn't in the office.
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.860]   Well, I thought anyway, but it wasn't on the iPad.
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:43.300]   It was the smart cover that I ordered for the iPad.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.780]   Your shmite coverage here, right?
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:48.460]   That is the most depressing thing ever.
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:51.900]   Your smart cover came.
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:52.900]   Let's take a break.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:56.820]   Come back with more Leander Conny's here from the Cult of Mac.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:00.700]   You know, I know why Apple didn't invite you because of this Cult of Android thing.
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:01.700]   That's probably...
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.700]   They're probably mad about that.
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.300]   That's not making many friends for Shiloh and Apple now.
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.460]   We thought he was like an occult.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.540]   Turns out he's kind of easy.
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:13.340]   He'll join any old cult there is.
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:14.340]   Right.
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:18.540]   You didn't shave your head with an Android, I hope.
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:21.300]   Well, I haven't got any hair left, but...
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.220]   That wasn't your head, was it?
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.220]   No, no.
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:28.060]   There's some kid we played who was going to get like a thing a Nike swoosh or something.
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.820]   He was at a barbershop that's famous for doing Shaving People's Heads.
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.300]   Would you mind getting an Apple instead?
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.300]   It's very...
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:38.620]   It was, of course, on the cover of the book, the Cult of Mac book, which is...
[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.580]   That's a wonderful book.
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.340]   That's still in stores, right?
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:43.340]   It is, yeah.
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:47.380]   I've been getting pressure to update it to do a new version of it.
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:48.860]   It's a lot of work, though.
[00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:49.860]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.820]   Well, it's a historical document at this point.
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.780]   It's, well, I don't know if you should update it, to be honest.
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:46:00.660]   I think it's just a great thing to have because it's like it's all the people who are just
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:04.260]   crazy Mac fanatics.
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.060]   I love this book.
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:07.900]   It's on my coffee table.
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:08.900]   It's a good point.
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.260]   At the time, Apple had come back.
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:12.260]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.820]   And it was definitely...
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.820]   The community was a lot more cultish.
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:16.820]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:21.340]   It was a strong-eyed sense of we got a band together to help support this company and
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:22.620]   this culture.
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.260]   That's what's so changed.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:25.420]   You published that in 2004.
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.300]   That's what's so changed.
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.300]   Thanks, in great part.
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:31.500]   I think to the success of the iPhone and the iPad, it has become normal people now, are
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.500]   Apple users.
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:33.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:34.500]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.060]   That's why you and I and Andy don't get invited to these events anymore because they were not
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.060]   normal.
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.060]   We're going to take...
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:41.060]   Well, that's obvious.
[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:43.060]   I don't want to come out on that.
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.860]   We're going to take a break.
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:49.180]   Come back with more Andy and I can also hear from the Chicago Sun times and he's got Calvin
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:52.300]   and Hobbes sleeping blissfully over his shoulder.
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:53.900]   I love the pictures you put up there.
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.980]   Those are so great.
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:57.620]   Is it Berkey-breasted?
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:59.500]   How do you pronounce it?
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:00.500]   Berkey-breasted?
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:01.500]   Berkey-breasted?
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.300]   But I think you want Bill Watterson to work.
[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:05.300]   Oh, Bill.
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:06.300]   Oh, that's right.
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.300]   I confuse those, you know.
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:08.300]   Berkey-breasted did...
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.300]   Opus.
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.300]   I love the same county.
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.860]   Bloom County with Opus the Penguin.
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:14.100]   I confuse those.
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:17.300]   So is that comics?
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:20.220]   What is the name of that one?
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.380]   Bloom County?
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.060]   What are we looking at?
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:24.060]   Calvin and Hobbes.
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.060]   Calvin and Hobbes.
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:26.060]   Is that still going?
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.500]   No, it's famously not going.
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.980]   Neither of them are going.
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:34.140]   Bill Watterson ended the strip because he felt as though he had said everything he needed
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:38.300]   to say it's with the strip and that it could put it in the Tupperware, seal it up.
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:44.980]   I think the Henry's sense of humor, which is quite well developed, came from the fact
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:50.940]   that when he was about six, he read the entire works of Calvin and Hobbes.
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:56.820]   I actually subscribe to Classic Calvin and Hobbes, so I get a daily strip every day.
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.460]   And because he cleverly, he did not put any...
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.460]   No, no, no.
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.340]   There are no cell phones or no computers.
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.340]   There's nothing.
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:07.540]   The only time you get any hint that this strip was done 15 years ago instead of today was
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:10.140]   that when you see a TV that's actually three-dimensional.
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:11.820]   There's some depth.
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:13.660]   That's the only giveaway.
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:16.140]   Such a great, such a great comment.
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:19.940]   Let's talk a little bit about fresh books.
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:26.020]   Fresh books, if you're a small business owner, I'm a small businessman.
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:30.540]   You know that one of the most painful parts of your life is the end of the month when
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:33.540]   you have to invoice.
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:35.260]   This is where Fresh Books is so great.
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:38.900]   It was Amber MacArthur that told me about Fresh Books way back in 2004.
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:42.220]   Since then, three and a half million people have tried and used this service and love
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.140]   it for sending invoices.
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:45.140]   It saved my life.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.660]   It made it so easy to invoice online.
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:49.460]   Now I was invoicing US and Canadian clients.
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.380]   They handled the currency transparently.
[00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:59.220]   You can email invoices as looks like your invoice.
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:00.940]   It's got the logo and everything.
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:03.820]   You can have it printed for an additional fee and mailed.
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:08.140]   I'll tell you why we want to email them.
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:10.820]   Because there's a button on there that says, "Pay Leo."
[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:12.740]   Well, in your case, it would say, "Pay you."
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:16.740]   It would be nice if they all said, "Pay Leo," but they don't.
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:22.540]   The client presses the button and can use one of a dozen different authorization services
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:27.060]   like PayPal to pay you instantly with a credit card.
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:31.580]   I have to tell you, clients love that because frankly, it's just as much of a pain for them
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:34.860]   to go and pay the invoices as it was for you to make it.
[00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:38.620]   In fact, you can make it completely automated if you want.
[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:41.020]   It is the ultimate online invoicing app.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.580]   It saves you time, gets you paid faster.
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.980]   You can easily create invoices that look super pro.
[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:49.620]   Your clients view them online, pay you right on the spot with a credit card.
[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:52.620]   You could turn time sheets or hours.
[00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:55.300]   They have an app instantly into invoices.
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.660]   You can run all kinds of great reports to monitor your small business and your accountant.
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:00.660]   Loves you around tax time.
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:01.660]   You know what?
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:02.980]   This would be a good time to do that.
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:07.340]   This is while the pain threshold is high for April 15th.
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:10.940]   In the U.S., we pay our taxes on April 15th and it's coming up.
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:14.740]   I know a lot of you are doing a lot of small business people.
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:19.300]   They may be tall, but they're small are doing this and it's such a pain.
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:24.100]   This is the time every year that I would say, "I wish I had done a better job keeping track."
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.100]   Fresh books.
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:26.740]   Start right now.
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.500]   Automated late payment reminders follow up with clients.

[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:35.340]   complete with return envelope, the iPhone app.
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:36.540]   So cool.

[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:49.540]   Macbreak."
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:51.140]   That's all.
[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:52.140]   Sign up right now.
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:53.140]   30 days unlimited use.

[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:06.380]   taxes, it's just like, "It really changed my life when I discovered them."
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:07.380]   Freshbooks.com.
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:11.380]   They're stupid fresh.
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:13.740]   When the kids say that, that's a good thing.
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:19.460]   The kids have said that since DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.
[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:20.460]   That's how...
[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:21.460]   What is that?
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:22.460]   20 years now?
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:23.460]   30 years now.
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:26.060]   Just an understanding, Leo.
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.660]   That's true today as it was then.
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:31.660]   Parents, just don't understand.
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:33.860]   Let's see.
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:40.300]   ominous letter to Chinese iPad vendors from those good folks at ProView.
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:44.740]   Those are the people who are suing Apple saying, "We got the name iPad."
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:50.100]   It's a Hong Kong based company that says, "We've been using the iPad forever."
[00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:59.620]   They sent out a letter to Chinese iPad vendors and dealers saying that they are the legal
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:05.500]   registrant of the trademark iPad.
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:08.220]   Apple has filed an appeal following the rejection of its complaint about the registration of
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:09.660]   this trademark in China.
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.500]   We remain the only legal holder of the trademark.
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.220]   I don't know what they're saying here.
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.740]   We solemnly inform...
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.540]   I'm sorry, I'm reading it too.
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:17.780]   Happy a voice.
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:23.020]   We solemnly inform vendors and dealers, including e-distributorships of Apple iPads, including
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:24.380]   the iPad 3 in China.
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:28.780]   They should immediately stop all infringing activities like warehousing, transportation,
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.460]   mailing, concealing, etc.
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:35.500]   They shall be deemed as deliberate infringement and we will without prior notice take the most
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:38.180]   severe measures possible.
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:40.180]   You are hereby informed.
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:45.700]   Okay, I like the exclamation line.
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:48.180]   You are hereby informed.
[00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:52.380]   So is this going to put a chill now?
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:55.620]   Isn't it that they're complying with some of the distributors?
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:56.620]   Are they?
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:57.620]   Really?
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:02.220]   I thought on the previous reports that they were, that it was disrupted in the supply chain.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:03.220]   Interesting.
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:06.300]   Could be wrong.
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:15.620]   So here from CultivMac is the, "How long will it make Apple iPads to match demand chart?"
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:17.260]   Days after iPad long...
[00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:18.420]   Oh, this is good.
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:24.820]   So John Brownlee on your site did a little research and the blue line is the first generation
[00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:25.820]   iPad.
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:26.820]   So it's how many delay...
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:29.380]   Right now we are in a two week delay period.
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:31.140]   How long that lasts?
[00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:32.620]   So has he been...
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:35.620]   Does he like to just go to Apple site every day and make a screenshot?
[00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:38.540]   How did he get this?
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:41.940]   I think he's actually quoting some other sites.
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:42.940]   Okay.
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:43.940]   That's good.
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:45.500]   But yeah, they looked at the historical numbers.
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:46.500]   So this is iPadGailbreak.com.
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:47.500]   Right.
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:55.420]   And it looks at how long it took for the supplies of the first generation iPad to meet demand.
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:59.620]   And you can see there that it took like six months for it to get down to one day shipping.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:00.620]   Right.
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:02.980]   So iPad one was the worst.
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:05.500]   Before it was one day shipping, yeah, it was about 175 days.
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.140]   It got down 150 days for the iPad two.
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:09.140]   But that...
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:10.140]   I mean, that just shows you.
[00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:13.540]   I think at this point, is there any credibility to the idea?
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:15.100]   And somebody proposed this.
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:19.580]   I was doing the morning show on KFI last Friday and Bill handled their host there.
[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:23.660]   He said, "Well, doesn't Apple do this on purpose to stimulate sales?"
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:26.580]   And I said, "Bill, I think Apple would sell...
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:29.660]   Would make as many as they could because they know they could sell everything they could
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:30.660]   make.
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:33.180]   And it's just money down the tubes if you don't have them available."
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.180]   Yeah.
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.180]   Absolutely.
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:37.700]   There's no way that they're trying to hold back demand.
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:39.860]   They don't need any more publicity.
[00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:40.860]   I don't know.
[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:48.740]   And especially with the iPhone 4s, a lot of customers, there's this huge long tail.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:51.380]   All of us early adopters, we've already got our orders in.
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:56.260]   And there's going to be restricted demand for everybody, for all those other fans who
[00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:59.780]   may already have iPads and everyone who's already read and heard about it.
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:03.380]   But there's a lot more people who casually, they're out shopping on the set.
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:05.500]   They wander into the Apple Store and they want to see it.
[00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:07.660]   They want to check it out before they decide to buy it.
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:08.660]   That's probably sensible.
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:09.660]   We're just not sensible.
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:11.660]   I don't know.
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.660]   No, we have to.
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:15.660]   I tell everybody this.
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:17.780]   No, no, I have to.
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:19.060]   I do iPad today.
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:20.620]   You're a co-founder of Mac.
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:21.620]   You have to.
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:22.620]   Right.
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:23.620]   But I would do it anyway.
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:24.620]   I know I would.
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:26.660]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:32.740]   The iPad 2 wasn't a huge difference, especially since the camera was so crappy.
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:34.780]   It was just mostly faster.
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:37.420]   This is a big jump.
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:39.900]   I think it's hard to say until we've seen the screen.
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:44.220]   But I think when people see the screen, it's my sense that people are just going to gasp.
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:45.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:48.300]   It's the most visible feature of any device.
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:50.420]   What does it look like when you look at it?
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:51.860]   And there's just no.
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:56.740]   It's not a subtle difference between the iPad and whatever phone you've got in your pocket,
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:56:00.100]   whatever Kindle you've got at home.
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:02.740]   It's just right there in your face.
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:03.740]   And I agree with you.
[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:06.140]   I think that one of the reasons why this is going to be the best selling iPad ever is
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:11.980]   because it's going to capture not only the faithful iPad users who tend to buy new hardware
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:18.380]   every year and resell the old one, but there are people like me who bought the first generation
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:20.940]   and who thought that, well, the iPad 2 is nice.
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:22.460]   I do like the extra features.
[00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:27.700]   I like the extra speed, but I can't spend another $900 or $700 to replace something that's only
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:28.700]   a year old.
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:29.700]   But now there's two years old.
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:30.700]   Yes.
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:32.820]   Now that you've got these great, huge new features.
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:33.820]   Yes.
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:37.780]   You also have the other people that are going to capture, which are people who have their
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.300]   they like the iPad.
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:40.860]   They've been wanting an iPad.
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:45.540]   They've been looking for something to finally push them over the cliff and this sort of delayed
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:48.980]   reward psychology that says, ah, yes, this is why I waited.
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:50.620]   This is what proves that I'm a smart person.
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:53.420]   I waited for the 4G model with a double resolution screen.
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:59.340]   And now I shall connect my reward, which is the $500 gizmo that I can't.
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:01.140]   I love it because they didn't raise the price.
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:02.140]   I can't wait to my wife.
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:03.140]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:04.140]   Great.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:07.620]   I thought that would have been a really huge deal if they had even raised the price by
[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:08.620]   50 or 60.
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:09.620]   That was a big rumor.
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:10.620]   80 bucks more people were saying.
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:12.060]   Yeah, I didn't credit that.
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:14.260]   I, yeah, that's just not how it works.
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:15.260]   I don't know.
[00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:18.300]   I mean, I, here's one of those places where I have to remind myself that there's so many
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:20.220]   areas of business that I just have no clue on.
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:22.780]   I have to talk to people who know what they're talking about.
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:26.820]   And I could imagine a world in which they would drop the price of the iPad to down to
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:30.780]   below $399 and use that as a justification for saying we want to make sure that this
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:35.100]   is anybody who wants, we want to reach the iPad to spread to more people who couldn't
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:36.180]   afford it.
[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:42.660]   Also, we wanted a screen of very exacting specifications and as such, it forced us to
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:44.580]   raise the price to $549.
[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:48.540]   But hey, $349 iPad too, how can you, how can you be angry about that?
[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:51.940]   So I thought that was a possibility, but it would have been a really, really, I think
[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:57.580]   more than any other, any other qualm, it would have been, I think that psychologically,
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:01.140]   Apple does not like the idea of raising the price after they have established a price
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:02.140]   point.
[00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:06.060]   It's one of those little strokes of elegance that makes the iPhone so successful and the
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:07.060]   iPad so successful.
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:08.060]   It is amazing.
[00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:11.140]   They were able to get these screens with that, you know, in there and, and, and the other
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:15.940]   features like the better camera and the faster processor without increasing the price.
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:19.740]   It's, it shows how, how huge the buying power of Apple computers.
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:24.220]   I, I got to say, I mean, if you, if you look through archives of podcasts from last year,
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:29.300]   when we start talking about a double resolution iPad two, iPad three, my biggest, my biggest
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:34.060]   question mark was how can they make a screen with the same resolution as a notebook, actually
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:38.900]   exceeding the resolution of most notebook screens and still sold the line at $499.
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:42.820]   And it wasn't until I saw we still, we started seeing other bits of evidence of this being
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:47.540]   an active product that I thought, okay, I, now I believe it, but man alive.
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:51.820]   It's like, I don't think they, I don't think they haven't, there's any pixie dust inside
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:55.540]   the iPad two, because it's all being used during all of the negotiation meetings with
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:57.540]   their parts suppliers.
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:01.300]   You will not charge us $230 for this custom part.
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:03.260]   You will charge us the same price as the old book.
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:05.260]   This is the same price.
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.180]   Apple is the same as the old one.
[00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:10.020]   Apple might hit 600 bucks today.
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:15.660]   They have just, they have to share with Apple stock costs more than I've been there.
[00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:21.660]   It does now, it does now up another $13 today.
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:30.460]   $5.65, it's, this, you know, you can see right here where they announced the iPad was that
[00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:31.460]   big, big jump there.
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.060]   Oh, I have no way, let me go back to a week.
[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:35.060]   Let's look at a week here.
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:39.060]   Sorry about that.
[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:41.740]   So what it was March 7th, right?
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:43.820]   Let's see right here.
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:45.900]   And it's been going up just steady ever since.
[00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:48.540]   And it is now, I think at an all time high, is it not?
[00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:49.540]   Yeah.
[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:51.500]   All time high.
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:56.500]   It started the year ago, it was a $310 is now $565.
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:59.500]   Unbelievable.
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.500]   12 and 7/8.
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:05.500]   It's still going up with the looks of it.
[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.500]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.020]   It's just amazing.
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:15.620]   Their market cap now is more than half a billion, half a trillion dollars, $527 billion.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:18.380]   Just incredible.
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:22.820]   Moving on, AT&T is responded by adding 12 more cities to its LTE coverage.
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:27.500]   Congratulations if you're in Naples, Florida, St. Louis, Missouri, New Orleans and Baton
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:34.140]   Rouge, Bryant College, Station, Texas, Cleveland, Akron, and Canton, Ohio, Bloomington, Lafayette,
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:37.380]   and Muncie, Indiana, and Staten Island, New York.
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:44.540]   There are now 40 markets compared to the 150 plus markets that Verizon has LTE in.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.020]   What land or what is your thinking?
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:47.020]   What should you get?
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.020]   AT&T or Verizon?
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.020]   What matter?
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:50.980]   Yeah, Verizon, unfortunately.
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:51.980]   Yeah.
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:52.980]   More LTE.
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:56.940]   And they're offering free hotspotting, which is huge.
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:58.380]   And better data rates as well.
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:00.580]   You get a better, a better, a more.
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:03.540]   It's roughly a buck a gigabyte though when you get to the, you know, once you go past
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.300]   like three gigabytes.
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.340]   It's about the same for both.
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.020]   I'm sorry, 10 bucks per gigabyte.
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.020]   What was I saying?
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.020]   A buck a gigabyte.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.620]   Dream on, Leo.
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:17.260]   So five gigabytes is 50 bucks on both carriers, 10 gigabytes.
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:23.420]   Verizon offers a 10 gigabyte plan would be $80, which is $8 a gigabyte.
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:28.420]   So I guess, yeah, if you think you're going to be a big user and do not buy the 250 megabyte
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:34.580]   AT&T plan, because I don't think about three seconds to fill it up and it's cost $60 a
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:35.580]   gigabyte.
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:36.580]   Yeah.
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:41.020]   I mentioned seeing what the metrics of the 4G radio and the double screen is going to
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:42.020]   do to all your data.
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:47.020]   I thought your data charges, well, the Apple's already said that it's going to be six one
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.020]   heptas and the other.
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.020]   So I tend to.
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:50.020]   Okay.
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:54.380]   But now realize that when you download an app, you're downloading quad resolution graphics.
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:59.900]   I have to, it certainly won't affect a, certainly want to affect a webpage that hasn't been
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:02.100]   optimized for the iPad three.
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:05.940]   But I think that as we use more apps that are aware of this double resolution display,
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:11.220]   it's going to try to push down better graphics and better elements.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:14.260]   And so that might start eating up more 4G.
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:18.220]   Last night I was doing a little bit of work outside the office and I had the, the Slink
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:20.140]   catcher app on my iPad.
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:24.940]   And I just start wondering, well, what happens when this app gets updated and they start thinking,
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:29.340]   well, let's, let's, let's give them the ability to have full 1080, it's a full 720p streaming
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:31.580]   instead of just dumbing it down a little bit.
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:37.260]   And I think, I think it is more desirable feature of these apps is going to be, please
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:40.940]   try to tamp down my bandwidth usage.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:45.700]   I haven't, I haven't seen the settings, the settings box for, for the iPad three, of course.
[01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:50.220]   But I'm hoping that there is a setting so you can say, please restrict me to 3G networks,
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:54.180]   just like on other devices, you can say, please restrict me to just edge networks too.
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:59.940]   You can, you can, in fact, according to that Vietnamese video, turn LTE off.
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:02.140]   I don't know if you would turn 3G off.
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:06.380]   I mean, you can turn it off, but I don't know if you could say edge only, but you can turn
[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:07.380]   off LTE.
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:14.740]   I just got a notice from AT&T that I'm over my monthly bandwidth allocation.
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:17.740]   And I looked into it and I was like, you know, I haven't been downloading that much stuff.
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:20.420]   No, it's now, it happens at a gigabyte and a half now.
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:22.740]   Well, the problem was I was uploading.
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.500]   Yeah, well, that all counts too.
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:31.220]   Uploads from iCloud backup and it's, you know, 180, 220 megabytes a time.
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:37.220]   And it's, let's turn this over to 3G network, even when I'm at home with Wi-Fi.
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.220]   Right.
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:40.420]   There's some, yeah, there's some glitch.
[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:45.380]   I just, I'm looking into this now, but it looks as though there's some glitch, I think.
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:50.660]   In the settings, there's a default, there's an option that's turned on by default, upload
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.540]   over 3G networks.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:58.620]   And apparently, I guess there's some bug it, it uploads to iCloud over 3G, even if you're
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:03:59.980]   on a Wi-Fi network.
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:00.980]   Hmm.
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.980]   So I, I used to.
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:03.980]   That's very frustrating.
[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:08.340]   2 gigabytes a day on a week, just doing iCloud backups.
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:09.820]   Hmm.
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:13.900]   So there's another reason we're bandwidth is going to get eaten up.
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.500]   I wonder if this is going to bite AT&T in the butt.
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:20.860]   Now that they're clamping down on heavy users, really, the reason why I'm sticking with AT&T
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:25.700]   is chiefly because I got great, I got great AT&T coverage in my, in my house.
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:28.700]   So that's really the, one of the big steals.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:33.780]   But if they start making my unlimited package almost useless by making sure that the closer
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:38.300]   I get to two or three gigs, the more they're going to tamp down my speed, now you start
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:42.420]   telling me that, well, next time, next time you buy an iPad or next time you're going
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:46.140]   to be renewing your contract, maybe you should consider switching over to Verizon because
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:50.700]   that is the reason why they've got me as a customer right now.
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:54.380]   The Department of Justice is a little unhappy.
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:05:01.380]   You know, I'm curious what they're, they're, they're warning Apple and publishers about
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.020]   colluding on ebook pricing.
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:07.220]   Where Apple said they're going to be 15 bucks cheap.
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:12.780]   So the Department of Justice is weighing in saying, no, no, you can't have a cheap,
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.020]   fixed price.
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:20.500]   Now I agree, price collusion is bad, but isn't it usually bad when it's colluded to be higher?
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:24.380]   When you're colluding for a lower price isn't, shouldn't they get out of that?
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:25.980]   Shouldn't they stay away from that?
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:26.980]   Colluding to the illusion.
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:27.980]   Colluding to that, son.
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:32.820]   Well, I mean, it's technically, I guess it's illegal, but well, because what is the harm?
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:40.340]   Well, the reason the public says the central complaint here is that Amazon was actually
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:45.500]   selling Kindle editions of books for less than what it caused them to acquire them.
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:49.820]   So and if you have a huge work chest like Amazon has, you can do that and spend, you
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.660]   know, eat it for a year or two.
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:54.380]   And the interest of making sure you always have the cheapest books and you will capture
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:57.380]   as many customers as possible and lock them into your format.
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:00.380]   And then you're free to start checking up the prices three or four years later once you
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:01.380]   develop the iTunes.
[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:03.380]   So it's like price-delling kind of.
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:04.380]   Right.
[01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:10.340]   So Steve Jobs was his point was that he wanted favorite nation status with everybody saying
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:14.900]   that if you're going to sell a book for 10 bucks on Barnes and Noble.com or Kindle.com,
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:16.780]   you have to sell it for 10 bucks here too.
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:20.620]   And that sort of insisted upon the agency pricing model where the agency sets the price
[01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:21.820]   of all these titles.
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:26.020]   So there's, it really depends on what, what, what poison you think is going to be a little
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:32.540]   easier to take as a consumer would you rather have a system in which Amazon can do something
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:37.220]   like that where you will be able to buy a book for 799 instead of 1299.
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:42.580]   But it also means that if there is a smaller publisher who wants to try to give you a better
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:47.100]   deal, like simply say, we will make sure that whatever DRM format you want to, you want
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:52.220]   to use your use on, on your device, we will support you for that or we will be a more
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:56.980]   author oriented sales force, all these different things they could differentiate themselves
[01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:01.140]   from a franchise on from do would you rather those companies be able to get a fair shake
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:05.260]   because they can afford to, they can still sell these books at a price that everybody
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:06.580]   else is going to get them at.
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:12.420]   Or do you, as so many people have that disconnect for this, does it kind of honk you off that
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:18.900]   you're buying a package of electrons and spending $19 for it and it's just like $4 less than
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:19.900]   the hardcover price.
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:24.620]   And it's actually, in some cases, even a dollar more than what you can order the hardcover
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:30.780]   from on Amazon sometimes because of the discounting that happens with the hardcover versus the
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:33.740]   discounting that can't happen on electrons.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:36.300]   So I really don't know which one I support here.
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:39.620]   I do see the appeal of both options.
[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:42.900]   The smoking gun is in the Isaacson biography.
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:43.900]   Yeah.
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:48.780]   Steve Jobs said, we told the publishers, we'll go to the agency model, as you said, Andy,
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:52.900]   where we set the price, or I'm sorry, where you set the price, publisher set the price,
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.060]   and we get our 30%.
[01:07:55.060 --> 01:08:02.100]   And yes, Jobs said, the customer pays a little more, but that's what you want anyway.
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:05.820]   And that's exactly the contention in the Department of Justice says that Apple and publishers
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:09.300]   acted in concert to raise prices across the industry.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:13.540]   So these $15 textbooks aren't really the issue.
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:17.660]   The issue is the agency model.
[01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:20.660]   Is that right?
[01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:24.380]   It's not even like the religious aspect of having the agency model.
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:26.940]   It really is the Fair Harbor position.
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:27.940]   Right.
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:28.940]   Fair.
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:30.100]   And acting jointly to raise prices.
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:36.220]   I mean, if you all agree, I'll charge $60 if you charge $60.
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:38.060]   Then that's it.
[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.260]   That's not a free market.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:46.220]   As somebody who has a broken nose himself, I am offended by your bigoted appraisal of
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:51.020]   people who have a slight kink in their nose because they lead an active lifestyle.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:55.380]   The chief joined advertisers and calling for a boycott.
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:56.380]   You're a slut.
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:57.380]   But don't be your...
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:01.100]   William Lynch, the chief executive of Barnes and Noble gave a deposition of the Justice
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:02.100]   Department.
[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:05.060]   This is according to the Wall Street Journal in which he testified that abandoning the agency
[01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:10.060]   pricing model would effectively result in a single player gaming even more market share
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:13.580]   than it has today.
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:18.700]   Prior to agency pricing, Amazon often sold best selling digital books for less than it
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:21.380]   paid for them.
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:22.380]   That was...
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:24.820]   Remember, it was $9.99 best sellers on the Kindle.
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:30.300]   But you also noticed that Amazon still has the lion's share of all digital book sales.
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.860]   iBook still has the smallest library.
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:36.220]   I don't think Apple is really sharing numbers on how many they're selling.
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:37.220]   But I don't see it.
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:40.740]   I don't know any analysts who thinks that the iBook store is being competitive in selling.
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:45.980]   So this might all be just an academic exercise than anything else.
[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:51.260]   It's also a philosophical one when you talk about is it okay that Amazon is locking people
[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:56.260]   into one DRM standard with all the titles that they buy given that they have just proven
[01:09:56.260 --> 01:10:00.340]   that if I prove to them that there is more than like two millimeters of silicone in this
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:04.660]   watch, they will produce a Kindle reader that will work on this wristwatch.
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:08.140]   I can't think of any device that I have that's rechargeable and has a screen that there isn't
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:09.140]   a Kindle reader for.
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:13.100]   I have a crap one that I have a recharge in nine months.
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.100]   It's fairly complicated.
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:19.500]   Apparently, there are settlement negotiations going on and there's different...
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:23.460]   The thing that would really get up everybody's nose though is if Random House decided to
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:27.900]   do a deal where congratulations, the next Hunger Games book is going to be Kindle exclusive
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:29.460]   for four months.
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:35.420]   Or what they used to do, which is to delay the release of the digital book for several
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:39.500]   months to make sure that the hardcover gets some breathing room and gets exclusivity to
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:40.820]   the market for a couple of months.
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:43.780]   They seem to have backed down from that almost completely.
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:48.700]   I think they realized that taking money from people who want to pay them for things is probably
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:50.260]   good for business.
[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:54.860]   If only other industries like the movie industry would be as welcome to, again, taking people's
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:59.180]   money who wants to give them.
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:04.140]   Good article if you want to get the details by Thomas Catan and Jeffrey Tractenberg in the
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:07.500]   Wall Street Journal technology section on March 9th.
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.780]   That's where we're getting this story.
[01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:14.140]   Did you follow this open street map?
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:21.140]   When we showed, Apple showed at the iPad announcement how iPhoto would map your stuff.
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:28.260]   The beautiful looking retro-styled maps turns out the data is two-year-old, not even recent,
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:31.940]   two-year-old data from OpenStreetMap, which is a wonderful service.
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:38.500]   I hope that the outcome of all of this is that OpenStreetMap.org becomes better known.
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:44.140]   The OSM Foundation wrote a very positive, upbeat piece that Apple's great.
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:45.140]   They support open source.
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:46.100]   They give back to the open source.
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:51.140]   They probably just forgot to mention that they got it from us, but they did.
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:55.220]   We expect them at some point to come into compliance with our license, which says if
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:59.300]   you use our data, you've got to tell people you're using our data.
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:03.220]   The data is created by 400,000 volunteers.
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:07.180]   I'm one of them who you sign up if you've got a GPS, even if you don't, you can go in
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:10.260]   sign up correct maps of an area that you know.
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:13.380]   You can use your GPS drive around and add to the maps.
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:19.140]   It's a really great system, and it's free as long as you credit OSM to use.
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:23.100]   That's why 4-square is using it now instead of Google Maps, and it's presumably why Apple
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:26.100]   is using it as well.
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:29.220]   Still no word for Apple on all of this.
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:32.380]   I do hope that they give them credit.
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:38.100]   I have 17 pages of credits on the iPhone if you go to the About screen, and there's
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:44.740]   a credit menu I think that runs to...
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:45.740]   It's a lot.
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:46.740]   A lot, yeah.
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.540]   Do they mention OSM in there?
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:50.100]   I haven't looked.
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.100]   Who's read it?
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:56.100]   I presume that the OSM Foundation before they blog this looked.
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:13:01.500]   They probably just did a text search.
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.740]   Class action lawsuit against Siri.
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:06.500]   This is funny.
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:10.660]   Siri, what do you think of the court system?
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:11.660]   Whoops.
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:13.860]   I clicked the link and I got this.
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:15.100]   I don't know what this is.
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.260]   Chinese something.
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:18.020]   Is that malware?
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:19.020]   Chinese malware?
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.020]   No.
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:21.780]   It just was what came up.
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:24.180]   Oh no, that's a link that I posted.
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:25.260]   Oh, you did that.
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:26.260]   You did that to iTunes.
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:28.260]   Did I paste it into the wrong?
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:29.260]   Yes.
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.260]   Sorry, this is something.
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:32.740]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:34.220]   You clicked underneath it.
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:37.700]   You clicked underneath the Class Action lawsuit thing.
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:41.020]   That's the holes in app security, Chinese apps, blah, blah, blah.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:42.180]   This is the story.
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:46.540]   I was thank you, Andy, and we'll get to that next story in a bit.
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:53.380]   A New York man is suing Apple saying that the advertising on Siri is false, misleading,
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:54.980]   and deceptive.
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:59.860]   In many of Apple's TV advertisements, individuals are shown using Siri to make appointments,
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:05.060]   find restaurants, even learn the guitar chords to classic rock songs, or how to tie a tie.
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:08.580]   All of these tests are done with ease in the TV commercials.
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:11.300]   This is not my experience.
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:15.300]   Siri either did not understand what the plaintiff was asking or after a very long wait time
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:17.860]   responded with the wrong answer.
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:27.100]   So I'm thinking that Mr. Fazio here, Frank M. Fazio, might have a strong accent.
[01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:28.460]   He says it's unusable.
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:36.660]   I think he'd say he'd be willing to settle this for her $20 Chipotle burrito card.
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:41.540]   I'm Frank Fazio, and I cannot use Apple Siri.
[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:43.580]   It does not seem to understand me.
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:46.700]   I'll tell you, I would love to see Dick D. Bartolo try to use Siri.
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:52.860]   Hey, Siri, how you doing?
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:56.180]   I have to admit, Siri is far from perfect.
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:58.860]   In fact, a little bit of a disappointment, especially when I try to dictate, it always
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:00.220]   seems to just give up.
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:02.060]   I get a lot more often than I'd like to.
[01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:06.580]   I'm sorry I really would like to help you, but I can't right now.
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:09.740]   But I don't think they make, well, the ads might be it.
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:10.740]   I don't know.
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:12.460]   The ads are, let's face it, the ads are misleading.
[01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:18.620]   There's a super funny spoof video of Siri TV where people are trying to control a Siri
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:19.620]   control television.
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:21.820]   It goes wrong pretty quickly.
[01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:24.700]   It's exactly, I think, most people's experience of it.
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:30.140]   Siri is really good for simple tasks, like calling people and setting reminders and maybe
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:31.140]   setting up calendar dates.
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:32.900]   But it goes wrong once, goes wrong twice.
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:37.340]   And then you're like, it's easier to just go and do it with your fingers.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:42.620]   The Rock God is one of the ads that has been airing lately.
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:44.620]   I got to get a guitar.
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:47.420]   I found 12 musical instrument stores.
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:48.900]   How do I play London calling?
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:49.900]   Pull out a love?
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:51.660]   I'll be minor ninth.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:53.380]   I found this for you.
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:56.020]   I mean, it does do that.
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:59.260]   But not as quickly or reliably as the atom.
[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:03.900]   You do have a certain obligation and ad to kind of represent reality, don't you?
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:04.900]   Oh, no.
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:07.700]   It's not called advertising.
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:08.780]   They're still calling it a beta.
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:14.140]   Although it isn't interesting that I believe this is a new feature of iOS 5.1 that Siri
[01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:15.740]   now has a way.
[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:19.340]   You have those pulsating three dots as it's thinking about something.
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:26.300]   Now if it can't get an answer for you, sometimes when you say you use speech to text and will
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:29.900]   just not give you anything, the last thing it does is it doesn't give you the same thing
[01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:34.300]   as go from fang, fang, fang, it will just fade those three dots out.
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.700]   I didn't notice that behavior in previous editions.
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:40.100]   That seems to be its way of subtly saying, I don't know.
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:41.100]   Sorry.
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.300]   I get that a little too much.
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.700]   I'll be honest, I hardly use Siri anymore.
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:48.740]   And this is like, this is not, you know, it's kind of what I thought would happen.
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:54.900]   At first I thought, oh no, Siri really is going to work.
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:58.340]   I still use it for speech to text.
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:03.140]   It hasn't gotten over that hump where I can really guess as to the sort of answers that
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:06.340]   it will know as opposed to not know, I was surprised.
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:08.740]   Two days ago I was cooking a pork tenderloin.
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:14.140]   I vaguely remembered that the food and safety question had lowered the safe temperature
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:15.660]   for pork.
[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:18.660]   And so it's, oh, the great, this is exactly the sort of number thing that Wolfram Alpha
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:22.500]   would know is like, Siri, what is the safe cooking temperature for pork?
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:26.180]   And the only thing it could do is like send me on a web search, which surprised me because
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:27.380]   it involves a number.
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:29.140]   It's an easy phrase.
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:35.660]   So I think that the next wager shouldn't be how many iPads are going to be sold in the
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:36.660]   first week.
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:40.660]   It's going to be how much time is going to lapse before Apple takes the beta tag off
[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:41.660]   of Siri.
[01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:46.100]   I think it's going to be a while before it gets so good that they can proudly say that
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:49.540]   this is as good as any other piece of software that Apple makes.
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:53.740]   We've collected all the data we need to collect about how people use the service to really
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:56.300]   lock down what it should be doing.
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:18:00.780]   Let's briefly talk about 5.1 and then we're going to get our picks of the week and our
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:02.620]   tips and so forth.
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:09.020]   iOS 5.1 came out at the same time as they announced the new iPad, iPhone and iPad.
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:12.780]   One change we immediately noticed that Colin, somebody, I think it was Colin came running
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:18.300]   over to me during our thing and saying, look, I get 4G now on AT&T.
[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:19.300]   Not really.
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:20.300]   It's still HSPA.
[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:26.060]   They just decided instead of naming it HSPA plus the same as HSPA, they gave it 4G.
[01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:27.060]   It's not really 4G.
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:33.020]   It's 14 megabits, which is not even close to 4G.
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:34.020]   It depends.
[01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:38.740]   The odd thing about the 4G designation, and this is something I learned last year as I
[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:43.460]   was trying to figure out the technology myself, is that it's not quite so much.
[01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:50.620]   The governing body that hands out that designation, they have it designated as if it has this
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:54.540]   technology, this technology, this technology supports these bandwidths.
[01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:59.380]   Know if you are doing something that's substantially faster than what the standards defined by
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:02.940]   3G can do, it's okay to call it 4G.
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:04.940]   Although it's not something.
[01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:11.900]   Yeah, I mean, it's such an odd thing for Carrier to do that, yes, this use of 4G is
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:13.540]   starting to raise a lot of eyebrows.
[01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:14.540]   Yeah.
[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:18.620]   If you look at Wikipedia, it says 4G is 100 megabits down, and that's nothing in the
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.860]   US is even close to that.
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:26.060]   This is the thing you're talking about, it's a press release actually, that came from the
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:29.500]   International Telecommunications Union last December.
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:33.100]   Actually two December's ago, December 2010.
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:40.580]   Other evolved 3G technologies can be named 4G as long as they provide a substantial level
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:45.060]   of improvement in performance and capabilities compared to the current 3G.
[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:46.780]   So I guess it's 4G.
[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:50.700]   Yeah, but me too.
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:52.740]   But it's like Elvis's black belt.
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:53.900]   Yes, it's a black belt.
[01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:57.460]   Yes, he was awarded to the rules, you're supposed to be awarded a black belt, but everybody
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:02.140]   who sees you wearing that black belt is going to say, "Uh, you get."
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:06.060]   Is black belt and his FBI badge?
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.460]   Yeah.
[01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:12.540]   So what else is new in, if I want, the Siri little dot thing is different.
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.740]   Is that really cool camera button on the lock screen?
[01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:15.740]   I love that.
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:19.940]   So before you unlock your iPhone, you'll see a camera, I guess it's on the iPad too, you
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:23.340]   see a camera button, and if you press that, the camera app launches.
[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:24.420]   That's something that Windows--
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:25.820]   Swipe it up, right.
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:29.580]   Windows Phone 7 added, which was great.
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:34.980]   The ability to take a picture right from the lock screen and now Apple is doing that.
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:40.580]   They also changed the camera, finally changed the camera app on the iPad so that the shutter
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:44.340]   button is actually probably where your thumb is going to be while you're holding it.
[01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:48.700]   So I think that the previous position really sold a lot of iPads because it would definitely
[01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:51.580]   drop it while you're trying to take a picture.
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:52.780]   It should be where your thumb is.
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:53.780]   And it moves.
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:57.500]   If you rotate it, it stays in the same position.
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:02.260]   They've also added the ability to recognize more than one face at a time.
[01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:04.700]   So it's kind of cool if you point it at multiple people.
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:06.700]   It goes, "Cha, cha, cha."
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:08.300]   What else?
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:17.020]   iTunes Match, Genius Bixes and Genius Playlists are back, supposedly, optimized in quotes
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:19.540]   audio for movie and TV shows.
[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:23.100]   They should sound both louder and clearer.
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:30.300]   Podcast controls for rewinding and playback speed.
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.300]   That's nice.
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:35.420]   If you can't fast-forward, kids, don't try it.
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:39.900]   Don't-- I see you trying to skip that commercial, do not.
[01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:43.140]   But you can rewind if you want to hear the commercial again, which is always nice.
[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:47.780]   It was an over-the-air update, which I liked, came in fairly quickly.
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:52.620]   Anything else-- Oh, you can delete a picture from iCloud.
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:53.860]   The photo stream from photo stream.
[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:55.420]   But it only deletes it on that device, right?
[01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:59.060]   So the picture of your bottom that's on that device still is on the screen saver on the
[01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:00.060]   big screen TV.
[01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:04.100]   So you got to go in by hand, so to speak.
[01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:05.100]   Is that right?
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:08.020]   It doesn't delete it from the cloud.
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:09.020]   I'm not sure.
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:10.020]   I think it's--
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.020]   I don't know either.
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:12.020]   Don't know.
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.020]   Sorry.
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:21.660]   Because when the new OS comes out, we all try out the new features that relate to what
[01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:22.980]   we like to do.
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:28.740]   I've unplugged the connection to my screen, so I'm going to check right now.
[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:32.660]   You can't see it.
[01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:35.540]   Apple is rapidly approaching $568 right now.
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:37.980]   I'm in exactly that same position with you.
[01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:38.980]   I'm reviewing iPhoto.
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:42.220]   And now it has that bookshelf view of your photos.
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:45.220]   And unfortunately, from one of my-- it's all fine.
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:50.180]   I can use it as a screenshot except for one of these albums of shot pictures.
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:55.700]   It shows as it's thumbnail one personal picture that I can't post publicly.
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:57.380]   That's not like nude or anything like that.
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:23:01.620]   It's just like I don't want people to-- people should not be interested in my personal life.
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:06.580]   It's like, oh, so I'm going to have to do something special to weird this out and edit
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:09.740]   it just because you randomly decided to-- oh.
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:12.100]   Yeah, there's actually quite a bit of stuff on here.
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:14.060]   It's probably just to surely just spark-flap.
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:17.460]   Why must Andy not always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop?
[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:18.620]   My photos-- well, wait a minute.
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:19.620]   I just updated.
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:20.620]   Did it delete?
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:23.580]   Because I have-- for instance, I have a business card in here with a phone number on
[01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:24.580]   it that I really don't.
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:26.380]   And I show stuff all the time on the screen.
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:28.420]   So it's actually been a problem on iPad today.
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:33.540]   I have to be very careful about launching my photo library.
[01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:35.540]   I think it has deleted these.
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:38.420]   And that was what it added.
[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:40.580]   I was just looking it up here on my iPhone.
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:41.580]   So in 5.1.
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:45.780]   Before 5.1, it didn't-- it deleted it on your device, but it didn't delete it from photos.
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:47.260]   Now it deletes it globally.
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:48.420]   Yeah, both, yeah.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:49.420]   Oh, hallelujah.
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:50.940]   Look at that.
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:51.940]   I think it did do it.
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:53.500]   Oh, that's great.
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.500]   Yeah, that's been a problem.
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.500]   Oh, there's another one.
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:23:59.500]   Oh, dear.
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:00.500]   Oh, no.
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:01.500]   I thought I deleted the-- oh, my.
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:03.500]   Been a problem, hallelujah.
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:04.500]   Wow.
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:07.100]   OK, well, let me just close that on an iPhone.
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:08.740]   We'll keep working on it.
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:10.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:14.300]   They look too much information.
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:17.660]   Let's see here.
[01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:18.660]   Anything else at 5.1?
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:21.220]   Did we miss anything else that happened?
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:23.180]   Siri for Japan, what we already did that.
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:27.300]   Siri for Japan, which apparently is according to some, not so good.
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:28.300]   It's struggling.
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:29.660]   Listen, let's not judge too harshly.
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:31.460]   I can't really understand Japanese very well either.
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:32.460]   Right, so how would you know?
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:35.900]   Before I go to Casting Stones, right?
[01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:38.300]   I had a great reputation when it was an app.
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:40.460]   Before Apple bought it, when it was an app.
[01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:41.460]   Right.
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:43.140]   There were a lot of people that really loved it.
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:44.460]   And it did a lot more things.
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:46.620]   It tied into, like, I think about a dozen--
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:48.260]   Yeah, you could make it open table.
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:49.780]   And yeah, it was cool.
[01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:50.780]   Yeah.
[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:53.500]   And the DARPA Agency behind it, so they
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:56.820]   got an even more advanced version of Siri in the labs that
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:25:00.140]   can reason and ask questions.
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:02.020]   And I'm bomb Iran.
[01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:04.220]   And it would just do it.
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:06.500]   No, that was a joke.
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.780]   That was a joke.
[01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:10.820]   Please, to our Iranian listeners, I was joking.
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:15.460]   iTunes 10.6 adds the option to sync 192 kilobits and 256
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:17.860]   kilobits quality audio to your devices.
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:21.100]   So for those of you who have 64 gigabyte devices,
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:22.860]   you don't have to shrink it down anymore.
[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:26.340]   Well, that's specifically what they did was--
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:29.180]   it could always sync higher bit rate files.
[01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:32.180]   We're talking about the special feature in options where
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:34.100]   if you actually have a lower capacity--
[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:34.980]   Right, right.
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:37.300]   --and you're creating a few more options in that.
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:37.820]   Exactly.
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:42.380]   So if you've got a 320k file, it will drop it down to not just--
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:44.900]   you used to only have the option of dropping it down to 28.
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:46.900]   Now, go to a distance of about--
[01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:50.700]   Tim Cook showing his confidence in the health of Apple
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:52.940]   has just cashed in $11 million in Apple stock.
[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:54.460]   Actually, that's nothing.
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:56.980]   I know, it's peanuts, why not?
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:26:02.900]   You know, he was given a million shares in August
[01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:04.820]   just to give you some idea.
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:05.660]   Is that the hotel?
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:06.780]   He ordered a Denver omelet.
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:08.460]   He realized he didn't have enough money for a tip.
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:09.860]   I did a couple million.
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:12.140]   Cashed in some pocket change for stock.
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:15.660]   So is his million shares currently valued more than half
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:16.900]   a billion dollars?
[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:21.740]   So he took $11 million.
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:23.740]   Big deal!
[01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:25.500]   Tim, enjoy.
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.460]   Have an extra cup of coffee on me.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:32.980]   Fiber optic thunderbolt coming later this year.
[01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:34.940]   Remember, the thunderbolt was originally called light peak
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:37.620]   because it used fiber optic, and then they couldn't get it to work.
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:38.900]   They could only get it to work with copper,
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:41.860]   so they renamed it to thunderbolt because they can't call it light peak
[01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:42.740]   because it wasn't using light.
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:43.900]   Well, now it's going to use light again.
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:51.260]   According to Intel, that fiber optic thunderbolt cables
[01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:54.340]   will launch later this year.
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:55.820]   That just means you can do it farther.
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:57.940]   Tens of meters instead of six meters.
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:00.100]   It doesn't mean it faster.
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:03.420]   It's already as fast as you could ever possibly want.
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:07.860]   You want it faster, Leander?
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:09.220]   We'll make it faster for you.
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:13.300]   I know, Bi-Moth hasn't been an issue, has it, for years?
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:14.140]   No.
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:15.500]   With external devices.
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:16.340]   Yeah.
[01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:17.180]   Remember, it used to be a big deal.
[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:19.700]   We're faster than the drives, aren't we?
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:24.460]   But there are people like Alex Lindsey who are pumping so much data
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:25.740]   that they need more.
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:33.340]   Safari 5.14 update has an 11% JavaScript performance boost
[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:35.540]   and fixes bugs.
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:40.940]   You will have to be running Lion or Snow Leopard to get it.
[01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:43.020]   Came out Monday via software update.
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:49.420]   Allow cookies set during this is a new feature.
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:50.660]   I don't know what this is good for.
[01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:53.140]   Allow cookies set during regular browsing
[01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:55.660]   to be available after using private browsing.
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:28:01.620]   Then just another little feature here.
[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:03.140]   All right, we're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:07.500]   An iOS tip, a Lion tip, product picks, and more.
[01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:08.700]   Stay here.
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:11.380]   Leola Port with Leander County of CultivMac.
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:14.340]   Mr. Andy Inato from the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:18.220]   Alex Lindsey is on assignment helping homeless people in Austin.
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:23.100]   This show brought to you by our friends at Pond 5,
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:25.460]   the world's stock media marketplace.
[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:30.380]   But, you know, I had not heard about Pond 5
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:32.900]   until they approached us and said, you know, do you know about it?
[01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:35.780]   And I said, no, and I am blown away.
[01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:40.900]   If you make presentations, if you need stock photos for your website,
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:43.260]   I love how every blog post should have an image.
[01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:46.580]   If you need music tracks for your video or sound effects,
[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:50.660]   or how about motion graphics templates, this is an amazing,
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:53.540]   amazing marketplace of stock media.
[01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:56.740]   Now, a million video clips, 5,000 new ones this week,
[01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:58.020]   put them over a million.
[01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:03.780]   7.6 million photos, 689,000 illustrations,
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:08.220]   104,000 music tracks, 212,000 sound effects,
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:10.580]   1,630 after effects projects.
[01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:12.860]   And there's always new stuff because, by the way,
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:17.860]   media creators love Pond 5 because you set your own price.
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:20.780]   Pond 5 uses the agency model.
[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:23.420]   It's a dynamic marketplace where you upload your content,
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:26.940]   set your price, and get industry leading royalties on every sale.
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:30.460]   So you're helping the media creators when you buy a Pond 5.
[01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:31.980]   And boy, look at all searches.
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:35.540]   Here's this week's free stock footage.
[01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:38.780]   Every week you should go every week and just visit,
[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:40.140]   because they have free footage.
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:41.060]   Look at these eels.
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:43.580]   Now, we'll just add that to your movie.
[01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:44.420]   I don't know why.
[01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:47.620]   Just, you know, anytime you've got a skateboarding flick
[01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:50.140]   and just stick some eels in,
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:53.260]   and people, you know, it just makes it so much more professional.
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:54.660]   Can I buy the lion here?
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:55.860]   Oh!
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:57.940]   Look at that.
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:30:00.060]   I'm a little bit hungry.
[01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:02.620]   Oh, look, there's an apple user.
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:04.020]   I think I'll eat him.
[01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:07.100]   Pond 5. Now, here's a deal.
[01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:10.220]   But, you know, probably people have gone out and bought stuff
[01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:12.740]   like the lion or the eel, and I forgot to tell you,
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:14.260]   we got a deal.
[01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:18.420]   On checkout, use Twitch25, TWIT25,
[01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:21.020]   and you'll get 25% off your purchase this month.
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:23.180]   Twitch25.
[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:26.740]   So, P-O-N-D5.com, the world's stock media marketplace.
[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:28.700]   Really, you know, if you've been using the other guys,
[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:29.540]   this is the one.
[01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:30.380]   Check it out.
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:31.620]   I cannot believe how much great stuff,
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:32.980]   the sound effects and stuff.
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:35.500]   And they let you look at it all, which is kind of nice.
[01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:36.860]   Here's a lion roaring.
[01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:37.700]   Let's see.
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.700]   (snoring)
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:42.540]   Oh, my god.com.
[01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:44.580]   See, they put a little watermark in there, so.
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:46.220]   And then there's the Twilight Terror.
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:49.620]   Ooh!
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:50.620]   Ooh!
[01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:51.620]   Okay, except for something.
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:52.460]   Isn't that great?
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:53.460]   I just love all these.
[01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:54.460]   It's so fun just to browse around.
[01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:56.460]   (whistling)
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:57.460]   Pond 5.
[01:30:57.460 --> 01:31:01.180]   Thunderstorm.
[01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:05.660]   They're not pond 5.
[01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:07.060]   That expensive, they're like two bucks.
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:12.220]   Yeah, they're, I'm telling you, I'm going to start adding sound effects to every blog post.
[01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:13.220]   Forget the picture.
[01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:14.220]   (laughing)
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:15.220]   You know what I was supposed to do?
[01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:16.220]   (laughing)
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:17.220]   That's great!
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:18.220]   That's the voice cuts.
[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:20.220]   I learned that if you time how long it takes
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:23.660]   between the Thunderclap and the Pond5.com logo,
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:24.660]   you can find it on our way.
[01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:25.660]   And multiply it by seven, right?
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:27.660]   Seven miles per second.
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:29.660]   (laughing)
[01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:30.860]   Oh, that's getting closer.
[01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:32.860]   (laughing)
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:34.660]   We really should take cover now.
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:35.660]   Listen to the...
[01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:36.740]   Last night was very windy around here.
[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:38.740]   I recorded this out my window.
[01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:39.740]   Pond5.
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:41.380]   I don't know.
[01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:42.380]   (whistling)
[01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:44.500]   I'm sorry.
[01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:47.140]   I get always, I might start playing with this side.
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:48.140]   I can't stop.
[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:54.820]   Pond5.com, 25% off, use the offer code TWIT25.
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:55.820]   (sighing)
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:59.260]   Do we want to do an iOS tip?
[01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:02.740]   Normally we have Alex do that, but he's not here.
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:03.740]   So we could skip it.
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:04.940]   We did just talk about iOS 5.
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:06.660]   One, we talked about three great things.
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:09.980]   When he gave a tip, watch the little fingers on Siri.
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:12.940]   How about an OS 10 tip, Mr. Andy Nunko?
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:16.540]   Actually, this is a really cool one that I had never even known about until I read about
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:19.540]   it on the OS 10 daily site.
[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:22.340]   Apparently, how many times are you looking at a site?
[01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:27.620]   You want to share it with front of yours via email so you can highlight copy paste.
[01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:30.220]   Actually in Safari, all you have to do is hit command.
[01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:34.460]   All you have to do is hit command shift I and it will...
[01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:38.980]   Lion will automatically create a brand new email with the subject line containing the
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:42.940]   title of that webpage and with the URL in the body of the email.
[01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:43.940]   It's so perfect.
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:49.940]   It works in no matter what web client, excuse me, whatever client you're using for email
[01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:53.460]   and the tip in the OS 10 daily also says that it works in Chrome as well.
[01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:57.540]   I only tested it out in Safari and it was one of those things where how come I've had
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:01.700]   this version of this offer for so long and I've been doing things the hard way for so
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:04.020]   long without knowing about this.
[01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:07.500]   So I definitely want to keep the tip of that OS 10 daily because that's a really cool one.
[01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:08.740]   It really is.
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:09.740]   Yeah.
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:11.980]   I do that all the time.
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:14.620]   So it's command shift I can't just wait.
[01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:16.260]   You know, just go through all these.
[01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:21.140]   I'm sure somewhere is documented in the help files and just go and get them all.
[01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:24.940]   What I love are I have no insight knowledge of this, but I love these features that you
[01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:29.020]   see that you don't think that at any point was this discussed and whiteboarded.
[01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:33.740]   Just like someone who was on the development team decided that I really want this feature
[01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:38.780]   for my own person to use and I never have to tell anybody that this shortcut exists,
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:40.180]   but I will be able to use this restaurant.
[01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:43.500]   Actually, if you look in the file menu in Safari, there it is.
[01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:47.700]   Mail link to this page command shift I and by the way command I mails the contents of
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:48.700]   the page.
[01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:53.140]   Oh, oh, oh, it's right there.
[01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:55.740]   I don't I don't I don't investigate the file menu.
[01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:56.740]   I don't either.
[01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:01.020]   You know, how many times have I gone to the file menu and selected mail link to this page
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:04.180]   without looking at the fact that I could have done it with command shift I it just drives
[01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:05.500]   me crazy.
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:10.300]   Let me try command I and it opens an email is going to open is this going to open an
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:13.260]   email with the contents is it thinking up there it is.
[01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:18.420]   Yeah, look at that and it puts the subject in and everything.
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:19.420]   Pretty cool.
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:22.900]   Hey, Leander, I bet you you have a pick of the week for us.
[01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:26.660]   I do fire when ready, griddly.
[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:28.460]   It's an iPhone case.
[01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:30.380]   Oh, what is that?
[01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:35.420]   It's called the SGP Blitz linear case.
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:37.300]   I've never been a big fan of cases.
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:46.140]   I always like the my iPhone naked, but I also tend to drop it a lot and I the chips
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:48.260]   hurt.
[01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:52.540]   So this is like a bumper case, but a bumper case with a back on it.
[01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:58.780]   It protects the back and actually the back is is more attractive on the inside or just
[01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:04.340]   is a part of the inside is on the outside, but has a nice sort of mirrored finish around
[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:06.580]   the logo and the camera.
[01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:11.420]   I can't do this, but anyway, it's pretty it's really quite attractive.
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:16.300]   Yeah, and the you know, the edge of the case fits on like a bumper.
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:17.860]   It's good to have a case of some kind.
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:19.380]   Those things break so easily.
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:20.380]   Right.
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:21.380]   Absolutely.
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:23.100]   And this actually flies off when you when you drop it.
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:25.420]   So it looks kind of alarming, but it absorbs all the energy.
[01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:26.420]   You want it to do that.
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:27.420]   That's right.
[01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:28.420]   Right.
[01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:32.660]   So you can I mean, you can you can't say that the scratches all over this thing and it's
[01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:37.260]   really saved my phone from a lot of nasty dings.
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:39.300]   And you know, it's it's the best case I've had.
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:41.300]   I think it's probably the best case I've had for an iPhone.
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:42.300]   I really like it a lot.
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:44.140]   It's attractive and it's totally functional.
[01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:45.140]   It's a function.
[01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:56.820]   Yeah, spy gen the SGP iPhone 4 and 4S case linear blitz series and it's a 3199 on Amazon.
[01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:58.780]   Very nice.
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:35:59.780]   And do you not code?
[01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:01.420]   Do you have a pick for us?
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:02.420]   Yes.
[01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:03.860]   And it's not exactly a new pick.
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:05.900]   It's the opera browser for Mac.
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:06.900]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:07.900]   Exactly.
[01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:08.900]   For opera.
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:09.900]   What?
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:10.900]   I don't.
[01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:11.900]   I don't.
[01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:16.900]   Because it's it's been like the ugly steps steps sister of of browsers like there there
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:19.420]   at least three really good solid browsers.
[01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:20.820]   Why would you go to opera?
[01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:28.300]   Well, because it all started when I found out that my YouTube downloader app stop work
[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:29.740]   has for some reason stopped working.
[01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:32.780]   And sometimes there's a there's a video up there that you really want like a local copy
[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:35.100]   of so you can play it like on your iPad or whatever.
[01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:38.780]   And it used to have Mac tubes which work just great but stop working for some reason.
[01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:41.780]   I haven't been able to find an update for it that actually works.
[01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:48.060]   And then so I started poking around and opera has a really super cash explorer feature to
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:49.220]   it.
[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:50.220]   And so I'm going to start with all browsers.
[01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:54.020]   If you just type about colon cache, it will give you a list of items that are inside the
[01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:55.100]   cache.
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:37:01.340]   Opera goes one step further and it will allow you to basically narrow down this whole list
[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:02.860]   of things that are in the cache URL.
[01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:07.900]   So you can simply say, please, after you've played an entire YouTube video, that that
[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:10.300]   video file is somewhere in the browser cache.
[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:16.220]   So you can simply click some checkboxes in that about cache screen and say, please show
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:22.540]   me any item in the cache that is greater than 50 megabytes, but let's say it's smaller than
[01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:23.640]   a gigabyte.
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:28.540]   That is of file type mp4 or flash video or dot move.
[01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:31.940]   And then suddenly you're looking at just simply the four files that it could possibly
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:32.940]   be.
[01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:35.220]   And one of those is going to really stand out for you for graphics.
[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:40.420]   It's even better because now if you go to Pixar dot if you go if you go to the picks Pixar
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:43.940]   is official site for the brave film.
[01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:49.140]   It's really cool multimedia HTML 5 site with these beautiful production art, just a teaser
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:52.260]   art, beautiful like 1600 pixel wide images.
[01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:57.220]   But then if you just simply load up this page and then go to about cache and simply say,
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:05.900]   show me any JPEGs that are, let's say, larger than 50k, maybe smaller than whatever.
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:10.500]   You will now be presented with a list of thumbnails that you can select that beautiful
[01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:14.580]   background image that from the cache simply downloaded as a file.
[01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:18.380]   And now you've got this beautiful lock screen for your iPhone.
[01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:21.580]   So it doesn't obviously doesn't work on everything if something is encoded in flash video,
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:24.020]   it's not going to get you that image there.
[01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:28.620]   But whenever you're in the situation where you see something inside a browser window that
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:34.140]   you would like to have in your media library, operas, the simplest and the cheapest way
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:35.140]   to get at that.
[01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:38.740]   I mean, you don't even need to bother buying any of these apps that you find on the app
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:39.740]   store for this sort of thing.
[01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:41.340]   It works just perfectly well.
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:42.340]   That's really great.
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:47.420]   It actually has a very nice cache browser.
[01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:52.620]   Yeah, I mean, it's, I mean, they can almost package that as its own special tool.
[01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:55.700]   And forget about actually browsing the web with it.
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:57.340]   I just, I always have it open.
[01:38:57.340 --> 01:39:02.020]   And the only reason why I use it is when I'll tab over from Safari because I want to get
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:05.020]   that picture, I want to get that video.
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:06.020]   Neat.
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:09.420]   Ah, free at opera.com.
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:11.980]   And I haven't used it in ages, but it's great.
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:15.940]   And a lot of people swear by opera is yeah, go ahead.
[01:39:15.940 --> 01:39:17.980]   I mean, it has a bunch of features.
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:19.380]   They say it's a faster browser.
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:23.300]   Say it's like a lot of it is they do some service site off of optimization.
[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:28.580]   I haven't found enough advantages to it that I would switch away from Chrome or Safari.
[01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:32.980]   But as a one, it's a one for me personally, opera is a one trick pony, but it's one hell
[01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:33.980]   of a trick.
[01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:34.980]   Yeah.
[01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:36.620]   Yeah, it doesn't fit and finish.
[01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:41.060]   The polish isn't quite up there, but it looks like it's designed for a bunch of different
[01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:43.940]   platforms and then they kind of unify it.
[01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:46.060]   It's not real Mac-ish, I guess.
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:50.580]   Say again, like Firefox, like Firefox, same problem.
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:51.580]   That's why.
[01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:52.580]   Yeah.
[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:53.580]   I haven't launched Firefox in ages.
[01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:54.580]   No, me neither.
[01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:57.580]   If Chrome were not so sluggish on the Mac, I'd use it more.
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:01.540]   I like Chrome, but it feels very sluggish on some of my Macs, not all of them.
[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:04.020]   And I can't quite figure out why.
[01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:07.820]   So Safari and Command Shift I.
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:08.820]   So this is brand new.
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:09.820]   Just happened.
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:13.260]   Actually, it was one of our news stories, but I thought I'd save it for a pick conicotomy.
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:14.900]   We've talked about them many times before.
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:19.620]   It's a great place to get an education for free.
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:25.740]   2700 videos, they've just announced an iPad app that lets you view any of the 2700 videos.
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:29.860]   They don't yet have the tests and courseware and stuff, but they say they're going to do
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:30.860]   that.
[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:33.100]   You can download the videos right to your iPad.
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:38.100]   So it's a great interface to the conicotomy library.
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:41.340]   And you just download them and it's free.
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:45.900]   Saman Khan is a hero for the stuff he's put online.
[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:48.580]   And now there's an iPad app to make it even easier.
[01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:57.380]   I think adding conicotomy to your iPad just turns it into an incredible, useful tool.
[01:40:57.380 --> 01:40:58.380]   And I have it here.
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:40:59.380]   iTunes, you and that.
[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:00.380]   You've got it.
[01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:01.380]   You've got an education.
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:02.380]   Yeah.
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:06.140]   I'm very nice.
[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:11.460]   2700 educational videos and pretty much every area, K through 12 math, science, history,
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:14.620]   finance.
[01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:16.260]   You can log into your conicotomy account.
[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:20.020]   It does something neat, which is it will keep track of where you are.
[01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:24.100]   And when you go to your conicotomy account on another device, it will zip you to that
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:25.100]   place.
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:27.100]   It remembers where you are, which is very nice.
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:30.180]   You can get credit for watching videos, track goals and achievements from within the
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:31.180]   app.
[01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:34.620]   You can get fully subtitled and you can browse by subtitle.
[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:38.300]   It's also a little, you can actually, you can actually even actually just scroll right
[01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:40.580]   to the part of the lesson we actually want to get to.
[01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:41.580]   Yeah.
[01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:42.580]   Isn't that neat?
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:43.580]   Look at that.
[01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:44.580]   Those are all the subtitles.
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:46.380]   So you just jump to that part.
[01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:48.580]   Anyway, very nice.
[01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:50.700]   K-H-A-N Academy.
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:54.740]   Andy Inaco is at the Celestial Waste of Bend with CWOB.com.
[01:41:54.740 --> 01:42:00.740]   He's also at I-H-N-A-T-K-O on Twitter.
[01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:02.740]   You win the green jacket.
[01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:05.940]   I just always remember I have no idea how to spell it.
[01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:08.620]   I-H-N-N-N-The rest you can do.
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:11.140]   I have no idea.
[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:17.100]   Andy's also, of course, the tech writer for the great Chicago Sun Times.
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:21.620]   And also joining us from the Cult of Mac at CultofMac.com, the greatly Andrew Conny.
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:22.980]   Always a pleasure, Andrew.
[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:23.980]   Thank you for being here.
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:24.980]   Thank you, Hamilio.
[01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:31.420]   Apple stock price closing, the market closed two minutes ago and the closing stock price
[01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:38.220]   for Apple was $568 up 16 bucks today alone.
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:39.900]   It's like there's something happening.
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:45.780]   Again, one share of Apple's stock costs more than an iPad 3.
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:47.780]   Unbelievable.
[01:42:47.780 --> 01:42:50.500]   iPad 3 plus tax.
[01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:54.820]   And a soda, you can buy a soda at the CVS in the mall on the way back to your car.
[01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:55.820]   Yeah.
[01:42:55.820 --> 01:43:02.100]   So I will leave you with a great YouTube video that looks like it was something horrible
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:04.340]   happening at the TED conference.
[01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:08.740]   A disastrous speech from...
[01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:11.020]   You've got to watch this.
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:12.020]   I think it was...
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:16.500]   Was this from the most recent TED, the 2012 TED, I think it was?
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:19.220]   And let me close this here.
[01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:21.100]   Could you have my video?
[01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:22.100]   Am I audio?
[01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:23.100]   Yeah.
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:24.420]   All right.
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:26.420]   Paying attention to...
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:31.060]   Don't you hate it when that happens?
[01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:32.060]   Beach ball.
[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:35.740]   I think it's the crowdsourcing.
[01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:36.740]   Beach ball.
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:39.180]   Just a quick video.
[01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:44.140]   I don't think the audience knew that this was part of the improv everywhere.
[01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:46.660]   Moment to lounge.
[01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:54.540]   We'll just skip.
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:56.900]   I'll just skip through the video instead.
[01:43:56.900 --> 01:44:02.020]   We've all been there, haven't we?
[01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:05.620]   I'm sure that Apple's really thrilled that they used like Apple's...
[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:08.740]   The Apple Macintosh was screwing up.
[01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:09.740]   They should have used Windows.
[01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:10.740]   Oh, look, yes.
[01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:14.460]   Look, the beach ball is in the audience as well.
[01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:17.900]   Oh, that's at OS 9.
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:26.340]   I thought this went a little bit too Cirque du Soleil.
[01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:27.860]   Yeah, but still.
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:29.820]   Of course, like...
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:33.260]   I know I'm supposed to feel as though I'm transported to a dreamy of Wonderland, but
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:38.740]   I'm just looking at weird people in Leotard's, which I don't understand.
[01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:40.900]   That's why I like Cirque du Soleil.
[01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:41.900]   All right.
[01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:43.860]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:44.860]   Stop watching the video.
[01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:45.860]   Get back to work.
[01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:47.860]   Break times over!
[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:48.860]   Yay.
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:57.580]   I gotta say that whether you like show it, show it.
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:58.580]   What?
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:02.780]   Whether you like dudes or whether you like ladies, they chose a lot of improv people
[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:05.020]   who look really good at tight fitting spandex.
[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:06.820]   Yeah, except for that guy.
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:08.860]   Oh, that's me.
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:13.820]   This is the entertainment and the tech.
[01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:14.900]   This was a talk.
[01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:15.900]   This was a TED talk.
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:17.340]   What was it about?
[01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:18.340]   Well, it's improv.
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:20.340]   The guy's improv from improv everywhere.
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:21.740]   And the whole thing was staged.
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:23.300]   Yeah, it's all staged.
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:25.740]   It's just a funny improv.
[01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:30.900]   This just goes to show how awful it's come in the last 10 years, because this would have
[01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:31.900]   been Windows.
[01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:33.900]   They would have been the butt of the show.
[01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:34.900]   Right.
[01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:35.900]   Right.
[01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:36.900]   And this is sort of like being on the Simpsons.
[01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:37.900]   Right.
[01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:38.900]   It's a badge of honor, even if it's dead.
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:39.900]   Exactly.
[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:40.900]   And it doesn't happen that often.
[01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:42.580]   In fact, it's very reliable.
[01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:45.900]   But it's just a funny-- you're exactly right.
[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:47.420]   It's so recognizable now.
[01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:48.420]   Right.
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:49.940]   Because it's gone totally mainstream.
[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:52.420]   Before it would have been-- you know, it would have--
[01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:54.100]   you know, that Mac Ease was just too small.
[01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:55.180]   They were the minority.
[01:45:55.180 --> 01:45:59.340]   I think this is a perfect example that Apple is now the majority competing platform.
[01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:00.340]   Even if it's not.
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:01.340]   Right.
[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:02.340]   I think the minestack is actually--
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:04.020]   It is among that crowd, isn't it?
[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:05.020]   Among the TED crowd?
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:06.020]   Yeah, it does.
[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:07.420]   I bet you don't see a whole lot of Windows devices.
[01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:08.420]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:09.420]   Right.
[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:10.420]   Yeah.
[01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:13.780]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:17.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:19.720]   (upbeat music)
