[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.160]   Calling us, what time is it in Rwanda?
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.120]   >> Oh, it's actually not that bad.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.040]   It's 8.8.20 in Rwanda.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.040]   >> So it's not out of it.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.920]   >> This shows you how little I understand time zones.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.920]   Morning or evening?
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.920]   >> Evening.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.920]   >> Evening.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.960]   >> It's dark outside here.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.920]   I'm going to show you the, we're at my school.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.200]   >> What do you teach in your school?
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.920]   >> Yeah, I just finished class.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.920]   >> What do you teach?
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.760]   >> I was teaching visual effects.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.760]   That's what we teach.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.760]   >> Visual effects.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.760]   >> Media.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.760]   >> We have media and production here.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.520]   We'll see if we can actually pull this off.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.680]   So we have actually one of the top five locations of bandwidth in the country.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.480]   >> Well, it's working well.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.960]   I got to say, much better than most people in the states.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.960]   That's fabulous.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.040]   Is that the prison cell over there in your left?
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.400]   >> It's not the prison, but in Africa it's pretty common here.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   >> Hold on.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.400]   We're outside now.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   I get it.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   >> Yeah, we're out.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   >> So this is the, hold on.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.400]   Let's see if we can.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   >> Oh, look at there's the classroom.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   >> There's the classroom.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.400]   >> They're watching.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   >> Hey, everybody.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   >> Hey, everybody.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   >> Hey, everybody.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   >> So that's cool.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.160]   >> Yeah, so that's our pretty nifty little classroom.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.560]   And yeah, stand up and be seen there.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.560]   >> Stand up and say.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.560]   >> Everybody, stand up.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.640]   Hey, no, it's no invisible people.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.640]   >> Hold on.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.440]   We'll bring up, Jerome is my boss.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.440]   So he's wearing the tie.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.440]   I can tell, I knew that.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.440]   He's wearing a tie.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.440]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.240]   So give it a answer to Jerome.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.240]   >> Hey, Jerome.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.080]   >> So anyway, so anyway, he's here auditing, seeing how we're doing.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.080]   So that's funny.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   We're going to, so I just thought I'd show you that for a minute.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.080]   >> Hey, everybody.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.080]   That's great.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.320]   So even though I look like I'm, the principal's office is not nearly as cool as the classroom.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.640]   So, but the classroom's pretty cool.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.600]   It's all iPads and Big IMAX and so.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.840]   >> Alex, you can be honest with me.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.080]   Are you guys working on episode seven over there?
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.080]   >> No comment.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.080]   No comment.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.080]   >> No comment.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.640]   >> Hey, that's the idea.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.640]   >> Yes.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.080]   >> Actually, that's the idea, I think, is to create a workforce, an international workforce
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.080]   that can do that kind of stuff.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.160]   A lot of it is, we're using visual effects, but a lot of it is media development in general.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.400]   I mean, one of the things we're really looking at is e-learning and other media effects.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.080]   Almost all of those students will end up working here for local clients because Rwanda now
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.280]   is the ninth fastest growing economy in the world.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.880]   And so it's growing like a weed.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.360]   And so you need everything, including media.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.800]   And there's not a lot of media producers.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.720]   So while we're teaching visual effects, they're also right now they're learning video production
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.880]   and animation and so on and so forth.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.560]   But a lot of it's going to be really driven around doing stuff for e-learning, which is
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.040]   needed pretty badly here.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.560]   So anyway, so we're pretty excited.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.760]   I like to -- we were in South Africa over the weekend.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.440]   And so I figured, you know, I was in the continent.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.320]   So I figured I'd stop by my school and see how things were going.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.320]   >> That's wonderful.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.320]   Welcome.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.320]   Great to have you.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.720]   >> Also with us Renee Ritchie from iMore.com and beautiful sunny Montreal.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.120]   >> Beautiful rainy Montreal.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.520]   Since the last time I have spoken to you, it has not stopped raining.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.120]   It has been a constant stream of melted snow.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.120]   >> Oh.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.720]   That's what they call it in Canada, melted snow.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.720]   >> Absolutely.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.520]   Nice to see you again, Renee.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.520]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.520]   >> It was Canada yesterday, Leo.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.520]   They didn't even shine for that.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.020]   >> I mean, well, we're having a heat wave.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.440]   It's the hottest day of the year in Petaluma over -- I think it's going to go over 100.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.520]   For a while, I think, whether undergrad was pertaining 117 degrees for Petaluma today,
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.520]   which is for Petaluma, that means --
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.120]   >> I'm in Central Africa.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.720]   It's about 65 degrees here.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.920]   >> That's so weird.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.920]   >> We swap weather.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.920]   >> So weird.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.420]   >> Also -- >> He's fumbling for the shirt already.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.520]   >> Also here, Andy Inaco with his iPods and accessories.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.020]   >> There you go.
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.320]   All completely legal, as I'm sure you will understand.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.920]   Because if you're on 42nd Street in 7th Avenue in New York City, you can expect nothing
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.120]   but top quality, current, and not at all copyright rule.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.120]   >> $39.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.520]   That looks like a used -- >> I was too iPod there.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.520]   >> I was -- I was taking -- I had to take that picture because, like, I love the -- I
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.920]   don't know if it's there on screen, but it's like, you see, big word, iPod, and then
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.920]   underneath that tiny lettering, like -- >> What?
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.920]   >> -- new.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.520]   >> It's like -- they're very, very clear, like, and you look at it and it's almost perfect.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.120]   >> Oh, it's iPod-type, yeah.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.120]   >> iPod-like, iPod-type, iPod-type, iPad-ish.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.720]   >> I might paddish.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.720]   >> Wow.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.400]   >> And so if you're doing, like, if you're doing, like, a movie that's set in 2007 and
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.640]   you need to get your hands on a 2G iPhone, they got them.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.640]   They can help you out there.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.680]   It's something that's made, like, in the Obama administration that they will have trouble
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.720]   furnishing, but it's like, oh, isn't that interesting that you're selling those?
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.720]   Okay.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.520]   >> I have a sign over the front door says, we've got edge.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.520]   Yes.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.120]   >> Also with this Renee -- I said Renee.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.240]   I'm going -- I'm confused because they flip-flopped your positions.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.160]   And also, I'm a little flustered because there's a beautiful woman over all the way on the
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.160]   left here.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.800]   We don't usually even have a monitor over there.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.560]   Serenity Caldwell, who has the coolest name of all time.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.560]   >> Well, thank you.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.320]   It is a very unique name that my parents have blessed me with and I have --
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.040]   >> You weren't named after the Starship Serenity.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.960]   >> Sadly, I am a little bit too old for that, despite my appearance.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.680]   Some people think I'm 12.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.920]   Associated her Mac world, she is aware of many hats, but not one hat today.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.760]   I don't -- unless that hair is a hat.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.160]   >> No, no, there's no hat.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.840]   I was wearing a Team Canada hat all weekend, though, because I play roller derby and there
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.560]   was a Team USA versus Team Canada matchup.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.080]   >> Did you trade T-shirts at the end?
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.080]   >> We did.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.800]   We traded T-shirts and flags and --
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.280]   >> It was Canada Day was yesterday, right?
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.280]   >> It was.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.280]   >> Are you Canadian serenity?
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.960]   >> I am half Canadian.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.440]   My mother is Canadian, so I have dual citizenship.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.200]   >> The serenity half is Canadian.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.200]   >> Yes.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.600]   The Caldwell is very Scottish, but also California.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.600]   >> I like it.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   I like it.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.600]   It's great.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.960]   Well, we got two Canadians, a Bostonian, a Rwandan, and me.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.720]   And this is -- because this is our 4th of July week, we're going to start a new tradition.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.680]   I like this tradition, actually kicked off by Sean Montgomery.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.720]   We did this last year.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.280]   Where are you listening to Mac Break Weekly?
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.800]   If you're listening live, Sean is apparently listening at the beach.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.080]   Either that or he has a beautiful blue screen.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.240]   Green screen.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.240]   So tweet us.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.400]   Where are you listening or watching Mac Break Weekly today?
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.800]   And you can just use the hashtag #MacBreak and I'll find him and we'll have some fun showing
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   where everybody's listening today.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.960]   So everybody has wanted for the last three weeks since Apple announced the new Mac Pro
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.840]   to say everybody keeps saying what does Alex Lindsey think?
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.000]   You are apparently Alex.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.320]   You are like the platonic ideal of a Mac Pro user.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.320]   >> Yes.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.960]   So I am conflicted.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.360]   So that's what I'll say initially.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.400]   So obviously the performance of the new Mac Pro, at least as it's listed, looks pretty
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:56.960]   outstanding, you know, a lot of connectivity, there's a lot of speed.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.840]   One of the problems that I have is I really wish that they put an Nvidia graphics driver
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.640]   in there as opposed to ATI.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.400]   We develop a lot of GPU heavy or we have developed a lot of GPU heavy stuff and it's we find
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.160]   that the Nvidia card, the ATI card is better for games and the Nvidia card is better for
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.160]   Pro.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.960]   >> And it's soldered in there.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.400]   You're not going to be able to just swap it out.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   >> Yeah, I know.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.400]   >> You know what you're saying?
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.480]   >> I'm just saying because Apple is pushing this open CL and of course that's why the
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.320]   ATI card is in there.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:30.320]   And there is some speculation that because it's a single core unit, apparently it's going
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.720]   to be only single core, 12 core is total, but only single chip I should say, that they're
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.680]   hoping that Pro's will push the GPU performance with open CL.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.680]   Isn't that doable?
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.680]   >> Well, it is.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.680]   It is.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:50.160]   >> We most Pro applications barely touch the GPU and the GPU is really where a lot of the
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.880]   power is in most of these computer systems these days.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:00.280]   I mean, so conduit, one of the programs that we worked with my folks on a building, it's
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.520]   all GPU based and so is DB Mat.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.800]   And so these are heavy GPU operations and we were able to do incredible things, basically
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:17.080]   to comping 3D, 2 streams of 3D, HD together in real time on the current Macs.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:23.120]   And so that's all because we were using the GPU, CPU can get to one tenth of that speed.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.800]   So even now the GPUs are really the place to go for a lot of that processing.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:32.160]   The CPUs can be a little bit more stable at times for certain operations in the GPU.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.000]   So it's not that the GPU is the VL end all, but definitely for a lot of graphics, heavy
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.520]   graphics performance.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.520]   We would hope that people will continue to develop down that path.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:47.040]   >> But would you prefer NVIDIA's CUDA to ATI's OpenCL?
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.040]   >> Yes.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:55.640]   >> It's two very different thought processes related to how to process the GPU or how to
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.400]   process the operations.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:03.040]   And ATI tends to break it up into a lot of smaller pieces than the way NVIDIA handles
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.040]   it.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.680]   And so after the average user probably won't see it, my view is from the developer perspective.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.360]   >> Yeah, but this is not an average user machine by any means.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.840]   >> Right, right.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:20.920]   Well, and so the, it's not an average user, but I mean what I mean by that is the user
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.560]   probably won't feel the pain of an ATI GPU as much as the developer will.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.400]   >> You're writing CUDA code.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:36.240]   >> The applications that we've released actually are a little closer to the metal than CUDA.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.320]   So we're really writing right to the cards to get all the performance out of it.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.800]   So we didn't have a layer of abstraction like CUDA or OpenCL or any of those.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.880]   I mean, OpenCL, yes, but we're writing really right to the cards.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.640]   So that's why we're really sensitive to how the different cards operate.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.400]   And so, or we have been.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.480]   And so we just had a lot of compatibility issues where a hard or ATI I think is better for
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.120]   games as I said, the way that the games manage texture maps and polygons and everything else
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.440]   I think is better.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.280]   I think that for a lot of the heavier operations, and I'm not the only one, I think a lot of
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:18.600]   developers have stated that NVIDIA tends to, has been in the past anyway, easier to develop
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   for.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.320]   But it's not that it's impossible, just that it's less convenient.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.880]   And so I think that that I was kind of, you know, not being able to swap it out, but really
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.000]   having it part of that system is, you know, it'll be something to see.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.200]   The connectivity looks good, the performance obviously looks great.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:39.200]   Obviously, the form factor is not something I'm particularly excited about.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.040]   But I think that, you know, I think it'll be fine.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:49.800]   I'm curious as to, you know, Apple's core target market because a lot of the higher-end
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.720]   folks that would really want to spend a lot of money, I mean, because in the old Mac pros,
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.960]   you know, our average cost for a Mac Pro the way we spec them was anywhere from nine
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.840]   to $11,000 a Mac, you know, for the desktops.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.760]   So we're really spending, you know, we're putting a lot of, we're putting, you know,
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.080]   a lot of memory in and drives and a lot of extra pieces to make sure that the whole
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.040]   system was really as fast as we can make it.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.480]   Because if we were going to spend, you know, if we were really going to go down the path
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.040]   of a Mac Pro, we really needed it to do everything.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.760]   Because otherwise, we just replace it with a, you know, a Mac, an iMac.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:30.120]   And so I think that the problem is that folks that are in our, you know, doing what we're
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.880]   doing would vastly prefer to rack them out their machines.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.120]   And so, or at least most of the ones that I know.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:43.160]   So I think that one of the frustrations looking at the new one, when I saw it, I mean literally
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.160]   like the first couple of seconds, I actually was watching on the where I was, but I was
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.880]   watching the video and I was just like, "Oh, it's round."
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.880]   You know, like I don't know what I'm going to, you know, it's like I don't know where
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.040]   to stack it.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.920]   Because we don't buy, you know, we don't buy computers one at a time.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.200]   We're buying, you know, five or six of these and being a, you know, a lot of what we try
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.200]   to do is rack them.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.280]   I mean, there's part of me that, you know, is excited because we're just finally going
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.000]   to get an upgrade and it's going to have Thunderbolt and it's going to be very fast.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.920]   And I think I understand from a heating perspective, you know, in the way that they're managing,
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.880]   you know, all of those things, why circular makes sense to them, wrapping everything around
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.680]   that can make a lot of sense from a size perspective.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.200]   But from a use perspective, I think there's a lot of us that really want to see that kind
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.400]   of performance in a, you know, in a pizza box.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.720]   And I know that that's not creative and it's not, you know, all those other things that
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.200]   Apple does.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.760]   But it leaves me, you know, for a lot of the stuff that, you know, we literally have 30
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:41.440]   or 40 Mac minis that we have because they're rack mountable and we can show them into systems,
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.440]   you know.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.080]   And so I'm hoping, I know this sounds kind of odd, but I'm hoping to see revs now in the
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.960]   Mac minis, which we'll probably end up buying more of than the Mac Pros.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.000]   We'll probably buy, you know, a handful of Mac Pros for some of our editing systems.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.560]   But I don't see those as the bread and butter, especially if the Mac mini was upgraded to
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:05.200]   something that was a bit beefier, if they, even if it built it, you know, to you or whatever,
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.200]   we'd be much more likely to buy a lot of those because of their form factor than buying around
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.200]   a round computer.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.200]   So I know I seem like a curmudgeon, but we have to deal with a lot of these machines.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.960]   And so I was, you know, the form factor, I don't know what, you know, I have a hard time
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.040]   getting my head around it.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.920]   So I think there's just a lot of, I think there are a lot of questions about it.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:30.320]   Why that particular Z on why that form factor, why is everything soldered in no upgradability,
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.480]   will Thunderbolt two be supported better than Thunderbolt has been because that's key.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.080]   What about pros who've invested in PCIE cards?
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.640]   What, you know, are they just going to throw them all out?
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.640]   The form factor is a lot of.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.440]   It's beautiful.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.920]   And then the final question is how much is this damn thing going to cost?
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.120]   Because it looks expensive.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.120]   Well, yeah.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.680]   And I think that, I mean, I think that the reality is, you know, pound for pound literally,
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.360]   I think that it'll probably be the highest performance computer that you can buy and
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.440]   it'll be very stable and the graphics will be, I mean, I mean, it'll be a very, very solid
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.440]   machine.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.480]   The question I think is, and for a small market that really needs, you know, that kind of
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.200]   performance and it's, and ready for that, I think that that'll be, you know, it'll be
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.200]   a great machine for that.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.880]   I think that works the way it is out of the box just right for you, then it's fine.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.880]   But you can upgrade it.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.640]   Well, yeah, you can upgrade.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.240]   Yeah, you can't upgrade it in the way that we would normally.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.280]   I mean, obviously, using Thunderbolt, I think a lot of the idea is an external capacity of
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.240]   using Thunderbolt to expand some of those things.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.160]   And coming out of the box, it's going to be way ahead of a lot of other machines.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.200]   I mean, and so I think that, and I think it will also, I think we'll most likely see
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.120]   revs to, I mean, I'm just guessing all of this stuff, but I think we'll most likely see
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.600]   revs when it's released to Final Cut and Motion and all those other things to take full advantage
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.600]   of it.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.760]   And I think that it is as a 4K editing, editing machine.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.480]   And I think that that might be a lot of what it's designed for.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:56.600]   I think that it has some pretty intense advantages from a cost perspective and performance perspective
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.200]   over many of the options that you would see from, you know, Adobe and Avid.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.040]   So I think that you're going to see, you know, Final Cut, you know, really coming into
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.960]   its own, you know, with a machine, it's really designed to work with it because I'm going
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.320]   to guess that Final Cut is really going to be, I mean, this machine was designed for Final
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.600]   Cut and Final Cut was designed for this machine because I think that that is probably their
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:21.360]   best market, you know, is going to be people who want to do the next generation of, you
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.480]   know, 4K, you know, production.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.960]   I think that there's a lot of people who are going to want to edit that and, you know,
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.840]   they're going to find that the thing that runs the smoothest on it is Final Cut because
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.280]   like, I'd be really, it'd be hard pressed to believe that they weren't obviously working
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.000]   pretty closely with the Final Cut team to do that.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   And I'm just...
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   I don't like that.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   They said that.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.120]   I think they said that.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.120]   So I think this is really...
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:44.920]   I think that this machine is built for Final Cut users who want to go to 4K, you know,
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.800]   and they need a machine that's going to be able to suck that up and play it back well
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.800]   and everything else.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.400]   And so I think that that's going to be great.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.040]   I think that, again, you know, I think that it's going to probably do really well with
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.720]   3D, you know, I think that there's enough there to be powerful, but I think that a lot
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.000]   of people are going to have to decide whether they're really going to use that up, you know,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.100]   in a way that makes sense to get that as opposed to a really fast, you know, 27-inch
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.960]   iMac, you know, which is pretty impressive these days.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.960]   So...
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.880]   I guess what is the guess to price on this?
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.880]   Where's this?
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.880]   I bet you it starts at 4,000.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.720]   I mean, that's my guess.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.720]   3500...
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.720]   I mean, it could...
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.160]   I mean, at the very lowest, maybe you get it stripped down, 2500 to 3000.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.560]   I feel like Apple will find some skew that's 2500.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.560]   Not that anybody would buy it.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.080]   I think it's a 25-hundred-dollar skew just so that they could say it's starting at $2500.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.840]   But the one you want is, I think you're right, 4000.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.840]   And people are asking about Q-Master rendering.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.600]   And I think that's a perfect example of what you want Mac minis for.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.600]   So, you know, you don't...
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.760]   You know, you want to be able to have racks and racks and racks of machines, not...
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:53.320]   And being able to rack the machines is, you know, pretty important to us.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.320]   So...
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.320]   Well, you get those new cylindrical racks.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.120]   They're going to be beautiful.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.280]   To me, it feels like the cube.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.800]   It feels like something that was very design-focused.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.160]   Somebody in the chatroom said, and I think he might be right, form over function.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.160]   Wouldn't it have been...
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.040]   Wouldn't a lot of pros just been happier to keep the cheese grater because they don't
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.040]   care.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.040]   It's under the desk.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.040]   And make it new.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.040]   Make it fresh, make it all the new parts.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.040]   All I really need was...
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.640]   I don't see why they didn't do that, frankly.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.640]   So, I'm a little...
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.880]   I'm not as excited as I thought.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.680]   I was hoping to be when I saw the new Mac Pro.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.040]   You know, maybe I'll use it and I'll change my mind.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.960]   It'll be a great home theater PC.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.080]   I cannot wait to have that in my living room.
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.080]   Seriously, with your case screens.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.080]   That's a home theater PC.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.720]   So, Serene, what do you think?
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.080]   We've been chewing this over for three weeks.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.800]   That's why, because Alex hasn't been here, I really wanted to get his opinion.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.920]   I'm not leaving Renee and Andy out, and we'll give you a chance to talk, but we've been
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.920]   chewing this over.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.160]   I got basted on Twit for saying I thought it was a cube and disappointing.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.520]   Serene, what do you think?
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.520]   What do you readers think?
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.240]   Well, it's a good question.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:59.960]   I mean, Dan Frick's, my co-worker, is probably the expert on the Mac Pro over at Mac World,
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.120]   and he's been writing things at length about, "Oh, he's great.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.080]   He's great, and he loves the Mac Pro."
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:10.520]   I think very similar to Alex in terms of like, "Oh, so, so."
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.600]   He wants to go out and buy one, but at the same time, he doesn't really think that it's
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.360]   necessarily the machine that pros were asking for, but that's Apple, right?
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.040]   Apple never makes machines.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.120]   They're not going to say, "Oh, you want that kind of a machine?
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.560]   We're going to go ahead and make that for you."
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.920]   They're going to say, "No, we know what's best for you.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.720]   We know what kind of machine you should be using, and you should be powering forward
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.680]   with, so we're going to make this, and you're going to like it."
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.440]   At least for six months until we realize that we're not selling any of these things.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.440]   That feels awfully arrogant.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.320]   Yeah, I feel so arrogant in this day and age.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:45.880]   It is a little bit arrogant, but Apple at this point, I think, has earned enough credit.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.000]   They've earned their cred to be a little bit arrogant and say, "Yeah, we're going
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   to try something new."
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.960]   I mean, everybody thought that the iPhone was going to fail when the iPhone came out,
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.960]   and look where that dropped.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.080]   I mean, not everybody, but the Mac break weekly crew.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:04.920]   Right down to Scott Borne, who was like, "I don't know what," he was like ready to
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.320]   leap over the table and grab one, a sight unseen.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.920]   Give me all of your things.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.280]   Yeah, no, I mean, as I used to be a film editor, I could totally...
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.280]   Oh, so you really...
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.280]   Use these things.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:23.640]   So just for a few years, because I got out of that industry pretty quickly, but my cheese
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.760]   grater Mac Pro is my best friend.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:31.400]   So seeing that, I always keep a button on the Mac Pro issue, even though I don't think
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:37.080]   I'm ever going to buy one again, because my needs, at this point, are pretty well filled
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.880]   with an iMac and a MacBook Air.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.400]   It's still a really, really interesting market to follow, and I have a lot of friends who
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.720]   are creative professionals, both in the film industry and in graphic design and comics.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.080]   And I know, especially comics industry, there are some people who are looking at the Mac
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:59.880]   Pro and being like, "Hmm, that will run multiple monitors and my Photoshop install, and it
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.080]   will make everything really nice."
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:07.880]   So I do see that the new Mac Pro may have a good market for it.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:12.640]   It's just not necessarily the market that the Mac Pro is currently serving.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.640]   Andy?
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:20.120]   Yeah, I think that's when he had the right point there.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:25.480]   The design of this thing kind of screams out that they're not marketing this at companies
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.120]   that want to buy 100 of these in Mac Rack month.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.640]   I think the shape says that they want to sell these to that colorist who is running Photoshop
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.000]   in multiple layers and multiple screens and wants the power so that they have immense
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.480]   responsiveness and control for the person who's like a one person editing suite, editing
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.480]   shop.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.280]   It's for one person who buys this one thing to put on their one desk and have a beautiful
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.800]   thing to gather dust and wrap cables around as they get into week three of a two and a
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.280]   half week project.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:59.600]   So I do think this is a case of, I'm not sure if it's of style over substance.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:05.800]   I think it's more of style making the statement of who Apple is intending this for.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.920]   And one thing that I want to say is that I don't necessarily even think the round shape
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.680]   was style over substance as much as it was.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.000]   I mean, I think that there are some clear engineering reasons to wrap something around
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.760]   the heat core, you know, so, you know, or the cooling core.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:23.360]   So, so I think that that part of why it gets so small with so much power is a functional
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.000]   issue and not just a form issue.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.800]   So I understand that.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.160]   As I said, for me, I think I'd probably end up buying a lot more Mac mini pros that were
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.760]   souped up than than one of these.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.840]   But I mean, I could definitely, I mean, I'll say everything I'm gonna say I'm still buying
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.840]   two or three of them.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.840]   I think you're unusual too.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.880]   But it goes as always, you're an outlier, Alex.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.880]   But it does say that I'm sorry.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:49.680]   I just want to say that it does that is a design that it is impossible really to do anything
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.560]   with it, but put it on a desk.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.600]   You can't put it on a floor.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.080]   You can't put it in groups.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:59.880]   I mean, unless unless you want to have your server room look like the alien egg see environment
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.880]   from the first alien movies and who would not want that.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.400]   I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it's not it's not as though they designed something
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.720]   that could be flexible.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.600]   It really is put it on the desk and put it one by all by itself.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.360]   It's interesting because I think anyone who's observed Apple for a long time saw this coming
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.520]   because you know, there was the iMovie reboot and there was the Final Cut Pro reboot and
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:25.160]   the X-serve was kicked out and laptops became, you know, it's completely sealed and the
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.160]   iMac became completely sealed.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.480]   And this is the same sort of priorities put onto the Mac Pro.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.360]   And Apple is clearly saying once again that if you wanted to put this as one of three
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.760]   million units in a crate, we don't necessarily want that business.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.880]   You have a valid business, but you know, there's other companies that will sell you
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.920]   those boxes and that's not Apple.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:50.040]   But if you are an independent, if you're a single person, if you're a creative type,
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:54.280]   this is a spectacular machine inside and outside and we would love your business.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.200]   And exactly what, you know, Andy instrumentity said, this won't be the thing filling your
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.320]   server room, but it will be the thing that I think a lot of indie Mac developers are going
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.920]   to really let loose on and make some fantastic software for.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.600]   And those things will trickle down to whatever the next generation iMac and Mac mini and
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.400]   eventually laptops are.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:16.120]   Well, and I think that I think the individual, I don't know that many individuals that need
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.240]   more than a 27-inch iMac.
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.520]   So I think that's the thing is that I think that's the issue is that the, I mean, I have
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.800]   a classroom in the other room here with 27-inch iMacs.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.560]   And so, and we're doing 3D and editing and everything else.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.080]   And so I think that that is a, it's a pretty beefy machine.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.920]   And so I think that that's the hard part is that is that I don't, you know, usually you're
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.120]   starting to get into 3, 4, 5.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.680]   And maybe that's enough to put a desktop.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.480]   But I think a lot of us, you know, when you start getting efficient, once you get over
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.160]   and I can see Apple really focusing on that handful of people.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:50.480]   But once you, you know, get more than five or ten of these, you really wish they were
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.080]   all, you know, kind of tied together into one place that you can manage.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.320]   Everyone's going to get into one of cinema retina display Alex.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.920]   As soon as they see that, I'll just buy the computer to run it.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.920]   Right, right.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.920]   Exactly.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:06.240]   There are now some geek bench, you know how, when new Macs come out, before they come
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.800]   out, people geek bench them and a geek bench saves everything.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.080]   And they think that they know that these are the new Mac pros.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:19.880]   They're being identified as with an kind of an unusual number, the AAPL J90,1, which
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.920]   is not a standard Mac Pro reference.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:25.040]   And it does show better geek bench 2 scores.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.080]   Some, in some cases, a lot, in some cases, not a lot.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.320]   And I guess depends, it's going to depend a lot on what you do.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.880]   You know, there's so many unknowns here.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.760]   Those all Pixar IP addresses, Leo.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.800]   Yeah, you got to figure it somebody like that, right?
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.120]   Maybe this is designed for Pixar.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:45.680]   You could just see, you know, hundreds of these in Pixar, where design is so important.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:51.760]   When we saw wall E, was that act was, was E robot was actually the first functional design
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.360]   prototype for this?
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.240]   It doesn't fly, Andy.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.240]   Yeah, sadly.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.240]   You don't know that yet.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.640]   They didn't give us the full spec.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.640]   That's true.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.640]   Put it upside down.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.640]   The thermal could be a hovercraft.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.000]   Apple does not comment on the flight capabilities of unannounced products.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.480]   John, John Poole, who runs geek bench at Primate Labs said 10% faster than the current Mac
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.480]   Pro.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:18.920]   You know, if it were really true that that's 10% faster, and we don't know, that's a pretty
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.920]   big disappointment.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.120]   But again, everybody seems to be saying they're not focusing on CPU improvements.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.320]   But as you said, GPU improvements, Alex.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.480]   Yeah, and it's a pre-release machine.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.000]   We've got six gigs.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.240]   I believe it's six gigs of VRAM, which is mind-boggling.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.800]   Well, it's dual cards.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.320]   I mean, that's right.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.520]   So it is people take advantage of that.
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.000]   And again, I think that I really think this is focused on a, I mean, obviously, there's
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.240]   other industries that can take advantage of this, but I think this is really going to
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.400]   be focused on the Mac, the Final Cut Pro 4K editing solution.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.400]   I think we're going to see a lot of marketing.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.400]   I agree, but I don't know.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.400]   I don't know if you're backpack.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:03.480]   I don't know if design and size are critical factors for the pro community.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.360]   And that's really seems like a big focus of this.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.600]   Let's get it nate the size.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.600]   Let's get it looking gorgeous.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.600]   But doesn't it?
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.760]   Well, if you're going to put it on your desk, that's the way that that's what you want
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.760]   to do is make it nice and high.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.000]   Because they want to put it on their desk.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.600]   I could also see, you know, film, the independent filmmaker who is probably going to be traveling
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.040]   a lot or wants to make a film on location and edit on location.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:29.320]   Let me tell you, trucking a Mac Pro down to Florida to make a feature film and edit it
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.200]   there, that wasn't fun.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.400]   Trucking one of these Mac Pros is a lot easier.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.280]   I mean, that's your cores and your cables and your hard drives and this little tiny thing.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.880]   You can stick, you know, in some foam in a backpack and then set it up pretty much wherever.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.560]   I mean, that's, that's really cool for independent filmmakers.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.120]   I bet that would fit carry on luggage, as a matter of fact.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.160]   It's very good for us a discussion that you could put this in your backpack or into a
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.960]   carry on luggage, which, you know, that's a big deal for a lot of us trying to move
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:29:00.360]   electronics because moving a, the current cheese grater is in its, in its case, is
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.400]   90, 98 pounds, in case you're wondering.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.400]   No, we do.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.400]   And we've done that.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.760]   You've done, I know that's why you buy so many Mac minis, actually.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.320]   And we've we've we've slept Mac Pros down at CES and elsewhere.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.320]   That's true.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.320]   I mean, this is a gorgeous thing for that.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.320]   Maybe that maybe.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.320]   But is this something that Apple?
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.400]   Do you think Apple like went out, surveyed the market and said, okay, we've we've been,
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.520]   we've pinpointed it.
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:29.440]   We see the future being one man shops, one woman shops and portability.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.560]   We don't we see open CL being strong, kuda not so much or we don't worry about that particular
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.560]   part of the market.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.880]   It just leaves a gap because do all these pros want to go out and buy Windows machines
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.960]   or Linux machines or do they want a hackintosh?
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.880]   It seems like there's a gap in the market.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.320]   Well, I still think I, you know, it's never going to happen, but I still have this dream
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:54.320]   that Apple will just let OS 10 run on anything at some point when they don't feel like they
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.520]   need it anymore.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.080]   You know, and then and then we can develop the hardware that we need.
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.080]   You are so full of it.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.080]   That's never going to happen.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.880]   I just said it wasn't going to happen.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.880]   Such a dreamer.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.080]   But that here's the thing is that when I, you know, I said it wasn't going to happen
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.080]   at the beginning of that.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.320]   It's like Edward Snowden getting to walk home.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.800]   It's just not going to happen.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.800]   I know.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   No, no, I understand it.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:19.160]   What I was kind of pointing to is just the frustration a lot of us have that are pros
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:25.000]   is that we want the, you know, we want the flexibility of a PC or Linux platform, but
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.440]   we want the OS 10 operating system, you know, and then we just, you know, because we want
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.680]   to build out these machines to do something, you know, useful.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:36.840]   And we're, you know, I think as on the pro level, a lot of us just get tired of dealing
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:42.720]   with the simplistic view of or the, you know, the simplified product market that doesn't
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.920]   really fit any of us particularly well.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:50.440]   Yeah, but I mean, if you get your fever dream wish, you end up with things like, Oh, well,
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.880]   I'm going to build this machine.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.320]   And then none of it is optimized for OS 10.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.560]   So I mean, I understand that, but I think that I think that there's a lot of, I mean,
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.320]   really, you could say that there are a handful of these that will work with OS 10 and you
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:06.360]   could build, you could do a lot of things that would let us have the kind of, you know, the
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.320]   number of, you know, you don't have to go crazy and have every different option because
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.400]   I know that that is the problem with windows, but I think that, you know, having, being
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.480]   able to put a little bit more ram in or being able to have more drive slots or being able
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:23.480]   to put more PCI, you know, these are all things that, that a lot of us, you know, need.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.200]   And then, and then, you know, we prefer to use OS 10, but we have, you know, some of
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:31.320]   us have windows machines specifically just so that we can do those kind of things.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:37.960]   So Colin Johnson is listening in while in the UK whilst rubbing down the lounge.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.960]   It must be a Britishism.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.960]   I don't know what that means.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:44.480]   I don't want to know what that he's getting it ready for paper.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:49.920]   I hope it's Sam, I hope it's Sam, paper and I hope it's the floor he's talking about
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.320]   either that he's going for like a Steve Jobs, like living room design aesthetic.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.600]   Simple, on stereo and nothing else.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.680]   This is Brian Curley.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.360]   He's listening while driving down the I five.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.920]   He says, don't not while driving down the I while parked on the shoulder of the I five.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:10.840]   I think you were meant to say he does say don't tweet and drive Jason Thompson is listening
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.160]   in his office just like last year for Jason.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.480]   He hasn't been able to get out of his office for an entire year.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.720]   Trapped for an entire year.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:24.920]   And Kyle Duffield is watching Max back break weekly as he does every week on his iPad mini.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:30.560]   Nice to have you all watching our fourth of July episode of Mac break weekly with newbie
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.560]   serenity called.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.360]   Well, the incomparable serenity call.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.360]   Are you are you a jammer?
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.280]   Oh, I guess you get you you have to do it all, right?
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.640]   You do have to do it all in modern roller derby.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.880]   But I like to jam jamming is my favorite thing.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.800]   Why am I not surprised?
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.800]   What is the name of it?
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.800]   It's so fast.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.800]   It's fun.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.520]   And you get to elbow people.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.640]   What what's the name of the team?
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:58.320]   I play for two actually the my home team is called the Cosmo Nauties and has a nice Russian
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.720]   logo and my I play for the B all star team.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.760]   So we're second string and it's the Boston B party.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.960]   Are you in Boston?
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:09.960]   I am in Boston.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.400]   I moved to Boston last year.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.200]   Well, that's great.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   And and now do you have a derby name?
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.360]   Cos serenity call was a pretty good name for even for a Derby name.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:22.200]   It is people who are joking that if I ever went by my real name, it would still sound
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.800]   like a derby name because it's as Caldwell.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   So it'd be scaldwell.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   Well, well, yeah, but my but my real derby name my real derby name is R2 D two Nate, which
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.840]   is perfectly.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.280]   And this my friends is why roller derby is the greatest sport ever invented.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.680]   It is all right.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:46.120]   All go see about a boot.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.120]   We're going to take a break when we come back more with Mac break weekly serenity and
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:53.400]   Andy Anaka Renee Richie Alex Lindsey enough with a Mac pro talk.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:58.960]   We got our we got we got what we wanted, which was a very detailed thought analysis from
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.960]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.320]   You know that we will all be buying one.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.800]   Yeah, I'm telling you it's going to look great in my credenza in my living room next
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.600]   to my 4k display.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.280]   Now that's the worst part is like I could sit there and go rah, rah, rah, this is what
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.280]   I want.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.280]   But I think Apple knows this.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.280]   A lot of us are going to go.
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.880]   Oh, I really wish it had this this and this, but I'm still going to get one.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.080]   Hey, I bought a cube and loved my cube.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.920]   I bought it in the last day they made it.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.920]   And you was pretty.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.920]   I had one too.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.920]   I had a cube.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.760]   I had many of Apple's strange designed machines.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.000]   Yeah, my first book was written on a cube.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   And you too.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And you and you and you.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Renee, did you have a cube?
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   You're the only one left out now.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   I missed the cube.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   I'm so sad now.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   You too.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   I feel like I have one.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   I have one.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.280]   I have one because it's you know that something's not going well when you have one on loan
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.120]   for review and then you get an email saying, you know, if you'd like to just keep that
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.440]   we can sell it to you at a substantial discount.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.000]   Oh, those are days and it was a lovely thing.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.280]   Al, but Alex, I'm going to put an idea in your head.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.920]   This can be the cruelest thing ever because as soon as you hear this, you're going to
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:56.920]   have to do it.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:01.840]   Now you're talking about a, you use it, you transport these in a backpack and use D B.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.520]   You need lots of them for power.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.200]   You should commission someone to make you a backpack harness so you can what you can
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.440]   carry two of them that side by side and look like the rocketeer.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.520]   Oh, man.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.800]   If that fan is powerful enough, you might actually fly.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.240]   I also know cosplayers who can sell you one of the helmets and it'll look perfect.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.520]   And now see, get it done.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.520]   You will now you're on a track.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.600]   You're not on a track that ends with you actually doing this out because you're too
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.600]   sensible.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.600]   Not to one of you.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.000]   No, you know, the gear is turning now.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.080]   I'm like, I think I could make that work.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:41.080]   And here from cult of Mac is a Mac, the new Mac Pro server rack.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.080]   I saw that.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.840]   You can actually convert a whine rack into that.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.000]   And of course, you see cool there in at the top hot air out at the bottom.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.080]   So I have to admit, this might change my whole view.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.640]   I'm going to have to go out and get a right one rack when this comes in and just see if
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.800]   we can't make a put six of them in there.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.800]   That one made for magnums.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:02.760]   It's not going to be a problem with thrust that will start like skating around the room.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.800]   Just put it on coasters and have it, you know, rolling around.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.440]   You put it on a central pin.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:12.000]   You put it on a central pin and then it will slowly go around and around and around.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.600]   We also are going to get started.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.960]   It could be the next jammer for the Boston B party.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:17.960]   Yes.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:18.960]   Watch out.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.960]   Here comes my rack.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.520]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:25.760]   Until we come back more, Apple spells out iTunes radio terms for record labels.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.000]   Details are now emerging.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.960]   They open their online store in Russia.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.640]   Man, it's a slow week.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:40.520]   And Apple and a 137 acre 20 megawatts solar array in Reno.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.520]   Mm.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:47.640]   But first a word from our friends at Citrix who make that great program go to meeting.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:54.040]   It is the simply the best way to meet with colleagues, clients, prospective clients anywhere
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.040]   in the world.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.920]   Nowadays, everybody's spread all over the place.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:02.840]   I mean, Rwanda, Boston, Montreal, Boston, Petaluma.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.200]   This is how people meet nowadays, right?
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.240]   With go to meeting, pardon me?
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:11.320]   I was going to say, you know, I'm in Africa and the way that I'm doing almost all of my
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:15.000]   meetings is with go to meeting because I can, the big thing is I can, I can log in on my
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.280]   computer to whatever Wi-Fi access that I have and be on my computer and meeting with them
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.440]   and they're calling in or using their computer.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:28.520]   And it is really efficient from a, you know, from a voice protocol, even though there's
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.080]   lots of other things you can screen share and you can do HD camera.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.840]   But the voice when you're all over the world, it's just one of the easiest ways to tie everybody
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.840]   together.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.840]   I love it.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.680]   Paul Adidas in our chat room and says I met my wife on go to meeting.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.320]   I don't know if I believe that if she, it's either not Paul.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.680]   Anyway, go to meeting.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:53.920]   It allows you to share your screens with others using Macs or PCs or iPhones, iPads, Android
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.160]   devices.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.400]   You can even present from an iPad, which means, which really kind of gives you some interesting
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.400]   options.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.920]   Beautiful day, you go out to the pool, you're having a meeting, you got your iPad.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.600]   It uses the camera so you can see each other.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:09.680]   The HD faces means that, that crystal clear HD video means it's as good as meeting face
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.680]   to face.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.920]   I have to say, I am a huge fan.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.440]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:19.320]   The key I think to being successful, I did for years, I didn't want to believe this.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.120]   At least it made me believe it is you got to meet with your team regularly.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.800]   You got to have regular meetings.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.120]   I hate meetings.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:30.240]   But if we can make them more effective, if we can, if we can, you know, have them work,
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.200]   you know what it is, the way to be effective and go to meeting makes that possible.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.480]   It's the powerfully simple way to meet and collaborate online.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.760]   Visit go to meeting.com, click that orange, try a free button.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.760]   Our offer code is Macbreak30daysfree.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.920]   Great support 24/7.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:46.920]   Not that you'll need it.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.040]   It's so easy to install and use.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:54.080]   Go to meeting.com, meet anywhere, even on an iPad.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.400]   We thank you for their support of our show.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:05.040]   137 acre, 20 megawatt, solar array outside of Reno, Nevada, where there's a lot of
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.040]   sun.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.960]   This is in partnership with the Nevada energy.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:13.680]   I'm not sure what it's what it's for, but that that's pretty cool.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:19.320]   I guess you want to build server farms in places where power is cheap, cooling is easy.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:24.920]   And you know, the connectivity is good, which is why North Carolina was the last place that
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:25.920]   Apple built this.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:26.920]   I'm having trouble pulling this up.
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.920]   I don't know.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.920]   You know, I'm having a little trouble with my Wi-Fi.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:32.880]   I'm wondering if this is the MacBook Air acting up again.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.040]   Where's it us?
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.040]   It's us.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.040]   Chats is us.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.040]   There it is.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.040]   Look at that.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.080]   Yeah, baby.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.080]   Power of the sun.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.720]   I don't want the job of dusting those panels.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.720]   That wouldn't be a good one.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.120]   That's for robots.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.120]   I hope there.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:54.200]   I hope, you know, there's a Roomba for solar panels that just goes around in dusts.
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.200]   That would be good.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.200]   Apple.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.600]   Let's take a look.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.760]   This is from I'm more, Mr. Richie.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:07.360]   Apple credited with two of the best designs of the last 100 years.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.680]   I just pointed at time.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.760]   Time magazine went and interviewed a bunch of different designers and got their opinions
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.800]   on what were the 12 of them.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.440]   I don't know what the exact criteria was.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:22.760]   12 most impressive, 12 of the most meaningful, 12 of the most influential designs.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.480]   And there was a huge array of things.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:30.480]   I mean, there was airplanes and Vespa motorcycles and there were two Apple products, both the
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:35.720]   original Mac and the iPod made it into their list.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:36.720]   Mac and iPod.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:41.640]   It seems like Apple should have more than two.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:47.200]   And the Mac Pro would go out, I guess, out of 12 in the best 12 in the 100 years.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.520]   And is it just the US inventions or is it inventions worldwide?
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.520]   Because it's hard to--
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.560]   Well, I wasn't sure.
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.880]   The Vespa sounds international.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.880]   The Airbus--
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:56.880]   Vespa's Italian.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.880]   Airbus is international.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:02.880]   Airbus is international.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:03.880]   It's European.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:07.880]   It's pretty good for Apple, for a company that's been around a little over the years.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.880]   I want more.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.280]   One sixth of the most influential products ever, Leo, and you want more.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.280]   I'm not happy.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.760]   All of the products.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:17.360]   I am surprised that it was the iPod that got mentioned and not the iPhone.
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.920]   But I suppose the iPod form factor gave way for the iPhone.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.160]   Both Johnny Ived designs.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.160]   This is true.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.720]   And the Macintosh, not a Johnny Ived, but you know, nobody-- who gets credit for
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.240]   designing the beautiful or first Macintosh.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.640]   Or the escalator, apparently.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.880]   I don't think that should be on the list.
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.120]   I don't think that should be on the list.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.120]   That's not a good design.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.120]   What the hell is that?
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.120]   An AK-47.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.120]   That's a crappy design.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.120]   The floppy disk.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.120]   No, no, no.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.120]   Get these things off of here.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:46.720]   See, that does show a wide spectrum because the AK-47, there's been a whole book written
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:51.440]   about it that the reason why it's such a great design is that you just can't destroy one
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.440]   of these things.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.160]   You can take it apart, bury them in the sand.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:59.760]   You can manufacture them badly, get them wet, they will always just frickin' work.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.160]   They're cheap and easy.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.160]   I don't know.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.160]   I can say collection.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.160]   Not like the floppy disks.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.160]   The Airon chair, really?
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.160]   Really?
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.160]   B&O stereo?
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.160]   I guess B&O stereo I'll give.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.520]   Okay, no, I'm not with you at B&O.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.520]   Yes.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.520]   The Model T.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:15.160]   That's an unusually good looking Model T.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.480]   You couldn't get them in red by the way.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.680]   That's not an option.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.480]   Well, that's the dragster version.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.240]   That's the funny car version of the Model T.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.240]   And the jet engine.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.600]   Yeah, it's a very random list.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.600]   It's totally random.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.960]   See, I don't know.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.360]   That's a very skeuomorphic design.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.440]   There's too much chrome on it.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.440]   For the jet.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.440]   You talk about the jet.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.440]   There's very little discoverability in that interface.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.760]   I mean, I don't know where to push.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.760]   I didn't know where to push.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.760]   I didn't seem not digitally authentic.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.560]   Look how steampunk that is.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.560]   Man.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:49.160]   Now, if you replace those things around the outside with Mac Pros, just think.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.560]   There's your server, Wreck.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:57.200]   There's your server with separate did good cooling.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.240]   Yeah, I think the, by the original Mac, you know, we give Johnny and I have such credit
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:06.480]   and he, of course, did that iPod that they showed, which was not the first iPod.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.480]   That's a later iPod.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.480]   Did he do that one?
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:11.440]   I think he did all of it.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.440]   Didn't he?
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.120]   I believe he designed the original iPad or iPod.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.680]   Okay.
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.520]   Jeff Raskin designed the Macintosh.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.520]   Somebody's saying an iPhone.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.520]   I know Jeff Raskin came up.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.520]   I think he designed it.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.520]   He came up with the idea.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.520]   No, I think the Bondi blew one.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.520]   Pardon me?
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.760]   Johnny, Johnny, I was at the Bondi Blue iMac, I think.
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:28.760]   Yes.
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:29.760]   I was.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.760]   And that predated the iPod.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:35.760]   So I think you're right, Serenity, that he must have had a hand in all the iPods.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.240]   But who did the original Mac?
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.240]   Let's find that out.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.240]   I want to know.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.600]   Wasn't Susan Karp, she did the icons.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.200]   Wasn't Frog, was it?
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.720]   Oh, it might have been Frog design.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.720]   You're right.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:47.720]   Who designed the one 28K?
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.920]   Yes, it was.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.920]   It was Bill.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.920]   What's his name?
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.920]   Macintosh.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.920]   Wonder if Google knows.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:55.920]   It is.
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:56.920]   It is.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:57.920]   It is.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:58.920]   Google.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:43:59.920]   Apples.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:05.040]   Apple history.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:08.400]   The answer for those listening at home is.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.400]   Potash.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.400]   Potash.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.400]   The password is.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.440]   Scuzzy black Terminator.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.440]   Scuzzy black Terminator.
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.440]   Mac Team Jeff.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.440]   This is a series.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.400]   Brian Howard, Mark LeBrunz, Burrell Smith.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.400]   Burrell was the hardware guy.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:27.280]   Joanna Hoffman, Bud, Triple Might have had something to do with it as well.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.160]   I don't think anybody could get these jobs.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.200]   This website is Terry Oama and Jerry Manock.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.280]   Oh, OK.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.960]   That would not have been Apple employees.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:35.960]   I think you might be right.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:36.960]   It might have been Frog design.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.600]   Yeah, because those names do not ring a bell as somebody else.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:44.840]   Steve Jobs's name appears on the design patent along with Terry Oama and Jerry Manock.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.760]   Granted, this is Google, so.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.760]   They're liars.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:54.040]   It's closely guided by Steve Jobs.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:57.200]   But who are Terry Oama and Jerry Matt Locke?
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.200]   Manock.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.200]   Matt Locke.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.360]   Oh, even though Steve didn't draw any of the lines, his ideas and inspirations made the
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.720]   design, what it is to be honest.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:10.640]   We didn't know what it meant for a computer to be friendly until Steve told us at Oama.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:13.200]   Well, it has to speak.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:18.960]   Matt Manock designed the rear bucket.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.520]   That's what they call the back of the case.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.280]   I might handle the front bezel.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.640]   So you got your bucket and you got your bezel.
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.600]   So Oama did the bezel.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.600]   Man act did the bucket there.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.000]   They snap days to get it.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.200]   Steve Jobs went like this.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.720]   You know, it's a Macintosh.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.920]   No, no, you don't know the whole story.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.160]   All they did was they went to Canal Street in New York, you know, where you can buy anything
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:43.080]   on Canal Street, especially in the early 80s.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.800]   You know, they said, hey, that looks like we can make a computer out of it.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.680]   And so they just bought like seven of them, worked out well.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:52.800]   They went back to the same guy that can he get us about 40,000 of them.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.320]   And they said, when do you want it?
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:57.040]   A lot of them, you know, they look like they fell off of something.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.040]   That's not your business.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.880]   It's like, you know, it's kind of a receipt for nothing.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:08.280]   It's made in Geneva with a J. Jerry Gerald Clifford Manock was an American industrial designer
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:13.640]   and worked for Apple from 77 through 84 and did the housing designs, not only for the
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:18.800]   Mac, but the Apple II, the Apple III and earlier compact Macintosh computers.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.320]   Now, is that a signature shade of gray, a shade of beige?
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.360]   We saw that on a lot of different Apple products.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:29.480]   I don't know if that was a signature color or where that was just the color.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:35.680]   That same page says that there is the specific color of the plastic was made to last even
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.760]   with prolonged exposure to sunlight.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.320]   Yeah, it's not aging well.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.040]   I got to tell you, it looks crappy now.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.080]   It's yellowed.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:51.320]   So apparently there was an influence from frog design in this because the Apple design
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:54.880]   group was founded by a former frog.
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.760]   Hot moute estlinga.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.600]   Anyway, the reason if this is your main is because if it's one of the 12 best designs
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:07.680]   of the century, then Manock and O'wanna.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.880]   Even they're talking about design is what I mean from the other ones that they did.
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.400]   I don't think it's necessarily industrial design but functional design.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.400]   Right.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.760]   It actually did something very easily because the AK-47 you can't say is a beautiful thing,
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.600]   but it highly functional.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:20.600]   It's Bulldog pretty.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.600]   Bulldog.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.320]   It's beautiful if someone's coming at you with another gun and you'd like to pack it
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.320]   at work.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:29.040]   But actually, just to circle it around, it actually has the original Mac has the same
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:33.320]   sort of design idea as this new Mac Pro and that you can stick your hand inside it and
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.080]   lift the top of it does act as a carrying handle.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.280]   It's not portable, but it's easily transportable.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:43.760]   You know, actually, now that you say that, you can make a good case that the new Mac Pro
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:49.520]   is in the tradition of the original Macintosh in a way that the cheese grater and other
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.800]   does late designs are not.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.280]   It is very, you make a good point, Andy.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:57.720]   It is very much the descendant of the original 128.
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:01.680]   And probably by the time they get finished pricing, it will probably cost as much as
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:02.680]   the original Mac.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.680]   2500 bucks at Macy's.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:07.640]   I think $1 less than 3000 myself, but yeah.
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:08.640]   2999.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.240]   It's got to have a two at the beginning though, right?
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.680]   I think there's going to be that.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:19.960]   Just like the first retina Mac Pro was technically if you want to get the cheap one, 2300, but
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:24.520]   they really think that you're going to be coming out leaving a store with a $3,000 model.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:28.720]   So I think that that's they want if they want psychologically say that we have it for a
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.040]   sticker of less than three grand.
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.520]   Yeah, I think you probably right.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.000]   Well, they certainly can't be more than three grand.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.520]   But as I said, I think that that will not be the unit anybody wants.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.800]   Up on the other hand, that did come with the screen in 1984.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:41.800]   True.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.800]   Beautiful.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.800]   And no removable storage.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.400]   So it really costs a lot more.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.200]   It had a parallel port though, Andy.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.080]   You can't knock it for that.
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:56.800]   How do you Sarah Perez doing some calculations on how to get into the App Store top 50 on
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.200]   the iPhone?
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:04.760]   Um, actually it's a mobile apps analytics firm, Distamo that did the calculations.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:12.840]   They say that you need 23,000 free downloads a day if you want to get in the top free charts.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:17.880]   And if you want to get in the top paid or grossing charts, you don't have to be quite
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:25.080]   so big, 950 downloads a day, but you do need to get at the top 50 spot in the grossing.
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:28.640]   You need a daily revenue of $12,000.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.760]   Is that a surprise that sound about right?
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.120]   Sounds about right.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.720]   I want to get into the top 50.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:39.320]   That's all I'm saying is I wouldn't mind $12,000 a day.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.080]   No, nobody's making any money.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.160]   Make an apps for the App Store.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:46.360]   I think then we just need to look at the top 50 and go, well, there's somebody making
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.360]   somebody make money.
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:59.080]   The top 10, the top 10 in the grossing chart, $47,000 a day in May, a free iPhone app needed
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:03.720]   to see more than 70,000 downloads a day to get the top 10 free.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:10.800]   Yeah, somebody's making money, but that's, I guess, always been the point, a small select
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:11.800]   group or make it.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:12.800]   Well, that's always the point with every industry.
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.440]   I mean, Hollywood is filled with a bunch of people waiting tables that want to be great
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.160]   actors that aren't making $20 million.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:24.160]   So I mean, I think that any industry, especially that is entrepreneurial, you're going to have
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.400]   a gold rush and there's going to be a whole lot of people and the real people are going
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.680]   to end up being the ones that sold the jeans.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.960]   It is the sixth birthday of the iPhone.
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:36.760]   When exactly did the iPhone hit the storage?
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.720]   On the previous weekend.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:39.720]   Last weekend.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.560]   I remember that day well.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.480]   Robert Scoble was in a shower.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.160]   No, no, that's something else.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.960]   By the line, Scott, board members of the picture of Scott born.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:53.200]   It was in the San Francisco Chronicle coming out with the first iPhone at the store on
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.200]   the.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:56.000]   Yeah, I think he had, I think he hired Greg.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   Not higher.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.040]   We told you had Greg Martin sitting, I think he was sitting out in the line for him in
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.040]   line.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:04.120]   Yeah, it's got to not nice to be the guy.
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:08.760]   Scott didn't sit in line line and then, and then, and then, and then so it's a great
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:14.240]   got sunburn and Scott got a picture in the cover of the.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:18.680]   The truth comes at six years later, June 29th, 2007.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:24.840]   It seems like it's been a, it's been a very big six years, hasn't it?
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.960]   Lots changed.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:35.160]   The iPhone clearly established the, the idea of a keyboardless, stylist, list phone.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.680]   Even a tenelist compared to those trails.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:37.680]   And tenelists.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:38.680]   Look at the trio.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.040]   Pretty impressive.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:45.040]   It's interesting how it lingered too.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:49.960]   I mean, for a long time, several companies said, Oh, no one's going to take a phone seriously.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:52.120]   That doesn't have a keyboard, a hardware keyboard.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.280]   It's just not going to be used by professionals.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:58.280]   Or, you know, I need a stylist because, you know, I have fingernails or I need to put in
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.560]   Asian characters or all these things.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:03.800]   And Apple in very typical fashion never said, okay, we'll give you a hardware keyboard or
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.280]   we'll give you a stylist.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:09.480]   But they decided to give functionality that would enable the same, you know, sort of feature
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.480]   set.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:15.080]   Now more and more companies have come along to sort of adopt that model.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:20.680]   But to be fair, remember that this was a super expensive phone sold only in limited, limited
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:24.280]   parts of the world only through, and in the United States only through one carrier.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.920]   So it's not as though there wasn't time to, for a transition.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:32.440]   So that the people who are kind of change a verse who the blackberry, which was the demon
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:36.200]   for messaging and people who had been, you had not at this point, at that point used two
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:40.360]   or three generations of these devices and now it could really pump out texts and emails
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:41.760]   really, really quickly on it.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:45.920]   You really do have to see that keyboard and use it, not only that, but learn how to use
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:50.240]   it before you kind of overcome your idea that this virtual keyboard is really going
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.000]   to work very, very well.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:58.120]   I'm not sure how well they would have done if, I'm not sure if all companies decided
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.960]   to jump on that at the same time.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:03.680]   I'm not sure the iPhone would have, if blackberry decided that we're going to do a virtual keyboard
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:07.200]   and hear the reasons why we think that's a good idea because we can make it even faster
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:11.160]   for you people who need to push out a lot of texts at the same, very, very quickly.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:16.200]   I'm not sure it would have been, it might have been a different story because it wasn't,
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:22.120]   it really is a sort of thing where, I'm not in trouble articulating it.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:26.800]   It just seems like there are devices where if you just make it available to absolutely
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:31.400]   everybody at the same time and give them exactly the same sort of motivation to buy this instead
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:36.040]   of anything else, meaning price and availability, that's one, that's a more difficult path for
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:40.080]   something that's brand new than we're going to make this so that anybody who is very,
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:42.960]   very well motivated to have one can have one.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.600]   And we believe that you who have a blackberry that still has another year and three months
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.960]   in the contract, you will probably have a friend who has one and then you can actually
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:54.040]   put get one in your hands and try it out and that will mitigate all of the problems that
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.960]   you were having and giving it a try to begin with.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:01.280]   I mean, it really was, it's hard to even for, you know, it was only, it was only seven
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:06.440]   years ago, six years ago, but it's hard to appreciate exactly how different this thing
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.520]   was from just about everything else out there.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:12.520]   I mean, I remember that it was like a whole year that I had to pretty much give people,
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:17.800]   challenge people to typing races to say, I'm going to use, and I'm not kidding.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:20.800]   Even iPhone users said, oh, I stopped using it because I said that I hate the keyboard.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:21.800]   I can't type fast enough.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.120]   And I said, you were trying to try it like this.
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:25.480]   You need to type like this.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:29.520]   There is software built into it that helps you figure out what you meant to do.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:34.080]   And literally say, I will do a race and give us, let's point out a paragraph of text, we
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:37.000]   will type both at the same time and I get almost guarantee you I will finish faster
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.560]   at least so fast that you will wonder if you haven't missed out on something.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.640]   I want to go and even get one.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.520]   Say against Rani.
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:48.720]   I said, I worked at Apple Store for a year and a half and there were many a typing race
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.760]   to show new customers.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:51.760]   It was crazy.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:55.600]   The Apple stores, I think, were a big, big proponent in getting these things in the hands
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:56.600]   of people.
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:57.600]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.600]   Key.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.880]   What was the year that you worked in the Apple store?
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:08.360]   I worked in the Apple store, let's see, from 2008 to almost 2000 to the very end of 2009
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.360]   beginning of 2010.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:14.160]   And then I left to go join Mac world because you've had quite a couple of interests.
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.400]   You really do wear many hats.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:22.880]   Film editor, Apple genius, roller derby, jammer.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.560]   My name is Brian Hogan.
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.640]   Ask me anything three years ago.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.080]   I leaked the iPhone 4.
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.400]   It's on Reddit.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:37.840]   Brian Hogan, the guy who sold the iPhone, the iPhone 4 and a bar and sold it to Gizmodo,
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:42.000]   did an AMA and an, an Reddit.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   He says, I was 21.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.200]   I was at a bar pretty late at night with two friends.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.640]   After the last call, both of my friends went to the bathroom.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:54.160]   As they left, a random drunk guy came out, walked up to me, picked up the phone and the
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:57.480]   bar still next to me and said, I'll forget your phone.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.480]   I told him it wasn't mine.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.040]   I didn't know who it belonged to.
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:04.080]   Random drunk guy hands me the phone and tasks me with finding its owner.
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:06.480]   Find his owner.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.320]   That random drunk guy was Steve Jobs.
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.320]   No, no, sorry.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.440]   I asked around and can't figure out who it belongs to.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.000]   After my friends returned, we left and walked home having any intentions of figuring out
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.840]   who the phone belonged to and giving it back.
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:19.280]   Next day I woke up, forgot I had the phone, then went around trying to figure out who
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.280]   it belonged to.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:24.080]   I checked Craigslist, started looking at the phone for clues.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:27.000]   Green looked like it had a higher resolution than any iPhone I'd seen.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.520]   Then the case had plastic pieces and buttons in strange places.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:34.960]   When I took the case off, I found an iPhone with a flat black, flat back, flat edges and
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.800]   a forward facing camera.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:41.440]   There were two barcode stickers in the back and a series of Xs instead of serial numbers.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.800]   Dum, dum, dum, dum.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:46.720]   I was very curious and excited at this point, but I had no idea what I had.
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:51.160]   Long story short, my friend Sage and I decided the phone was an Apple product.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:56.680]   We decided to test and see what kind of leverage something like that had.
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:02.080]   First Sage contacted Apple to tell them, "We think we might have it."
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:06.720]   After they blew him off, get out of here, kid.
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:10.960]   He started contacting different tech blogs to see if they wanted to meet in person and
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.440]   look at the phone for money.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.680]   The people at Gizmodo took us seriously.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:19.960]   We met and they thought it was real too after about a month after that first meeting.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.920]   They posted the article leaking the phone.
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:28.000]   He says that Gizmodo promised him $5,000 for the story and another $3,000 after it was
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.160]   confirmed by Apple to be real and they didn't pay him.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:35.920]   He says he actually hired an expensive attorney and it ended up costing more than they even
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:39.640]   promised that he would get.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:42.760]   I guess he got the first payment, didn't get the second payment.
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:44.120]   The attorney cost more than five grand.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:45.120]   He was out.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:50.880]   He said, "I rarely talk about the topic with people but my conscience is clear.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:53.960]   I'm over the embarrassment and life is too short for someone.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:57.040]   The guilt I was placing upon myself about it."
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.040]   Effit.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.040]   AMA.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.040]   Ask me anything."
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:08.440]   Of course, the first thing they said, "How much money did you get?"
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:14.960]   It's kind of interesting and I have no reason to believe it's not real.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:18.560]   I don't think he was ever prosecuted.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:19.560]   That's interesting though.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:26.160]   If that was the story that he told in his entirety to Gizmodo, it's the new element
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:29.600]   that I wasn't familiar with before that I didn't find it myself.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:35.920]   A drunk guy found it and handed it to me and then disappeared without any ability for
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:39.080]   me to ever identify who that person was.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:44.520]   That seems to be another layer of...
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.720]   Weirdness.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:47.720]   That would make...
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:50.440]   I'm not suggesting anything happened or didn't happen.
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:55.800]   I'm saying that if I had been offered this, whatever problems and questions I had about
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:59:00.000]   the legality of accepting this or where the actual source of the phone was, a new story
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:05.040]   would now be in my head saying, "No, he actually stole it or he knows the person who stole
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:11.560]   it and he feels such a problem about saying that I simply found it that I have to establish
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:14.160]   an extra layer that's saying, "Oh, a drunk guy found it."
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:18.000]   I can't tell you where it was in the bar because I didn't actually find it.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.360]   It was another guy who basically gave it to me.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:24.160]   I'm not saying anything when we were another.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:28.880]   I'm saying that that's a new detail that hadn't heard before before the AMA.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:32.960]   That would make me think if that had been me being offered this phone thinking, "Ah,
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:36.960]   it's kind of important that we not get involved with this right now because it's just too
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:39.080]   weird a story now."
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:42.360]   He does say if it happened again, he'd give it to the bartender.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.720]   What we asked, why didn't they just give it to the bartender?
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:50.120]   I think it's not an incredible story.
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:51.120]   Remember, it's closing time.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:56.480]   Pretty much anybody in a bar at 2 AM is drunk.
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.560]   You really want to add to the conspiracy?
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.920]   That drunk guy worked for Apple PR.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.640]   It was an intentional leak.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.600]   Certainly got him a lot of press.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:11.120]   What I'm saying is that let's invent something here.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:16.960]   That's what I was doing too, by the way.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.360]   Only this time we're announcing beforehand we're making something up instead of-
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.720]   Yes, that good thinking, yes.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:25.600]   Let's say that you were a competitor and you knew that you had your hands on a really,
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:31.800]   really bad Apple prototype and you wanted to get a bad review of a bad upcoming product
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.200]   in your interplay.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:40.920]   You would essentially spend about $8.30 on a plastic bottle of vodka, douse yourself thoroughly
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:41.920]   with it.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:47.320]   You stumble into this bar and say, "Hey, Mr. I think you forgot your iPhone."
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:51.000]   Although it looks like a secret Apple prototype, I bet you're the person who works for Apple
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.840]   who might have lost it.
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.440]   Don't sell it to the press.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.120]   It seems like it just seems odd.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.280]   If we've all seen too many movies, that's the problem.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.280]   Right.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.720]   We've seen 20 bad movies.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:04.720]   Too many scripts.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.720]   Too many scripts.
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.160]   It does seem like they're dead.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.800]   That is a teaser from an upcoming Cupertino fan fiction.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.720]   Cupertino vise.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.400]   Dark Brickly held the phone case in his hand.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.160]   There was something oddly familiar yet suspicious about it.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:26.680]   "I must contact his moto straight away," he determined, hailing for a passing cat taxi
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:27.680]   cab.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.120]   "50 Shades of iPhone 4," as read by Andy Ennaco.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.280]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:41.440]   We will talk about the MacBook Air Wi-Fi issue.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:46.360]   Unfortunately, we were talking about the old Apple store in San Francisco on Market Street.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.320]   Apple wants to move it.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.040]   San Francisco officials, maybe not too thrilled.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.800]   We'll talk about what's going on there.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.040]   But first a word from Shutterstock.com.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:05.120]   Shutterstock is a great place to get great images, videos for your vectors, for your next project.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:11.400]   There are over 25 million stock photos, illustrations, vectors, and videos at Shutterstock.com.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.640]   The best search engine ever.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:19.640]   Create a free account and you can start going through images, saving them into your own light
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.480]   box so you can share them with yourself or others.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:25.080]   They've got a gorgeous iPad app.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.000]   Want a Webby Award?
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.160]   Global Country too.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.160]   Company too.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.640]   So if you are in Germany or China or Italy or Brazil or Belgium or on and on and on, they've
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.320]   got a local office, they can help you.
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:39.600]   Multilingual customer support, dedicated corporate reps, full-time customer support
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.600]   throughout the week.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.600]   It's Shutterstock.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.600]   Try the search engine.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.040]   What did you search for there, Chad?
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.040]   That's furniture.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.240]   I searched for interiors.
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.240]   Interiors.
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:51.320]   So again, it's a source of inspiration as much as it is for stock photos.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.080]   Of course, all royalty free.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.360]   You can use the photos in a variety of ways.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:00.320]   They have a spectrum tool that you drill down and say, "I only want to look at red, green,
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.320]   blue."
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.240]   Rita Brows, use for inspiration.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.680]   And if you decide you want to buy, they have a lot of affordable packages.
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.080]   I particularly like the subscriptions.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:15.600]   I get 25 images a day, which is more than enough for my modest needs at a very affordable
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.600]   price.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:17.600]   So try it today.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.600]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.760]   Just start an account and start using the Shutterstock search tool.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.960]   Save your favorite images to your light box for later review or sharing with colleagues.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.480]   Once you decide you want to buy some images or get a subscription, use our offer code
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:33.600]   Macbreak7, Macbreak7 for the month of July.
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:36.800]   We just change that every month so we know what month it was.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.600]   And you'll get 30% off.
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:39.600]   Wow.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.560]   Any new account.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:44.120]   So if you get a subscription, that's going to be a really good deal.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.640]   That's why I did that one.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:47.640]   Macbreak7@shutterstock.com.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:55.400]   Thank you so much for their support at Macbreak Weekly.
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.400]   So yeah.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.040]   I'm afraid that I have to go out.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:04.040]   I have to go out to dinner with my boss, Jerome, who I introduced here.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.960]   So I'm going to have to drop off here from here in Rwanda.
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:07.960]   Quite all right.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:08.960]   It's great to have you on.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:09.960]   Thank you so much.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.960]   How long will you be down there?
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.960]   Thanks for having me.
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:12.960]   You travel.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:13.960]   I'm just here.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.520]   I fly to Istanbul tomorrow.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.880]   And then, but I'm only there for a couple hours and I'm only home.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:23.200]   So is Istanbul on the way or you just wanted to see the red mosque?
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.240]   No, I'm just connecting to Istanbul.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:28.440]   But the reason that I'm connecting to Istanbul is because the Star Alliance Lounge in Istanbul
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.440]   is the best in the world.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.440]   Oh, really?
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.640]   If you're going to pick-- oh, my gosh.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.280]   It's just-- it's incredible.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.280]   I'll post pictures.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:40.160]   I'll put pictures up on G+, it is the most amazing Star Alliance Lounge.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.160]   That's all I got to say.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.440]   So I mean, if you're choosing which way to go, if you have to choose through South Africa
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.440]   and if you go through South Africa--
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.760]   That's a very common route, right?
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:47.760]   Go through Johannesburg.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.760]   And then you have to use South African Airways.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:53.400]   And if anyone was following me on Twitter, you can know how much I love them.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.400]   Okay.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.960]   So we'll leave that alone.
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:01.760]   And anyway, so I'd rather just take Turkish and go through Istanbul.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:02.760]   So anyway--
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.360]   You're flying Turkish air?
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.560]   Yeah, Turkish Airways.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.560]   Wow.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.880]   And so it connects through Istanbul.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.000]   So it's a one hop from Rwanda.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.960]   I mean, you stop in Ntebi, which is for like an hour to refuel or pick people up.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:21.240]   And then you go to Istanbul and then you fly straight into Chicago.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.240]   Holy cow.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.240]   From Istanbul.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.920]   And then if I'm lucky, if we get a little early, I'm going to be able to get a little
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:30.120]   bit flying over San Francisco during the 4th of July fireworks.
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:33.880]   Oh, you'll see the beautiful colored clouds that we're famous for.
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.920]   That's what I'm rooting for.
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.560]   So we'll see how that goes.
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.560]   So anyway--
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.600]   Actually, it might be-- it's supposed to be like 100 degrees and clear.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.120]   I think we're going to have a clear 4th of July.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.120]   So that's great.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.120]   Well, safe travels.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.600]   And you're going to catch fire because we're going to draw.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.600]   So anyway, yeah.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:47.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:51.760]   You know, there are people who have leaked NSA secrets who do not travel as much as
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.160]   with exotic locations as I was closing.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.160]   No.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.160]   That's amazing.
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.160]   Oh, yes.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:00.880]   I love the Star Alliance Lounge at the Constance and Opal Airport.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.920]   It's just-- I mean, it's Denver.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:06.440]   It's just-- I remember back when it was Constance and Opal.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.440]   Ask for Darla.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:11.200]   If she's working there, she'll give you three extra brown sugars for your Turkish coffee.
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.200]   Exactly.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.200]   So good.
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.200]   That's a fun.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.200]   Have fun.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.200]   We'll take care.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.200]   I'll see you guys.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.200]   All right.
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.200]   Have a good dinner.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.200]   AlexLindsay, pixelcore.com.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:25.120]   If you want to find out how you too can have a crazy travel schedule.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.120]   Just follow them.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.120]   AlexLindsay.
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:30.640]   You know, people say they love to work for us and then they actually do.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.640]   They find out.
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.040]   And then they can't remember what continent they work up in and then they quit.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:38.280]   I'm actually going to be at the-- is British Airways Star Alliance?
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.280]   I don't know.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:41.280]   I'm going to be at the Istanbul Airport in October.
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.280]   Well, then--
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.280]   I'll look for Darla.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.280]   I'll look for Darla.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.600]   But you can still use the Star Alliance if you've got enough miles.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:48.600]   Miles?
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:50.600]   Anyway.
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:51.600]   I'll just say I know Alex.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.600]   Alex--
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.480]   We're not letting you in the last time he was here.
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.640]   He drank all the gin.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.640]   All right.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.640]   All right.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.680]   We're going to give Serenity Alex a seat at the table and continue on.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:03.680]   Soldier on.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.640]   Oh, I didn't ask you for a pick, Alex.
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:06.640]   Too late.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.640]   Oh, I have one.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.040]   You want to give us one real quick?
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.400]   Yep.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.200]   So this little guy-- check this guy out.
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:15.640]   It's called the Ultra Studio Mini Recorder.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:19.720]   So what this is, is this has got Thunderbolt on one side.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.040]   There's Thunderbolt.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:24.200]   It's got SDI and HDMI on the other.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:30.880]   This is the smallest, tiniest little way to hook your HDMI or SDI camera to your laptop.
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.880]   So--
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:32.880]   Oh.
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:33.880]   --it takes power from the Thunderbolt.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:36.480]   And so it is-- it's like $150.
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:40.680]   And I didn't believe it would really work, but it-- you know, it does.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.240]   So I carried this around in my backpack.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.360]   This is kind of my backup.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:47.040]   So if I-- you know, if you ever need to hook a camera, whether it's your little handy cam
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:52.680]   that has an HDMI output or it's your, you know, a bigger SDI camera, this literally plugs
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:55.680]   into your laptop and boom, you've got it sorted.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.680]   So--
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.920]   And if you have-- this for a like, if you have live HDMI out so that you can record on the
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.920]   laptop, is that right?
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:04.160]   Yeah, which almost every-- like literally almost every video camera that you can buy
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:07.400]   at Best Buy or whatever has live HDMI out.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.120]   And it's generally less compressed.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.120]   It's like 4/4.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.120]   It's typically--
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.760]   But the main thing is, is that if you want to take one of those cameras and cheaply and
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:18.720]   easily connect it to your computer so that you can do a live stream without just a webcam.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.360]   If you want something a little bit more than a webcam and you want to have something you
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.560]   have a little bit more control over or you have and, you know, something else, you want
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:31.480]   to do a live stream to you stream or YouTube or whatever it is, this little guy can connect
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.120]   that right up for you.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:37.600]   And it's-- so I-- as I said, I was very-- I bought it thinking, well, we'll see if it
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.600]   works.
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.760]   And it-- it works great.
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:43.080]   So anyway, so if you're looking for that kind of thing, this is it.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.960]   The Ultra Studio Mini, don't get full.
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:46.400]   Don't get the up to Studio 4K.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.960]   It's a little more expensive and a little bigger.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:48.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:49.960]   The little one.
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:50.960]   Exactly.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:51.960]   The bitty, bitty, witty, witty, witty.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.080]   From Blackmagic Design, as usual, they do amazing stuff.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.080]   I just want one of everything from Blackmagic.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:58.080]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.080]   I have one of everything.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.080]   I know you do.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.080]   All right.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.080]   See you later.
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.080]   You got to travel a lot.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.480]   But on the bright side, you get one of everything from Blackmagic.
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:05.480]   It's a good deal.
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.480]   A jack-link.
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:08.480]   All right.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.480]   See you.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:12.540]   So San Francisco-- well, see, Alex was the only one who cared about this all.
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:15.000]   You guys are off on the east coast.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   But--
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.400]   I used to live in San Francisco.
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:20.080]   You remember that beautiful flagship Apple store down on Market Street?
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.080]   I do.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.080]   I spent many time in it.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.720]   Me too.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:28.800]   They want to move up closer to Union Square, which is really a better spot.
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.200]   It's kind of more central.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.040]   Not far away, a couple of blocks away.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:36.640]   The city planning department says there's too much glass.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:37.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.640]   Well, in fact, they say--
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:39.640]   I'm on the Apple store.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.520]   And in Apple store, they say there's too much glass.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.440]   It's on Post Street, too much metal on Stockton Street.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:51.900]   This is why people just get so upset with San Francisco.
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:55.700]   The plaza that would accompany it needs a friendlier entrance.
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:10:00.700]   Planners also want the project to include a circular bronze fountain by Ruth Asawa.
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:08.820]   In their defense, it is already on the block.
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:10.540]   So they just want them to keep it.
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.540]   Look at all this.
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.820]   The city's top planter said Thursday.
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:18.560]   He sees no reason Apple can't build a modern metal and glass box within the historic setting
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:19.560]   of Union Square.
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:22.620]   You just got to move that fountain.
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:27.780]   And not so much glass on Post Street, not so much metal on Stockton Street.
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:30.420]   You can just add all of the colors of iOS 7.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:32.380]   Die the glass in the metal.
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:36.380]   So it's a multi-color at Apple store, which would actually fit very well for downtown San
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:38.380]   Francisco when you think about it.
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:45.500]   See, you realize that they're kind of like tying their own nooses here, the planners,
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:48.980]   because the next time there's a big problem with the indicate that, oh, by the way, there
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:54.220]   was a major sewer line break due to lack of maintenance or that there's a heavily underserved
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:57.700]   power grid in this section, everyone can say, yeah, I see, because they didn't actually
[01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:01.860]   deal with infrastructure because they're too busy complaining about the choice of materials.
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:02.860]   Exactly.
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:04.380]   That's the whole department.
[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:05.940]   That was their entire budget.
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:12.300]   Can't you use olive wood or perhaps like a walnut texturize sort of process?
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:14.300]   We need more shrubberies.
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:18.100]   Apple clearly can't be trusted with materials at their own Apple stores.
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:19.100]   Of course not.
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:22.660]   The same thing happened here in Petaluma.
[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:28.180]   The city council told the Petaluma to tell the people building our movie theater what color
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:29.180]   to paint it.
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:33.460]   And it's the most god awful green and purple.
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:34.460]   It's just crazy.
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:35.460]   Green and purple.
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:36.460]   Joker colors.
[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:37.460]   Yeah.
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:41.140]   I don't know why anybody wants green and purple together.
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:42.140]   I know.
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:44.140]   Come see it, serenity.
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:47.100]   All colors and was specified by the city council.
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:48.100]   That's a whole fetish.
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:53.260]   It sounds like hotel room carpet or like a casino carpet.
[01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:57.580]   Like, you know, look villains, there's too much clash on Post Street and I don't like
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:01.580]   the metal on Stockton and would you put a fountain in front of it for crying out loud?
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:03.580]   It's all too matchy matchy.
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:09.060]   Are they project runway judges who have proven design architecture now?
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:10.060]   Way too elegant.
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.060]   Stop it.
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.060]   Get rid of that wickety whack.
[01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:13.980]   You got so much wickety whack.
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:18.820]   And also, Raytrium has crazy crotch going on.
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:22.700]   Project runway San Francisco.
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:27.740]   And this the company credit with two out of the best 12 designs in the last hundred years.
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.100]   All right.
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:34.860]   So if you we talked last week about the air MacBook Air Wi-Fi problems on the newest MacBook
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:39.340]   Air, I'm still not sure what's going on with mine because our Wi-Fi is a little wanky here.
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:44.020]   I've never had a problem with the Apple zone airport, the new one with the AC.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:47.900]   So I can't tell people have people have complained about it.
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:51.380]   Apple has said, remember last week we talked about capture.
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:54.660]   If somebody comes into the Apple store with Wi-Fi problems on the new MacBook Air, capture
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:55.660]   it.
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:13:00.980]   And apparently the capture plan has now gone to a capture and release program.
[01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:05.340]   They have invited people to join the Apple seed program.
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:08.940]   If you accept, we'll provide you with a pre release version of a Wi-Fi update to install
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:09.940]   on you.
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:13.820]   So I guess they think they've figured out what's wrong with the Wi-Fi and the new MacBook
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:16.300]   Airs and they're beta testing it.
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:17.300]   Anybody in our chatroom?
[01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:18.300]   Software, not hardware.
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:19.300]   Yeah.
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:20.300]   Let's cross your fingers, right?
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:22.380]   Because that's easy to fix.
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:27.460]   Anybody in the chatroom received one of these invitations as tried it?
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:29.260]   I should have complained it and complained so.
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:33.420]   I have not, but also my MacBook Air is very old.
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:36.540]   So I don't think it's going to be running into Wi-Fi problems.
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:37.540]   You're fine.
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:41.020]   It just goes blank every day, but that's another story.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:43.180]   That's another story entirely.
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:44.540]   They're not capturing those.
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:45.900]   No, they don't care.
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.900]   They don't care.
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:48.900]   Sketchy photos.
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:49.900]   I hate, you know what?
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:51.860]   If it weren't a slow news day, I wouldn't be doing this.
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:58.380]   Sketchy photos claimed to show backplate for rumored low-cost iPhone iPad 5 schematics.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:13:59.860]   You know it's low-cost.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:01.460]   It's lime-freaking green.
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:03.500]   It's like a leisure suit.
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:07.220]   It looks like the cheap cases that you buy on eBay for iPhones.
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:08.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:12.700]   Well, that might not be the actual-- if these were genuine and I'm not suggesting they
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:14.900]   aren't, that might not be the actual color.
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:17.980]   Sometimes when they're doing these sample runs, that's just whatever they happen to
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:18.980]   have.
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:25.460]   But you're going to do a low-cost phone design for tasteless poor people.
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:29.780]   I did love the article about that.
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:32.500]   Let's just go ahead and make sure we diagram that sentence.
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:37.860]   Poor people, comma, who happen to-- if that subset of poor people--
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:38.860]   It's a joke!
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:45.260]   --in the set of poor people, the subset within that set who have no taste, much as in any
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:47.100]   set of average people of--
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:49.300]   Poor people have no taste at all.
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:52.260]   You want to put too much glass on Stockton Street.
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:55.820]   I mean, wealthy people who buy with guest though, they actually launched them.
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:57.700]   They would be in iOS 7 colors.
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:01.460]   But I did like the articles claiming that they were ripping off Nokia by using these
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:02.780]   sets of tasteless colors.
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:03.780]   I thought that was-- yeah.
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:05.620]   Hey, that's Nokia's taste.
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:11.260]   They want to hit their wagon to the overwhelming success of Lumia Windows Phone.
[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:12.260]   Yes.
[01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:16.020]   Rocket ship to the stars, baby.
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:22.140]   Somebody explained to me why there's a masking tape on the back of this iPad new iPad.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:25.100]   To hold the antenna cover in place.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:26.100]   Great.
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:27.100]   That's encouraging.
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:29.020]   Those are accurate as far as I know.
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:30.260]   From what I've seen, those are accurate.
[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:34.540]   This means that the new full-sized iPad, a 10-inch iPad, will have the same basic form
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:36.100]   factor as the Mini, which makes sense.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:37.100]   I would believe that.
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.100]   Yeah.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.100]   Except for the masking tape.
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:41.100]   That's not permanent.
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:42.100]   That's for 30 bucks to construct.
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:44.060]   I'm going to use just for me so much though.
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:46.460]   It's like, oh, let's see the back plate of the room.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:47.460]   I know.
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:50.460]   Like I said, I wouldn't do this story.
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:52.620]   Yeah, if it weren't a slow week.
[01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:56.940]   Well, let's you feel bad about buying an iPad that doesn't have that design.
[01:15:56.940 --> 01:16:00.700]   So instead of feeling bad about an Apple actually launches it, you can feel bad about it 12
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:03.380]   months earlier before they have any intention of launching it.
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:08.220]   I can feel comfortable in my unsatisfaction and then still go out and buy something.
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:09.220]   Oh, consumerism.
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.980]   So you can use your education.
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:15.740]   You can pre-write your unkind review that you're going to be putting on your tumbler.
[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:19.860]   I've already written my review of all of the next six iPhones.
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:20.860]   They're boring.
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:21.860]   Boring.
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:22.860]   Oh, sad.
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:23.860]   They're falling in the process.
[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:26.540]   The once-prayed Apple computer.
[01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:27.700]   Still a phone boring.
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:34.740]   Having advocated its design mandate and a more aggressive stance towards pro to proge's
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:35.740]   money.
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.820]   Very sad.
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:39.540]   Can Apple read your eye messages?
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:41.660]   Something we've gone back and forth about.
[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:44.620]   Apple says they cannot.
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:51.500]   Matthew Green, who's a research professor at Johns Hopkins and a self-styled cryptographer,
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.940]   says he.
[01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:57.300]   Well part of it is that it's a black box.
[01:16:57.300 --> 01:17:02.300]   Apple has never said exactly what encryption they're using or how they're implementing it.
[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:06.980]   So a lot of this is kind of reading, you know, looking at a black box and kind of reading
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:08.980]   into it.
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:14.500]   Apple says they can't read them in their post on the Apple site.
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:18.380]   There are certain categories of information which we do not provide law enforcement or
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.980]   any other group because we choose not to retain it.
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:25.660]   For example, conversations which take place over, I message and FaceTime are protected
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:27.020]   by end-to-end encryption.
[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.780]   So no one but the sender and receiver can see a read them.
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:37.660]   Apple can't decrypt that data.
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:40.340]   He says he's skeptical.
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:44.900]   The biggest problem with Apple's position is it just isn't true.
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:48.900]   If you use the iCloud backup service to backup your device is a very good chance Apple can
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:57.220]   access the last few days of your eye message history.
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:59.420]   This is kind of what we talked about last week.
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:01.140]   There are two possibilities.
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:04.340]   One, eye message backups are encrypted under a key that never leaves the device.
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:10.420]   Or two, the backups are encrypted using your password as a key.
[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:15.580]   He says unfortunately neither of these choices works and it's easy to prove why.
[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:17.060]   There's a thought experiment on here.
[01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:20.220]   We don't need to go too deep into this.
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:27.020]   He says you don't really have to understand crypto to understand what's going on.
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:31.620]   If Apple has your eye for got security questions and Apple certainly keeps the answers to those
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:34.940]   questions they can decrypt it.
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:44.500]   If you didn't use iCloud backup then perhaps not, but read the article and I think he says
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:49.140]   the upshot is the integrity of eye message depends on Apple honestly handing out keys.
[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:53.900]   If they cease to be honest or if somebody compromises the eye message servers or perhaps
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:58.700]   if they're compelled to by law enforcement they can run a man in the middle and silently
[01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.180]   intercept eye message data.
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:04.980]   So I don't think it's that important except that you should not assume that eye message
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:07.780]   is fully secure.
[01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:08.780]   You can't hear it.
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:10.580]   I feel like it's so difficult to trust.
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:15.940]   Yeah, any online conversation tool that you're going to be using you have to have in the
[01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:19.140]   back of your head someone could possibly read this.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:24.180]   It's probably harder given Apple's encryption methods than it is for maybe I don't know
[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:28.420]   AOL instant messenger but there's still the possibility.
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:31.940]   If you're backing up if you're having highly sensitive conversations and then you're backing
[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:34.900]   them up to iCloud that seems like a bad idea.
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:36.620]   You can always turn that off.
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:37.620]   Right.
[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:40.460]   But you still don't know if there's some other way.
[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:42.900]   I mean it's just I just feel like you don't know if the person or the end is sporting
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:43.900]   into someone else.
[01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:44.900]   I mean there is no such a good point.
[01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:45.900]   That's a good point.
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:46.900]   That's a good point.
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:47.900]   It's not Snapchat.
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:48.900]   Even that.
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:52.260]   This message will self-destruct in five seconds.
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:53.460]   I love that idea.
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:55.060]   I'm photographing the other phone.
[01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:56.060]   I'm photographing the other phone.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:57.060]   Oh boy.
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:20:04.060]   By the way didn't they and iOS 7 didn't they turn off the feature that let's Snapchat let
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:07.660]   you know that somebody is screen-shotting screen capturing your picture.
[01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:11.980]   So people who have broken the NDA have supposedly said it in the release notes.
[01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:12.980]   Supposedly.
[01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:16.700]   Well I don't know because I don't have an NDA so I'm just saying what others have told
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:17.700]   me.
[01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:21.660]   But I think that'd be kind of cool.
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:26.740]   I just hate it when you know it says oh Leo's taking a screenshot of your Snapchat.
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:27.740]   Damn it.
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:32.220]   Again you can select a photograph of the phone with the Snapchat on it.
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:33.220]   So I mean these things limit.
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:35.660]   They make it less easy to do.
[01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:37.180]   Which I thought of that.
[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:38.180]   That's true.
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:43.100]   And given that it's still beta software that feature could be removed in the future.
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:44.100]   Yeah.
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:47.580]   That's the reason why I'm sure that everyone in this conversation has when they're talking
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:52.780]   to companies or individuals there's an email conversation that switches to why don't we
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:55.340]   talk on the phone about this next part of it.
[01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:59.460]   Because that's kind of the only way to ensure that as soon as the conversation is over with
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:01.180]   it kind of disappears.
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:04.100]   And the only thing that could possibly be left behind is.
[01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:08.060]   Yeah I mean it's more difficult.
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:11.460]   I mean people can record them but then they have to do something to describe them as opposed
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:12.460]   to it's it's.
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:15.260]   We're going to be eating a public place and not go out in the open where everybody can
[01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:16.260]   see.
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:20.020]   Now you just think I'll go again.
[01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:25.340]   I'm very disappointed my friends by the places you've choose to watch Mac Breakley Weekly.
[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:28.380]   Even though it is a summertime it is a vacation week.
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:31.660]   This is Ryan Fairchild watching in his office.
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:34.060]   Hey at least Yup.
[01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:39.860]   His Twitter handle is Who Sleeps is smoking some ribs while he watches Mac Breakley.
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:40.860]   Can you see that?
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:41.860]   No no no.
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:42.860]   Can you show that?
[01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:43.860]   I think that's.
[01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:44.860]   You can't show that.
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:47.060]   That's an indication that our shows mandate is effective.
[01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:52.100]   People are taking a break from work to enjoy some conversation about Mac and Apple and
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:54.660]   ribs and we're sticking it to the man.
[01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.140]   She's always lovely.
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:58.980]   Hey Chad could you show that please.
[01:21:58.980 --> 01:21:59.980]   Thank you.
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:01.700]   He was talking to somebody else.
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:02.700]   There's the ribs.
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:03.700]   There should be.
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:04.700]   Boy.
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:05.700]   Mmm.
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:06.700]   I'm hungry.
[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:09.300]   Bill Meakes is editing on a video on a PC while he's listening.
[01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:11.500]   Bill that's not allowed.
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:14.820]   Lance is watching the show again from his messy office.
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:16.380]   How many of you listen in a messy office?
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:17.380]   You got to stop that.
[01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:18.380]   I want you to get out.
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:19.940]   Get some fresh air.
[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:22.420]   Put some headphones in.
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:23.420]   Stop.
[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:24.420]   Okay.
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:25.420]   Let's see.
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:26.420]   Johan.
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:27.420]   He's got a few screens.
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:28.420]   Okay.
[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:30.300]   Maybe I'd stay inside if I had that many.
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:35.180]   He says that's 11,520 by 1080.
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:39.940]   When they get multi monitor support he's going to be happy.
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:42.740]   Now does that those six monitors like fold up like an accordion?
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:45.340]   I don't know what's going on in a backpack.
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:46.340]   This is just wild.
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:47.300]   I don't know if it does.
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:48.300]   That's awesome.
[01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:51.020]   I feel like I'm looking at a setup for the Matrix.
[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:52.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:54.780]   No, it's more like a shrine to St. Alex.
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:57.620]   It'd be like a couple candles in front of the middle monitor.
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:59.540]   It is a lot of Alex Lindsay.
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:06.460]   Just to tip Johan extended desktop, not mirroring, might get you a more real estate.
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:09.300]   I don't know why you'd want six of the same thing.
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:10.300]   Here.
[01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:11.500]   And some face of Alex.
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:12.700]   Maybe he's just because it's yeah.
[01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:15.460]   Maritza is watching with her.
[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:17.780]   Her babies, she says, but they look like dogs to me.
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:20.980]   But she's a little pug.
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:22.980]   A little pug dog.
[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:24.940]   Oh, the keyboard's waterproof.
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:25.940]   Yes.
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:28.100]   Strange that she puts that on the ground.
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:29.100]   Oh, there there we go.
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:33.380]   Here's somebody who likes serenity and has figured out the extended screen concept has
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:36.900]   many things going on all at the same time.
[01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:40.020]   And look, it's a cheese grater over on the right hand side there.
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:41.100]   A Mac pro.
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:43.780]   That is, I think that's Terrell.
[01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:48.820]   Yeah, I hope you enjoy putting your keyboard on top of your computer, Jerrell.
[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:51.020]   You're not be able to do that with the next one.
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:53.260]   Those fascist at Apple.
[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:57.420]   Matt, I don't want you to put your keyboard on top of things.
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:00.700]   Circular keyboards might become a standard.
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:05.260]   I mean, if you tried the hockey puck mouse, it could be next thing, like weird, Dvorak.
[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:06.260]   I don't know.
[01:24:06.260 --> 01:24:07.260]   I don't know.
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:09.260]   That was going to be like a special experiment.
[01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:13.060]   It's a spherical hover keyboard that sort of bobs on the air current.
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:14.060]   Adam works at it.
[01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:15.060]   We're not the flying.
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:16.980]   Adam works at a computer repair shop.
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:19.660]   Look at his collection of broken computers.
[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:20.660]   Wow.
[01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:21.660]   Toys.
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:23.460]   Spilling out from under the desk on the right here.
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:24.460]   Look at that.
[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:28.220]   They have a lot of problems with customers not coming to pick up their computer.
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:32.700]   Your CRT has been fixed and was waiting for you for the last four years.
[01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:35.100]   It turned out that the COVID-19 64 just simply had that key.
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:38.540]   You can't pick it up any time, sir.
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:43.220]   I don't know if the modem still works, but it was working when we fixed it in 1983.
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:48.580]   What state do you think this guy, Andrew Rogers, lives in?
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:51.460]   He's in Katie, Texas, but he's got a coffee mug from Seattle.
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:52.460]   So I don't know.
[01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:57.740]   And his poster says, think libertarian socialism is forever.
[01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:58.740]   I'm very confused.
[01:24:58.740 --> 01:24:59.740]   Look at that.
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:00.740]   Yeah.
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:01.740]   Quebecie.
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:04.980]   Here is somebody from Sweden.
[01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:08.220]   He's watching in Lulia, Sweden with his cube.
[01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:09.220]   Wait a minute.
[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:10.220]   Is that a cube?
[01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:11.220]   It is.
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:12.220]   Look.
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:13.220]   Aww.
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:14.460]   Aww.
[01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:17.220]   And there's a Nokia phone.
[01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:19.500]   Candy, candy bar phone on top of it.
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:22.100]   That's well-desired invasion.
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:26.100]   Leo, measure the lapels of you in that screen.
[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:27.860]   Maybe that might be from like 1998.
[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:29.860]   That's an old one.
[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:30.860]   That's an old one.
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:36.380]   The poster is avoiding the rain and watching inside.
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:38.100]   I'm not sure from where it isn't saying.
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:39.980]   Tell us where you're from.
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:48.340]   And finally, this fella, Joe, Joe Kounia, watching Macbreak and saw this go by his window.
[01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:54.420]   The Clides, the Budsweiser, Clidesdales, he's gone off to chase them down the street.
[01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:55.420]   Buster.
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:59.620]   We're going to take a break, come back with...
[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:00.620]   Should we talk about...
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:03.260]   Easy to story this whole thing about Apple.
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:06.340]   Wall Street Journal says Apple finds it difficult to divorce Samsung.
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:09.060]   Is Apple trying to dump Samsung?
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:10.060]   No.
[01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:13.060]   I don't think...
[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:15.660]   It's complicated, Leo.
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:16.660]   It's complicated.
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:17.660]   It's complicated.
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:21.220]   Thank you, Facebook, for giving us a phrase for that relationship.
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:23.860]   Awkward, Fourth of July dinner.
[01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:25.860]   Stay quiet today.
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:26.860]   Block and unfollow.
[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:27.860]   Boy.
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:30.060]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:31.900]   Come back with our picks of the week.
[01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:36.060]   Actually, this one's going to be you too, Andy, because it's AudibleTime, Audible.com,
[01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:38.540]   the greatest audio bookstore in existence.
[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:40.460]   Over 100,000 titles.
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:42.940]   All the best books read by great actors.
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:47.100]   If you read that New York Times article about how many actors are reading books now, and
[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:50.660]   of course, they mention Audible because Audible Studios are near Broadway.
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:51.980]   They've got nine studios.
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:54.500]   They're in there and they're bringing in the best voices.
[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.580]   You know what they're doing, which is great.
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:56.580]   They've got this...
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:27:00.980]   Among other things, this Audible Frontiers program where they're taking classic sci-fi
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:05.980]   that's never been made into audiobooks, getting great actors to read them.
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:11.740]   If you're a sci-fi fan, Audible is manna from heaven, but you don't have to...
[01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:12.740]   You know, you know me.
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:14.460]   I love my Audible books.
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:19.660]   Right now I'm listening to Peter F. Hamilton's Great North Road, which is just fabulous.
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:24.100]   Another classic sci-fi from one of the great sci-fi authors.
[01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:27.580]   What do you said you had something good you're listening to, Andy?
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:29.380]   I've got something good on deck.
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:30.380]   This is good.
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:34.020]   I've selected this as good summer beach reading for nerds.
[01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:38.700]   Kevin Mitnick has written a couple of books, but he was one of the first, like, second
[01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:40.860]   or third, like really highly publicized.
[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:45.340]   The FBI shut him down and he put him in jail and then he went under right books about his
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:46.340]   experience.
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:50.140]   The first one was about sort of a business book almost, a technical book.
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:53.020]   The second one is the one I'm recommending.
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:57.740]   It's called Ghost in the Wires, My Adventures as the World's Most Wanted Hacker.
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:04.140]   This is written kind of more like a memoir written by somebody who did some naughty things
[01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:06.620]   years ago and it was...
[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:10.300]   The events are still recent enough that he can still reconstruct exactly what he did
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:15.020]   and what he was thinking at the time, but it's long enough ago that he can be, "Oh, I
[01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:19.260]   remember that time that the FBI had to flee my apartment and to sue my new idea because
[01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:22.020]   the FBI was on my tail for federal crimes."
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:24.780]   Who doesn't have a story like that?
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:27.900]   It'd almost be weird if I didn't.
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:34.540]   And so when I realized that this is actually this is a book that I was sent for review when
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:37.900]   it first came out a couple of years ago and I read the first couple chapters and liked
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:42.220]   it, but like paper books is like you don't wind up reading those things.
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:43.700]   And then so I got the audiobook.
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:49.460]   What I liked about the bits of it that I read in hardcover is that this is sort of like
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:50.980]   this exact analogy.
[01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:55.260]   You see these movies about like the elegant gentleman's safe cracker, like the elegant
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:57.420]   like cat burglar jewel thief.
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:29:02.380]   And so his story in this book is from a different time where it's like, "I'm not going to steal
[01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:03.500]   people's credit card numbers.
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:04.500]   I don't want to...
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:05.500]   I don't want to pillage the castle.
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:09.580]   I just want to walk around and see what's inside there and satisfy my curiosity."
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:11.300]   This is the guy I just simply want to steal.
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:14.540]   This was what has been stolen from somebody else and steal from the rich and I want to
[01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:15.540]   be elegant.
[01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:22.500]   So it's the difference between that kind of a criminal and the kind who wants to smash
[01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:28.100]   every window in the jewelry store, hold guns on the employees, maybe put a gun butt to
[01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:29.660]   the head of the guard.
[01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:32.300]   It's not so that's why you can be entertained by this.
[01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:36.100]   This isn't about somebody who was stealing hundreds of thousands of credit cards and
[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:38.580]   selling them to an organized crime.
[01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:41.020]   That would come other people much, much later.
[01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:48.380]   So you can actually read it like a light thriller with lots of details about where it goes into
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:53.420]   detail is mostly about as usual the most powerful weapon, which is social engineering.
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:57.340]   Just get a phone number, call somebody, give them the right story and get them to give
[01:29:57.340 --> 01:30:02.660]   you that information that is by voice, the information that is very, very tightly secured
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:04.660]   by microchip.
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:05.660]   So good stuff.
[01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:07.500]   It's also a 14-hour book.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:12.780]   But it's more like a beach book than a technical book, by any means.
[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:18.460]   And we also interviewed him on triangulation a little while back where Leo did it.
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:21.980]   And I've been listening to this one for a while.
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:24.580]   And yeah, absolutely, really good.
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:28.660]   Meanwhile, I will double my recommendation for Neil Gaiman's last book, The Ocean at
[01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:30.020]   the End of the Lane.
[01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:31.500]   Beautiful book.
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:33.180]   Just finished it like last week.
[01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:34.660]   I was saving it for a car trip.
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:40.420]   And it really was-- it did cost me an extra $4 in gas because I just wanted to keep driving
[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:41.900]   and get to the end of this.
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:47.860]   And yeah, I mean, it's a great crossover book because there are people who really like what
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:49.140]   the Gaiman does.
[01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:50.700]   And there's lots of that in there.
[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:54.820]   And there are people who might have been put off by his previous books because they are
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:57.380]   of a certain genre, they are of a certain type.
[01:30:57.380 --> 01:31:01.140]   And this one is a lot more relatable and a lot more human because of the way it's narrated.
[01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:04.580]   But another good book, I highly agree, Neil Gaiman is amazing.
[01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:07.260]   Have you started listening to that yet?
[01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:09.700]   I finished The Ocean at the End of the Lane.
[01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:15.020]   I have-- I've read the first two or three chapters of Ghost in the Wire in Hardcover.
[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:19.380]   And this is one of those things where I occasionally have to go through review copies of books
[01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:21.860]   and decides which I'm going to keep, which I'm going to donate, and which I would not
[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:24.060]   inflict even on my local library.
[01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:25.740]   And was reminded of, oh, I like that.
[01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:26.740]   Why did I not read this?
[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:28.740]   Oh, because it's a hardcover and you don't do this thing.
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:30.780]   We cover carry on hard covers anymore.
[01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:33.900]   And so knowing that I still have a couple of audible credits, so--
[01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:34.980]   But, oh, quick, we'll get that one.
[01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:36.460]   I got two.
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:37.940]   I know what I'm doing.
[01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:38.540]   How about you?
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:40.380]   You got your Audible credit and get one for free.
[01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:44.860]   If you go to audible.com/macbreak, you'll be signing up for the gold account.
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:45.860]   That's the book a month account.
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:47.100]   But your first 30 days are free.
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:49.340]   You can cancel anytime in that first 30 days.
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:50.740]   Keep the book forever.
[01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:51.740]   Pay nothing.
[01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:53.300]   I don't think you're going to want to cancel.
[01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:56.940]   But we know that maybe some people are a little nervous about the idea of audiobook.
[01:31:56.940 --> 01:31:57.940]   So try it.
[01:31:57.940 --> 01:31:59.100]   I think you'll like it.
[01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:01.460]   Either one of those would be an excellent first book.
[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:07.500]   But there's 100,000 to choose from audible.com/macbreak.
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:09.700]   We interviewed Kevin when that book came out.
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:12.580]   And I thought I had a copy, but I do not.
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:15.220]   Must have brought it to hell.
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:17.180]   Let us get our picks of the week.
[01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:22.820]   I'm going to start all the way over to my right, Mr. Renee Richie of iMore.com.
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:26.820]   So Warner Brothers is having a sale for all of their iOS apps.
[01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:28.740]   Not their Mac app sadly, but their iOS apps.
[01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:30.660]   And that includes a lot of the Lego games.
[01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:32.500]   You can get them for 99 cents now.
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:38.380]   And I am a huge fan of the Lego series, especially the older ones, especially Lego Batman.
[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:41.340]   I used to play that with my God kids.
[01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:43.540]   Four years old, seven years old.
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:44.900]   We had a great time.
[01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:47.580]   We played it on the Xbox or on the PlayStation 3.
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:50.500]   I've played a little bit of it on the iPad with them as well.
[01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:52.460]   It's timeless.
[01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:55.660]   It's a fantastic way for people of many ages to play.
[01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:57.020]   Great game for families.
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:59.540]   You can have multiple players, especially on the consoles.
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:01.700]   On iOS, it's more of a personal experience.
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:04.540]   But just in the original games, they didn't have any voices.
[01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:09.700]   So they had to do everything just through the presentation, the animation and the interaction.
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:14.340]   And it was just completely delightful from the characters you could get to all the different
[01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:16.620]   situations they were in.
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:22.140]   And for anyone who's a longtime fan of DC Comics or Star Wars or Indiana Jones or Harry
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:26.700]   Potter or any of the games that they have the Lego equivalents for, it's a great way
[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:29.820]   to relive those memories in a new way.
[01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:34.540]   And for people who just love those sort of family-friendly games that give you a bit
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:37.940]   of a story but more you could just play together and have fun together.
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:39.180]   They're wonderful for that too.
[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:42.380]   And I especially Lego Batman, the Lego Star Wars ones as well.
[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:43.620]   I can't recommend them enough.
[01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:47.500]   Now I'm confused because this is Batman, but it's everybody in the DC world all together.
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:48.500]   The second one.
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:52.900]   So the original one is just Batman and there's a part two now where they have his friends,
[01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:56.660]   Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, all join him for even more superhero.
[01:33:56.660 --> 01:33:57.660]   Frolics and fun.
[01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:01.820]   Yeah, this looks, is there comic book violence or is it just?
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:04.620]   Well, I mean, if you hit the Lego guy hard enough, you breaks down into little blocks
[01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:06.660]   and then has to reassemble himself.
[01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:11.380]   It is the best demonstration of death free video game.
[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:12.380]   Awesome.
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:13.380]   Explosions, I can say.
[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:14.380]   It's lovely.
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:15.380]   Yeah.
[01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:16.380]   I love it.
[01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:18.260]   All right, I'm down 99 cents.
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:19.980]   I'm downloading it.
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:20.980]   That's great.
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:22.740]   Is there an iPad or iPhone?
[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:23.740]   All right.
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:24.740]   Yeah.
[01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:25.740]   And again, the console versions are better.
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:30.340]   But because you can play with the whole family, everyone sitting around the living and playing.
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:33.540]   But the iPad version is great, you know, just one on one.
[01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:36.460]   Serenity, did we warn you that we would like a pick from you?
[01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:38.780]   I got a last minute warning from Chad that you did.
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:40.620]   I kind of figured it out.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:41.620]   Sure.
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:46.900]   Actually, I will share what I'm using to podcast, which is that I have all these really lovely
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:50.460]   audio technica mics that I bought when I was doing radio plays a few years back.
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:54.740]   So I didn't want to buy like a Yeti or a different mic to podcast with.
[01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:58.220]   So I'm like, I spent so much money on these beautiful mics.
[01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:03.940]   But blue microphones also sells this really cool thing called the icicle, which hooks
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:04.940]   up via XLR.
[01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:06.620]   I'm picking it up now.
[01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:07.620]   Oh, break it.
[01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:08.620]   It's up via XLR.
[01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:10.100]   Oh, it's it's really sturdy.
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:12.780]   It like it's plastic, but it feels completely sturdy.
[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:14.740]   And I've tossed it around a bunch of times.
[01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:16.620]   It just hooks in via XLR to your mic.
[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:20.420]   And then the other way via USB and connects and auto plug and play.
[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:21.420]   No problem.
[01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:24.580]   Just a little switch for gain, but everything else is either controlled through your computer
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:26.340]   or through your original microphone.
[01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:27.340]   And I love it.
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:29.620]   I think I paid 69 for it.
[01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:34.420]   I think it's probably been discounted since then a little bit, but it's a awesome, awesome,
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:37.940]   little, little gadget for hooking up mics you already own.
[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:40.660]   Converts pro mics into USB mics.
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:42.380]   So tell me about the radio plays.
[01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:44.660]   Did you, did you stop doing that?
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:46.020]   I still do them occasionally.
[01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:52.020]   The incomparable just did a radio play a couple months back, which I directed and did a couple
[01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:57.900]   voices for, but that was my my college major was experimental theater and including in
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:02.660]   that were radio plays and mask work and all kinds of fun stuff that you do when you're
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:04.460]   not doing traditional plays.
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:06.140]   Mask work is really cool.
[01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:07.140]   I love it.
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:11.020]   Yeah, something happens when you put that mask on.
[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:14.100]   So yeah, it's always been a dream of mine to do that here in the studio.
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:17.780]   Like Saturday nights have problems getting great scripts.
[01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:21.980]   Yeah, we actually have David Lauer, who's a playwright in the.
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:27.660]   Midwest and also a fan of the incomparable wrote us this amazing radio play script for
[01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:32.460]   the incomparable for April Fools, which we put together and performed and it was just,
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:33.900]   it was too much fun.
[01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:38.620]   Thrilling adventure hour in Los Angeles also does radio plays right now and they do ongoing
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:41.700]   scripts with B list and C list actors.
[01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:47.220]   You'll get Nathan Fillion coming in to do a do spots is a great podcast.
[01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:53.620]   For podcast, five by five.tv slash incomparable with Jason and Glenn Fleischman, Scott McNaughton.
[01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:54.620]   Dan Warren.
[01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:55.620]   Dan Warren.
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:56.620]   It's a great great.
[01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:57.620]   That's a good cast.
[01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:58.620]   A lot of fun.
[01:36:58.620 --> 01:36:59.620]   We had a lot of fun.
[01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:00.620]   I hope we do more.
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:02.620]   Yeah, the April Fools edition.
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:03.620]   I was I did that.
[01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:08.420]   I did a couple of roles on the show too and it was just it was even just like four hours
[01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:13.300]   of here is what the recording session was like perhaps edited down to two and a half.
[01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:14.300]   Yeah.
[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:18.820]   And I forgot that I was directing you while barely having any voice.
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:22.740]   It was very that's that's that's a compliment because that indicates what a chameleon I
[01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:23.740]   am when I am.
[01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:24.740]   It's true.
[01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:26.980]   You just go into your role.
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:28.300]   I really want to do that to me.
[01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:29.980]   The only thing holding us back is the scripts.
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:35.700]   I just want to do good scripts and the problem with the old time radio theater is all exposition.
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:36.700]   It is.
[01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:37.700]   And I hate it.
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:38.700]   Which can be fun.
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:42.100]   If you have if you have a good expository character as a cornball actor.
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:43.100]   Yeah, it's a little cornball.
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:44.100]   It's a style.
[01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:48.100]   But I think that we could do real stuff.
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:51.380]   You know, you don't have to do cornball stuff.
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:56.740]   If we could only get some scripts, there's only an army of people who could maybe have
[01:37:56.740 --> 01:37:58.340]   a scriptwriter among them.
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:37:59.340]   We're listening.
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:02.900]   If you've got a script what we for a while what we thought we would be able to get is
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:08.100]   kind of un unproduced scripts from from screenwriters who were just, you know, wanted a workshop
[01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:09.700]   them or something like that.
[01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:10.700]   Mm hmm.
[01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:12.660]   Anyway, still still working on it.
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:13.660]   We've got mics too.
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:17.260]   Andy and I go your pick of the week.
[01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:21.180]   This is a new comic book reader for for iPad that I recently came across.
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:23.940]   It's called comic.
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:25.980]   It's called comic rack.
[01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:29.940]   And when someone recommended to me, I thought, why is it called comic crack?
[01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:32.500]   Cause rack.
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:38.420]   And it is very much it is very much like in in line with what I was seven is doing.
[01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:42.580]   My previous, my other favorite reader is kind of skeuomorphic where it puts, organizes
[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:46.140]   everything into like virtual long boxes and virtual shelves.
[01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:49.660]   This one takes a more well, let's just organize them the way that people might want to get
[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:50.660]   at them.
[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:57.060]   So it's it's you have a CBR CBZ PDF reader and it automatically makes these like sort of
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:39:00.380]   or automatic organization playlist, so to speak.
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:04.780]   So that right now this showing me all the all the comics and all the titles that I have
[01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:05.780]   in here.
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:10.580]   You can also just have it please show me just the ones that I've recently been reading recently
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:12.900]   opened and that will just simply take you right there.
[01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:16.900]   And then the reader itself is really, really nice to see.
[01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:18.740]   Well, that's where I hit.
[01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:23.460]   And so because not only is it a good navigator, but the other readers don't do things like
[01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:28.980]   this where if you want to just jet all the way to a specific page or to a specific section,
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:32.660]   it's easy to just teleport like straight to where you want to go.
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:36.540]   It keeps your place very nicely.
[01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:37.540]   Like that there you go.
[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:39.180]   It keeps your place very nicely.
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:42.980]   It's good for managing lots of different series and lots of different things that you're into
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:44.820]   at the same time.
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:49.100]   And it's very it's not as it doesn't have that nice guided view that you get like in
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:53.500]   the comics, all of your reader, but look how nice that is that when you go to the when
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:59.540]   you when you're go from reading, when you go from from reading the book to basically
[01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:00.940]   back to navigating.
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:03.580]   Like this gives you everything reminds you, here's the cover of the title that you're
[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:05.260]   looking at here, the pages that you're at.
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:10.180]   And if you go back to the library, I mean, it's very much like the Kindle app with lots
[01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:11.660]   of style lots of organization.
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:14.100]   I mean, even the color scheme is a little bit like the Kindle app.
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:20.540]   So if they if if Amazon wants to improve their kind of stuff, comic book reader, because
[01:40:20.540 --> 01:40:25.060]   they do buy they do sell comics through the store and simply buy this buy out this company.
[01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:27.620]   I think they would be doing a very good favor for themselves.
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:32.740]   It's not cheap as as iOS apps goes 799, which is not a ridiculous amount of money, but it's
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:38.860]   the sort of thing where I it's I'm I'm it's you might be grateful that someone is showing
[01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:41.860]   it to you and there's videos of it online that you can take a look at.
[01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:46.620]   I do I do buy almost all my comics on complexology these days because all the ones I want to
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:48.260]   know available on complexology.
[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:52.060]   But sometimes for those really, really old like plastic man, police comics and like comics
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:56.780]   for the 30s and 40s, you'd and other stuff that's like hasn't been actually printed in the
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:58.980]   United States in 10 or 20 30 years.
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:03.580]   You do still like acquire a lot of CBRs and CBZs and this is a really, this is a really,
[01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:06.540]   really great app for reading that stuff.
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:07.540]   Very good.
[01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:08.540]   Comic comic.
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:09.780]   Cart comic.
[01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:10.780]   Comic.
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:11.780]   Comic crack.
[01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:12.780]   Yes.
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:13.780]   It's also multi platform.
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:16.420]   So if you also have Android, if you also use windows, you can also get readers for those.
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:18.580]   Yeah, I saw that that's awesome.
[01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:20.580]   A couple more from our viewers.
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:24.140]   This is Martin Wetterings in bread bread of the Netherlands.
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:29.700]   And he's doing a rape reprise of one of our other pictures.
[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:31.420]   And I like the wooden background.
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:34.260]   It's very skeuomorphic and also the way he's a lot.
[01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:35.260]   That's where it went.
[01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:36.260]   Yeah, that's where it went.
[01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:40.700]   And he's aligned the monitors by height, which I think is a great, you know, very, very
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:42.900]   good thing to do.
[01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:47.500]   Here's somebody who's watching while working another, you know, we were talking about multi
[01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:48.500]   monitors.
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:51.100]   A lot of people have multiple monitor displays.
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:58.620]   Here's a guy who's tweeting from his BlackBerry 9930 while he's working on his PC Mac iPad
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:04.100]   Mini and a few other things in the background there.
