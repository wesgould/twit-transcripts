[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.880]   Listening in and joining us from Montreal, Canada is the lovely and talented Renee Richie. Hi Renee
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.340]   Hey Leo, how are you you and I kind of swapped
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.620]   Opening day pictures from our local Apple stores. The only difference is yours were in French mine were in English
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.540]   Internationalize it the blue car
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.780]   What was it the playground iPhone?
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.300]   But it was bigger than big right so if you can't complete now could go
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.900]   And mine said bigger than big it was cute with a little iris
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.980]   Sculpture that they do there and we'll talk a little bit more about that because Renee and I both were in line
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.140]   Also here Alex Lindsey who not only was not aligned still doesn't have his iPhone you poor poor man
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:35.340]   However, you survive I don't it was it was early in the morning here. I'll lend you mine for the show up in pre
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.580]   There we go. Thank you. No, I got up in
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.220]   Here you go. I had trouble logging in first thing in the morning
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.340]   And then I thought about it and half my company sat in line and I was we have big projects coming up
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.700]   I have my company sat and I joined them. I didn't as a fearless leader
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.340]   That is the one I've ordered online that night from Verizon
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.380]   I was able to get one from spring one from Verizon, but not ever from Apple so I went to the store
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.700]   But we'll do that. Also here mr. Andy cannot go from the Chicago Sun times
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.020]   How are you today? I am fine. I speak English well I learned it from a book
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.940]   Handy which phone did you choose?
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.300]   Well, I chose well, it's a misnomer because these are both Apple owners, so
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.900]   You're on the list I have one of each
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.740]   And I think even hold up to right side up. I've got to say that I'm leaning towards the iPhone 6 plus
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.420]   because I
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.580]   Am due for my I'm now off contract on phones
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.500]   And so now I'm free to purchase another one through through my carrier
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.300]   And if I were to buy it on discount as opposed to owning an outright, I think it's gonna be the six plus
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.180]   It's it's very much in line with my needs. I will I would definitely vote for it for a running for open position on my school board
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.900]   Reflects my values. It's the phone that I would most like to have a beer with so to speak Apple did quite a few
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.380]   LONORS this year. I saw reviews the Wednesday before the phones went on sale
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.960]   By of course Molly Wood at the New York Times, but then also by David Pope formerly of the New York Times by
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.100]   Walt Mossberger Walt Mossberg
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.740]   formerly of the Wall Street Journal and now recode
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:23.620]   And and you got one and did you also Renee Richie get review units?
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.540]   I bought the six plus but I got a review unit for the six. Okay
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:36.260]   And so it's just really Alex each of us has two phones and Alex has none that seems unfair
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.220]   But he has a fast-rising and exciting company that's at the forefront of a vital technology
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.940]   Change to reshape our world frankly, I'll swap him
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.620]   What about a crane camera?
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.620]   Never that's right. I mean
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.820]   I got up
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.780]   I got up it was very late or actually very early and I
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.020]   And I did order and then I couldn't get on and then I didn't get back to it until later that morning
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.020]   And then I was three weeks to wait
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.020]   This makes me sad so let's talk about
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:13.100]   So Alex you just have to recuse yourself actually Alex you're playing with everybody's your arginny pig by the way behind that
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.100]   Okay, so I are guinea pig because you haven't bought yet
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.220]   And are you like I did or most of the United States of America and soon China and the rest of the world
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.540]   In a conundrum and a country it is very upsetting for me
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.420]   It's it the the whole thing is is it if the image optical if the optical image stabilization was on the small one
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.780]   It would be a no-brainer like I wouldn't even think of a more point. Let me just point out something real quickly that I think is significant
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.220]   These are identical except for size right and now the red the pixels per inch or not
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.260]   But but it's not like you get more icons on the screen you get an extra road don't you know?
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:58.260]   Now this is not zoomed. This is standard. Yeah zoomed way would take away a row as a matter of a wait until developers start targeting that screen
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:04.340]   Just like when the first iPad mini came out. It was just every single full-sized iPad app only like
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:10.620]   Optically shrunk down and then after a few months people started targeting that user interface and making it better
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.060]   So we're not see we're seeing that a little bit with some of the Apple made apps
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.540]   But I think that we're gonna really see this as like as like an entirely new like device platform
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:26.460]   And that's another really important point for today, which is many many apps are not scaled properly at all
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.140]   So this is Google plus none of the Google apps were modified for the new resolution
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.060]   So this is Google plus basically as it would have been on the 5s or the or any other phone
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.060]   scalars pretty good though especially on the on the
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.860]   5 plus on the 6 plus because it's got so much such a high density
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.900]   On the 6 you'll see the little line wave sometimes because it's scaling it
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.300]   But on the 6 plus the density is so high you can barely see this yeah, but I got a point okay
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.980]   So again look at this
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.540]   Here this is exactly you're seeing exactly the same thing. Yeah, it's not likely
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.900]   So you're using more of the screen at all and so these are fairly fairly big tech now again
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.140]   This is for an unmodified app
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.060]   Your absolute right and it will soon be better investment
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.900]   Go ahead
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.700]   I'm saying if you have an app like the Kindle reader where you can adjust font sizes
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:23.940]   Suddenly you can make the font a lot smaller than you had on the even on the regular 6 and still be nicely readable
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.860]   So even today, it's even a good idea. I think in the future though. It's gonna be even better
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.940]   I would I have been continuing my little experiments with with keyboards
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.980]   This is not a pick of the week. Although I'm just gonna give you a preview
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.380]   There is somebody who has the stowaway keyboard those really really awesome
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:49.260]   folding keyboard that you these these two sides like fold in to make a continuous keyboard and then this folds up flat
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:54.740]   Perfectly flat like this and you wind up with this package inside your pocket. So here's well
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.740]   Let's stick on this
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:01.500]   I don't want to get too crazy. We got lots of stuff to talk about. Okay, let's let's continue with the resolution
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.580]   So these are apples app presumably up to date
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:08.140]   Yeah, and you can rotate it on the six plus Leo so you get the
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.580]   If you don't have it. Yeah
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:19.000]   You know why if Apple didn't rotate the home screen the springboard
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.680]   I wouldn't I would leave it on but I hate it when springboard rotates, right?
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:28.020]   So you get this you get the iPad style of app on horizontal. That's nice
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:34.880]   Yeah, but I but see what I don't like is that is when this happens ooh, but even we if we have that resolution is it?
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.480]   It still won't actually load iPad apps correct or does no
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:47.420]   Still runs iPhone and also it doesn't have a lot of the nice features of the iPad like a lot of the four-finger gestures for navigation
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:54.280]   The system. Why don't work? I don't believe it works with the some of the iPad accessories through the lightning adapter
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.920]   So it's very much still a super big iPhone as opposed to an iPad that's smaller
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.360]   Which I think is kind of a bummer because I think that it would be I mean
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.620]   I would replace my mini with it with the larger one that would be more
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:10.020]   More of a temptation for me. Yeah, well, I'm saying that over the past week
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.620]   I have been using keyboards with this
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.040]   I've been doing a lot of experiments that way and I find that a lot of reasons why I would like just
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.560]   Toss an iPad in the bag because I'm going out for the afternoon is now being replaced with well
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.640]   I've got the iPhone 6 plus maybe I'll just grab this pocket keyboard in case I want to write something
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.540]   But otherwise I'm gonna be good. So here is app presumably Apple mail is updated, right?
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:35.380]   So as soon as that this loads, I'll show you so this is a nice spam message
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.340]   But I didn't want to show you anything any personal details in it
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.340]   So bail arm you're getting a free at
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:46.580]   Mail list when you turn it later. Yeah, so when you turn it sideways like that, I like that and that actually is probably the best
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.980]   Example of why a bigger screen right is useful because of course you that doesn't do anything
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.180]   That's because of all those new adaptive UI classes
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.100]   So you have compact and regular classes and this iPhone presents itself as an
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.780]   Basically developers can target it as an iPad and horizontal view right right?
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.740]   so I
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.180]   Don't see a lot of again. This is this is the segment which we help you decide which to buy
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.980]   Yeah, this is this is one of my chief problems
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.900]   I really only actually wear one shirt that has different colors and
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:21.860]   This is my problem this barely it fits beautifully. What are you talking about?
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:27.180]   Now you're probably gonna want a case so you probably should include the case right once you have a case on it
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.780]   It gets this one fits better. Yeah, you need pockets of holding I know exactly
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:35.740]   So yeah, so okay, so new apps will come out that will take advantage of the
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.100]   Real estate and that won't look scaled
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.780]   I have to say I see the scaling but there won't look scaled
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.740]   And then we saw this happens every time
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:52.660]   There's OIS in the six plus not in the six although a lot of people are saying the low light performance of the six is
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:58.640]   Excellent the OIS doesn't turn on unless you're in a low and do you have you have you done any like real side-asides or or
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:07.060]   Renee, I'm actually going to be doing my really intensive eight way side-by-side comparison tests Wednesday and then into Thursday
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:12.780]   I did some quick stuff with it in the backyard and in like in basically in darken rooms
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:19.220]   I think that you can in the right situation. You certainly can see the enhancement of these six plus the I don't think you're correct
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:24.660]   I do think it's always image state always alright. I believe it's a believe that it's always on there are the
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:31.060]   But the reason why the iPhone 6 does such a good job in the light is that there are a bunch of other tricks behind the scenes for instance
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.420]   there is a
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:39.540]   Three shot behind the scenes trick that they're doing so that let's say that you're you're taking a picture of somebody inside a church
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.580]   It will take one show it will take a sequence of three shots without you knowing it the first shot will be
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:52.820]   a long exposure to capture whatever is not moving around like the actual church and then it will actually look
[00:11:52.820 --> 00:12:00.460]   Combine that with those two other pictures to find sharp areas in which people weren't moving and combine that synthetically into one shot
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:05.620]   That looks where everything looks like it's nicely in focus. So there's a lot of elf and magic behind those
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.420]   Hollow tree it is an amazing camera on both phones. Yeah
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:17.380]   Yeah, Renee and we did some tests with them and it's really close the six is phenomenal
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.660]   I like to but you can just see the things we if you zoom them up
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:25.780]   You can see that the way it handles the pixels on the six plus is it's better. It's less noisy
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:30.780]   I it's one of those things where if you buy the thousand dollar lens as opposed to the five hundred dollar lens
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.220]   Some people can tell it apart. You know probably you can tell it apart. Yeah, it's harder for me
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:40.860]   Well, I think it's the difference between Instagram and then your grandchildren 20 years later
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:46.060]   Almost I mean seriously almost every phone that you buy today. That's a halfway decent phone
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:51.500]   We'll take a picture. That's just fine for Instagram or Facebook. The question is 20 years later when
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:59.700]   You realize that oh that was the last time that we really had everyone all the family from Chicago and Boston and San Francisco all in the same place together and
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:06.300]   You you're glad that you had the iPhone 6 plus because this is something that will take a picture good enough to actually
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.540]   Print out and put on the back of your sofa table. Whereas the other cameras are like, okay
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:18.940]   That's nice. We'll put that on the Apple TV mark 21 and we'll wish that grandpa actually used a proper camera
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:24.220]   Actually, you know, I can actually see a little bit of well. This is not a good set test
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:32.780]   And like I said my processor is doing so much work in the background. Yeah. Yeah, also being the face time the front facing camera is doing interesting things to
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.460]   The the front facing camera here
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.900]   Francis does one they could they're calling it one shot HDR and we'll do it automatically
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.820]   So if you're doing like a selfie like this if you're doing chat
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.460]   It will automatically switch to a mode where it is
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:52.740]   aesthetically producing an optimized image so that the higher exposure in the background is not going to be quite as dramatic as the
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:57.020]   Between the exposure in the foreground sometimes that kind of in my experience over the past weekend
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:01.060]   There if you give it a really bad lighting situation like I was shooting a video
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:07.340]   We can see it on YouTube in the backyard kind of like a couple hours before sunset and it's in shade
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:12.060]   And so and this is a 1.2 megapixel camera. Let's let's not forget this on the iPhone 6
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:17.180]   And so because of the HDR the colors are a little bit odd, but the tonality is right there
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.060]   So there's so much so much tricks out there
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.940]   That's why you really do have to take it out and rock and roll with it for a few days before you appreciate
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:29.340]   That has specs that go beyond what the actual hardware is how long have you've had it for more than a week now?
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.460]   Is that right?
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.500]   No, I've had it since Friday. Oh, okay. Okay
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:41.220]   So, okay, so we're just talking about differences obviously screen resolution camera and then battery life. How about that?
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:47.700]   It's a monster. I go to sleep and it's still a 38% which is nuts that for the 6 plus
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:54.060]   Yeah, I have I have yet to put when I'm finally wrapping up my last Android phone stuff today
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.340]   Which means I can finally put my sim in this AT&T iPhone
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:02.100]   So it's only been used on Wi-Fi for the since Friday, but I
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.580]   Was charged up fully on Friday and had her charge it again today
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:11.860]   And that's a guy who's been spending all weekend playing with it and watching movies with it and listen to music with it
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.180]   It's just a monster this iPhone 6 plus battery 6 plus
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.820]   If you're about the six now, what's the battery life for the six the six is good
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:25.020]   I think I would put it at a little bit better than what you get on the I've on the iPhone 5s
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:29.100]   But not so dramatically better that it would influence your buying decision
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:33.060]   I mean if you're there are a lot of people who actually have tethering on their
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.420]   iPads because they can just use that as your two-day
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.980]   Broadband waifs waste the base station
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:45.820]   I think that this is gonna attract a lot of people for the same reason if you're using this also as your internet access point as you travel
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:52.780]   Or even spending the day outside the office you will be able to after using this as your base station for your for your Mac book
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:57.540]   Or any other notebook all day long you'll be able to board the commuter train home and still have enough juice left
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.140]   To have a good time on that train ride home. I
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:07.300]   Got the exact same thing the battery life as some people have been confused because when you first install if you're stored from a backup
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.380]   It's it's got to download everything again. It's got a reindex spotlight. There's a lot of stuff going on
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.940]   So the first couple days it's hard to get good battery readings
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:21.300]   But it's it's lasting a little bit longer than my iPhone 5s nowhere nearly as long as a 6 plus and to Andy's point on Roger's now
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.180]   Roger's LTE is obscene. It's not even LTE advanced yet
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:30.740]   But they've got I think of 15 to 20 lanes of LTE and I'm getting 90 down in my in my condo and 90 down at Starbucks
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.700]   To which is twice as fast as my broadband turn off Wi-Fi. I'm curious what the
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:41.220]   AT&T is giving us here in the studio. I don't think AT&T has the enhanced. I think Verizon's the only Verizon
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.900]   Well, this is a Verizon. Let me turn off. Let me I got 90 down on
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.460]   Josh's T-Mobile
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:51.180]   That's because no one uses yeah, it's probably true. I just got I just got I
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.980]   suggested I
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.540]   Want a Wi-Fi calling a couple of other points. Yeah T-Mobile has Wi-Fi calling that's that was my number one
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:03.140]   Apple store was telling us and I asked several people the T-Mobile is locked to T-Mobile. It is not carrier locked we have learned
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:07.580]   I bought mine completely on and another point which I think is great is the Verizon version
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:12.700]   Is a SIM card unlocked as it has been in the past which is very good news because
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:17.380]   For instance, I could take this to England have Verizon here get all those bands of
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:24.140]   LTE but still take it to England and use T-Mobile and have the free international and also now the new Verizon will allow you to do both
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.580]   data and voice
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.920]   Voice of reality. I think so. Yeah, so now you can so let me turn off
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.780]   Because I'm curious what we're gonna get here now. I don't know
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.540]   What Verizon is like normally here, so all right
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:44.740]   So I think is that all of all of the pros and cons that we would need to make help Alex make the right choice
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:51.660]   size obviously battery life to me the camera number one thing for me is just knowing how much of a difference the
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:57.100]   Optical image stabilization is and it seems like not much if you wait well, I doubt it
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:57.980]   I'm again
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.740]   I have not done my intensive tests yet
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:06.460]   But the last every time I do this once a year where I truly fill my pockets with like eight different phones and a real camera and
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.260]   Every single time the only shots in which I can tell that
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:16.540]   The iPhone 5 or the 5s has not done as well as the others are the ones where the other cameras have optical image stabilization
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:21.500]   The iPhone 5s could only had to like ramp up ramp up ramp up the sensitivity
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:28.140]   And do the best it could so I'll be very very surprised if the iPhone 6 plus does not take better pictures in the iPhone 6
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:34.020]   In like indoor situation and I have which you really want that sort of I just feel like that's my number one frustration with my phone
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.660]   with the phone
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.140]   Sensor is
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:43.060]   Specifically semi low light and getting soft images, you know, just that just drives me absolutely
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:49.540]   Matthew pans arena took it to Disneyland to test it. Yeah, my two. Yeah, two F stops better with the optical image
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.360]   Yeah, I'm trying to see a Matthew pans arena also did video shooting and
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.820]   Showed how quickly the video adapts
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:01.900]   He was on what was the on the matter horn or one of those roller coasters and it adapted quite well
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.460]   The only other thing I point out is it depends on your use case for example
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.740]   I quite often use my iPhone 5s when I was walking around with coffee or if I'm on the streets
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:15.340]   I can't do that with the iPhone 6. It's just big enough that it's not that I can't reach is that when I try
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.460]   I think I feel like I'm gonna drop my phone and I just stop and I say no
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:19.420]   I'm gonna put it down
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:24.980]   It's it's a hand and a half or it is the iPhone 5 sorry the iPhone 6 I can use perfectly well one-handed
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:31.820]   Without any problems because it's so thin. It's so rounded. It still feels great the iPhone 6 plus I can't do that anymore
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:37.860]   I think that it's it's it's the first iPhone where I think that having it in a really good case is gonna change
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:44.860]   How you use it? I can't wait for really good like folio cases like fold-over cases come out for this because you're absolutely right
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:50.500]   I mean this I've been carrying this without the case only because I want to be able to feel like how warm does it get in the back
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.900]   What I'm using it all the sort of stuff when you're just testing a phone
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.140]   But I also have the silicone
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:59.740]   Sleeve for it and when it's in that sleeve I have a little bit more of a firm control over it
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:06.500]   This is one of the slipperiest phones. I think Apple has made I was just putting it down on the on the the end table
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.700]   Just just about a couple hours ago while I was getting other stuff ready and I could just see it subtle slightly slightly going
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.900]   It's like the Nexus 4 remember that it would fall off a flat table
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:21.220]   Yeah, exactly so so I think that you're right once you once we have cases of light to get a little bit better grip on it
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:26.260]   I wouldn't it's I can certainly walk and use it so long as I don't have to access most of the screen
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:33.380]   I mean my my basic my basic takeaway on it is on the sixth and the six plus is that your default should be the six
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.940]   I think that you will any iPhone user will be extremely happy with the six and will not have a complaint about it
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:44.380]   If you have a reason for the six plus to have this larger screen whether you want to your system administrator
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:48.820]   And you want to do remote access and have more screen you watch a lot of movies you read a lot of books
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:54.460]   You really want up want the extra battery life for for acting as a base station or
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:21:01.300]   Assuming that the camera tests pay off as well as I hope they will you really you really do are frustrated by low light
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:06.860]   Photography in other iPhones then get it but don't you have to have a reason in mind
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:11.260]   Don't think that while I've got I don't know which one to get I may as well get the bigger one because I think you're gonna
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:17.220]   Be kind of unhappy with it especially after spending five years using phones that are you know as small as this
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:24.620]   I had I had to get I had to get out like the the pre stretched out version and holy cats
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:31.220]   It's about the is about as long as this screen is wide. It's amazing
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.940]   Yeah, I was a six plus
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.300]   If I'm like a white as an iPad. Yeah, yes
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:41.500]   All the people I know who have come from five S's or even less
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:47.460]   Are struggling a little bit with the six plus because it is such a big jump. Yeah, I surprised myself
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.860]   I've been using a phone of the six plus's side for the last six months and
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:59.060]   I really like the six. I think the size of this I've always felt 4.7 is kind of exactly the right size for a phone
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.540]   I prefer the size I said for me
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.900]   It's just that I take so many photos and I'm so attached to them
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.660]   It's the only thing and if Apple put and I'm sure that Apple thought that out. Yeah
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:14.580]   Oh, that's showing us the amount of pixels in the original iPhone which is way down here
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:20.300]   We know that that was 2007 and the current you might as well show a blackberry pager next to that
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:25.220]   I mean, it really does feel like the iPhone 6 is a linear successor to the iPhones and the 6 plus is something new
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:29.940]   It's like the giant size of the Greenland. I agree. You don't come to visit. I agree and I so
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.580]   Just like you Andy unless you have a compelling reason to go with the larger screen
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:37.260]   For instance, Lisa really wants the extra battery life and the larger screen
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:43.340]   I think that most iPhone users will be overwhelmed by the six plus and be extremely happy with the six
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.500]   Yeah, this is why when people were pre-ordering it staying up all night
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:52.020]   I was saying look you really want to hold both of these in your hands before you choose one even if you do have two weeks to
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:56.340]   Send it back. It's like you you don't you don't want to get yourself in a situation
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.900]   Where you're just struggling for two weeks to get a grips on this and then you're stuck
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:05.220]   Yeah, this is more the six plus more like carrying a 15 20. Here's your here's your MA
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:09.500]   Yes, yeah, and your MA is actually closer in size to the little iPhone than the big iPhone
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.860]   Yeah, I really feel like I've been carrying a one plus one
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:19.060]   Which is exactly the same size as six plus and even that I prefer to the six plus I it's something about
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.080]   And this is the this is the 15 20
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:27.540]   20 massive. Yeah, and it's actually I mean, it's actually not that much larger
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:34.620]   That's a six inch it's it's larger enough that this extra like centimeter or whatever is kind of like the breaking point
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:42.460]   Yeah for convenience this I I don't I don't feel like I don't feel I need to take extra water and hire some kids to carry my other
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:48.260]   Stuff with me if I'm carrying this with me. This is still is about as big as a phone can be and still read as a phone
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.140]   My visceral reaction to the iPhones and it surprised me
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:59.340]   Was this is it this the six the 4.7 inches a jewel is just right it feels and looks
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:03.240]   Gorgeous the curvature of the glass is so nice
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:10.340]   The size is just right. So I just feel like anybody with this phone is going to especially
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.500]   Existing iPhones users are gonna be happiest and if you are already happy with the phone that you have
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:18.740]   I mean, yeah, if you have if you're already happy with the camera that you had and the pictures you were taking
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.140]   Then I think that the six is the way to go if again
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:27.580]   If you if you're really particular and you take a lot of low light stuff for whatever reason then then I still want to see the tests
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.540]   You know, I guess I could still change if I wanted to well
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:35.020]   I did by both I might that's what you just do. I mean face it
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:40.740]   Well, see but the thing is is now I have to I'm I'm my whole thing is I always have one iPhone and one Android
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.860]   Phone and the M8 has been great
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:47.540]   But the new Panasonic is coming out and now I feel like I need to get that because that's better camera
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:51.260]   The Panasonic is a camera with a little bit of phone because who talks on the phone is
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:58.220]   All I mean, that's the perfect thing is a great camera that ha Mollie would in her New York Times
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:05.220]   Review said and I thought this was interesting that the four the six is a little bit too small and the six plus a little bit too
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:09.380]   Big she felt like they missed the sweet spot in the middle. I'm not sure I'd agree with her
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:14.260]   That's one can't you can't you can't Samsung the category because Samsung's already doing that well
[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.460]   No way you have Samsung it just by having two
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:23.060]   No, no, you basically produce it options because it's a reflection of the fact that people actually do want these things
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:28.580]   The fact that the Galaxy Note has sold phenomenally well and that other make makers have followed suit
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.340]   It's not because of trends and not because just they want attention because damn it these phones
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:36.220]   So but it would be a terrible thing if you could only get a 5.5 inch iPhone
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.580]   So it's great that they have this this spread spectrum that is just
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:48.100]   Rationally large phone for most people a big phone for people who tend to be a little bit more intense and broad with what they use a
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.700]   Phone for I do think it would be a great thing if they were to decide
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:57.380]   We're specifically going to create a small one for people with smaller hands or people who just don't want to be dominated by phones
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.820]   But I'm sure that won't happen
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:04.940]   Well, it's nice to have a choice. Let's let's let's put it that's amazing
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:10.580]   When you use this for just a few minutes and you look back at an iPhone 5s and it looks so
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:16.540]   Thick and small and square and then you look back at one of the phones Andy held up and it looks like a little toy
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:22.700]   It's it's amazing how quickly your brain recalibrates having used all the iPhones and not full time for the last couple of years
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.820]   I admit
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.020]   This the the six itself is
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:33.860]   Easily the nicest iPhone they've ever made I really feel like this is a stunning work of Apple Apple says that every year
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.500]   They say it really this is the best iPhone we've ever made and of course means
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.940]   In terms of specs in terms of
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.380]   Features that's always true
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:48.300]   But this really is the first time it feels like they they could almost have called this the iPhone 2 like mark 2
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:55.100]   Yeah, because it's almost as if every iPhone before this was just laying groundwork for this because this is so superior in every way
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.700]   There's hands down the biggest upgrade. I think they've ever done in hardware. Wow
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:04.540]   Well, all right, let's take a break. I want to talk about line experiences and there's a lot more iOS 8
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:08.420]   We now can talk about that a little bit. It wasn't out when we convened last time
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:14.180]   Lots to lots to say and do we've got a great panel to do it and we have the question engine up
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:20.420]   Thanks to Alex Lindsey. So twit.to. That's our URL shortener twit.to/m
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:24.660]   Bw four two one for those of you who are listening live
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:29.340]   We've got a major upgrade to the question. Are you ready who you talk about?
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.860]   Well, what do we mean? Who are we gonna talk about?
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:36.060]   Well, I'm we're gonna take a break for an ad. So if you want to vote on which ad you want to hear we could do that
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.060]   But right now
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.340]   We've got questions. This is the moderators. There you go. That's the that's your look interface
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:48.620]   So not only can you put questions in now and vote questions up and down, but there's an agenda
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:52.620]   This is a new featured nice where you can put and Alex has put in stories
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:57.820]   And you can vote those can you can't vote those in so you can't see those yet. That's all
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:04.180]   That's private to us at the moment. We're working on it. I like deciding how we're gonna expose that. Yeah, you know, we're you know
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:10.780]   Andy is constantly updating the the process and he not an echo any your I've got your guy
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:17.340]   I've got sin who is the author of this and so yeah, so but but that'll you'll see some of those pop up as we as we go and
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:21.540]   But yeah, so definitely vote on questions. There's a lot of questions in here right now
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:26.520]   So definitely vote on some and and ask a few of you don't see yours and it's still in beta in fact
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.320]   I see Peter. We don't know his last name because it has non
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:34.180]   Roman characters in it and or at least characters with heavy
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:40.780]   Everything and non-asky characters in it and he says you got to get this to work with Unicode. No, it says yes. Yes
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:47.040]   So so this is still in beta and it's a chance for you to also weigh in on things like that
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.460]   But do vote up questions and we'll get to those little later on on the show our show today brought to you by
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:59.360]   Gazelle calm now that you've seen the discussions of which phone you might want to look at perhaps you're ready to pull the trigger
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:03.240]   And maybe you maybe you already bought a new iPhone and you're wondering now
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.280]   What do I do with the old one?
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:09.600]   Well, if you don't have an uncle Jerry to give it to or an ace or an F you maybe you want to just get a little money for it
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:14.720]   In fact, you might want to go to gazelle before you give it uncle Jerry to find out. Yeah, I know whether you want to give it
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:20.920]   Uncle Jerry how how how rich are feeling? Yeah, Gazelle will buy your old not just iPhone
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:26.120]   But your iPads cell phones from a variety of manufacturers. I've got my new Moto X on the way
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:33.740]   So I'm gonna see how much I can get for the old Moto X you can get money for Samsung tablets even your Microsoft Surface
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:39.480]   So this is a great place to go to get a quote these quotes are locked in for 30 days
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.640]   That means you don't have to decide today what you're going to do
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.560]   But you can at least get the price and then
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:49.980]   Within 30 days when you pull the trigger they'll send you a box. They pay the postage
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:55.080]   Very very nice. You just pile all those gadgets in the box and I suggest you don't just do one
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.140]   We are sending we've got the we got a really old iPhones are sending back
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:03.100]   You finally gave up well, we slide down what we do is we slide down
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:08.220]   So right we get the new ones and relatives, you know kids get the next generation down and X
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:12.620]   Expouses get the next generation. That's where my a lot of my iPads go exactly
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.580]   So finally gazelle gets the ones that are falling off the edge where we just nobody wants them
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:20.060]   So gazelle take them and even then you're getting some money for this
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:24.580]   Which is awesome instead of it collecting in a dust in a drawer or getting thrown in the trash
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:30.100]   Which is really not the right thing to do gazelle is the best way to recycle those old gadgets get your 30 day quote
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:34.460]   They'll still send you the shipping the box. He's ship it into them fill that box up
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.620]   You get the maximum amount of money. They will look at your device if you forget to wipe the data
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.140]   Don't worry. They always do that look at that hundred seventy five bucks for a 16 gig Wi-Fi
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.700]   I've had many
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.620]   This is a great price is an important thing to decide
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:51.420]   You know when to do this because what happens with me is that I handed off to my wife
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:55.620]   My wife hands off to the kids and the kids throw it on the ground right so you have to decide when you're gonna sell it
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.980]   And who you're gonna hand it to first. That's a hundred twenty eight dollars. Just throw on the ground
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.380]   What are you doing?
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.780]   So gazelle.com by the way, they will pay you in cash
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:08.420]   You can get a check but you can also get a PayPal credit if you're in a hurry and I recommend if you do a lot of Amazon shopping
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.700]   Getting the Amazon gift card because they bump the price of that by five percent
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.700]   Isn't that nice ain't that sweet?
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:21.340]   Gazie Elle they've sent out nearly a hundred seventy five million dollars now to over one million customers
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.940]   Including me we use it all the time
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:26.540]   Gazelle calm
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.540]   Get your get your quote today
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:33.600]   Get that new gadget. This is a time really that would be appropriate and a lot of you are doing the two-year upgrade
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.940]   You have an old five
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.300]   They'll absolutely good price top dollar for your five. So that's a good deal
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:45.580]   So who waited in line you did Renee? Yep, I did and he I guess you probably didn't do any line sitting
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.820]   Oh, he's muted
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:53.600]   Is that us or is it him? All right, that's me. Oh sorry. I waited in the FedEx line at my house
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:32:00.380]   Align of the line baby and there are still people from the Chinese mafia and what line would try to me?
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:05.900]   Did you see those videos from New York? It's got to be a little depressing for the
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:11.960]   Apple employees in fact, let me show you the video from the Santa Rosa store. Do you have that their chatter?
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.620]   Should I pull it up?
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:19.300]   It seems like you know, you don't want to obviously you don't want to apply any kind of a lot of rules Apple kind of like
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.340]   Whoever shows up whoever shows up in them the rules of lines or the rules of lines
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:26.820]   But I know that one of our guys was sitting in line and just kept on one person kept on turning into ten
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:33.700]   You know like it was no we actually had revolts when that happened if somebody tried to save a place and then four hours later
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:38.980]   Ten other people showed up there were massive revolts when that happened. I think that that's inappropriate. Yeah
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:43.780]   This is a picture of the line. This is other. Okay, this you're the one from New York
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:49.420]   This is have the one from I have mine and I'll show you but go ahead. All right. So the one from New York
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:56.180]   So this is the problem is that it's so valuable in the Chinese market and is not for sale in the Chinese market yet
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:00.100]   That people there are paid to sit in line
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:06.780]   This was a documentarian who shot this and just get these phones and many of them don't speak English
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:10.820]   They're they're being paid to do this and and of course they don't share the enth-
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:15.700]   There's nothing wrong with this is completely legal and I'm not even saying it's a bad thing
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:22.540]   But it doesn't exactly communicate the enthusiasm. We've seen in older Apple wines where everybody's there is very excited their Apple fans
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:28.900]   Let me show you my pictures at chat. Oh, yeah, there were some buses and stuff. Yeah last year time
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:33.760]   I was day in date this year it is not yeah, and that's why you're seeing it because it probably the phone that they're buying for
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.080]   $949 and I'm sure they're getting the top of the line phone saying
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:41.020]   They list why two or $3,000. Oh, did you see that's the customs footage of all the seizures?
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:45.820]   They had a guy just throwing like look like 30 or 50 gold iPhones onto a table that they seized a cousin
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:50.580]   Oh, wow, so I got it. I was going for okay. I'll tell you my story
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:57.760]   I was gonna order online the week before but you remember Apple store had trouble opening and I finally gave up because I was sleepy
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:04.740]   Did order one for my mom. She got her six plus day and date from Sprint. She's so happy
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:10.900]   She loves it, but she was using a galaxy note too. So what I'm good son. She was a good boy
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:17.780]   We face-timed immediately and it's so it's so great to face time on the phone as opposed to the iPad because yeah, you know and then
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:23.260]   I bought this little one just because I want I wasn't convinced a little one
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:29.540]   This little bitty phone. I wasn't convinced we'd have a phone. So I ordered one from Verizon if rises website worked pretty well
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.540]   as I told you last week, but
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:36.740]   John Slanina Jamerby in our office who was already good planning to go about
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:43.460]   I think he was planning to go about 4 a.m. Got a cold feet because he saw the boy genius report saying that only two to three percent of these
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:48.020]   Shipped phones in the stores were gonna be the six pluses and we all wanted six pluses
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.460]   So he went at 8 8 p.m
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:58.300]   Seven thirthed in line. There he is at the Santa Rosa Apple Store. There's our friend Gary Koeffler who was right ahead of him
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:04.060]   This is the line right before we we got in
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:09.060]   The Apple store there and you can see they put all of the iPhones in the back
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:14.500]   I don't know what they did in Montreal, but they put all the iPhones in their beautiful white album boxes
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:19.820]   Again, we're of course counting tall boxes versus short boxes. Yeah
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:25.740]   It looked like a pretty even distribution. I was happy to see that you can't see in this picture. This is hey, I apologize
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:33.180]   This is an android phone. It's just not a crisp our store had nine six pluses that weren't pre-reserved if you I pre-reserves
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.660]   I didn't have to get there too early. I got there around 5 36 a.m
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:41.380]   And I had six plus reserved but the people in line they said they I think they had like nine the six plus only yeah
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:44.700]   Well, we had considerably more and I did not have a reserved one
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:49.380]   So I'm looking I'm starting to freak out with John and at 3 a.m. I decided to go in
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:54.160]   This is the the display you took the same picture. Yeah, only yours says
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.140]   The plugr on could call on or something like that
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:01.780]   Bigger than bigger than bigger and I love this. I don't this wire
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:06.700]   Thing is really cool. This was in your store - I guess all the Apple stores Adam
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.900]   They probably had one Chinese factory alone just making the wire things
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:14.700]   click on click wrong pugr all click wrong and
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:18.780]   Let me see if I can find the video. I know I have it here somewhere
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:24.620]   That I took of the countdown. This is what you want. I remember the last line. I was in I
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.740]   think was
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.660]   Was when the original iPhone came out?
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.540]   Can you get my audio because there's audio on this? I don't know if you can
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:41.100]   Can you can you hear me? I'm giving you something else. Yeah, I'm I don't know what you're turned up all the way
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.660]   Well, let me let me start playing then you're gonna get a nice loud
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.900]   What's going on?
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.900]   Hey Google
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:58.380]   It's great, this is 8 a.m. We've all been there. I've been there five hours many have been there 12
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:03.180]   The Apple employees come out first right like a football team
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:15.020]   And they had let 75 people into the mall there were another hundred people outside they were letting him in in groups of 25
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:20.820]   I was number 41 in line at 3 a.m. And there go the first people in there
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:27.740]   If I asked the Apple people I says this you he said they were this long when the five came out every I think every other year
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.060]   They're pretty every yeah, we had 350 in Montreal
[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:35.060]   But I think they had 5,000 did fifths out fifth Avenue. Do you want to hear what in comparison?
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:40.340]   The other document yeah, let's hear what the Chinese folks were doing when the store opened and
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.540]   Right
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.700]   They're like what are they doing? They have no idea okay?
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.140]   It's cold. I've been here a long time. When do I get my hundred dollar?
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:57.020]   You know the first iPhone never came to Canada and people set up websites to sell them to Canadians jailbroken and
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:02.980]   Exorbitant markups. It's just it's a supply. I brought Amber MacArthur one. I jailbroken and brought it to her and
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:07.780]   She's still didn't use it. She was stayed with her blackberry. I was I was actually heartbroken
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:12.500]   It's good. She's a good Canadian. She's a good Canadian. She did she wanted to be loyal. I know
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:19.860]   I'm a little bit bothered by this now. Are you like yeah? I mean it was except with the first couple years with the new iPhones
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:24.460]   The new iPads there's a sense of celebration. There's okay. It's new. It's novel. It's wonderful and we're
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:29.140]   Despite apples dominance in the market. We're still kind of a community now
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:37.060]   I see people camping out for reasons that are they want to buy them to resell them someplace else people who probably don't want to be there anymore
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:44.020]   applications because now people are like you said having problems achieve well look you were one guy this morning and now they're 10
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:48.420]   You brought in 10 guys. What's that all about and then even if you have a cute?
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:52.500]   Let's say that there were there an impossibly curated line where you know everybody is blessed
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:58.340]   Everybody answered three trivia questions about the making of them of the original Macintosh and the Apple IIe
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.860]   To prove that they've that they're real Apple people even so
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:05.700]   You can't get around the idea that this is a flashy
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:12.980]   Trendy consumer item that everybody is I'm so overjoyed look that's applaud this person for buying something. Oh, isn't that wonderful
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:19.540]   Society, isn't it? I don't want to put cold water on everybody about this. It's just that it was with each passing year
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:25.060]   I get a little bit less excited about the line and more wishing that I just wish that they would just simply say look
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.180]   We'll do pre-orders for for the store. Basically. We're not
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:34.660]   I guarantee you we will sell out of everything that we have just show up at the time that we're told that we'll have a phone for you and come in because
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:39.060]   Like I said just for me. It just gets a little sadder every single time. I'm kind of with you
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:43.780]   A little queasy making that the two people ahead of me in line were clearly buying it for somebody else
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:47.460]   They were not there to buy it for themselves even though they said they were I mean, that's fine
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.860]   The guy behind me was excited
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:52.660]   but was apparently
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.780]   Professional line sitter because he says yeah, this is nothing like Best Buy
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:40:00.340]   I go to Best Buy every black dark black Friday and I said will you go with something in mind to buy?
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.860]   I said no we just go
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.940]   And so he obviously loves that's and but there were people like me and Gary. I met
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:09.300]   I met a guy in line. He was showing me his iPad app
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:14.340]   Uh, he turned out to be a class college class made of mine that we hadn't met before
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:16.580]   Um, and we had a great conversation
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.300]   So there's still a little bit of that. I remember the first time I was in the iphone line
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:24.900]   In 2007 sitting behind two googlers one of them was a was a google reader developer
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:28.500]   He said yeah, I was up all night adapting it to work better with the iphone
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:34.260]   There was this and this was in pedalum. There was this sense of a cultural phenomenon now
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:40.020]   It's just a sense of of really gross consumerism. I see the same 12 people. I mean every year
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:43.220]   I don't see them every year in the lineup and they're always there. They're always near the front
[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.300]   I think the first guy came
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.900]   24 hours early this time, but all of them were at the front of the line talk to them
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.380]   It's the only time I see them and it is that sense of community
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:55.780]   And there are scalpers or some people who have dual citizenship who come because their countries aren't getting them for a while
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:59.140]   And it's an easy way for them to pay for their phone if they take a couple back with them
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:02.980]   You know with some of these with some of these countries. It's an easy way to pay for college
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.220]   I mean, you know, I
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:08.500]   It's a lot of the markups are crazy on these phones
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.580]   You know, I think that they're anywhere from 200 to 400 percent in a lot of these countries and so it's uh
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:16.180]   It's it's I was a little perturbed that the apple employees were
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:22.180]   Somewhat unprepared there was a little bit of disingenuous on this on their part
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:25.300]   They all denied that they knew what was in stock or how much was in stock?
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.740]   I'm sure they're told to do that
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:30.900]   I was a little disappointed two or three of them said we do not have any unlocked phones period
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:35.140]   I said the T-Mobile's unlocked they said no it is not it is locked as carrier locked at T-Mobile
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:39.620]   That was a lie. Whether they knew better. I don't know, but that was a lie
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:45.140]   um, and I think management probably was told told them that uh because
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.380]   They wanted
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.420]   And by the way the T-Mobile phones by the time I got there were gone
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:54.420]   I don't think they in fact by the time john got there they were gone. I know they might have had one
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:57.220]   um, so
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:02.020]   Again, we you know now is that because of uh, why would we think that that they would be told to
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:08.260]   I don't uh, well, I think because they're not officially start selling unlocked phones in a few weeks
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:10.660]   Right the unlocked unlocked no carrier phone
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.060]   And I think that for some reason
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:18.580]   We just let you discourage scalpers because unlocked ones are more valuable right receipts. That's what my sis my suspicion
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.340]   maybe
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:24.420]   And any of them computers went down like the computers went down like roger's sale central always goes down
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.260]   But the apple system went down for a while too
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:31.700]   That's right. They had a very elaborate reservation system that they were supposed to use electronic reservation system
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.620]   It went down. I knew that it had gone down in Canada because you tweeted it rene
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:40.100]   Uh, and then they came they didn't do it to us. We thought well, it's five a.m. Six a.m
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:45.140]   Still hadn't done it. They were letting people into the mall and still hadn't done it finally shortly before 8 a.m
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:46.980]   They started handing out paper
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:49.700]   Hat check tickets with my game on written numbers on it
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:54.340]   You're supposed to get a text message that would have a passbook that you could load up that works
[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:58.660]   By the way it worked the next day because john went back to the store on saturday
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:01.940]   And the system was up and actually worked quite well. He got a message
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:06.900]   That said you know, you have reserved this such and such phone. We are holding it for you
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:12.020]   You have to the end of the day to come get it. So that's a great solution gets my bottle line gets things
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:18.020]   I think that apple's gonna have to start having a real policy about how they manage this starting with you're not allowed to camp out overnight
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.620]   We will basically have security saying you if you keep if you want to stand
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:23.700]   From 4 a.m. Onward. That's fine
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:27.940]   But you're not laying down and you're not going to be hanging around outside our store before this hour
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:33.620]   I'm just I guess one of my other worries is that we all we've all seen sort of the arc that the black friday sales have gone
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:38.100]   Where from this sort of insider thing where oh, yes, how i know i'm kind of weird
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.420]   I like to do my christmas shopping friday morning to
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:46.020]   Now that there's sales and now there are people who are outside that community of weird people and down to well
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:53.300]   On friday morning. I will have one a slice of leftover pumpkin pie and two about two hours for the news stories about who got shot in front of a wall
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.300]   Greens or in front of a kmart
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:59.460]   Because they wanted to save 60 dollars on an hd tv and they thought that some other guy was trying to get
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:04.980]   The thing that he had his hands on first on the other hand here's that press here's from trisha d tweeting
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.380]   The fire phone for the amazon fire
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.020]   The line for the amazon fire phone
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.740]   You know in a lot of ways
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:16.100]   This is the massive success of apple's marketing
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:20.660]   One and quality too and i think part of it is is that apple likes to rub it in
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:26.100]   I mean like everybody else tries to get do things that create lines and nothing creates lines like the iphone
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.580]   I mean
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:35.220]   Who was excited about all the crowds until since naddy the rolling stones was probably excited about the crowds until altimon
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.460]   And i just i just want apple to
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:44.180]   Take take control of this before they have a 1/100 scale altimon situation or something that happens
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:45.620]   It's so ugly that
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:51.540]   Okay, now we're forced to do something about this because this ugly ugly thing that is now taking the news cycle that it's not
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:56.180]   Instead of people reporting about 12 million iphones sold on the first three hours now. They're talking about
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:59.940]   Yeah, you know that kid that almost died because okay, well
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:06.420]   Perhaps when there's some guidelines will do fine. I do want to point out the like my local apple store the fairview point claire when they did a really good
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:10.900]   Job of managing expectation like they came out and said look we have this many iphone six pluses
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:14.420]   And when the last person had got the ticket for one and said we don't have those anymore
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:18.020]   So if you're waiting for those we can't help you but there's a reservation system
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.660]   You can go and use it right now and you can get one as soon as they are of it
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:24.420]   And they did a very good job making sure that nobody hit the store with false expectations
[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:27.780]   Everyone knew what they could get and what they wanted to get by the time they got inside
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:35.380]   Uh and a great many people did not actually get what they wanted and still stayed in line and and uh still participated
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:38.900]   Because they sold out a lot of things. I didn't get what I wanted
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:44.100]   I wanted a t-mobile. I got an 18 or I got an 18 t because that's what they had
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:48.420]   Right, but i'm a little different because I had to have it before the radio show the next day, right?
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:54.740]   Uh, steve jobs would always get in line at the Palo Alto store participate tim cook following
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:57.300]   along the ids g
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.900]   Yes going to the end. Yeah, he's smiling
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.380]   I think this is a good thing every ceo should do this
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:10.820]   In fact every ceo should go to the apple line and see why people are doing what they're doing
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:13.220]   Right do the king richard speech
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:17.060]   Take a shin should be there in the left today
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:20.180]   You will remember
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.180]   Hey as well as wits
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:26.020]   You will tell your children and your grandchildren
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:29.700]   Somebody really wait if i was taking pictures of him to be a sport if he really wanted to be a sport
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.780]   He'd do it and will he want to cosplay
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:34.820]   Complete with a gold ticket
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:40.100]   That was steve's thing he's got a he's got a bigger than the character did steve get in line or did he just come in later
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:44.260]   I think he came in later. He came in later. He would go into the store. I think
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:49.540]   The tim's actually greeting people who are in line, which is neat and he's posing for the selfies the cookies. Sorry
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:55.860]   Good for him and of course, uh, note the news cameras surrounding him. This is a very good PR as well
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:47:01.460]   Health kid is working wonders for him. Yeah, he looks you know
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.460]   We were talking yesterday an ipad today
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:08.100]   Uh, sarah lane was looking at the picture of him standing next to dr. Dr. Dre the famous balcony picture
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:15.460]   He said she said you know either dray isn't as as buff as we all thought or tim's been lifting and I said you should see tim's guns
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:20.020]   I think on the I can't remember where I saw it was on the charlie rose interview or somewhere that guy
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:24.340]   Clearly has massive guns. This guy is pumped
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:28.420]   All right, I'm sorry. I shouldn't carry the weight of apple on it. Yeah, really
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:33.140]   Um, yeah, obviously very happy smiling jolly tim cook
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:38.340]   And rightly so he's the zodiac million valuable company in the world
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:41.620]   Oh, here we go put show this because he actually is now in the store
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:46.660]   And he's going to participate in that's in the traditional the annual ceremony
[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:49.220]   Of the running of the geniuses
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:51.700]   And then he married them off two by two
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:57.940]   Sung young how did he get in early? Hey wait a minute get out of here. You don't have a blue shirt
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.260]   You
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.700]   It's like any other store with a steady cane
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.180]   That's a pretty neat one
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:10.660]   I still I I know it's a testament to raw consumerism
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:15.620]   Etc, et cetera, but there's a cultural thing that's happening here too. That's really great
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:16.820]   There's the
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:22.580]   Let me point out that i'm podcasting to you on a table that has one two three four five six phones and two computers on it
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:24.580]   So yeah, perhaps i'm not the person who
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:27.540]   Said to it is some minimalism. Well, the truth is
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:31.460]   We're we're like the alcoholics who work at the gym beam factory
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:35.620]   We we got into it because we wanted all of the gadgets we could get
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.460]   I did
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:39.460]   Oh, yes, right. Yes
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:44.100]   If we had a way to do it nice and legally yeah, I couldn't afford it so I had to do it
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:46.180]   Let's take a break some questions from the question engine
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:50.820]   Uh coming up in just a little bit. I'm sure there's other stuff to talk about with the iphone
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:54.740]   I want to talk about ios 8 you did a great to i'm ordered a great ios 8
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.420]   uh, piece tips, but also bugs there's a there's
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:03.220]   a not insignificant number of problems with ios 8 i've run into a few myself
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.300]   um
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:07.860]   When we come back, but first a word from square space
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:12.420]   The all-in-one platform that makes your next website sing
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:15.140]   Square space
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:20.180]   I just I admire these guys so much started by Anthony castellane and his in his college dorm room
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:23.780]   Because he wanted a better content management system. It has now become the
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:26.180]   premier
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.220]   uh, web hosting company their site just never goes down
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:37.220]   The incredible uptime you cannot kill a square space site and he did something very smart early on they tied the content management system tightly
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:41.220]   To the web hosting and so they're very intimately connected
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:44.740]   It's not just some software running on top of some servers and that's one of the reasons
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:52.340]   Uh, you can't bring a square space site down also such intent such attention to the the code the details of beautiful code
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:59.860]   When they update their platforms and they do it regularly you get the benefit because suddenly your site supports the latest
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:00.980]   web technologies
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:03.460]   You don't have to worry about it things like mobile responsive design
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:07.460]   The thing in the last couple of years has been no we know you don't have a separate mobile site
[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:11.780]   You have one site that fits any size screen of course all square space templates do that
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:16.180]   They all have the best e-commerce built in their e-commerce is sweet
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:19.940]   everything from the merchant account to shipping
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:22.340]   to uh, uh,
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:28.340]   I mean, it's just it's spectacular if you're looking for a a, uh, e-commerce site square space is a great choice
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:34.820]   Starting at eight dollars a month and with a yearly plan you even get the domain name for free and they hook it all up for you
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:40.580]   It is easy to post to you pay attention to your content square space handles the nitty-gritty
[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:45.860]   Technical details. They also have incredible apps the square space metric app for iphone and ipad
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:51.860]   It lets you check stats like page views visitors social media followers. They've got a blogging app
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:55.540]   For photographers. I love this the new portfolio app
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:51:00.980]   If you're a photographer a lot of photographers use square space for their personal website or their business website
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:04.100]   The portfolio app will pull the images down
[00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:10.660]   From your site and so if you have a client and you go over with your ipad to say let me show you the images
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:15.620]   You could do that right from your site. You don't have to preload the ipad. It's just sweet
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:18.180]   You know, we had a I think we talked about this earlier
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:22.500]   We actually built an entire manual in square space, you know for for a whole training
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:28.420]   Is a whole training program for a client where we were able we found it the easier they wanted it to work on every different platform
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:32.420]   You know easily and we were trying to figure out what how to code it how to build it iBooks

[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:06.260]   Question number one from Jim
[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:12.740]   Tim cook has said new technology. Oh, we just got voted down or is it because i'm taking it
[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:15.380]   Oh, I see what you did. You clicked a button
[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:18.660]   Tim cook has said new technologies will be presented this year
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:23.220]   We've seen the apple watch. We know that'll be out sometime next year. What else?
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:30.020]   TV macs i think for new apple tv they updated it last week for beats
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:33.860]   Huh spring new boxes spring spring you think
[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:39.940]   Yeah, how about the rumor which Jim dowry will poo poo that there be new ipads october 21st
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:45.380]   Jim said no that day he said not that day, but but it will be sometime next next month
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:48.820]   Be surprising you think if they missed a year that'd be the first time they've done that
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:52.180]   Yeah, and there is something you could do the ipad you could put a fingerprint reader on it
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:55.540]   You put such idea on it. That'd be huge. Uh needs it. I miss it
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:54:00.660]   I'm so used to unlocking my store and unlocking the phone by putting my finger on it works so well
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:05.380]   And it's so bad now because you touch it and it takes you 10 seconds to realize there's no touch idea sensor
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:11.860]   And then it unlocks like an animal and it just it's such a slow process now. It feels bad. Yeah
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:14.900]   Um, what else
[00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:20.180]   I will be coming out next month that mini's will never emerge. I can only I forget it
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:22.900]   Dream on
[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:24.900]   They're dead mac pro
[00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:28.260]   Well, bro. You're saying that my broadwell chips will come out
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:33.860]   I'm hoping I mean the thing is as far as I know the thing is done is just waiting on on broadwell chips, right?
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:37.140]   And that's so it's up to intel in other words
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:42.100]   Uh doctor mom says that she believes that there will be more health
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:49.220]   Features released on the iWatch when it comes out, but they have to await fda what the fda's doing is interesting
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:53.860]   They're they're trying to change the rules to make a broader range of health devices
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:56.420]   not require approval
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:55:00.100]   Right and when that happens they call it grass g r a s
[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:02.820]   when that happens
[00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:09.140]   Then she suspects apple will say oh and by the way we could do this this this well and I think that I think health kit and home kit are going to be huge
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:12.740]   Massive. I think that the timing is real kid. What's happening with that?
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:16.180]   Well, I think that as we start to see I mean we're just starting to see it come out
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:20.900]   So we're but I think that the ability to have a lot being able to interact with many many
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:27.940]   Devices, you know and being able to have that all work is going to it opens up a lot of opportunity for developers
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:29.940]   It opens a lot of opportunities for apple
[00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:33.380]   I mean everyone's talked about getting into the you know into the home
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:39.060]   You know in in a in a big way and I think that there's so many interactions that we haven't started having with you know
[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:45.780]   Our refrigerator and a lot of other things that you know, I'm knowing what's there. No having it. No, what's what's going on
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.980]   I think that those things are are things that we're going to continue to see
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.740]   You know grow. I mean even just stuff like when you think about bluetooth le
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:56.740]   When this starts to work and you put those little you know trackers on it
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:59.860]   You know, you'll never lose your keys or your or your you know stuff again
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:02.260]   It's like your iPhone like where are my key? I that's what I do now
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:04.420]   I use my little my little tracker on my keys
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:06.740]   But the point is is knowing where everything is
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:09.300]   understanding how you know the context of
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:13.860]   Where those things are I think that and when and the watch I think is going to be a key piece of this
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:15.860]   But I think that it's a pretty
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:19.700]   Explosive opportunity and everyone's looking for it. I mean google's trying to go down that path as well
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:25.460]   It's not something that is apples only doing but of course apple has a an opportunity to kind of move it down the path
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:30.900]   On the home kit topic leo is just a question of time because they got ios 8 when we did and the new fawns when we did
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:34.100]   And algato's announced and philips is announced and a ton of companies have announced
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.500]   But it won't be as long as carplay takes to get up
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:39.860]   It'll take a while for manufacturers and vendors and everybody what's it going to look like?
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:41.220]   I'll have a
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:45.700]   Unified interface on my iPhone no so I unlike so there's health kit and health
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:51.220]   But there is home kit but no home there's no home right so what apple's done is developers have to create the ability for you to
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.380]   Create homes rooms
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:59.620]   Accessories and actions in every one of their apps so if you launch the q app and it doesn't detect that you have a home
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:04.580]   Set up is going to ask you to set up a home and then your rooms and then add your accessories so the management happens
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:08.820]   I'm guessing that's because the manufacturers are more sensitive to apple taking over their experience
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:11.220]   Than the health providers are
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:15.060]   So they have to sort of defer a little bit to them but you'll be able to do all of that within the app
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:20.180]   And they'll be able to use series and interface so you can just say series vacation home kitchen lights on
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:23.060]   And it'll do all that I really like that. I hope that that
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:25.620]   Well, that might be a year or two out, right?
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:27.860]   Is well
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:33.060]   If they're not quick to adopt you yeah, I think I think the thing is I think we are going to see a lot of first movers at sees
[00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:36.420]   So this is there's enough time for them to look at this to experiment january
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:39.540]   I think ses becomes a huge home kit and health kit
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:46.100]   Uh, you know exposé that makes sense. In fact, there you know ses always has this home automation pavilion
[00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:54.260]   Where every different standard competes and fights and uh, it'd be nice to have one unified standard that everybody could support and uh, maybe it's not
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:57.460]   You know, you still are using zigby, but this integrates in with
[00:57:57.460 --> 00:58:02.100]   You know home kit i would be like harplay where you'll have like the apple version that works really well
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.620]   But you'll also be able to use the google version and then whatever else there is in the industry
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:08.980]   It's a shame apple doesn't have just a hundred percent monopoly of all mobile devices
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.460]   Then it would be so much easier horrible all
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:15.220]   I think we're thinking about i'm kidding health kit it just all work because everybody'd have to do it
[00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:19.060]   I think that when you're looking at what you're going to do for ses as one of these manufacturers
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:22.020]   There's a company that just sold 10 million phones over the weekend
[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:24.820]   I mean, you know that and with the watch and with all those other things
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:27.460]   I think those are the things that are going to get their attention at the same time
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:31.780]   That's not going to convince everybody to replace their 45 dollar thermostat with a 200 dollar one
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:36.500]   Uh, so it's great that this infrastructure is there my goodness gracious
[00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:40.500]   By the way ladies and gentlemen new instagram filter we call it green
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:45.300]   I'm using the same barber Streisand cheese class who puts over the lens to give you this so that dreamy
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:47.300]   You know get rid of the crows crows filter
[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:50.020]   Not on my
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:52.260]   If you switch on optical let me stabilize in heaven
[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:55.060]   I'll see you look
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:57.700]   Is that smooch on the lens? No, it is not smooch on the okay. I'll
[00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.500]   I looks like the gain
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:06.100]   Okay, why don't I unplug this and plug plug the unplug the camera plug it back in because it was not doing that before
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:12.900]   Okay, but i'm just i'm just saying it's it's it's it's not like I think health kit is a bigger deal because right now today if you
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:18.020]   If you have ongoing health issues or if you're if you're a caretaker for somebody
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:23.380]   Just drill down into all those menus and all the metrics that you can put in there and that and organize really well
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:27.140]   The health stuff is also mean you just keep this thing in your pocket. It will track your activity
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:31.860]   It will track your fitness to a certain extent. So this is something that works today and people can really discover
[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:39.940]   I think that the home kit stuff is more like that we want this to be there so that when over the next three four five years when people start acquiring things that
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:43.620]   Unbeknownst to them their oven actually has home kit features
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:48.420]   Unbeknownst to them. They have a thermostat that had when they when they upgraded their their home heating system
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:52.820]   It actually had because it was only $13 more to build this component with home kit
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:56.180]   They actually added that that's why I think we're gonna look at where you're just gonna realize that
[00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:59.940]   Oh, well if this has that feature I could just look in this part of my phone in order to make that work
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.340]   What do you think of the the impact of the
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.740]   Of the apple
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.660]   Watch with all these health bands
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:10.900]   I mean because I just feel like this has been a big issue for me where I'm constantly having to choose
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:13.060]   I don't have one on right now because I keep on breaking them
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:16.980]   But whether it's fit bit or all these other things do we think that that kind of early on
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:21.860]   Part of why Nike got out of the business because they saw what was gonna always gonna happen to them
[01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:26.180]   I mean, I does it's it sounds familiar to something that I was I was talking to the
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.780]   At the amazon event I was talking to the vp who's in charge of devices
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:33.140]   And he was saying that you know amazon's policy is that you know what?
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:38.500]   Let somebody else get into the the the problems of keep building new devices
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:43.140]   And marketing them and maintaining them and doing support for them that by and large they're perfect
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.180]   They will sell their own line of kindles, but they're perfectly fine
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:51.620]   If they if other people are making phones and tablets and other devices that can still access their content
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.220]   So I feel as though it's the exact same thing
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:57.780]   I mean if app if I'm taking a guess that if app if Nike could say that
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:04.420]   If you put it to Nike that you can either ask them to continue to make and support the hardware and do nothing with services
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:08.260]   Or just do nothing but push electrons around and collect all that data
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.580]   Uh, I think they would much rather say, you know what?
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:16.820]   We're perfectly happy to let other people develop hardware then figure out how to make things not die when you sweat into them
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:21.460]   Nice thing about health kit is that for example if you have your apple watch
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:26.020]   But if you forget to charge it you could throw on a Fitbit go running and it'll sync back that information
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:30.500]   And as long as you're willing to share read write and you could choose granularly read write permissions
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:35.140]   You you now have if your stuff is no longer in a health silo all this stuff can share data
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:40.820]   So you can wear whatever you want whenever you want and you never lose out on the central repository of that information
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:44.340]   I feel like at this point
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:46.900]   one of the issues is
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:51.460]   The technology doesn't exist to do much more than measure heart rate and footsteps
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:55.940]   Uh, what I mean, what are you gonna wear a funny hat or a cuff
[01:01:55.940 --> 01:02:02.580]   You you currently I is there technology to do things like blood pressure on a wristwatch? I don't think so
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:06.580]   Or still still vio to max or I don't think so
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:09.300]   so, um
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:13.540]   But there's a lot of I mean we're a cart ahead of the horse here. We got to vet these things first
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:18.820]   But I think that even just those simple things means that you know, we we have that that basic those basic things that we're starting to
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:24.500]   Um, and I think that was a big thing when you're thinking about for all those people have fit bits or nike fuel bands or or thinking about them
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:31.060]   You know, the big thing is is now that if you take that number and you reduce that from the cost of the of the watch
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:34.980]   You now the watch seems a lot less expensive if you were thinking about doing both of those things
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:41.860]   And I think that that combination is a key thing to lowering the overall perceived cost of the of the watch and then it does all the other things like
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:45.220]   You know, right change the channels on your apple tv. Yeah
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:49.140]   My from my conversations with people in the health tech community
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:53.220]   They keep telling me that there's a big line between stuff that works and it's practical
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.980]   So long as you're selling it under prescription and using it under a doctor supervision
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.700]   This is the stuff when you talk about the technology that can actually do blood
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:04.340]   Blood glucose readings without having to do a stick. That's the sort of stuff we're talking about
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:08.100]   Well, excuse me. It doesn't exist. Does it?
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:15.220]   The technology is there they've got it's sort of like imagine like imagine if the back of this watch didn't have just leds but also had
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:17.620]   A grid of sandpaper so to speak
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:21.860]   And it can oh seriously and and it's essentially making micro perforations
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:25.460]   Not so much as to enough that they can actually get a good get a sample
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:28.100]   But not so much that it would actually be a problem
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:36.020]   But we're talking about sensors that we you would you would have an ongoing health issue for whom for which having a certain nonstop stream data
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:42.020]   Because the other issue and this is something I didn't really think about until it was explained to me at the in great in great excitement
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:49.380]   That uh one of the worst things that a doctor wants to hear is that oh, I bought this new gadget that gives me data on my health every single day
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:51.620]   And could you tell me what these numbers mean?
[01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:57.620]   Because it's the same it's an extension of the problem where hi. I've got a sniffle and now I've and now i've done a google search
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:00.500]   And I think I might have this incredibly rare
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.820]   Amazonian born disease
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:07.940]   And now this guy has to say well, unfortunately, ethically now i have to test you for this because now you've asked me about this
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.980]   Well, you raised that that's an important point, which is the privacy
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:17.780]   Side of this and now I think we understand a little bit better why tim cook has finally pulled the trigger on something I thought for a long time
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.420]   Apple should really focus on which is privacy
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:26.900]   Uh and and apple's marketing message should vary and it's going to need to be if they're going to do this medical stuff very clearly be
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.780]   We are not because i'm not going to give them my blood pressure
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:33.300]   If they're going to send it to an insurer so they have to really be very clear
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:36.420]   Starting today and tim cook has done that with his charlie ros interview
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:44.500]   They've announced that they're not that it will no longer be possible for law enforcement to send them an iphone and get them to decrypt it because
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:48.260]   We don't we don't have the technology. We've changed how it works
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:54.100]   This is going to be a bigger and bigger drum beat from apple. We're the privacy company google and facebook not so much
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:57.940]   We're the privacy company. We're the privacy company and that's going to be very important
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:04.420]   And it's going to be a huge advantage if they can get people to believe that because then nobody will trust a google health watch right?
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:11.940]   Well, I think that the the really interesting thing there is that apple has already identified tim cook's identify google as what he considers their number one competitor
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:16.740]   And by by really attacking privacy what they're really doing is being the anti google
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:19.300]   You know saying we don't care about any of your you know, we don't want your data
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:22.180]   And people some people don't care and so that's fine
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:28.660]   But I think that that they they are making they're providing a clear choice for consumers or what they perceive as a clear choice
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:33.300]   For consumers, it's even more important over that is health aspect, right? Right? No, absolutely
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:37.860]   I I'm not I don't really care home kit. I mean to be honest with you. I mean, there's a lot of you know
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:41.780]   People got a lot of people got very paranoid when when when we start seeing
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:46.420]   Drop cam and nest being bought by google. There's a lot of people that that concerns
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:52.100]   I I'm not really that it I'm not concerned about it personally. Yeah, well and I don't care if somebody's
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:56.500]   Scanning my my searches to give me better advertising that doesn't have
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:06:00.820]   Economic disadvantage, but boy and and maybe a lot of people don't care about that
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.820]   But boy with health they're gonna care
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:03.860]   Yeah, although dr
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:09.700]   My point's out that your doctor is already sending all of that stuff to your health insurance company as part of the deal with the health insurance
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:15.620]   I think a lot of people make choices about what they're gonna talk to their doctor about because they're concerned about about and I and I think that this is a
[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:22.020]   Little bit less after Obamacare and everything else assuming that continues is that I think a lot of the reason people were very
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:26.900]   Sensitive about privacy in the United States was because they were afraid of being turned down for health care because of it
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:30.740]   Existing the thing about privacy is that the way apple built it into health kit
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:33.700]   If you say you're not gonna share something they don't even know it exists
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:37.300]   It's not that they get a thing saying this is not shared because they believe even that leaks information
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:42.740]   They they're not even aware of it. So if you say don't share my blood data, it's not uh-huh. He must have diabetes
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:46.980]   It's that blood that doesn't exist that whole part of health kit is not active from st
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:51.460]   Louis, Missouri, Steven McGauley. What do we think of the rumor that the 12 inch
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:55.780]   Retina macbook air, which doesn't even exist yet, but it's going
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:07:01.860]   So there you go right there 12 inch backbook air and retina is going to be thinner fanless with smaller bezels
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:05.620]   What does that mean for other macbook hairs? Is that uh, you think of the next backbook here?
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:11.380]   Who cares about that Leo could be in gold silver and space gray? I mean, let's let's get on the important stuff
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:14.020]   the fingerprint reader
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:17.140]   I do think it'll be part-dashing. They make a lot thinner if they didn't have a screen on it
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:20.740]   Wow, I think that's all right guys get serious is it first of all
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:26.020]   Retina macbook air in 12 inches. We have heard the rumor of 12 inches. Yeah, I don't know
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:32.580]   I have an 11 inches. I mean the 11 inches not really 11 is the 13 inches not really 13 inch apple just rounds to those numbers
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:37.300]   So and retina on a macbook air doesn't seem very likely or with
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:42.180]   Yeah, it is right. Yeah, it's it's happening with probably that will have it as a broad will okay
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:45.620]   Yeah, and at least they built that I mean there's a lot of applications that we use
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:50.500]   I know on the 11 inch that become very difficult to use because of the limited resolution so a little bit more resolution
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.060]   Yeah, right. Yeah
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:55.940]   Uh by the way, Yosemite
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:01.780]   If you're running Yosemite, can you do all the hand-off stuff now with iOS 8? You can
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:08.660]   Yeah, I had a weird experience yesterday my phone my iPhone rang and my desktop said you're getting a call
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:10.580]   answer decline
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:13.460]   Yeah, uh on my desktop when you're somebody because I'm running the beta
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:17.700]   But then I hung up on my iPhone and it continued to ring on my desktop for another 30 seconds
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.620]   Which is not good. It's it's a little bit delayed
[01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:22.180]   But the cool thing is um, I have two friends
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:29.380]   I married georgia and anthony and they were both logged in on the same apple id and I would call one and both their phones would ring because the continuity
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:32.580]   Calling can shift between phones too. So if you have old phones
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:36.020]   You can make an extension system in your house suddenly you can leave them in different rooms
[01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:40.580]   And answer your phone no matter where you are or if you do want to have a situation where your partner is in a business
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:44.660]   And you want to make sure you don't miss a call all this stuff is going to enable a bunch of different workflows
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:46.340]   Are going to be really interesting going forward?
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:47.540]   I was I was a little embarrassed
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.780]   I was on a conference call the other day and my phone rang
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:56.020]   And of course I have it set up through google voice and now with uh continuity everything in my office
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:09:01.460]   Dozens of things all started ringing and I said, I'm sorry. This is like a clock job at noon
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:04.100]   I apologize, but that's because everything's ringing
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:07.300]   I mean the thing that I love about about like because I do all the texting with hangouts
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:12.740]   The big thing I love about hangouts and thing I hate about hangouts is when a hangout hits my android phone and my my ipad
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:18.820]   My computer and my phone all go off. It's very very difficult. They all have my apples now my apple stuff's ringing too
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:22.660]   That's happening on this podcast. I think a couple weeks ago my phone was ringing
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:27.860]   I turned it off in my pocket and all of a sudden my macbook and two ipads and another iphone started ringing in the other room
[01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:30.980]   And I was just desperately hoping no one could hear them. It's pretty amazing
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:33.220]   We are going to have some some issues there
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:37.540]   By the way, is this new because I found that among the ringtones and the alert tones
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:42.020]   On the iphone six there's a classic section and you can go back and get the previous
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:47.300]   uh ringtones i'm gonna I am going to set all my ringtones to the original marimba ringtone. Oh good
[01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:49.460]   It's so red. It's so good. I love that
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:56.980]   Also, you kind of get yourself programmed in a pat wovian way to respond. Yeah, I actually I use the I use the six plus as my alarm clock
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:59.300]   this morning and
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:04.660]   Usually I use my my android phone for that, but I even though it had been about like eight months to a year since the last time
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:08.500]   I'd use an iphone for that. I could not not use the same
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:13.220]   ringtone as I used like for two years or five years before that because I'm just
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:18.020]   Pavloneally programmed to respond to that. Oh, gotta wake up gotta wake up. Do you use chimes? Which one do you use?
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:20.660]   Um, I use the digital the
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:26.980]   Yeah, well because it's annoying enough that I won't just say you know what I can put up with this for 30 seconds
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:29.060]   But means that I don't pick it out of bed. This one is a
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:33.060]   One the ooga. Doesn't this bring back memories? Yeah
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:36.020]   And when you see when you see that on a
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:39.300]   On a tv show you go. Oh, that's old
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:45.700]   All my funds are gonna ring like this. That's that's the will home stream of uh of tv ringtones
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:50.660]   I love that. I love that
[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:52.980]   um
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:58.260]   That's robot, right?
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:05.380]   I didn't do that. Okay. Should we be Sean Kennedy asks a bit more concerned that swift key and other keyboards
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:11.780]   Use server side processing and can store everything you type on their servers. This would be a treasure trove to any hacker
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:14.660]   So this is a question that's coming up a lot now
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:20.500]   There's a lot of confusion and it's really sad because a swift key and a lot of those keyboards are bound by some of the decisions
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:24.100]   That apple made in the architecture if you look at how easy widgets are to install
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:28.340]   Uh, the keyboards are nowhere near near near is easily installed. You have to go into the keyboard section
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:31.380]   And unfortunately, there's not a lot of space inside the extension
[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:35.300]   So if you have a really big app like swift key has a ton of smarts behind it
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:39.300]   And they can't fit that into the extension so that has to live in the app
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:45.140]   And that means that you have to enable full access so the extension can talk back to the app and then send the information back to the extension
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:50.900]   That isn't server side at all, but because of the way it's labeled. It's very confusing. What am I giving full access to?
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:56.900]   They have a secondary service that lets you sync between with google plus or with facebook if for example, you know
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:02.100]   I have a nexus seven and nexus five an iphone and ipad if I want to sync that intelligence between all my devices
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:08.500]   I can enable that but that takes a secondary action inside the app. So I think it's just it's perfectly safe right now
[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.580]   There's a lot of confusion about it
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:14.580]   But people should realize that if they do put their stuff on servers then they are subject to all
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.180]   The benefits and liabilities of having stuff that lives on the cloud
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:21.620]   So this is what this is why I would trust something like swift key
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:25.300]   I would not necessarily trust an app that I'd never heard of no matter how brilliant it is
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:31.300]   So this is what I tell people because this has come up because apple of course was a massive warning when you turn on these third-party keyboards
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:36.660]   Which by the way google also does an android saying this keyboard can gather everything you type and
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:43.140]   And send it back to their servers. You have to agree. Okay, I'm gonna do that and that's scaring the pants off people
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:44.500]   um
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:48.580]   And but what I tell them is well, it's now explicit, but it's always been going on
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:52.740]   Don't you think that any any program or any on your computer at all can do anything it wants
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:56.500]   Including send every keystroke back absolutely. So you're trusting every
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:13:02.260]   Program on your laptop or computer right just because desktop software has never warned you
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:04.500]   Do we do we think that oh on your computer? Absolutely?
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:09.780]   Well, that's what but I'm saying you're already doing that all the time on any computer. Oh, it's also b
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:12.020]   b
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:15.140]   Every bit of software running on any device has this risk
[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:20.100]   There's a trust factor in using in fact there's a trust factor in civilization
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:22.580]   No, is there it does apple do one thing we don't know
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:26.580]   I don't know is whether apple is doing any kind of that's part of their for app store
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:32.500]   Either on the computer or on the iphone whether that kind of communication back and forth is considered
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:38.580]   Um, yeah, so they have to declare it. Yeah, it's an it's an intent in the android world
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.020]   I don't know what they call it in the apple world. Well, yeah
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:45.780]   So they they have to make like they can run without any supervision if they are only local if they want to do anything with a cloud
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:50.580]   They have to declare it to you more importantly though apple has taken what some people find annoying measures
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:56.980]   But would they consider safe measures for example third-party keyboards get deactivated in the password field it defaults back to the iOS keyboard
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:01.700]   On the phone pad because that has to be secure carrier communications third-party keyboards can't act
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:04.740]   There's a there's a series of what's considered high security
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:10.740]   Elements that the third party keyboard just has absolutely no access to and it's typically security involved
[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:15.860]   So even if you are worried about it when you go to put in something that is incredibly sensitive information
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:21.780]   That keyboard just doesn't have access anymore. Well, and actually that's something that drives me crazy because apple because of their paranoia
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:24.740]   Switches back to the crap apple keyboard
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:28.980]   Whenever i'm entering a password, which is the time i most want swift key
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:33.620]   Because it has lower case keycaps and so and so it
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:37.780]   I think apple's implementation because and this is where the paranoia
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:42.580]   I understand paranoia and if apple's gonna be the privacy company then they have to do all of this
[01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:46.420]   And it's why i probably i'm not going to end up using iOS
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:53.380]   Because this paranoia means that you live in this kind of weird world where not everything everything you want to do can be done
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:57.140]   I think you have to decide do I trust swift key
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:00.740]   Um, I do and I have for a long time on an android
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:05.060]   If you don't then you should continue to use the apple keyboard and understand that you're trusting apple
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:08.180]   Um, and you're I mean that's you know
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:14.660]   Um, that's the way it is in the real world and on desktop always I think any any program running on a desktop OS can do that
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:17.140]   I mean do we but I guess one question is do we think that?
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:21.460]   passwords the way that we think of them as we start to see the
[01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:25.300]   um touch id and other things related to that do we think that
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:28.660]   Those are gonna we're gonna continue to use them five years from now or ten years maybe five years
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:31.300]   But maybe ten years from now. I think that almost everything will be biometric
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:34.020]   Because it's just much it's just a lot more
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.220]   efficient
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:38.020]   Like it wasn't the technology wasn't there to do it before
[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:41.220]   But I think that at this point we're really getting to a point where
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:46.420]   Um, that technology is going to continue to go if you look at the kind of what apple's able to do just with your iPhoto
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:49.060]   You know, um images
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:53.860]   That mixed with with your you know all the things that have been used in security for quite some time
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:59.060]   Um, it seems like those are the kind of things that we're gonna start seeing added to a lot of these things
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:01.060]   Just make it actually easier
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:07.140]   Am I wrong somebody in the chairman says oh no you can switch it so that you don't have to use the apple keyboard during password entry
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:14.340]   No, as far as I know that's just that's totally locked down you have to get it's which it forces you back into the apple keyboard for passwords
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:14.980]   Yes
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:18.660]   I mean if it's using the proper path if it's using an iOS proper password field that they have a fake
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:18.900]   You know
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:23.460]   Because the maid pass doesn't always do it but it when it's an official that password field it doesn't and I think when you're locked
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:26.660]   I think before if you've never entered your credentials you can't access a
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:31.140]   Third party keyboard either, which is why some people don't see it on the lock screen if they haven't logged in
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:36.340]   Yeah, having said that I would say apple is correct to do this. This is the right path for apple
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:41.940]   They should make themselves the privacy company the safe company and those people who are paranoid
[01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:48.820]   Will then flock to apple because there's you're and and the people who want more capability and functionality will leave apple
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:51.940]   But that's you know that will be a very clear choice. Always been the case
[01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:59.140]   Yeah, that's always been something it's it's privacy in 2014 is what security was 10 years ago for them
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:03.540]   Where they could simply they could really put that in the ad said well, you know, there's no there are no viruses
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:06.980]   There's no malware. It's always there and then eventually okay
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:12.740]   There is some so they can't make that message again, but privacy really is something they have control over the only the only
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:16.340]   caveat to that is that always make sure you know that
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:21.300]   There is nothing really preventing them from going back on that on a case by case basis
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:26.100]   So it's possible that there will be a tool that they release in the future where at some level
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:31.140]   They'll decide that it's just too valuable to us to look at this data as it's coming in
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:34.420]   Even if it's only to make sure that this device is running properly
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:39.460]   And it's not as though apple's going to say oh by the way we decided to and not anonymously collect a
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:44.740]   performance information from people who are using an iPhone in this particular situation
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:49.940]   But there is it there the fact remains that there is no company that I would trust with that kind of information
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:52.420]   Of that scale more than apple
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:58.980]   One of the cool new things in iOS 8 is you can choose to share your diagnostic information with apple and with developers
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:03.780]   But then if you go into the diagnostic section it lists every report and what it's sending back
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:06.340]   Like for example if an app was jetson because it ran out of memory
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:10.340]   There's a jetson report for it in that section. So you have a lot of transparency into it now
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:15.460]   I'm a little bit worried that they're being a little bit too verbose because over the past weekend i've gotten i've gotten so many
[01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:18.820]   Do you know that do you know that this app is still has the ability to do this?
[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:22.980]   Do you want to continue to do that? I'm saying I my my initial thought as well
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:27.940]   I know you wouldn't you wouldn't be warning me about this unless there was a bad thing that the app should not be doing
[01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:32.420]   So maybe I should turn that off so I really it's my understanding that it's something to do that
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:34.500]   I hope once per app, right
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:38.900]   But it's for the settings lately you have a location settings have changed it used to be always no
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:40.500]   So here's the deal no no no wait a minute
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.740]   This is what's happening to me rene and I think it's happening to andi
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:46.900]   I give it approval to have location settings. It says you want to allow that I say yes
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:51.700]   Then at some time a couple of days later it says you know it's still doing this is that okay with you
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:52.980]   Yeah
[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:58.340]   And is that I am hoping that if I say allow the second time it will stop nannying me
[01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:04.980]   Because it's like I cannot use my phone at this point without a pop up all of every every minute or so
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:08.260]   It's driving me up the way I go through I have to admit I turn
[01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:12.420]   Both on my computer and my phones like I go in turn most of the notifications off
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:13.700]   You can't turn that one off right?
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:18.980]   Unfortunately if you choose always like if you choose just an app it's only going to allow location in the app and it shouldn't bother you again
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:24.340]   If you choose always that location can persist and when it thinks the app is using it outside of its normal function
[01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:29.220]   Like for example, even it's own app like the apple store app if you've left the apple store for three or four hours
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:34.420]   And it's still using your location. It's gonna it's gonna pop up that warning and say are you really sure this just will be using it
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:38.980]   And part of that is battery life because you know people complain all the time and location is one of the biggest
[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:45.300]   Battery drains and part of that is just it wants you to know that an app is using your location when it doesn't think it needs it anymore
[01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:49.380]   So I want to be clear. This is a good thing for apple to do
[01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:54.260]   But then the user is going to have to make the choice. Do I want to live in this world or a world where
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:57.300]   Anything goes and I don't get all these annoying alerts
[01:19:57.300 --> 01:20:02.660]   I hope google doesn't start doing this too. I fear that they will and then it's it's a big problem though
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:05.860]   Because a lot of people just get dialogue fatigue like you see I have it
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:07.220]   Can I use your contacts or your camera?
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:11.700]   Can I use your scut your twitter? Can I use and people just start pressing the button and they don't read anymore?
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:16.660]   I mean apple has privacy sheets now if you go into settings into the app it shows you all the permissions
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:20.260]   Right and I would much rather that she'd come up the first time and let me look at it
[01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:24.020]   Then have pop up after pop up that I get frustrated and blast through yeah
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.660]   That that should be sufficient. I think
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:29.540]   um
[01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:36.660]   We're gonna wrap things up here pretty quick before I uh do I take a few more questions? I'm not sure
[01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:39.540]   Where we stand here apple tv
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:43.460]   Health kit we already answered I think a lot of it we talked about the the bent phones
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:47.620]   Yeah, there's this rumor or story going around that these phones the big ones are bending
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:52.580]   Yeah, the people who are just putting their pockets sitting down and then they don't sit on it
[01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:57.700]   They don't well or they or and so they come home and they put it on the table and notice that's now like about
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:00.180]   It's like Pringles shaped a little bit
[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:02.740]   And it's still hard to find but
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:08.340]   And they you know they should try to sell it on ebay as a prototype curved screen, you know, uh rumored device
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:12.660]   Uh, so i'm sure that if they take it back to apple to the june's bar
[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:19.700]   Uh, there are people in kubertino will be very interested to find out. Okay. How the hell did that happen and how can we prevent that from happening in the future?
[01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:26.100]   My understanding is like this is and we we covered it because you know if you know the basics of physics and materials
[01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:29.860]   This is aluminum and it's large and if you put sufficient force on it
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:35.460]   It's gonna bend and if you put even more force on it, it's gonna break and if you sit on it with a roundback side on a flat thing
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:38.100]   It's gonna start taking the shape of that roundback side
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:41.300]   And there's unfortunately nothing apple can do to change the laws of physics
[01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:44.900]   But what they can do is educate people and say maybe it's not a good idea to put this
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:48.740]   You know 5.5 inch phone in your jean pocket and then sit on it for six seven hours
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:51.540]   Or maybe they can look at this day and say okay
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:58.340]   Maybe there's a cost to making this as thin as possible because if we put a a thick steel frame around it that didn't happen
[01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:02.900]   But actually no actually that had happened with I think with a couple of five five and five s's
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:07.140]   But uh, it's there's things that don't happen with other just phone designs
[01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:10.500]   That is a fun. That is a funny fault for a phone
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:13.380]   I mean the Wi-Fi issue is driving me up the wall with iOS 8
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:17.780]   But that would be a funny funny fault that oh I've I have a curved phone now. Isn't that interesting?
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:20.820]   You know what that'll go for on eBay
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:22.820]   Yeah, he just knows
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:27.940]   You know if it if it goes that far without breaking it you could see someone organizing themselves around that
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:29.940]   You know building a nice little form
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:36.100]   Uh what any any other issues that uh, we uh want to address here
[01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:42.740]   There's some like the Wi-Fi issue Andy mentioned whenever apple updates for some reason Wi-Fi is always a problem for some people
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:46.900]   Is almost like the butterfly effect now where the software is so complicated that
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:51.700]   Uh, you have infinite variety and infinite situations of different errors for people
[01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:55.620]   So i'm sure Andy's getting the same thing people will tweet me saying if you heard a lot of people saying this
[01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:58.980]   No, only you but it is a really bad problem for you and it yeah
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:02.740]   We set up like five or six phones and they're all different they all have different bugs
[01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:08.260]   I had a problem like that and I was very relieved that john groover has it too. So now I don't look like I think i'm just being a
[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:09.380]   pissant
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:11.620]   I think that is I think inside kupertino
[01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:17.860]   There's like a little there's a little rule of thumb saying that we're not the the the o s can't possibly be finished yet until something breaks
[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:19.860]   Wi-Fi then we know that
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:22.660]   I was trying to use you know
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:27.780]   I come back to ios after a couple of years away
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:34.340]   And uh, one of the things they changed is if you have itunes match turned on on the phone you can no longer sync music over usb right
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:37.540]   Yeah, um, which I i'm not sure I under fully understand
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:39.060]   Do that anymore?
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:44.900]   Well, right it's very old-fashioned right because i've heard of this thing i tune spatch so what we do is i actually don't use i
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:49.860]   Oh, you don't use i had Spotify. I was like, so i want i'm going on an airplane my bags are packed i'm ready to go
[01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:54.020]   I want to have a bunch of classical music to sleep by on my iphone
[01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:57.700]   So I have a nice playlist that I like about 900 songs
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:02.740]   So I can't sync it so i go well, that's no problem because itunes match i can just download it
[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:05.540]   Except no apparently
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:12.100]   About half of them downloaded the rest and so for the rest of the day i was getting messages can't download that can't download that can't download that
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:18.900]   And even though these were purchased on the itunes store they're legit blah blah blah. It's just a flaw and apparently it's a long-standing flaw
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:24.980]   In the itunes match nothing nothing in my itunes library was able to sync back down
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:28.900]   Stuff i purchased the itunes store no good stuff that's synced through i do you had a good
[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:35.860]   Yeah, and that's and that's particularly galling because the actually the first thing i did because i've so much music purchased through the amazon mp3 store was
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:38.820]   Download the mp amazon mp3 app sign in
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:46.340]   So i please download every single thing i've ever purchased in five years to this device and 45 to a minis to an hour later
[01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:50.740]   I had 1500 to a thousand two thousand songs on this device. It was that easy it was nice
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:57.460]   So that's not apple that's amazon. They don't work for apple and why how can they make this work an apple can't well and and
[01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:00.580]   The other problem i was having is i couldn't stop
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:04.660]   There's no cancel you can go one by one, but you can't cancel the whole minor
[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:11.540]   Dave whiskers who's john groover's partner uh posted a solution maybe for him, but everyone can benefit you just you on checks sync music
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:15.700]   Delete all your music and then reaching recheck sync music and that's helped a lot of people
[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:18.180]   Uncheck sync music
[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:24.020]   Yeah in iTunes and then delete music general usage manage storage just delete the music and then just start over another work
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:30.500]   Yes, well, it's all right because what i ended up doing is wiping this phone restoring from backup and trying and then doing it via usb
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.700]   Which is what i wanted to do in the first place so my tip to everybody is
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:37.220]   You i know it's old fashioned
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:44.340]   But but but sync you get your match stuff on your desktop and then sync over usb if you're moving more than us a few songs over
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:47.860]   I find that my my spot advice my spotify
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:52.740]   Subscription works great. Yeah, maybe that's how i just made local is well screw it guys
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:55.860]   You shouldn't be doing that anyway. It just seems like this is something that should work
[01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:59.540]   It's been and it's been a couple of years apparently which i was surprised to find out
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:04.340]   Um, it says for some people's they've been all these problems like the wife's not everybody
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:05.860]   Yeah, and that's it's hard
[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.820]   Yeah, it was about 50/50 on twitter but half the people said well that never happens to me
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:11.220]   Works just fine and about half the people said i know isn't that awful
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:16.820]   And i don't want to make excuses because this is where people start calling us apologists and sometimes rightly so but i every
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:21.220]   I think there's some sort of rose colored glasses because everyone says you know this version of ios is a bug
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:26.580]   Whenever but i go back and i look at the articles i wrote a year ago and two years ago and there's like massive amounts of re springs
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:28.900]   Or incredible battery drain and every zero
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:34.580]   Every x dot. Oh is bad and it says pickly bad because you came from 7.1 point three which
[01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:39.540]   Fixed a ton of problems and they're working on fixing a ton of problems too and they're prioritizing them and well
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:43.780]   Let me point out though. This is not an ios 8 problem. This has been a problem for two years, right?
[01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:48.980]   Yeah, it's a long standing problem that apples never fixed and voiceover i think is broken now too
[01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:52.340]   Which is affecting a lot of accessibility people and they've gone to fix that as well
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:55.140]   I think what happens with apple but look all technology
[01:26:55.140 --> 01:27:01.460]   Breaks it all does everybody and apple gets a lot of free pass a lot because people love it so much
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:06.820]   And they find workarounds i found a workaround so they they put up with it and it doesn't get fixed
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:10.340]   Well, but in broad strokes i grieve for nay
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:16.820]   I mean, especially when you have such a major update such as ios 8 i will give any i will give microsoft
[01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:24.500]   I will give google i will give apple a month to solve any of the deal killers that happen once they ship something two months to
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:29.700]   Eliminate the bugs that are annoying and don't affect everybody right?
[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:34.260]   It's only when we get into the 90 day mark when i say okay you guys need to
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:40.180]   You guys need to you're no longer allowed to get the name brand cereal in the cafeteria
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:46.660]   You get the generic brand churios from costco until you fix this because you need to be punished somehow. This is not acceptable
[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:51.940]   Um another one that will probably be fixed plants versus zombies doesn't work on any of the iphones
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:55.780]   We've tried and we've tried quite a few of those that's that now now we're getting serious
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:28:02.100]   Match thing is not important, but i'm not upgrading till i know the plans pvz's got to work
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:07.380]   Well, I think it's because and this is was a little puzzlement to me that apple's only giving a gigabyte of ramp to this
[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:11.940]   Phone, that's one thing i thought maybe was a little under specked but well
[01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:16.980]   Yeah, I mean we should really start playing with this over extended period
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:21.060]   It's it's always nicer to know that this has more application memory than less
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:24.820]   But then you have to sort of like complaining that this doesn't have uh
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:31.060]   The the cpu is only 50 faster in terms of actual like a clock rate then
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:34.740]   Let's actually play with it. I haven't actually seen any problems with it
[01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:39.220]   Uh over the past four or five days and i've only granted i've only had two or three hours
[01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:41.700]   Which I was trying to really make it cry
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:46.180]   Uh, but I want to work process this I want to be streaming music off of this
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:49.860]   And I want to be downloading something in the background and it was still working fine
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:52.340]   So there i guess they're just limits to what a phone
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:54.980]   What what a human can expect a phone to do
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:29:00.580]   You'd actually you would actually pull out your own hair and tire yourself out trying to run apps on its small phone
[01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:03.780]   I just want my safari tabs to stay around longer
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:08.980]   That's the only thing that the ram meditation is still killing me on is almost one safari tab every time we'll reload
[01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:12.820]   Since day one it's the most frustrating thing because hey, I need to oh what who my
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:17.060]   What's the street address for this place? Oh, I have the map on safari. Oh there it is. It's far
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:19.220]   No, don't reload it. Yes
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:26.260]   Are you trying to make you just not like me you showed it to me just long enough to take it away from me again
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:30.580]   Are you are not on my side for an easily stressful device? That's a very interesting
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:32.660]   position to take phone
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:41.140]   If fush anything is if 1.3 megabyte megabytes of ram would work perfectly apples like i have to put in two megabytes and then how much power does that drain every time they light up two megabytes
[01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:44.660]   So it's it's all a crazy science to get these things to work
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:47.460]   And I understand that messing with the ingredients messes with the recipe
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:52.980]   But I would really like to have you know four or five safari tabs open. You know, crazy six tabs open
[01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:56.020]   Let me have you think it's a ram issue
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:30:01.220]   Yeah, I think they're just not still or they're being incredibly aggressive and not caching them
[01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:06.500]   I mean, whatever it is is reloading my tabs every camera rolls gone, but that's fine. You got recent pictures
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:11.060]   That's the camera roll, right? Except somebody was saying that the ex-if information is no longer preserved
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:17.540]   It's confused people because you if you're used to for years having a camera and you go there and it's gone and apple never explains anything
[01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:22.020]   So that's you know, that's something has changed someone's coming to your phone and change something and that's always distressing
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:28.260]   Recent photos is not quite camera roll because it only holds a certain amount of photos and camera roll used to hold all of them
[01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:31.460]   Right. I'll be it it would put screenshots and downloads and everything together
[01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:37.780]   So now you still have your collections and you know years and moments to be clear every picture you take is still on the phone
[01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:41.860]   Yes, it's not where you thought it was it's not where it used to be. Yeah
[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:45.060]   So
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:49.460]   Others people. I'm sorry. This is just interrupt. This is exactly what you're talking about
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:55.620]   Ways has been using your location in the background. Do you want to continue doing this? Yeah? You're like, uh, my hope is
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:31:00.260]   Is it's only gonna do that once it's a pop-up? It's not a notification. It's a pop-up. So this is what I'm doing
[01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:02.420]   But I'm interrupted to make this exactly like okay
[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:05.140]   I've been getting those all day and it's driving nuts
[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:08.900]   But I presume that once I get through all 159 of my applications
[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:15.220]   It will stop doing that the other thing that's been confusing people is the battery usage because they you've got battery shaming like you do in Yosemite
[01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:19.140]   But it's it's confusing for some people because you go there and you'll see for example tweetbot
[01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:25.460]   Is using 40 percent of your energy and you've got to think is is it because I'm always tweeting if it is then that's perfectly normal
[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:29.300]   But if google hangouts is using 40 percent of energy and you haven't launched it in four days
[01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:34.420]   That's not normal and you might want to kill that well in some ways do we think that that apple is subtly
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:40.740]   pressing on the developers if that keeps on coming up like if I had ways and it kept on doing that all the time
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:45.620]   I would be tempted as a user to get rid of it because it just if I can't turn it off and it may be
[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:48.980]   a way to hint to the developers that they need to
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:51.620]   Be more austere about how they're using the phone
[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:59.300]   I heard a story that when some of the developers saw the the battery shaming technology like ha ha that's very funny putting that in the beta
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:03.460]   They're like no we're shipping this like what do you mean? You can't ship that i'm gonna have tons of customer complaints
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:07.140]   And apple's position is people complain to apple about battery life and they'll take it
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:11.540]   But if you're making a bad app they would like they would prefer the customers complain directly to you
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:16.260]   There is there remains I think this is a hole that's been around for a long time
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:19.380]   But you should know about it the serie lock screen issue
[01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:24.660]   Where you can actually go up to somebody's phone locked and launch serie and say
[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:27.220]   Send a facebook message
[01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:32.820]   I'm not wearing any pants right now and it will go on their facebook stream without any further permissions
[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:38.180]   Uh if you don't want that to happen. I I don't feel like it's a bug. I feel like it's not a feature
[01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:44.100]   Yeah, but it's a feature to walk up and it's a convenience and you know with the new hey serie
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:48.580]   Sorry with the new I can't I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm plugged in you can do it leo
[01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:54.020]   To me, but everybody watching their iphone just woke up. It's fine if if it's plugged in and you do
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:55.780]   HS
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:33:01.700]   Uh that you could do it without touching anything. So in theory I could right now say
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:04.580]   HS
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:06.740]   Send a facebook message. I'm not wearing
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:11.540]   Right now hold up your phone and we have to wait a bit because it says do you want me to send the message?
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:14.420]   I'm not wearing any pants right now and you say yes
[01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:19.140]   And then like thousands of people's facebook will have that message
[01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:21.860]   I haven't tried it yet because i'm afraid
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:24.820]   I haven't tried it on the iphone six
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:29.940]   But on the iphone five s if you just you could set it up so that you had to have touch id to make serie work on the lock screen
[01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:33.460]   And in that way if some random over rando puts their finger on it. Nothing happens
[01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:35.540]   So that's why my that's my message
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:40.180]   Which is if this bothers you or you're worried about this you absolutely must
[01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:43.620]   Go into your settings in the passcode settings and disable serie
[01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:46.500]   Uh, but I think I don't think apple considers that a bug
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:53.220]   I think they consider a feature now here is a video that effin done sent us of of uh president obama
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:55.860]   triggering
[01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:57.700]   His iphone
[01:33:57.700 --> 01:33:59.220]   watch this
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:05.220]   The counter is hateful ideology and to stop the flow of fighters into and out of the region
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:12.340]   Last night. We also took strikes to disrupt plotting against the united states and our allies by seasoned al-kite operatives
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:16.820]   In serie who are known as the chorus on group apparently seria and serie
[01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:20.740]   Are close enough a match it's launched serie
[01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:28.100]   Here's all i got to say is is that we just hope that there's no there's no government programs in there that could be activated serie
[01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:30.740]   Where you go? Hey serie, please launch the iowa nukes
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:38.340]   But you see the problem if a lot of people are sitting watching us with their iphones plugged in I could probably prank them
[01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:40.420]   Right
[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:42.820]   Well, I I think I just tried but I don't know if it worked
[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:47.940]   We had that where someone yelled hey seriously on a podcast and then a bunch of people yeah launch the nukes
[01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:50.900]   Yes, I am the president bye bye
[01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:55.780]   And I mean bye bye
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:35:01.460]   Uh, all right. We're gonna take a break come back and have your picks of the week. I think we've got a bunch of good stuff
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:03.780]   Is there before I do that I
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:08.420]   This is such a big show. There's so much to talk about and we've just touched the surface beats
[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:12.980]   There's some debate tech crunch says the beats streaming service will be
[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:19.460]   Disbranded that apple will absorb it and somehow into its own i radio service
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:24.660]   apples kind of denying this recode said that yeah apple spokesperson said no that's not the case
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:28.100]   And yet, uh, I have to say that tech crunch had five
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:35.380]   People say this five unnamed sources seems like a pretty sure thing and it's kind of how apple would operate any any thoughts on that
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:41.540]   Two brands are too are too many one too many. Yeah, well, I think the other thing is is that the beats
[01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:45.700]   Uh headphones have a lot of brand recognition, but the beats uh service is not
[01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:50.580]   It was a flop because it came too late. It was it's cool and it's great, but it's just not apple
[01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:55.940]   And so they need to maybe use it for something that I don't think but I don't think there's no reason to keep that brand
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:56.900]   Yeah
[01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:01.300]   Uh, it's interesting that they put the the beats app on the demo phones during the launch event
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:07.140]   But certainly the actual phones. Yeah, not on the actual phones that may that may be wonder if there was actually going to be shipping with the beats app on
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:10.100]   Yeah, I thought maybe and I think the fact that it wasn't it's telling
[01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:15.700]   Why not you're in america? Yeah, well, you don't care right. It's not available. No
[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:19.780]   We get nothing you get nothing and we got nothing so we're equal
[01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:22.260]   Um
[01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:23.860]   Anything else
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:26.980]   Last minute chance to get any it so much leo I know
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:33.780]   People talking about the iCloud groupers says that the uh the uh apple watch edition will be $6,000
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:40.420]   Could it's solid gold solid 18 carat gold. Mm-hmm. Why would you buy a watch for $6,000? It's obsolete in a year
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:44.900]   I think there are so many engineers that have no time and a lot of money
[01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:49.300]   There's people who spend $6,000 on a on a single air airplane flight
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:53.940]   Yeah, well, that's my my question. See my question is that so that you
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:58.980]   You are the you are the sort of you are the sort of executive who can afford to have a $6,000 solid gold watch
[01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:04.260]   And you buy the $6,000 solid gold watch because you have a unique $6,000 solid gold watch
[01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:06.500]   How will it make you feel when you walk?
[01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:13.700]   You know to the outer office passed by one of your assistants who has a $350 sports version of the exact same watch that you have
[01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:16.420]   That doesn't do anything that your watch doesn't do
[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:18.740]   I'm the same thing as you
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:22.580]   But the thing is that when you're the same coca-cola as you do when you buy a Rolex
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:26.420]   I mean it does exactly the same thing as everybody else's watch in fact sometimes it doesn't do as well
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:32.740]   You can talk about the the centuries of the tradition of watchmaking and how this is a special escapement and look
[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:37.060]   How the sweet pan is it how much work how to go to make sure it doesn't have to go click click click click click
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:39.780]   It's it's a timepiece, but it's a special timepiece
[01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:43.940]   If you block out the fact that all this is the same watch in a different metal
[01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:50.180]   So unless they unless they decide they're going to make come up with a brand new design to make it a little bit more flashy to really point out that
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:52.180]   Hey, look I didn't just spend
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:58.340]   $4,750 more on this for sorry $4,650 more on this for absolutely nothing
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:03.620]   I actually look it has a inscribed line and a special color red on the bezel
[01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:07.940]   There you go. Oh is that gold? That's so cute. I have an addition
[01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:14.100]   If anybody buys an edition it'll be me but I but you and you made it
[01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:15.860]   I mean I know I'm a sucker for this craft
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:17.060]   I was lining up for the edition
[01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:22.820]   Um, but how about the line of people who will have $6,000 in cash in their pockets at 2am and so-ho?
[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:25.300]   Oh man, what do you think you think that'll happen?
[01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:27.140]   Sure. I don't know
[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:30.020]   I don't all I know is I hope they've got police there
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:33.140]   Shanghai billionaires
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:36.020]   um
[01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:39.380]   In a weird
[01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:44.100]   Kind of uh confluence of prepaid advertising Joan Rivers is
[01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:47.460]   Uh posted from the grave that she bought on phone six
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:50.980]   Uh apparently on her instagram facebook feed
[01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:55.380]   Apparently, uh, this was just purchased earlier and scheduled
[01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:58.020]   Uh
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:00.980]   Uh, they were quickly taken down so don't go looking for them. I just did
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:07.700]   Uh, she tweets or facebook's this badass is being replaced by an iPhone 6 not the fat one
[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:10.980]   Uh, wow

[01:41:59.060 --> 01:42:04.180]   And it and it and it over the past three weeks. It's it's not pristine anymore
[01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:08.260]   But it's required. It's acquired a nice little bit of patina. Yeah. Yeah, it's nice
[01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:12.900]   It's it's a nice and that's just one of like a million different treatments. You can have on this phone
[01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:17.940]   That's it's awfully nice. This makes me ask you the question and you are very famously about a year and a half ago
[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:20.340]   Banding the iPhone for android
[01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:23.460]   Are you going back with the iphone six? Have you decided yet?
[01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:30.260]   Haven't decided yet. I want to I have the luxury of course of being able to live with an iphone six and an iphone six plus for a while
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:32.340]   Without actually having to buy one
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:34.500]   I love these two new phones
[01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:40.740]   The I will I will say this if I had known two years ago that apple was definitely going to be come out with not one
[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:45.380]   But two larger sized phones and that they'd be creating an update to the operating system that allows
[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:49.780]   Applications to talk to each other more efficiently and even swap out keyboards
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:53.380]   I might have held out for another couple years to see what happened
[01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:56.260]   But the fact matter is I'm really happy with android
[01:42:56.260 --> 01:42:58.100]   So I'm really gonna have to give that a lot of thought
[01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:01.140]   I will tell you that for the first time in since I made that switch
[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:06.980]   Boy is it tempting and maybe I will be using ios in about five or six months time. Yeah, it's an interesting
[01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:10.100]   Challenge for me as well great time to be
[01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:14.660]   Using any kind of phone, but what a great time to be using an iphone
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:22.820]   So I'm legitimately totally sincerely excited about this. What a great time for apple my attitude towards this is now
[01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:25.460]   officially a tie
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:32.180]   That you can get that it's really a personal choice what you feel you want there if you want a bigger screen
[01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:36.420]   You can get it if you want their barry creepy. It is now a tie. There's no reason
[01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:39.940]   Uh, you know no, there's different you know differences in both ways
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:48.180]   I mean i messages the ability to send audio messages is so sweet so easy the ability to accidentally send naked selfies also sweet and easy
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:50.580]   There thanks for those Leo
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:52.580]   There there are
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:58.340]   There and so there are differences obviously and and but now you have a very very good range of choices
[01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:02.580]   And that's great. We're in a mature industry where there's a lot of good stuff out there
[01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:07.780]   Yeah, and I feel like apple had some catching up to do and absolutely did it and boy nobody makes it better
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:14.580]   Better hardware. I mean as a physical object. There's nothing more pleasant than an iphone. I may absolutely want to put it in my pants
[01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:16.500]   object
[01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.500]   Every have a show title
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:20.740]   Andy and not go
[01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:23.540]   Um, but is your pick at the link?
[01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:27.860]   My pick of the week is an oldie, but a goody good reader for ios
[01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:34.900]   This is an amazing app with not with a somewhat clunky interface. It's not all it's not the slickest nicest like web
[01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:38.260]   5 18.0 ios 8 style interface
[01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:47.220]   But what it is is it's it's job is twofold to allow you to take any file you have on any computer anywhere on your network or anywhere in the cloud
[01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:54.900]   And put it onto your iphone and then the second thing is any document any file of any kind to let you read and or play that file
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:56.500]   so uh
[01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:58.500]   We've others
[01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:01.460]   iTunes is a concept by which we measure our pain on some days
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:08.260]   And so I have to have to admit that to get like comic book files to get movie files to get documents onto the iphone
[01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:13.620]   It's as easy as just simply i'm afraid i don't have a i don't have the setup for
[01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:17.860]   for crane can three thousand the future of video podcasting to give you a demonstration
[01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:20.100]   And we're also i know we're running a little bit late
[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:25.140]   But you just simply say look for places where you can get files off of the and off of my network
[01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:30.980]   And it found every single machine that has file sharing it found my NAS it's found everything
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:38.260]   Navigate through all the structure for once you've logged in and credentialed yourself and this basically take any file that's on there and bring it onto this device
[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:41.220]   You can either use it for really really easy just point to point
[01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:46.100]   I've got a file that's on this macbook or on this note windows notebook. I want to move it from here to there
[01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:51.380]   Just uh, enable that feature here and now this basically becomes its own Wi-Fi file server
[01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:58.260]   You can copy that file from here to there. This is still the one serious serious serious fundamental pain point for me
[01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:03.140]   With ios devices it is so difficult to get a file from over here to over here
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:09.300]   And if you have a good reader on the device you are 95 of the way towards a solution to that
[01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:12.980]   It's just i've tried so many other file managers for ios
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:18.180]   None of them are as magical almost as good reader where it is truly tap this one button
[01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:22.980]   If it is available for sharing anywhere on your home network or any on your on any of your cloud servers
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:25.060]   It can get it for you
[01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:31.860]   And right now it's on sale for 299. I don't know how long that sale has been going on or if it's one of those things where we'll just keep it on sale for 299
[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:35.060]   Until we can afford that tesla that we've been having our eyes on
[01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:39.860]   But the fact the matter is it is on discount for 299 and worth every damn penny
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:44.260]   Uh, an iphone is almost not a complete phone for me until i have a good reader on it and this is
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:48.180]   I really wish that apple should just write a huge check
[01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:53.220]   Buy this product and call it the finder and ship it on every single iphone that exists
[01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:57.460]   Well, i have to try it again because of course i used it when the ipad first came out and used it for a long time
[01:46:57.460 --> 01:47:01.220]   I just have and it's probably still on my ipad. Yeah, it's really it's really grown
[01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:06.580]   It's uh, I tend to re-up it re-updated every five or six months and every five or six months
[01:47:06.580 --> 01:47:11.220]   A i used it. I used the first version. I thought oh gee this is really just look very good
[01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:16.260]   Only does a couple of things but then the year after that wow they made it 50 percent as good as it is right now
[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:20.820]   And then a year after that it became kind of in the form it is right now and it became absolutely essential
[01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:26.260]   It would be nice if they hired someone to give the user interface a bit of a polish because it is rather
[01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:32.020]   Literal so to speak it is like the first is is the first design that you put off the whiteboard to say
[01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:35.060]   Let's just make sure all the features work and then once we've got this lockdown
[01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:38.500]   Then we'll redesign the interface and they never got around to redesign the interface
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:43.300]   But I don't care I would much rather have an app that's as functional as this and make it a little bit of a
[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:48.740]   Little bit of a mutt as far as interface goes and have the most beautiful interface in the world and say well
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:54.900]   It only does one thing it gets things off of microsoft cloud drive, but boy the interface isn't it
[01:47:54.900 --> 01:48:01.220]   Beautiful. Yeah, I actually wanted to be able to get my comic files off of the oh, but look how easily it connects to microsoft
[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:04.340]   Yeah, but I don't use microsoft. You don't understand design
[01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:10.660]   You're picking the week I have two I originally was going to go with one password
[01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:14.420]   But then I saw it in the show notes so I defer we didn't do it. So you should still mention it
[01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:16.260]   Yeah, so one is one password
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:23.380]   Which I've been using for years and their iOS 8 update is great because they've done two things one is they've used the action
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:26.180]   custom action
[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:29.620]   Extensions so that anything that has a share button in it
[01:48:29.620 --> 01:48:33.220]   So if you're on a website you want to fill in a password if you're in an app and you want to fill in a password
[01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:37.300]   As long as it can access a share sheet you can use the one password action to
[01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:40.100]   Enter your master password and quickly fill that in
[01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:46.340]   Yet week passwords are gone last past doesn't do that yet. That's nice
[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:48.100]   It's it's great now
[01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:52.980]   They can't do touch ID at the same time because they can't keep the credentials resident in memory yet in the action extension
[01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:56.740]   But you've been typing in your master password for a long time anyway, so you can probably do it
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:49:01.060]   So if you want to have one that does do touch ID last pass does that but doesn't have sure sheets
[01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:05.060]   So well, you know, it does touch ID. So I want to it's so in the one password app
[01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:08.340]   You can use touch ID to access that now. You know, okay your master password
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:12.580]   It's just that apple doesn't as far my understanding is apple doesn't let you keep stuff in memory
[01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:18.020]   So they can't get your master password authorized with touch ID then store that and let you keep accessing it with touch ID
[01:49:18.020 --> 01:49:20.580]   in the share sheet
[01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:24.740]   So you still have to put in your password every time I get I get it I get it
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:29.860]   Yeah, so but it's still it's still much better than having to go to the app copy your password go back to the
[01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:32.340]   app pasted in
[01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:37.300]   From anywhere you can again anywhere with a share button. You can just use one password to populate
[01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:41.700]   Uh your password and username the one password app itself touch ID now
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:46.740]   You can set it to not ask you for your master password for 30 days if you want and unless you reboot
[01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:50.580]   It won't ask you for it again. Anytime you go there is just touch ID and you're straight in
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:52.820]   super convenient
[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:57.140]   Uh, and I've been using it again on on Mac on iOS on my ipad everywhere
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:50:02.180]   I installed Dropbox and I install one password and I install everything else. It's just super convenient
[01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:04.740]   the other one is um
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:09.620]   storehouse and storehouse is made by marcuana who used to be apples to uh user experience evangelist
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:12.820]   And it was on the ipad for a long time and it's a fabulous ipad app
[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:14.980]   And he's brought it to the iphone too
[01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:19.380]   And he sort of made the same realization that claton morris did with quick read is that
[01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:22.580]   You think that people want a big ipad experience all the time
[01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:25.540]   But sometimes they just want to do things really quickly while they're on the go
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:30.820]   And now with this version of storehouse, uh, you can take a few pictures and within seconds
[01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:34.580]   You can make a visual story and share it and the editor is
[01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:37.460]   Sublime, it's not just good. It's fantastic
[01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:39.940]   It quickly arranged stuff for you automatically
[01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:44.660]   So if you have no time at all, you can just get that story done and post it and be on your way
[01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:49.460]   But if you have time you can edit things you can change the layout you can add text
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:53.140]   Uh, I put a couple sample stories. Um, one of the ones that I did
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:57.700]   For the iphone in there and that took me all of about two minutes
[01:50:57.700 --> 01:51:01.460]   I had the photographs in my camera roll. I added two lines of text
[01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:08.020]   I arranged like I rearranged a couple things and I shared it and uh, this is nice
[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:15.060]   Ridiculous, I know sarah picked it previously on ipad today, but now it's brand new on, uh, the iphone and
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:20.500]   Again, these are like these are d at hundred shots that a friend of mine happened to have in her in her camera roll
[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:24.980]   But you can get photos right off your iphone and especially now with the manual camera controls
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:30.180]   You can do some phenomenal, uh things. I'm gonna put this on here for my trip to london
[01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:32.020]   I think this would be great for travel, right?
[01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:35.860]   It is it's so quick and you can share it to twitter you can share it to facebook
[01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:39.380]   You can go people can go right to the website to see it in that beautiful sort of layout
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:44.420]   And I like I you know, I like writing I love writing I do it for a bit of a living
[01:51:44.420 --> 01:51:49.700]   But I was trained as a designer and an artist and the ability to tell a visual story is just incredibly appealing to me
[01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:57.380]   Storehouse. Yeah, it does video too. So if you want to have your title shot be you know a slow win through the trees or something can do all that
[01:51:57.380 --> 01:51:58.980]   How much is it?
[01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:00.500]   It's free
[01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:02.020]   How can that be?
[01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:08.020]   One password is free now too. I know free mium $10 for the prover. Yeah, I presume storehouse is free mium as well
[01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:12.980]   No storehouse right now. It's free and I think a lot of social apps have to do that just to get a network effect
[01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:18.420]   I don't know that you can launch a social app anymore with any sort of upfront charge. This is like medium for pictures
[01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:22.580]   It's really nice. Yeah, I'm installing it right now in both my phones
[01:52:22.580 --> 01:52:28.420]   Awesome. And the only thing better than looking at it is actually get like it's like finger painting with a visual story the way that the editor works
[01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:30.980]   storehouse
[01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:34.100]   Uh, Alex Lindsey you do. Oh good. I'm glad you're gonna do that
[01:52:34.100 --> 01:52:37.700]   Because I want to do something different and if nobody did it, I was gonna do it
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:42.020]   It's brand new and and it's it's something that uh erin maylor. I don't know if he sends you something
[01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:46.500]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, and so we're talking about taco. Yes taco and it's and
[01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:49.140]   T-a-l-k-o not t-a-c-l-o
[01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:52.420]   How do they get that name? That's all I'm saying. You know, it's hard to get good names
[01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:56.420]   I worry about this so so um, I'm still getting my head around it to be honest with you
[01:52:56.420 --> 01:53:01.140]   So it's it's something that is is brand new and what it really does is let you use your voice
[01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:04.740]   You know in a lot of different ways. So whether you're calling someone you can share
[01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:08.820]   audio connected to a photo you can um, you know, you
[01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:14.180]   Connect to other things to do and allows teams to we're just starting to play with it
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:17.140]   Figuring out, you know today. We've been kind of knocking around on it
[01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:20.340]   So I can't say that I I know it really well yet. We just started playing with it
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:23.540]   Well, it came out last night late last night ray aussie who
[01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:27.300]   Of course created lotus 1 2 3 and then went to microsoft
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:30.260]   And uh, we don't know exactly how he screwed up microsoft
[01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:36.740]   But he did and then left and uh, this is his new thing right with a lot of help for venture capitalists smart programmers
[01:53:36.740 --> 01:53:39.380]   Um, and it's free right now
[01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:43.780]   Um, so should I play errands? So here's the taco interface on my iPhone six plus
[01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:45.380]   Um
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:47.940]   You it'll add uh people from your contact list
[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:51.060]   And it's funny because when I joined last night there were two people on it
[01:53:51.060 --> 01:53:53.780]   Right and now all of a sudden everybody seems to be using it
[01:53:53.780 --> 01:53:56.180]   The idea is you could make phone calls, voice calls, right?
[01:53:56.180 --> 01:54:01.060]   But you can also send uh audio messages kind of like iMessage
[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:03.700]   Um
[01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:06.820]   So this is errands message so I could play it back, but then I could
[01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:13.620]   Is that the erin mauler?
[01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:19.140]   Mailer yeah, erin mailer. I knew erin like 40 years ago. All right. I should say hi to him
[01:54:19.140 --> 01:54:22.980]   So now I can message him back just like iMessage, but I could text him
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:25.540]   I could take a picture and I can make a phone call so yeah
[01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:30.980]   These teams might do this to work together in a kind of fluid multimedia fashion. Is that right? Yes
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:37.380]   So it's it's a good, you know, it is a uh, it's it's a really interesting application that we're experimenting with
[01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:41.460]   It's not something that I've banged on a lot yet because it's only been out since last night
[01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:43.380]   Well, it also overlaps a little with iMessage
[01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:50.180]   It does but I think that I think this takes the what that interaction that process and makes it more fluid than what iMessage is doing
[01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:54.500]   So so I think that's the that's the key there and so or what's app or facebook messenger?
[01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:57.780]   It's all of those things are very simple and very easy to use
[01:54:57.780 --> 01:55:00.660]   I think this is adding a layer of usefulness on top of that
[01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:04.340]   Well, certainly reynos group where I mean he created that the whole
[01:55:06.020 --> 01:55:10.660]   Field basically. Yeah, I have this problem now where every time I try to use the new soundbite stuff
[01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:13.700]   I talk like i'm talking to series so I'll say hey leo comma
[01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:19.620]   Actually sending that as a message. I have to say that's the one thing that may keep me from giving up the iphone
[01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:23.380]   I love sending audio messages in my message by the way
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:26.100]   I call it iMessage because if you just say messages
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:33.540]   Which is its real name? You don't know what message like generic messages capital M messages trademark what message to so I have to call it
[01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:36.660]   I message and I apologize. I know that's not right, but I love sending
[01:55:36.660 --> 01:55:40.820]   And I love the unified in but I mean I think they've done some really good things with messages
[01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:45.060]   You can just raise it to hear it talk and then you can say it back and put it back down and it sends
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:49.300]   But one thing to be careful about uh when you're creating a message apparently
[01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:52.900]   And I haven't had this happen to me, but if you
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:57.940]   What if you just if you press and hold the camera it will take a picture and then send it immediately is that how it works
[01:55:57.940 --> 01:56:02.580]   It's not exactly that's the worst case scenario because we talked about this last week
[01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:06.100]   Everything is based on this instant sticker sending that's so popular with the kids these days
[01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:10.820]   If you if you hold down the camera and then let go it'll send a selfie
[01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:15.620]   If you move your finger back down it will not if you hold the camera and you let go so
[01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:20.820]   It'll take a selfie and then it'll send it instantly. So he's not doing that
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:23.940]   If you touch that yeah take your finger off and then just put it down on the camera button
[01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:30.100]   Yeah, so now oh and now if I let go it'll send it you got us tied up to the camera icon
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:33.300]   Uh, so just like just like messages, but unfortunately
[01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:38.820]   But it's not it's a little people so it would be easy to accidentally like be holding your phone this way
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:42.580]   Take a picture and not realize it and slide your finger up and oh whoops
[01:56:42.580 --> 01:56:50.020]   Yeah, which I you saw how easy that was. Yeah, all right. That's the biggest faces on my message. Yeah. Yeah, well and people tend to do this in bed. So
[01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:53.860]   Hey, uh my
[01:56:53.860 --> 01:56:56.580]   Okay, talk about a weird third party keyboard
[01:56:56.980 --> 01:57:03.700]   Um, we were talking about third party keyboards and of course everybody the kids these days communicates not with text but with animated gifts
[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:09.380]   Riffsy and I thank jeff needles for for doing this during the show. He started sending me animated gifts
[01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:11.620]   I'm saying what are you doing needles?
[01:57:11.620 --> 01:57:18.100]   Well, he's using a special keyboard that is not text is a pure animated gift keyboard
[01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:24.660]   Let me let so I'm talking about cats. Yeah. Well, oh, it's thousands of them. So i'll press the globe
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:29.860]   So that's the apple keyboard press the globe once that's the the swift key keyboard press it again
[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:35.220]   That's another that's the swipe keyboard. I got too many keyboards installed. There's the emoji keyboard
[01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:37.940]   Somewhere in here. I'm gonna get that keyboard
[01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:46.820]   Getting out of hand down you'll get a list of keyboards. Oh, because this is ridiculous. Oh, I had the wrong no wonder I have the wrong phone
[01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:52.900]   There's that's another thing only buy one phone my suggestion to you. Okay, you're day and night phone
[01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:59.140]   I have a special bespoke app on the night phone. All right. Let's do this again. All right now i'm in here
[01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:01.140]   So this is what the keyboard looks like
[01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:02.660]   um
[01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:09.060]   You can pick an emotion like excited and then it will give you a bunch of excited animated
[01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:10.900]   GIFs
[01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:14.660]   And you just say oh look here's uh, I never can remember that guy's name
[01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:18.900]   You can copy it to video copy the gift or you can paste it into
[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:21.860]   A link in or you could just paste it in
[01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:27.220]   Uh into your and so you see now I don't know jeff explained to me because some of these are big
[01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:30.820]   And then some of these are little but you can have an entire animated
[01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:35.300]   Jeff conversation is it jeff for kc list you can finally talk to kc list
[01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:39.140]   I can finally do it jeff. How come some are big and some are little is there a reason?
[01:58:39.140 --> 01:58:42.900]   Because that's what that's how big they are when they found them. Maybe that's they're just not very big
[01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:45.700]   So if I wanted to get the old spice guy, do I just drag it to you?
[01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:49.300]   I just tap it
[01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:51.220]   Uh
[01:58:51.220 --> 01:58:55.300]   Okay, so you can paste the link is tapping the old spice guy for people who are listening
[01:58:55.300 --> 01:59:00.900]   I will paste the old spice guy and I will now send the old spice guy to needles
[01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:05.620]   I don't know about the whole and it's been sent. So there you go. It's free. It's called riffsy

[01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:32.340]   That can't be on the first day turn into something gloriously and heroically stupid god bless all of you

[02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:31.140]   All right, ladies and gentlemen
[02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:38.020]   Thank you very much for joining. What a fun show. Yeah, this is fun. I like it when there's something to talk about on this show
[02:00:38.020 --> 02:00:42.180]   Andy and Ico is uh available at the Chicago Sun times
[02:00:42.740 --> 02:00:44.900]   He is a regular on this show
[02:00:44.900 --> 02:00:49.860]   And we're happy to be so late and he's the instagram filter from his screen
[02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:53.220]   Exactly by by unplugging and pulling something back again. Sorry about that
[02:00:53.220 --> 02:01:00.180]   I also have a new video series that is temporary that I wanted to learn how to do youtube videos and stick to a schedule
[02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:06.180]   So episode 12 got posted today. I'm posting two more and then i'm gonna decide whether i'm gonna continue doing it
[02:01:06.180 --> 02:01:08.180]   But there are at least 12 videos online of me
[02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:13.300]   In a setting much like this and in a series of hotel rooms talking about things that you would figure that I would be talking about
[02:01:13.300 --> 02:01:15.380]   It's good. It's what is the least I could do
[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:16.580]   I call it
[02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:21.700]   I call it the very least that I could do because the original the first episode shows the premise of why i'm doing this experiment
[02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:25.380]   Figuring that I hate doing videos. They're too hard to do. I overthink them
[02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:30.580]   So I figure what if I tell myself I can just do the very very least I can possibly do that would count as a youtube video
[02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:35.860]   And and yet i'm still doing like 10 to 20 minutes and sometimes a 50 minute video
[02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:39.940]   That could be the least i'm having fun. I'm enjoying it. I'm enjoying it 12 episodes
[02:01:39.940 --> 02:01:42.580]   It's youtube.com/andie and aco

[02:02:18.660 --> 02:02:24.500]   Maybe it's semi-recoming your semity. They probably broke it on your semity complicated. It's complicated
