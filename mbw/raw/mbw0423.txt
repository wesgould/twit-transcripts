[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.000]   We'll also talk about that Sapphire Company
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   that's on belly up.

[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.840]   Alex Lindsey is here from the Lindsey Tron.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.680]   What is that called?
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.960]   New.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.320]   The Pixel Core.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.160]   Zip-Ex-a-core.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.800]   Zip-Ex-a-core.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.480]   Your shot is all messed up.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.080]   Let us fix that.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.680]   Because--
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.040]   I moved.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.600]   You moved.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.240]   I had a shoulder.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.360]   There was a shoulder in your shot.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.160]   So I moved--
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.800]   I figured someone was going to tell me to get out of Leo's shot.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.600]   Or fix him out.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.360]   I know I just did a shot.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.680]   Renee Richie is also here from iMore.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.800]   I'm going to talk to you because you got a lot of press.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.920]   I'm reading the London Times.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.400]   All of a sudden, I see iMore's debug podcast reveals--
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.760]   Leo.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.560]   Oh.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.400]   Oh.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.280]   So terrible.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.880]   But thank you.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.800]   We'll talk about it in a second and also let's say hello to--
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.680]   Mr. Crane Cam 3000, the future of what?
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.080]   Crane Cam 3000, the future of video podcasting.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.600]   Oh, it does.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.200]   The problem is you've been out of the country.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.520]   And this phrase is on every lips of everyone
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.560]   in the '14 to '38 demo.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.760]   Nobody in the UK was talking about this.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.760]   I'm shocked.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.320]   Because they're more conservative.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.200]   They don't believe in transgressing
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.560]   across class boundaries.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.400]   We're a lot more free here in America at Leo.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.600]   Yes, we are.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.200]   You have a very lovely London vacation tan, I must say.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.680]   I know.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.440]   It's funny.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.920]   We went to London because it would rain and be gloomy.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.280]   And instead, we had the hottest, driest September
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.760]   in the history of England.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.720]   You're welcome, England.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.880]   Thank you, England.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.000]   You brought the drought with you.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.360]   You're the secret to the kids of the California drought Leo.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.400]   You brought the drought with me.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   And then brought it back because it's like in the '90s.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.760]   You're going to get back.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.120]   So thank you to Sarah Lang for filling in last week.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.080]   I really appreciate that.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.760]   We are back.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.200]   Have either you, Andy Enoco or you, Renee Richie,
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.800]   received an invitation to an Apple event next week?
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.280]   Not yet.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.000]   No.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.720]   I have not yet.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.360]   Time keeps on slipping.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.960]   Slipping into the future.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.560]   Into the future.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.240]   If they're going to do it, it's a week from Thursday.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.000]   You don't have to buy tickets.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.720]   They have to do things.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.040]   They'll have to--
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.920]   I'm just looking at my Apple watch.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.400]   It's Town Hall, so it's a smaller event.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.440]   I know they launched the 5S there last year,
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.840]   but it's possible that this is also their room for--
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.040]   Yeah, it's not big.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.240]   We got the dog.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.120]   We got the pony.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.760]   We don't know if we're going to give you both of them,
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.520]   so who knows?
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.000]   Right.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.400]   We're going to livestream it all because that worked out so well.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.560]   Alex and I were talking about that at dinner last night.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.440]   Theory's about what happened.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.320]   And I need to say that I don't have any--
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.320]   No, I'm excited.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.720]   No one-- everybody that I know that would remotely
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.600]   be connected to it won't talk to me at all.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.080]   Like, as soon as you be there, they
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.480]   don't want to stay in the room.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.600]   No one's talking about it.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   But I think that the whole, like,
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.000]   the little theory that was up online is not probably accurate.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.880]   The problem is that the stream worked on Apple TV,
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.520]   which would make it highly unlikely that a web request was
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.760]   causing issues.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.880]   Much more likely that literally what we saw
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.680]   was probably one of the heaviest hits on a livestream ever.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.920]   And Akama needed a couple seconds to catch up.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.920]   Anyway.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.880]   So it was-- it was Dan-- what's his last name?
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.080]   From the streaming video blog, who hypothesized--
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.120]   and anybody who read this.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.720]   I repeated it, but it seems to me anybody who read this
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.440]   and understands how the internet works, might have said--
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.720]   Yeah, I don't think so.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.040]   He claimed that it was something to do with the way
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.840]   the Apple page-- web page was crafted
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.720]   and that the-- because Apple did something which I really
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.160]   liked, which is their own live blog of the event.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.440]   And the video was embedded on that.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.560]   But I don't think that that means that the video lived
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.360]   on that page.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.400]   It's easy enough to embed a video link.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.400]   And in fact, you made the point, Alex, that because you
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.160]   could watch it on Apple TV, it obviously didn't live on that page.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.520]   Right.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.120]   And there's one comment here that says the World Cup
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.680]   was able to do it.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.200]   The one thing to know about the World Cup
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.600]   is that it was spread over 28.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.600]   I mean, it wasn't one two-hour event.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.600]   Well, not only that, it was spread over many, many networks
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.640]   with their own--
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.560]   and the encoding was centralized.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.880]   But it was a much different setup than what
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.000]   we're talking about here.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.640]   They're actually ready for it for that kind of thing.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.360]   The thing that you told me that I thought was interesting--
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.480]   I don't think I'm going to get you in trouble by repeating this--
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.200]   is that this is the number 8 million.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.840]   Can I say that?
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.320]   8 and 1/2 million.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.080]   You know, that's a Guinness Book of World's Records.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.400]   So I think it's 8-point something or other.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.600]   It's the Stratis Jump is considered the most--
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.280]   That's the guy, the Red Bull guy who jumped.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.840]   Continuous.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.440]   Now, millions and millions of millions of people
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.080]   watch FIFA, but I'm not--
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.320]   It's not individual hits.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.320]   It's the matter.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.760]   It's that--
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.640]   How many people at one time are going boom, boom, boom,
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.920]   boom on the server downloading that video.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.040]   And so the Stratis Jump, 8 and 1/2 million, was a record,
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.480]   and they didn't have a problem.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.480]   Is that right?
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.040]   Were they using Akamai?
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.200]   No, that's the YouTube backend.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.720]   No.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.360]   Oh, well.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.400]   Yeah, that's the YouTube backend.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.200]   That's got to be awesome.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.280]   Akamai, which is a content distribution network,
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.320]   distributes all the iTunes content.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.560]   They distribute a lot of content.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.040]   Like it's not just everybody.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.640]   Like a lot of times you're loading pages
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.920]   and you're getting it from Akamai.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.360]   They're one of the first to do really edge network
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.440]   solutions and so on and so forth.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.960]   The theory there-- and we've talked about this before--
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.520]   is that you'll get a server geographically proximate to you,
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.840]   so it's faster.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.120]   And all the servers cache the content
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.440]   so that they all have the same content.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.240]   But you're getting it, in effect, locally, which
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.800]   saves you time over the internet.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.080]   And plus, you're many, many servers.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.920]   So a lot can handle many, many more hits, that many more.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.680]   I don't know how many points does--
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.320]   I have no idea.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.040]   --points of presence.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.640]   Lots.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.760]   So-- but one could assume that they had more than 8 and 1/2
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.160]   million people trying to watch that Apple video.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.440]   Well, I don't know if one could assume that.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.760]   But what it looked like was a CDN situation.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.320]   So of course, Akamai, I'm sure, is going to--
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.680]   someone's going to call me and never--
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.040]   There are a couple other things too,
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.760]   because they had the Spanish--
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.840]   sorry, the man in overlay.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.840]   There was probably a problem in the mixed truck.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.960]   And because they had--
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.520]   I actually don't think so.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.200]   --it worked at Cafe Max.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.040]   It worked at--
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.960]   Alex has a theory.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.280]   Listen to Alex's theory.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.440]   I think Alex knows more about streaming video
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.280]   than most mortal men.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.080]   So--
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.960]   What some people will do with multi-language events
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.320]   is that they will use the backup stream as the second language.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.840]   It's not something that we do.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.040]   But if you don't do it that way, what you end up with
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.200]   is a lot of encoders.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.800]   So when we-- and that's what we have a lot of encoders.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.720]   And so what happens, though, is if you use the--
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.640]   if you think that you have a really solid network,
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.800]   you may decide that I'm going to go ahead and use the backup.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.080]   So there's an AB for the accounts.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.280]   And I'm just going to say I'm going
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.480]   to use the backup one for Chinese translation.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.520]   For Chinese translation.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.040]   Because I don't want to encourage the expense and complexity
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.640]   of having many, many more servers.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.280]   It's very complicated and difficult.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.840]   And it's--
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.320]   However, if the primary fails--
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.760]   And it pops over what you're going to see
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.320]   is the Chinese Chinese.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.200]   And so the--
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.320]   And what about the truck--
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.360]   Color bars that we were seeing.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.560]   What happens when--
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.160]   I know this is all new.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:35.720]   Specifically--
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.280]   I tell you why I'm getting to this.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.840]   Specifically what happens with Akamai typically
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.240]   is that if it fails, you see the last completed file.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.240]   So--
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.760]   That's that content.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.280]   Yeah, so what happens is that truck--
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.240]   what that really--
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.200]   if you have a problem with your connection or you--
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.240]   and typically it's not that Akamai has failed.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.600]   It's that the connection between you and Akamai has failed.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.920]   It will take that last file and play it back or it can.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.720]   That's one of the options.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.200]   And so-- or has been one of the options.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.120]   I haven't streamed Akamai for a little while.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.480]   Most of our streaming is with YouTube.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.840]   And so anyway, so the--
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.040]   so all of those symptoms, what it looked like,
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.880]   was something went wrong with either the connection
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.480]   to the CDN or the actual CDN.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.760]   And it could have been the connection to the CDN as well
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.840]   that caused it to--
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.800]   first, you saw the last file, then you saw the backup stream,
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.880]   then you saw-- and then it finally
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.960]   found its way back to the--
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.440]   This truck.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.040]   --to the show.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.560]   But the truck-- most likely, everything at the facility
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.000]   was fine.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.960]   So I have talked to people who saw it--
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.000]   that saw it not on the web.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.240]   But at Apple or--
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:42.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.920]   --and it was satellite.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.480]   And it was--
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.000]   It was fine.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.520]   Perfect.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.600]   You know, so there wasn't any wrong--
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.280]   So Dan Rayburn wrote at streamingmediablog.com.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.440]   Inside Apple's live event stream failure, why it happened,
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.800]   it wasn't a capacity issue.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.880]   While we acknowledge that Dan knows a lot about streaming,
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.640]   I don't think he knows anything about website design.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.320]   He claims that JSON on the Apple.com page.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.800]   I think that's pretty clearly wrong.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.360]   And your theory sounds like it makes perfect sense.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.760]   But I have no idea what actually happened.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.960]   I'm just making this stuff up.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.000]   This is probably the most--
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.500]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.000]   --it makes sense.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.800]   It would be the most intense interest,
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.280]   the most viewed video, streaming video, even more
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.880]   than this guy jumping out of a thing.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.120]   The only thing I could think of is
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.480]   is that if, for some reason, the way
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.480]   that they structured the website did not
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.840]   allow it to go to as many servers, you know,
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.720]   like so the way that it had--
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.440]   But it didn't work on Apple TV either, right?
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:27.880]   Right.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.160]   But I'm wondering if there was some way that for some reason
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.360]   that all the servers got-- it reduced the number of servers
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.840]   that were available or whatever.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.960]   CDN, by the way, is a content distribution network.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.880]   There was a question about that.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.680]   So--
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.080]   I defined that earlier just so--
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:39.580]   Sorry.
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.080]   It's an attention to it.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.480]   Anyway, fast.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.240]   But anyway, but the--
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.800]   anyway, so I think that just what those symptoms look like
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.880]   were either a break between the encoder and an acomite
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.440]   or a break--
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.600]   It's a system that you expect, right?
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.840]   Now, it could have been a break between--
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.000]   an acomite's defense.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.480]   It could have been a break.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.960]   The same symptoms were very similar.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.080]   Symptoms would happen if there was a break between the encoder
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.560]   in the backups.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.080]   Like for us, for an event like Apple's,
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.360]   we would have four ways to get to the ingest.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.080]   So we would do-- we'd be on site with one encode.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.600]   We'd have a satellite on another encode.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.960]   We'd have cellular on another encode.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.400]   We'd have fiber back to our DC facilities.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.880]   And all this redundancy, you're only
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.120]   going to primarily use the--
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.840]   Here's one.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.520]   But you've got four of them going so that--
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.000]   OK.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.200]   But in four different ways, because the satellite
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.600]   can go down if there's clouds of rains.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.400]   The cell can go down in the between people.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.800]   We had-- our cell didn't go down,
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.640]   because our cell was great.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.360]   Yeah, we had a great live on the stream.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.560]   Right from that location.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.320]   Right from the event.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:36.800]   Someone asked me--
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.800]   You were crystal clear.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.560]   Someone asked me, did you do the Apple event?
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.800]   I was like, only on the outside.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.760]   And our stream was great.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.720]   But the reason I ask this is because they've
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.160]   got another event coming up Thursday.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.400]   And so what I'm wondering, Andy and Renee and Alex,
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.720]   if you're Apple, what do you do?
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.600]   Do you say--
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.800]   I think you have to stream it.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.840]   Yeah, because if you don't stream it,
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.160]   isn't it an acknowledgment of failure?
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.840]   It's like saying, oh, we can't do this.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.320]   Oh, well, they don't stream town hall, typically, I don't think.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.360]   And I think the last time they said it
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.120]   was because they had trouble with the equipment
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.360]   in the small venue.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.920]   How do you know it's town hall?
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.040]   John Potowski said it was town hall the same time
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.280]   he announced the date.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.120]   And my understanding is the date is correct.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.960]   And he's usually very correct with that information,
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.840]   so I wouldn't put it past it.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.440]   And no Jim Dalrymple nope, which is what we got on the 21st date.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.680]   So Jim would have known for an Apple event.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.960]   Well, I can't remember the last time they did that.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.080]   Yeah, so it's Thursday.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.360]   Why would-- well, I can understand why they do it Tuesday,
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.040]   because then they could say, and you can order it Friday,
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.400]   and it'll be available week from Friday.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.240]   Like, as you're 10 days, does that incline one to believe
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.360]   that whatever they're going to announce
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.520]   will be available day of?
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.720]   If the rumors are correct that we're mostly
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.440]   going to see new iPads and some new refresh--
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.880]   refresh in Macs, that makes sense.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.720]   The rumor is also saying that their manufacturing is already
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.640]   up.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.680]   I don't think they-- I can't remember the last--
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.800]   what they did the last time they announced new iPads,
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.240]   whether they announced and shipped the same day,
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.960]   or whether it was the typical pre-announced pre-order today,
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.160]   and then we'll ship very, very soon.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.000]   But it is an odd thing.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.360]   It doesn't seem like the sort of miraculous--
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.000]   it doesn't seem like the sort of event where
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.440]   miraculous things aren't going to happen.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.280]   It seems like the sort of thing where things that are--
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.480]   what's left in the bottom of Santa's red velvet sack
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.080]   after they've shown the iPhones and the iWatch,
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.360]   it's like, OK, turns out we got an iPad in here.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.400]   Turns out we got some new updated CPUs in here,
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.640]   and that's pretty much it.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.720]   So that-- and possibly rumor mill seems to think--
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.200]   a 12-inch iPad Pro.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.960]   I don't think so.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.160]   No?
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.000]   I heard that for next year, but you never
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.760]   know with Apple in there schedules.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.560]   It's just that if something that major was happening,
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.600]   I would have-- and if it were happening next week,
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.480]   I would have expected--
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.440]   as I'm fond of saying, it's not just
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.160]   do-- leaked out bezels come out.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.240]   It's the velocity and the nature of certain pieces
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:01.880]   of information.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.040]   And I'm used to linking a certain--
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.080]   when my trick knee acts up, that's
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.320]   when I expect bad weather.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.800]   I might trick knee for feeling as though there's
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.200]   a new iPad is not acting up.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:12.760]   So I'm not sure.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.040]   There is a slim chance if it's substantially different,
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.000]   especially for software.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.880]   Like if there's something new that it can do that nothing
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.520]   else could do, they could pre-announce it
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.080]   to give developers a heads up.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.960]   But it seems like this would still be an odd period of time
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.960]   to give to--
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.400]   now it's at now and ship it next year.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.040]   That seems like way too long a time.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.400]   When I was looking at some of these rumors,
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.520]   I was thinking that if Apple is interested in a 12.9-inch iPad,
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.360]   they would have to do it pretty much the same way
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.760]   they did the iWatch, where the only reason we really
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.280]   have a 12.9-inch iPad is to say, well, creative people,
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.680]   we now have something with either--
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.480]   we have a stylus solution for you,
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.560]   whether it's an actual active stylus or a really, really
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.600]   good Bluetooth stylus that only works with this big, big,
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.240]   big pad that has extra hardware in it that will let it work
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.640]   very, very closely.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.400]   Or we have now a solution for running tiled apps,
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.360]   for running multiple apps side by side.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.160]   And we know that there's a lot of nods to that in what
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.560]   was announced in WWDC sessions.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.400]   But that was the sort of thing where they would want to give
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.120]   every developer a chance to make sure that by the time this
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.400]   thing ships, there isn't just one or two free gaps up there.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.600]   There is a collection of apps that really endorse why people
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.560]   should be spending money on this 12.9-inch iPad.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.920]   I think it's a-- at this point, I think it would be an
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.120]   interesting device.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.120]   I might have thought that it was kind of a natural year and a
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.120]   half, two years ago.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.800]   At this point, I'm thinking that Apple wouldn't release it
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.200]   unless they had a really specific role for it to play.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.800]   And I don't think they started telling that story yet.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.560]   Rumor?
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.080]   Also, I think not completely credible is some sort of weird
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.120]   iOS, OS 10 hybrid.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.760]   No.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.760]   OS-- I don't think they're trying to get OS 10 Yosemite out
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.760]   there, do I?
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.760]   They don't have time to make a high.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.360]   I talked to somebody in London who shall remain nameless, who
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.360]   said, Leo, I was sitting with an iPhone 6 three months ago
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.600]   when you announced on MacPrick with you, there's no chance
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.880]   in hell that they're going to announce a five and a half-inch
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.240]   iPhone.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.040]   He says, I'm looking at this and snickering.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.920]   And so I am no longer going to prognosticate.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.560]   I have been wrong.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.400]   I said there'd be no eye watch.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.440]   I'm still right on the Apple TV display.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:17.960]   So far.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.080]   So far.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.520]   One out of three.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.760]   But I know there are people-- this is what I didn't really
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.320]   think about, but obviously it's true.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.600]   There are people who listen, who know.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.800]   And I sound like a complete putz because they know.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.360]   In fact, he said, I thought you were either trolling us
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.400]   or disinformation.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.440]   I thought there's no way he could definitively be saying,
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.880]   oh, they'll never be a five and a half inch iPhone.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.000]   Yeah, that's why you would never say never.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.320]   It's just that you've--
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.240]   Unlikely.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.080]   I'm serious.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.200]   I mean, what Renee is fond of saying
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.300]   is something that I don't have to say because Renee is so
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:53.960]   fond of saying it.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.440]   If you can name any sort of combination of rice, beans,
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.320]   and pork, Apple has made it already.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.320]   And whether or not they've decided
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.480]   that they really want to do a 15-inch touchscreen Mac,
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.280]   or whether they actually want to do a seven and a half-inch
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.840]   iPhone, is immaterial to them actually building it
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.360]   and then waiting for the time is right
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.720]   or waiting for when this makes sense.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.120]   So you never want to say never.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.680]   It's just that I would be--
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.200]   the most accurate thing I can say
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.460]   is that I would be very surprised if a 12.9
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:24.960]   and Jite bed came out next week.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.120]   E. Carter Schinnner in chat room says, oh, and Leo,
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.520]   let's not forget about the Beats thing.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.440]   Thank you for reminding me.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:31.960]   It was harsh.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.240]   I was right on all of these though.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.440]   I'm just saying.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.360]   They shouldn't have bought Beats.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.160]   They shouldn't have made a giant iPhone.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.520]   And the watch--
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.400]   so let me ask you, Renee Richie, who is the Michael report
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.760]   and should we trust it?
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.360]   And I claimed it.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.800]   I'm not familiar with him, but there's nothing in there
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.520]   that's shocking.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.840]   I mean, they have better display technology now.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.920]   They've shown that off the iPhone.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.880]   I should explain.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.560]   Blockbuster exclusive reported, again,
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.280]   re-reported by the boy, Genius Report and others.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.840]   From the Michael report, this is the iPad Air 2.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.520]   And he claims to have pictures, which he didn't publish.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.080]   We've made the editorial decision to not publish the pictures.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.760]   Well, that makes sense.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.240]   OK.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.720]   You never know who has access to the pictures.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.000]   And what the room in the background could tell you.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.360]   So is this--
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.040]   but you think this is credible, everything he's saying here?
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.840]   So all of it is absolutely credible.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.960]   Whether they'll do all of it this year, it's harder to say.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.080]   I mean, they didn't put the best panel technology
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.680]   in the iPads last year.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.400]   There was several things.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.800]   They didn't put the best camera in the iPads last year.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.840]   They could do a much better SRGB standard
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.840]   using all their new display technology in the iPad panel.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.160]   They could put the 8-megapixel iSight camera into it.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.800]   Touch ID seems like an absolute given.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.360]   So all of the-- if I was the one designing the iPad Air 2,
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.160]   this is what I would put into it as a fan of that device.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.360]   You could do this.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.960]   Those two things are really important.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.560]   Touch ID is a natural.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.160]   But also, I admit when I'm wrong,
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.840]   I've always thought that taking pictures with a tablet
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.080]   is the silliest thing in the world.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.280]   But everywhere I go, when I go to the tourist areas of Boston,
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.840]   I see people holding up their iPads and taking pictures.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.400]   So I think I'll be surprised if sometime in the next year,
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.800]   maybe even next week, Apple doesn't decide that, OK,
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.440]   guess what?
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.360]   We're taking the exact same camera that we put in all the iPhones
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.760]   or putting them in every iPad.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.480]   I never understood why they put a hobbled camera in the iPad.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.320]   It didn't make sense to me.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.240]   You've got a great camera.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.360]   It's a good technology.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.760]   I think they put a one-inch chip.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.040]   It's a big guy in the space.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.000]   And then there's--
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.480]   They don't have the space.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.240]   They want to make these things thinner and thinner
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:34.600]   and thinner.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.920]   They are totally living themselves.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.160]   Product marketing opportunity, the iPad selfie stick.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.160]   Just saying.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.160]   I'm still holding.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.160]   I'm still holding.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.200]   I will still hold the line on the selfie stick.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.680]   It's like there are two ways to look ridiculous walking
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.440]   through the public garden.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.280]   One was walking around with your phone on a selfie stick.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.440]   The other one is to get one of those joke shop-like fake dog
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.040]   leashes for the invisible dog.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.760]   At least the second one is funny.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.520]   The first one is just kind of sad.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.360]   So here's what the Michael report.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.640]   Getting a lot of attention today, Michael.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.560]   It says, "Apple will unveil--"
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.600]   Besides the iPad Air 2, which is exactly as everybody thought,
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.840]   "also set to unveil a new lineup of iMacs with an updated
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.720]   retina display."
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.720]   Which I think is highly problematic.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.800]   Can I ask you about that?
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.800]   Because I just bought it.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.400]   That's why.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.160]   I mean, I just bought two.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.680]   So I'm sure that's--
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.240]   What is the current iPad 27-inch iMac?
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.400]   Is it 2660 by 1440?
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.000]   Something like that.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.680]   It's plenty of resolution.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.600]   To me, retina-- correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.240]   Of course, it's a pure marketing term.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:35.960]   There's no such thing.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:40.600]   Apple's definition of retina is, at normal viewing distance
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.760]   for that object, whether it's a phone that's
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.880]   a two feet away or a computer that's arms length away,
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.080]   you can't see a pixel--
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.480]   I can't see a pixel on my iMac.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.840]   It's retina already.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.200]   I'm looking at a Thunderbolt display,
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.920]   and I can see pixels in the fonts and things.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.480]   But again, I'm a-- no, I worked in design for a long time,
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.880]   so I'm sensitive to it.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.080]   But the idea is that you want to take that panel at the least
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.760]   make it 4K because the retina MacBook Pro is not really
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:06.960]   written.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.240]   I didn't double the previous MacBook Pro.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.760]   It kind of went to a middle ground and then down samples it.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.400]   But you could do that with 4K, 5K,
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.200]   or you could really pixel double it,
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.080]   do at 2X on an iMac.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.240]   And that would make an iMac display
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.680]   for photographers, for graphic designers, for artists,
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.960]   for people who just want the latest technology.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.880]   That is as sharp and as clear and as crisp as an iPhone.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.480]   You do want that.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.920]   In fact, Emorex saying that the 27-inch iMac
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.320]   is 109 pixels per inch.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.160]   That's actually low nowadays, isn't it?
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:34.920]   Tiny.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.200]   Just almost unacceptable.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.920]   I remember when 72 pixels per inch was enough for anybody.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.200]   I was watching a documentary about--
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.480]   the Cliffs remember when Cliffs' doll was breaking
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.960]   a Russian cyber espionage ring.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.320]   So the 1990 documentary for Nova is on there.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.920]   And it was so much fun to look at these ASCII display
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.440]   terminals with big, big, big, big dots.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.600]   I don't even have square corners on them.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.720]   But it would be interesting to see what a retina iMac
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.280]   would do to the whole lineup.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.880]   I think that it would certainly be not something
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.800]   that they would have immediate plans to bring to the entire lineup.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.760]   But to put one high-end machine out there,
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.560]   that would be sort of like the Mac Pro of the iMac line.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.840]   Even if they could even call it the iMac Pro.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.360]   Because I don't think that retina makes sense for the majority
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.840]   of people who are buying iMacs out there,
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.080]   or even the majority of users.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.480]   But there are people out there that if you're
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.360]   editing video, you're going to appreciate that.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.600]   If you're editing photos, you're really going to appreciate that.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.160]   And they would pay extra for it.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.400]   I don't remember, Gini.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.800]   I have some experience with, of course, a 4K display running
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.960]   on my Mac Pro with Yosemite.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.240]   And a couple of things I'd note.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.560]   First of all, Thunderbolt needs dual channels to do it.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.520]   One single Thunderbolt channel is not enough to power that display.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.480]   And the way it does it is really funky, which is
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.880]   side-by-side displays.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.760]   And it's easy for me, scrolling the web, to get them out of sync.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.760]   So you get this weird tearing until you get to where you want to be.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.840]   Although on an iMac, it would be hidden, built in.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:11.160]   Right.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.120]   But it'd still be there.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.200]   And the potential.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.320]   And I have to say, I have the Yosemite Gold Master, which arrived
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.840]   while I was in London.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.040]   And thank you, Apple.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.160]   And I just kind of was there on my computer.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.640]   And while it's faster--
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.200]   I mean, actually, the last version 4K was not very usable.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.040]   But it's faster, but it's still a little sluggish.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.560]   And every once in a while, everything--
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.320]   So there's a lot of pixels to push there.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.760]   And that's on a Mac Pro with dual video cards.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.280]   I mean, you wonder if they could put something
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.720]   special inside the iMac, just to conduct that signal for them.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.080]   They might not be bound by Thunderbolt at that point.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.400]   If it's inside the machine.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.440]   I still think they're not a good problem.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.440]   I think they're going to make a mountable iMac with an HDMI
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.440]   in an Apple TV built into it.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.400]   Wait, that would be the best.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:53.640]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.320]   Let me think about this.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.680]   Oh, this is this--
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.120]   Are you trying to make mini?
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.120]   No, no, no.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.640]   If he wants to make you wrong about the TV, too.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.960]   No, no, no, no, the Mac--
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.440]   I know you want a Mac mini.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.640]   If you just put an Apple TV into it and then the HDMI in
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.280]   and then make it mountable, then you'd have a Mac--
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.880]   an iMac that people use in iMac.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.760]   But if they felt like, well--
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.800]   You have to make it bigger.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.280]   I don't want that to be too much.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.640]   That's already a user-installable upgrade.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.560]   If you just got one of these little accessory kits.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.840]   A little let's-ex tape green to come true out.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.400]   All right, Yosemite, we'll probably
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.040]   see 10, 10, 10 on a weekend Thursday, right?
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.880]   Goldmaster went out last week, so it seems like--
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.800]   Based on last year's behavior, this year's behavior
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.720]   should be the same.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.600]   That will bring us a couple of new things--
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.000]   continuity and handoff with a desktop as well as iOS.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.600]   For those of us willing to.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.960]   Which means we'll probably need iOS 8.1 at the same time
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.800]   because that would enable the continuity features.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:52.120]   And along with iOS 8.1, and Apple Pay.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:52.680]   Yep.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.240]   That sounded 20th or something here.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.840]   And all I gotta say is that just a reminder for people
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.080]   who get excited about this as the curmudgeon.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.320]   We gotta get excited about something.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.320]   I know.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.920]   But I love life's in them.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.800]   If 8.0 was any indication.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.760]   When there's a line and you can't see past it,
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.920]   let a couple other people go first.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.440]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:19.800]   Yeah, it might be a golden cup, and it might be a bunch of saws
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.920]   that are tied in the cup.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.360]   You know, as--
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.280]   this is actually one of our stories in our rundown.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.800]   But adoption of iOS 8 has kind of stalled out.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.040]   We're all waiting for the dust to settle.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.360]   And also, there's so many--
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.880]   what I've said before still sticks is--
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.640]   iOS 8 is one of the most important releases
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.840]   that has ever happened for iOS.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.880]   Maybe even the most important release
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.920]   is the very first one.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.280]   But I can't remember another major release that's
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.040]   had so many broad problems because--
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:52.080]   So this is one in which they are finally--
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.560]   there was a picture that popped up on Reddit, a good one,
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.600]   not the enough--
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.680]   not safe work version of Truman.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.600]   When Truman took office, he decided--
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.080]   the White House was about to collapse
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.000]   because it has just--
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.920]   it had been burned down almost once and renovated badly.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.080]   And so there's a picture inside.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.000]   He said, OK, guess what?
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:11.920]   I'm moving across the street.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.880]   We're going to gut out the entire White House
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.120]   and rebuild it from the inside out.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.440]   And that's kind of what iOS 8 has done.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.520]   There's so much infrastructure that's been gutted out
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.600]   and replaced with something much stronger and better.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.280]   But it means that a lot of things are really seriously broken
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.560]   or at least inconveniencing a lot of people.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.120]   Our mutual friend, John Cirqueuse,
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.800]   was tweeting about how he had the wonderful experience
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.760]   where an update to--
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.280]   updating his device for iTunes deleted all of his playlists
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.600]   on that device.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.440]   And then because it was Cloud-synced, I Cloud said, oh,
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.200]   you've deleted all your playlists on this device.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.280]   I bet you wanted on--
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.880]   I would delete it from every Mac and every other device
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.840]   that you own.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.880]   And so he lost every iTunes playlist.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.800]   All this music was still there, but every iTunes playlist
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.440]   went away.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.800]   So that's why I myself have not put iOS 8 on everything yet.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.520]   I suspect that even when Yosemite comes out,
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.520]   I will not put that on the most important Mac
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.320]   for about a month, month and a half.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.160]   Because it's not because Apple is not testing these things.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.280]   It's because I don't think they've ever had to do.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.800]   I don't think they've ever rolled out
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.480]   things that are this important simultaneously
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.120]   cross-platform before.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.160]   And so you're going to have to put the kid in the backyard,
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.560]   let them fall down, and get grass stains,
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.520]   and then figure out where the go for holes are to fill in.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.680]   Wow, what a nice metaphor, Andy.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.200]   I thought I was rape myself when I was saw in my head.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.560]   The only thing I'll add to that is I think also some people
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.520]   after iOS 7, because they were re-springs
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.680]   and they didn't like the redesign,
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.480]   became more hesitant to do updates,
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.000]   because they were like, well, last year changed so much.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.640]   I'm going to wait and see what happens this year.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.640]   Because human behavior seldom changes quickly,
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.520]   but over time, you do get new patterns.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.720]   And just like people learn to wait for Windows updates,
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.480]   I think iOS 7 was such a stark update.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.320]   They've learned to wait for iOS updates now as well.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:00.080]   So last year, this time, almost 70% of iPhone iPad users
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.720]   had adopted iOS 7, 70%.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.840]   This year, 47%, and it's stuck at 47%,
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.400]   it was 47% two weeks ago, and it's still 47%.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.440]   Now, I have to say 8.0.1 probably had something to do with that.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.240]   That was-- Yes.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.760]   That must have scared the pants off people.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.360]   I know, I look at it as like, hey, would you like to upgrade?
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.880]   I'm like, maybe I'll wait just a little longer.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.600]   But Apple's showing some confidence,
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.520]   because late in the month last month,
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.520]   they stopped signing iOS 7.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.120]   So you cannot downgrade after iOS 8 anymore.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.240]   That was the fix for 8.0.1.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.280]   Can't do it anymore, apparently, because they've
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.160]   stopped signing it.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.080]   So that means Apple has full confidence.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.720]   They're from now on, they will know, yeah, these showstoppers.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.040]   Well, and typically what happens is
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.240]   that you have these--
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.640]   Wish I shared their confidence.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.560]   Right, exactly.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.640]   Well, typically what will happen is there'll
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.560]   be some app or some feature that you finally
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.960]   need to upgrade for, and that'll pull you forward.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.920]   I mean, I think that that's what's
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.280]   going to happen to get back to the 70% or whatever.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.440]   Is it our advice?
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.880]   I think it is, that you should wait
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.880]   unless you know you need one of those things.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.360]   Yeah, I don't need it instantly.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.200]   Then always wait and let someone else be the target.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.080]   Yeah, that's--
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:11.580]   Yeah.
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.420]   That's always good news.
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.300]   That's double good news in this case.
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.980]   Even if you decide--
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.220]   it's soon enough, there are going
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.020]   to be apps that you want to upgrade to that will require iOS 8.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.620]   But even that stuff is kind of delayed right now too.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:27.180]   So there's really very little cost to waiting to upgrade.
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.740]   Apple Pay is going to be a good reason to do that.
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.400]   I think so.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.260]   And that's October 20th, you said?
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.740]   If you have it in your area, yeah.
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.860]   If you have it in your area, it's going to roll out.
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.420]   They were banning about the idea that 80% of checkouts
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.500]   will have some form of it available to you.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.260]   But I'm sure that's down the road.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.420]   I think that you're going to have to go to specific stores
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.100]   and have a change to get it right now.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.940]   Although that does raise an interesting question,
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:53.580]   that given that Apple has had a few very public stumbles
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.620]   deploying software and deploying new services
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.260]   over the past month or two, who's
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:00.460]   going to be the first to attach their credit or debit card
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.260]   to Apple Pay?
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.420]   I say, it's not that I don't have faith in it,
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.740]   but it's going to be interesting to see if that
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:10.300]   has an effect on adoption rate, at least early on.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.260]   Well, you kind of already have a credit card attached
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.140]   to your Apple account anyway, right?
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.220]   Yeah, but now you're basically hoping
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.380]   that the person at the--
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.260]   whatever software is running the computers that
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.540]   are connected to your Walgreens or at the bank that
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.300]   is connected to your Walgreens.
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:30.300]   It's so difficult to understand what
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.540]   this chain of transaction is, because by necessity,
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:34.260]   it's complicated.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:39.740]   So how is the-- it's not true that an administrator working
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.780]   behind the counter at your local drug store
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.580]   can screw up this terminal so that Apple Pay is insecure,
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.660]   it doesn't work properly.
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.580]   But a lot of people aren't going to know that.
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.620]   In fact, we know that this is a really secure way to do it,
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.580]   because they're not getting the credit card number.
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.060]   Exactly.
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.460]   And that's the pearl of this.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.940]   But a lot-- I wonder if a lot of people
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.860]   are going to be thinking, oh, well, look at how--
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.260]   they had to do iOS 8, but they had to immediately nuke it
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:06.020]   from the air, because it was so dangerous to new iPhones.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.900]   It's going to be interesting to see how this works.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:08.900]   I also think it's going to be interesting
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.260]   to see if people start making decisions about where they
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:15.460]   shop based on it, because it won't be the first time I go in.
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.740]   But if I go to a coffee shop and it's really easy to pay,
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.540]   that's going to encourage me to go back to that coffee shop.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.020]   And also, if we keep on seeing security breaches with people's--
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.540]   if you have a phone that can do this--
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.300]   Look at this, Jake Morgan Chase.
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.940]   Chase, D-P-O, all these other--
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.340]   And you have all these issues where you start going, well,
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.980]   I really just don't want to do that anymore.
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.380]   If I have a choice between Walmart and another--
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.340]   And that's up to Apple.
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:36.820]   --and go somewhere else.
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.860]   That's up to Apple to really communicate that clearly.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:39.540]   This is safer.
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:40.660]   This is safer.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.980]   My other concern is that the retail person--
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.940]   I'm going to go and say, well, here I am to pay,
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.260]   and they're going to go, what are you doing?
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.540]   Where's your credit card?
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.900]   I feel like they're not going to get it.
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.380]   I'm waiting at me, sir.
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:55.500]   Well, so long as these point of sale terminals are now,
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.420]   they're almost like what you're facing as a consumer is
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.620]   what a McDonald's clerk faces, where
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:03.540]   you're expected to handle all these transactions yourself.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.220]   What kind of card are you going to be using?
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.620]   OK, what mode do you want to use it in?
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.140]   Is it a credit card or a debit card?
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:08.660]   OK, fine.
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.980]   Now, put in the pen and out, you want cash back from this.
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:14.580]   You're asking, so all the clerk is waiting for
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.420]   is for that little clunk of the solenoid
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.980]   for the cash register drawer to open up,
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.900]   or for a beep to confirm that, OK, it's OK to hand me
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.540]   my Diet Dr. Pepper and move forward with it.
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:26.980]   I will say this is one of the things that
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:29.580]   makes it so brilliant for Apple is that, as someone who
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:35.620]   myself, who is facing the idea of, OK, I own my Android phone.
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.620]   I own it free and clear.
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.060]   I'm free to buy a new phone if I want to.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.100]   I'm really intrigued by the iPhone.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:45.060]   The idea of not having to take $100 out of the bank
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.780]   every time I'm about to go out to dinner someplace,
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.700]   because I don't want to hand over my credit card
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.100]   to a strange person who takes it away,
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.380]   that would be enough to make me think maybe I do
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.220]   want to switch to iPhone now.
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.860]   So this is going to be one of the most important launches
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.820]   Apple has ever done, because it's a brand new service
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.300]   they have never done before.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.260]   And if they stumble hard on this one,
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.340]   it's going to take a long time for them to recover.
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.700]   And on the other side of that, of course,
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.940]   if they do really well on this, it gets really hard to catch up.
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.860]   Even Bill Gates said he liked Apple Pay.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.540]   Even Bill Gates is excited about this.
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:22.020]   He said, you know, Apple's not doing it for any altruistic reason.
[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.740]   They're in it for the money, but in fact,
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.740]   this is going to really transform not just the US,
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.860]   but the economy worldwide.
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.100]   This is really good in developing nations where--
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.060]   Where they already do it?
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.100]   I mean, they've got any--
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:35.900]   They've got exactly what they're used to.
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:36.980]   They've been paying with their phones
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:40.620]   in half of the world for the last five years.
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:42.540]   So this is us catching up.
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.020]   And it mean a little easier here than some
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.820]   of the ways they're going in there.
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.340]   Alex, Alex, we're an Apple show.
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.260]   You should know more than anybody else.
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:51.860]   The United States is not catching up.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.220]   We're iterating.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.260]   We should mention that the Michael report does not confirm
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:01.700]   a 12.9-inch Mac iPad Pro, so they're not.
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.380]   So it looks like a week from Thursday.
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.780]   I guess we'll do a special event.
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.340]   10 a.m.
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.420]   We'll just do the same thing we always do right after--
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.940]   We'll do an early tech news tonight, tech news today.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:16.500]   But it looks like if you've got an invitation
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.940]   and I presume you guys will, will you come out for this,
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.300]   Andy and me?
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:20.780]   I don't know.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:24.260]   I have to figure that out.
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.860]   As a matter of fact, I'm traveling again this weekend,
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.980]   OK, for New York Comic Con, but I'm meeting with people
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:30.380]   on there too.
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.980]   Renee has a corporate parent.
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.220]   You do not.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:34.220]   Exactly.
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:35.220]   I will see.
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:36.220]   I'm not-- see these hands?
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:39.420]   They are not shackled by a corporate overlord.
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.500]   But they are wearing a Moto 3.6.
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:42.740]   That's a big offer.
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:43.860]   See, they're still--
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:44.740]   No, no, no.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:46.540]   That's just the electronic bracelet.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.980]   That's part of my probation, so I don't drive anymore.
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.900]   That's all.
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.860]   I've been breathed into this before I can write a bicycle.
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.300]   But yeah, I don't know.
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.460]   Let's get an invitation first, and then I'll think about it.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:02.100]   Usually, if the rumor is true that it is in Cupertino,
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.180]   that's also going to be a factor.
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.780]   I think for some people, not for all people,
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.860]   because it makes it a little bit more difficult to go.
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:09.900]   But we'll figure that out.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.740]   And a smaller venue, it's only about what 350 people into--
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.900]   Oh, it's a really small venue.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.500]   So they mean-- they certainly won't send out
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.500]   all the invitations they sent out last time.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.900]   So new iPads will have a mini.
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.180]   I've had mini.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.860]   When I say the word mini, everybody goes, Macmini?
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:26.380]   No.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.660]   I've had mini.
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:28.380]   No.
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.420]   Don't get your help done.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.080]   Macmini, iPad Air 2, which won't
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.140]   have a number almost certainly.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.140]   It'll just be the new iPad Air.
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:38.140]   Right.
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:42.220]   OS 10 Yosemite, pretty sure, right?
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.140]   I think probably more--
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.220]   Who more about the integration?
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.220]   Yeah.
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.300]   And yeah, continuity and all that.
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.060]   According to the Michael report, the eighth time
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.380]   I mentioned the name today, a whole bunch of updated software,
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:57.620]   iMovie, Final Cut Pro, 10, et cetera.
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.060]   Does that make sense?
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.060]   Yeah, because remember that Yosemite
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.760]   brings to it fundamental changes in how Apple-- right?
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.560]   How an Apple-- a Mac user handles photos and videos.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.800]   So everything's going to have to be updated to deal with it.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.920]   Anybody want to go on the record predicting anything else?
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.560]   Will there be a new Macmini?
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.560]   It's so fast, dude.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.960]   I mean, if they go Haswell, it'll--
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.000]   But I think the Macmini-- if the Macmini was upgraded,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.040]   it wouldn't be part of the announcement.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.040]   It'd be like a press release.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:21.600]   It's too small a deal.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:22.400]   Barely pressable.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.040]   We'd probably just go to the website and just go, whoa.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.320]   You've read the iMacs, but that would also
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.560]   be kind of just an iteration on our--
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.960]   Read an iMacs and a written a MacBook Air.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.180]   If they're ready, we'd probably get at least--
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:35.060]   Plus, a couple minutes of Phil Schiller's time.
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.660]   Yeah.
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.100]   Schill Filler?
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:38.660]   Phil Schiller?
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.360]   Phil Schiller.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.340]   That is a very interesting--
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:43.100]   I never thought of that.
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.660]   Spoonerism.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:45.860]   Are Schill Filler here?
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:46.860]   Is here to fill some time?
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:47.500]   Let me take a break.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.700]   We'll come back with more.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.180]   Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.340]   I want to talk about debug.
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.940]   Kudos to you, a hat tip.
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:57.220]   The London freaking times.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.020]   I'm reading along.
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.240]   I know that guy.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.680]   The London freaking times.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:06.080]   Also, Mr. Andrew and not Co from the Chicago sometimes.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.840]   And equally important times.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.340]   And--
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:10.100]   For the end of times.
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:10.860]   For the end of times.
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:11.700]   The Chicago's--
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:14.560]   And Alex Lindsay from Pixel Core.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.760]   I don't have a times.
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.480]   Times two.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.240]   Crazy times.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.240]   Crazy times.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.160]   Our show today brought to you by a great place to go.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.760]   When you want to learn all about Yosemite, where do you go?
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.680]   Tell me, everybody.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.640]   Linda.com.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.080]   With a why.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.080]   They're already working on it.
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:35.240]   I'm sure they've already got an iOS 8 new features training
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.080]   course.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.880]   I work for iPad Essential Training,
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.280]   Office for iPad Essential Training.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.240]   They do those great Monday productivity pointers,
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:42.920]   which I love.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.040]   LYNDA.com.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:50.480]   It is a great place to get training from the software
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.040]   experts, the leaders in the industry,
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.360]   who are also great teachers, beautifully produced videos.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:38:00.000]   There are literally thousands of them at Linda.com.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.760]   And you can use them, all of them,
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.720]   when you become a member.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.320]   You just pay one low monthly fee.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.760]   I think it's $25 a month.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:12.000]   And you've got access to over 100,000 video tutorials.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.560]   All you can eat.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.480]   It's a buffet of knowledge.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.960]   And they also include things like searchable transcripts.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.880]   So you can jump right to the portion of the video
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.600]   you want playlists.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:26.120]   And now certificates of course completion,
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.440]   which you can publish to your LinkedIn profile and say,
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.640]   yeah, I know that.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.280]   I know Final Cut Proton.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.440]   I'm very good at it.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.120]   For a free trial, all you have to do is visit
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.280]   Linda.com/Macbreak, LYNDA.com/Macbreak.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.320]   So many people have been on this show.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.760]   Teach they've been long, Derek Story.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.520]   I love Bert Monroy.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:50.160]   He does a great free weekly show that you can get there.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:55.360]   LYNDA.com/Macbreak, one week free.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.520]   And then you could decide if you want the regular $25 a month
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.960]   plan or the premium plan, which allows you
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.120]   to download your courses to your iPhone, your iPad,
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.200]   your Android device, and watch them offline in the airplane.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.600]   Premium plan members can also download project files
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.800]   and practice along with the instructor.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.760]   It's a great deal.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.600]   Top five YouTube channel tips.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.560]   This is your account, isn't it, Chad?
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.040]   I could tell this is your account.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.560]   Might be the account that I use.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.120]   It might just be.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.640]   I should log onto my account and show you what I'm learning.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.640]   You could tell a lot about somebody
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.080]   by what courses they're taking.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:32.880]   They have courses like how to negotiate,
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.720]   how to create a resume.
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:40.640]   If I see that on your page, Chad, things like that.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:44.400]   How to distribute a resume without your boss eating.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.680]   Step one, don't log into Linda.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.840]   How to passively, aggressively ask for a raise.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.680]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.240]   That's a good one.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:49.800]   Oh, wait.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.040]   Just show that screen.
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.560]   L-Y-N-D-A.com,
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.480]   Linda.com/MacBreak.
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.880]   There's a whole training course there somewhere.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.280]   I don't really want to go on and on about flaws in iOS A,
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.280]   but there are a few things we should mention.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.320]   I'm sure Steve Gibson, if he didn't talk about it last week,
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.440]   we'll talk about this week, the broken Mac address
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.480]   randomization feature.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.160]   Yeah, apparently.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.040]   I don't know much about it.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:16.880]   It doesn't work.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.720]   We did a ton of research on that.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.520]   Like, R-naut, who just, I think he spent four or five nights
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.520]   just running tests against tests against it.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.760]   And it just seems to not work when your iPhone is awake
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.680]   and looking for things, but when it does sleep,
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.360]   because everyone has so many notifications,
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.240]   it's waking up constantly.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.040]   So it's, yeah.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.720]   There's also issues.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.680]   I don't want to even, I don't even want to go through all of this.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.880]   There's problems with iOS A, private browsing mode.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.880]   Maybe not so private, but it will get better.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:51.240]   The point on that one is you can have a private browsing session,
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.720]   close it, go back to Safari, and lo and behold,
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.200]   all your stuff's still there.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.240]   So what does it mean, private?
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.640]   Well, in iOS 7, it would screenshot that as the,
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.320]   it would screenshot your browser to show you
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.160]   when you came back to the app to make it look like it was
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.000]   restoring fast.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.720]   The server, your private browser window was, it would be,
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.480]   it'll show up immediately when you go back to them.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.320]   That's not so good.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.160]   They're working their way through it.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.000]   It's taken time.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.840]   I think my own thing, whether it's path or secret
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.080]   or private browsing is when you're on the internet,
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.080]   you're in public.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:18.920]   You're in public.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.000]   Just keep that.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.640]   Just don't dance around in your underwear.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.080]   Yeah, just, you know.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:23.880]   Or somebody else's.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:29.200]   No, that's okay.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.360]   We've got a replacement for Katie Cotton.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.000]   It's a Apple veteran Steve Dowling.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:34.840]   I don't know him.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.040]   You guys know him?
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:36.800]   Nice guy.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.320]   I know.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.160]   Friendly.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:41.080]   He did corporate PR for Apple for a long, long time.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.120]   Okay, so he's the logical kind of.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.680]   Apparently he's interim.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.680]   I don't know.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:52.560]   That just means don't get too excited.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:56.800]   Dowling apparently fulfills Tim Cook's desire
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.320]   to put a friendly, more approachable face on Apple PR.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.920]   By the way, this is not applicable to any end user.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.480]   But we care about it because these are the people
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.840]   we deal with.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.680]   I don't deal with them.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.040]   They don't like me, so it doesn't matter to me.
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.800]   He's, look at that friendly, likable face
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.240]   floating above Tim Cook.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.240]   He looks very interesting.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.160]   Put him in a super ellipse.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.440]   I think John Patchkowski just got,
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.280]   took Linda.com course on Photoshop
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:24.480]   because he's been doing a lot of photoshopping lately
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.640]   on his pictures on his posts.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.200]   It's Avatar 2.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.680]   Is Avatar 2?
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.640]   As Twitter Avatar now has full road warrior
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.440]   faint paint on it.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.640]   Yeah, see, I think he just took a course.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.360]   What the hell?
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.240]   That's just weird.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.240]   That's not kiss.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.280]   What is that?
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.680]   Is road warrior Mad Max?
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.520]   I don't know.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.920]   St. Compossy Kabuki?
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.200]   Kabuki?
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:52.320]   Also, is that him in the stiff collar?
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.160]   That's somebody else.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.320]   Doesn't look like him.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.520]   It looks like a 1920 picture of somebody
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.360]   I went to school with.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.200]   I don't know who that is.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.040]   Anyway.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.640]   1920s banker Stephen Colbert.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.000]   (laughing)
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.040]   So I'm reading along the LA Times,
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:09.880]   get to page four.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:13.480]   It says, "Lifestyle at Apple was really tough
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.280]   under Scott Forest Hall or something."
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.120]   You know what?
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.200]   I was going to save it for you.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.640]   I'm sorry I didn't.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.880]   But then it says, according to the Don Melton
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.640]   talking on the debug podcast,
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.960]   you got a lot of coverage, Renee.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.400]   That is, we've talked about the show.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.840]   Of course, it's your weekly show.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.840]   Don has been on a bunch.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.880]   Is he a host or he's just on a lot?
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.040]   No, he's a co-host on the review podcast.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.640]   We talk about 80s movies, which is a lot of fun,
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.000]   but he came on.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.440]   So Don, if people aren't familiar with him,
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.240]   he was former director of internet technologies at Apple.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.200]   So he spearheaded Safari and WebKit
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.640]   and a lot of that kind of stuff.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.200]   And he came on with Nitin Gantatra,
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.560]   who was director of iOS app.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:49.920]   So he was in charge of the mail app
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.080]   and anything that wasn't really web-based
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.480]   on the original iPhone.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.040]   And they just talked about a couple of things,
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.800]   like what it was like to demo for Steve Jobs
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.600]   when the demo went horribly wrong,
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.640]   and what kind of choices they made for gestures
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.680]   versus short proof versus buttons
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.240]   and web versus native and all these different things.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.440]   But at one point, they talked about meetings at Apple.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.000]   And just to be clear,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.600]   they're talking about director level
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.240]   and high management level,
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.560]   and that you had Monday meetings,
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.040]   so you'd prepare for them on Sunday night.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.240]   And their schedule is not,
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.800]   like I don't do anywhere nearly as important work,
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.960]   but their schedule is not too dissimilar from my schedule
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.560]   or anyone at a startup or anyone at a major company.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.600]   But the news reports, there was a blog
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.600]   who put up a thing saying,
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.560]   this sounds absolutely horrible.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.080]   And then I'm convinced that no one else bothered
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.440]   to listen to the show, they just reblog that blog over
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.600]   and over and over and over and over.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.920]   - Right, one of the points that I like,
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.880]   and actually this is from the London Times,
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.880]   but one of the pieces that I haven't listened to yet,
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.920]   I can't wait, debug 47, you must listen.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.560]   The current one actually,
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.400]   was that Don was really upset,
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.880]   everybody was really upset when the Sopranos ended,
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.800]   because they knew that,
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.800]   the 4th stall was a big fan of the Sopranos,
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.920]   so they'd have a free hour every Sunday night
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.000]   that they could visit with their families
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.440]   before they had to go back to startup hell.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.160]   - There's a part two to that show that they've recorded,
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.000]   we haven't put it up yet,
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.880]   but they're really clear that this isn't,
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.160]   they're not complaining about this in any way, shape, or form,
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.440]   and they were kind of offended that people said
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.360]   they were complaining.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.960]   They were incredibly engaged, energetic engineers
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.400]   who were passionate about a project,
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.720]   and they were making an iPhone,
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.640]   I mean they made the iPhone,
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.240]   which was not an insignificant achievement,
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.080]   and I took a lot of effort to get that thing out the door.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.560]   - I asked Philimine yesterday,
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.800]   the CEO of EverNote about this,
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:32.640]   and he said, you know,
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.840]   if you're doing something that's gonna make a difference,
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.000]   that you're really passionate about,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.520]   you're really engaged about,
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.800]   it's more like I wanna get back to it
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.720]   than how can I take a break?
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.800]   You want to do this, you're excited about that,
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:47.360]   this is what, he says it's not always happy,
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.000]   but it's always, you know,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.400]   you're doing something important and satisfying,
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.800]   you dream for this.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.600]   Now admittedly, if you have a family, it's not ideal,
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.920]   but, and I've talked to a lot of other people,
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:02.200]   even Lisa, our CEO, who said, well that's normal.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.400]   - Well there was a line that was funny,
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.160]   I think she didn't be snorled it out,
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.440]   and they said, you know, Melton said,
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.040]   you don't coast through a job at Apple,
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.400]   and they said, oh my God,
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.520]   and he, well, these people do not wanna work at a job
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.360]   that you would coast through.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.680]   - Right, exactly.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:16.920]   - They'd be bored out of their socks.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.440]   - Yeah, look at some jobs where people are doing something
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.360]   very, you know, repetitive,
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.720]   and then I'm just like, you know, there's a--
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:23.880]   - You could, you wanna take it,
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.640]   you wanna work nine to five?
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.960]   - Go to an assembly line.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.120]   - Yeah, I don't think I could work nine to five.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.080]   - And there are people at Apple who work nine to five,
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.920]   I mean, there's a lot of people at Apple who work nine to five,
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.920]   it's not people who are directors of major new products,
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.920]   working nine to five.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.920]   And we heard from some people at Apple who said that,
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.760]   you know, this is true, and this is why they left Apple
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:40.760]   because they didn't like--
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.280]   - Well, there's gotta be burnout.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.680]   - Other people said, you know,
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.240]   this made them wanna go back to Apple,
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.160]   or they were hesitant about working at Apple,
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.160]   but this sounded like a place that they wanted to work at,
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.160]   so people took it really differently.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.920]   - A lot of people, I know who used to work at Apple,
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.840]   think back to it as one of their great best,
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.040]   most the best in the worst times of their lives.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:00.920]   Challenging difficulty was very difficult,
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.680]   but they also know that they made a huge difference,
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.680]   they were doing something important,
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.840]   and they really cherished that time.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.760]   But as you get older, I think you want, you know,
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.280]   - Like a gun-made web kid in Safari, you know,
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.520]   we're complaining about him using the technology he helped
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.520]   create.
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.800]   - Yeah, right.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:21.360]   Hey, I wanna talk about Sapphire in just a bit,
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.360]   but right now we're gonna talk a little bit about Squarespace,
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.000]   which is the Sapphire of websites.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.560]   - Yes. - Bulletproof.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.160]   - Cannot be taken down.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.160]   - It bends. - It bends without breaking.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:37.600]   Squarespace is the best web hosting you've ever experienced,
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.840]   and if you're on a web host now,
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:41.120]   and you're not completely 100% happy,
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.400]   I got an invitation for you.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.760]   This had no cost, no obligation,
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.520]   you don't have to tell your other web host
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.240]   that you're shopping them around.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.160]   Just go to squarespace.com and click the Get Started button.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.920]   You'll have all the 25 beautiful templates
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.440]   at your disposable, really spend some time rocking it.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.720]   You know, put some e-commerce in,
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.600]   take a look at the responsive design.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:04.000]   They have importers for content for most of the other web APIs,
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.560]   so you can actually take your whole site
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.680]   and just put it in there and see what it looks like.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.200]   And the beauty part of this, I love it,
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.120]   is you put your content in there and you say,
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:15.400]   "Well, I wanna change how this looks."
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.000]   And your content doesn't have to be re-imported or anything.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.840]   It's just the content and the design are completely separate.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:22.720]   You can't bring a Squarespace site down.
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.640]   They are super, super good.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.160]   Best hosting plus the best software,
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.640]   making an amazing experience.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.360]   Not just for you, but for your viewers, your users,
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.120]   your readers, then, and that's what really matters, isn't it?
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.360]   If you're a photographer, you'll love their portfolio app
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:41.160]   that pulls the photos from your site onto the iPad or iPhone
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.040]   so that you can show them to a client.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.120]   If you're selling online, you've got a business,
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.680]   their e-commerce is second to none
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.680]   with all the features you want,
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:51.800]   including shipping calculator and merchant accounts
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.120]   and all the stuff that just make it very simple for you.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:58.360]   Incredibly easy to use, but if you have a question
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:01.440]   or you need some help, they have 24/7 support
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.680]   right from their own offices.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.600]   They don't outsource their support.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.400]   A completely redesigned customer help site,
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.400]   which makes it easier to get the self-help articles
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.960]   and video workshops you want.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:14.280]   They do webinars and all of this starts at $8 a month,
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:18.120]   including a free domain name when you sign up for a year.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:22.520]   Squarespace.com, you don't need a credit card
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.560]   to do the two-week trial.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.560]   All you have to do is push the button that says,
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.960]   "Get started, no salesman will call.
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.480]   "No debit card will be debited."
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.640]   When you do sign up though,
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.280]   make sure you use our offer code MAC break,
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.480]   that way you'll get 10% off your new site.
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:43.480]   10% off when you use the offer code MACbreak@squarespace.com.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.840]   Thank you for supporting.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.360]   Not just MAC break weekly,
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.680]   that's one of the sponsors that have been with Twitch
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.440]   for almost the beginning.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.440]   - It's just one of the things I think is interesting,
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.800]   even people in our company that,
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:58.040]   you know, just call in for customer support.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:58.880]   - So great.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.720]   - It's just like that.
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.480]   And it's not because they know that we talk about it
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.160]   or whatever, it's just that's the way they manage.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:03.960]   - Yeah, that's great.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:08.480]   So the Sapphire factory has gone belly up.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.080]   Actually, I guess they're gonna stay in business,
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:15.080]   but they have gone, is it chapter seven or chapter 11?
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.600]   They're going for a reorganization.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.280]   Even though they have hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:22.640]   in the bank, and some people are blaming Apple.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:26.000]   This is GT Advanced, a company that at first we thought Apple,
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.800]   didn't we think that Apple owned these guys?
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.560]   We knew that they had invested in them
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.920]   because they wanted Sapphire.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:34.280]   We thought for the iPhones, turned out too expensive
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.360]   to put Sapphire in and find a face of the iPhone.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.240]   - From the report, it looks like what Apple did was bought,
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:40.920]   a building and leased it back to them.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.440]   - So complicated.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:47.280]   In late 2013, Apple signed a $578 million deal
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:50.240]   with GT Advanced Technologies to produce Sapphire.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:56.160]   But abruptly this week, they said,
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:00.320]   we're filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:04.440]   GT said they have approximately $85 million of cash,
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.920]   but they're seeking new financing
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.280]   so that they can satisfy the obligations.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.560]   In other words, creditors associated with the--
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.920]   - It was trying to get the tuition.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.440]   - Yeah, it's kind of a, it's a,
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.160]   I thought seven was a reorganization, I don't know.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.220]   Chapter 11 is a reorganization, right?
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:25.420]   - I thought it is bankruptcy, it is the big B word.
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.300]   - Yeah, I mean, so the hard part,
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:29.100]   we're taking, I have a little experience in this,
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:30.500]   I won't get to know why.
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.820]   But the hard part working with a large company
[00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:34.500]   that's growing, that's going down,
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:36.340]   innovative directions and so on and so forth
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:37.180]   is keeping up with them.
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.620]   If you don't go fast enough, they'll go find somebody else.
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:42.380]   And if you overshoot them, you suddenly end up spending
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.620]   a whole bunch of money into nothing.
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:45.540]   - That's what it sounds like happened is that Apple,
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:49.420]   or that Apple, that they thought Apple was gonna order,
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:52.500]   you know, 20 million sapphire screens for their phones
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:53.820]   and then Apple didn't.
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:54.660]   - Or it didn't work.
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:56.980]   So the problem is that that technology isn't working yet
[00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:57.820]   and someone's having rumors.
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:51:58.660]   - And that was half rumors, right?
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:00.020]   - The rumor was they couldn't do it or was too,
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:01.220]   there were two rumors, it was too expensive
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:02.780]   or it didn't work.
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:06.020]   - Whatever that is, the issue you get into is that the--
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:09.220]   - Seven is liquidation, 11 is re-work, thank you, Chad.
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:14.220]   - So, but I think that most likely what happened here
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.140]   is that they're in the right place,
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.460]   almost in the right place at the right time,
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.340]   but they had to invest really heavily
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:20.980]   to try to, 'cause you've gotta be ready
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:24.660]   to serve four million phones a day or whatever that is.
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:26.060]   And that's an incredible number,
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.340]   like I can't even imagine having to build up
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.260]   the capacity for that.
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:30.980]   So if that doesn't end up being the case
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:32.860]   and now we're just gonna move you to watches,
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:36.660]   that's a huge change in your income process.
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:38.260]   So I think that they're probably fine,
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:39.260]   I think that they just need to,
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:40.980]   what they can't do is make the payments.
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:42.660]   And they're probably thinking this out,
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:43.980]   where if we keep on making the payments,
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:45.980]   we'll have to close down the company in three months
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:47.820]   and there's no way we're gonna get that revenue.
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:50.140]   I think from a business perspective,
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:50.980]   it probably makes sense.
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:52.380]   - There may be a larger issue here.
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.660]   Apparently, according to the Wall Street Journal,
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:59.660]   the CEO of GT Advanced Technologies sold $160,000 worth
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:03.780]   of its stock the day before the iPhone was announced.
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:04.620]   - How would you?
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:05.740]   - Yeah, that seems like,
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:08.000]   (laughing)
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.500]   and there's the stock price.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.580]   - Well, it's 'cause everyone was expecting
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:14.860]   to see Sapphire in the phone and so he knew that--
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:17.460]   - Yeah, but you know, that's, boy, you don't do that.
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:22.140]   I think that the SEC is frowns upon that kind of information.
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:25.420]   - Cheers had doubled, thanks.
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:27.700]   - And that's why a lot of CEOs for a lot of these companies
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:29.660]   have scheduled sell-offs,
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:32.100]   where they're selling a certain number of stock,
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:33.220]   literally every day.
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:35.380]   They're selling a certain number all the time
[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.620]   rather than ever creating these spikes.
[00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:38.460]   - Yeah.
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:41.020]   Well, there you go.
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.780]   Don't know what's going on there.
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:44.860]   There is Sapphire, Apple said.
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:46.900]   There is Sapphire in at least one of the three models
[00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:47.980]   of IWatch.
[00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:48.900]   - I think the top two edition.
[00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:51.820]   - The top two edition and sport.
[00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:54.340]   - Well, I don't know how I'm-- - Sports the cheap one.
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:56.700]   - Yeah, the regular and the edition has regular.
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:57.940]   Is that what they call it, the regular?
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:59.020]   - No, it's just Apple Watch.
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:53:59.860]   - Just Apple Watch.
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.700]   - Handy adjective to hang off the end of it.
[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:05.160]   - Sport, watch edition.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:08.100]   Okay.
[00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:10.020]   - In addition, it's just the gold one, right?
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:10.860]   - Yeah, the gold one.
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:13.020]   - It's everything the same except that it's gold.
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:15.740]   The Yachting Edition, let's say.
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:16.580]   - Yeah, no.
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:21.820]   - Speaking of gold, gold may be on the new iPad.
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:25.820]   That's when you know you kind of,
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.940]   you kind of, you're shading the thing
[00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:29.500]   because it's like, it's fins.
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.260]   - I admit the gold, the gold iPhones
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:33.620]   have looked kind of nice in the gold.
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:35.660]   - I tried to originally thought it was too much gold,
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:38.180]   but then they've done the iPhone 6 Plus now in gold
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.340]   and then the leap to the iPad mini is not so big,
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.900]   but then if you do the mini, why aren't you doing the air?
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:46.460]   - So now to add to Bendgate, we have Hairgate.
[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:47.300]   - Oh no.
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:50.980]   - I feel like people are just, this is really whiny.
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:51.820]   - Yeah.
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:54.060]   - People are, so Bendgate, as you know,
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:59.060]   or Bendgazee, who called it Bendgazee, I love that.
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:00.620]   - I think it was, you like hold it up.
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:02.860]   - We're very much doubling down here aren't we?
[00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:04.380]   (laughing)
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:06.780]   - Bendgazee was that the iPhone's bendable,
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:09.660]   well, duh, any metal phones bendable,
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:11.460]   in fact the M8 is according to consumer reports,
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:13.460]   even more bendable, but that's so people,
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:16.380]   and I feel bad for Apple now because weenies
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:19.100]   are going to the Apple Store, bending the phone.
[00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:20.460]   - Physics is bad.
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:21.300]   - Ugh.
[00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:23.260]   (grunting)
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:24.740]   I bet it.
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:27.980]   Well now the newest one is, people are bitching,
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:29.580]   probably Kim Kardashian, I don't know.
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:32.700]   People are bitching that their hair is getting caught
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.220]   in the cracks of the iPhone 6 Plus.
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:37.500]   - Christina Warren had a great video up about this.
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.420]   She did exhaustive testing on fear.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:40.260]   - She's got long hair?
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:41.100]   - What did she do?
[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:41.940]   Move it through her hair?
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:43.980]   Like, she got the whole Mashable staff
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:45.260]   to move it through there, assorted.
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:47.940]   - And did she find any, any catch?
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:49.220]   - Did anyone get lice?
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:50.740]   - I mean, no.
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:52.900]   - They're clean.
[00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:53.980]   She made a video that said,
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:56.100]   "Hairgate is not a thing."
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:56:00.740]   In three seconds after the ad concludes,
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:03.020]   I'm sorry, I didn't conclude, but I'm going to skip it.
[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:06.180]   We will see Christina Warren running an iPhone through her hair.
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:09.100]   You don't hear anything?
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:10.980]   That's 'cause I have these sound muted.
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:14.820]   Let's turn it way up.
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:18.980]   - I mean, I'm not getting any.
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:20.900]   (laughing)
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.060]   - He's rubbing on his beard.
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:23.140]   I think it has to be longer.
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:26.220]   - So apparently when you're talking on your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus,
[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:27.940]   what's happening is the hair is getting trapped
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:29.260]   between the screen and the screen.
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:32.220]   - Who are the people who are complaining about this?
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:34.140]   You gotta feel like Apple is a target
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:35.220]   for some people.
[00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:38.220]   - Yeah, that's gotta be good news for somebody inside Apple
[00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:40.420]   to realize that, okay, it looks like they're finally running
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:41.780]   out of things to complain about.
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:43.060]   (laughing)
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:43.900]   - Hairgate.
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:47.700]   - Don't come here here with your phone, okay?
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.860]   - That looks like how you trick a suspect
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.340]   into giving you DNA evidence.
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:54.180]   (laughing)
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:56.180]   Hey, there's a funny trick you can do with your iPhone.
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:59.460]   Here, I'll lend you mine out of this plastic baggie.
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:01.020]   - Short hair, your hair, my hair.
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.340]   - There's plenty, if you want a bitch about the iPhone,
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.460]   there's plenty to complain about.
[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:07.740]   You don't need to make up bending and hairs.
[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:10.580]   - What about Gapgate Leo, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4?
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:12.620]   You can put a business, it's a business card holder.
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:14.300]   You can put it down on your desk and slip a card.
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:17.300]   - And Samsung said, no, that's normal.
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:20.100]   - Yeah, making a partnership with Square any day now.
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.780]   - Yeah, we want him to do that.
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:27.740]   You know, if you wanna complain about the iPhone,
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:30.140]   look at iOS 8, there's bugs you can complain about,
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:31.500]   there's things that don't work,
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:33.740]   there are some legitimate complaints,
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:35.540]   but I think your hair gets stuck in it.
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:37.260]   - I think the biggest problem with this Xplos
[00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:39.020]   is mostly that you look just silly
[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:40.020]   when you put it up against your face.
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:41.300]   - That doesn't bother me, you really think so.
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:42.420]   - See, people do it and I go, oh,
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:43.540]   well, I don't really do that very often.
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:44.820]   I mean, I almost never--
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:45.660]   - I need your piece.
[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:46.500]   - I have an earpiece.
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:47.620]   - Who makes phone calls anymore?
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:48.460]   - I know.
[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:49.700]   - Every time I say that, one guy in the chair
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:51.140]   and says, well, I do.
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:53.260]   But it's not, I mean, it's not a phone.
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:54.580]   Let's face it, it's a computer.
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:57.380]   - But how many people would be freaked out if I,
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:00.260]   if I hand, when they're in their actual office,
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:02.460]   they actually have to use their network desk phone.
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:04.660]   That's pretty much bigger than an iPhone 6 Plus,
[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:05.500]   is it not?
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:06.740]   - No problem holding up to their faces.
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:07.820]   - Try bending that.
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:08.940]   - But it's a big screen.
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:10.540]   It's a big screen up against your face.
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:11.740]   It's weird.
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:13.860]   - It's a big card phone that plays movies.
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:14.700]   Don't complain.
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:17.100]   - Yeah, I, you know, I, I, I,
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:18.580]   this was the thing when the note,
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:21.700]   the Galaxy Note first came out years ago.
[00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:24.740]   Was it, you're holding a candy bar, whatever.
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:25.940]   - And then we just got used to it.
[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:27.300]   It's just like iPad photos.
[00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:28.300]   We just got used to it.
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.660]   - Well, Samsung takes that one on a table.
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:30.860]   - You can see, yes, that first year.
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:32.380]   And nobody could believe how big they are.
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:34.140]   And now you look at them and the iPhone,
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.620]   it looks like a toy and that looks perfectly normal.
[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:38.420]   - I'll tell you what I do feel like.
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:42.460]   The iPhone 6 Plus real estate is mostly wasted
[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:44.460]   because most apps have not yet been updated.
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:48.260]   So all you're really getting is just a blown up picture.
[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:49.340]   Especially the big companies,
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:50.420]   like a lot of indies have updated,
[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:52.300]   but most of the big companies haven't yet, which is.
[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:54.620]   - Yeah, Google just updated Gmail.
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:56.100]   - Right.
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:57.820]   - And I, let me launch it 'cause I haven't actually,
[00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:59.980]   oh yeah, ooh, look how crisp that is.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.540]   It was looking a little soft focus
[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:04.820]   because it was just being blown up.
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:07.100]   But now it takes advantage of the high res.
[00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:08.380]   - I found something really interesting
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:10.100]   'cause I installed new iPhones as new.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.180]   I don't restore from backup
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:13.340]   and I haven't yet had to install a single Google app,
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:14.700]   which really surprised me.
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:16.500]   - You thought you needed the Google?
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:18.740]   - I thought I did because what Google Maps recently
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:21.860]   made a change where they no longer announced the exit number,
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:22.940]   just the names of the rows.
[00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:23.780]   And they're getting the name,
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:25.100]   Montreal roads are really complicated.
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:26.260]   There's some French, there's some English,
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:28.300]   there's like nine different roads every time.
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:29.620]   And they're getting them wrong.
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:31.700]   So I had no ability to use Google Maps anymore.
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:35.860]   And then Gmail over exchange was great.
[00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:37.700]   The YouTube website is no less annoying
[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:39.260]   than the YouTube app.
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:41.500]   And I just haven't, I'm sure I will at some point,
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:42.660]   but I haven't had to yet.
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:45.460]   - You're not a Google Plus user, obviously.
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:46.940]   - I use Google Plus on the desktop.
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:48.500]   I use Google Hangouts on the desktop.
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:50.500]   I just haven't needed to use them on my phone.
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:51.900]   - Reason I installed it on the phone right away
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:54.060]   is 'cause I want the photo backup.
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:55.620]   I love the auto-wastoms and all that stuff.
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:56.740]   - I don't mind Google Drive,
[00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:58.100]   but I don't like the idea of putting my photos
[00:59:58.100 --> 00:59:59.220]   on Facebook or Google Plus.
[00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:02.900]   - I prefer the actual file systems to the social networks.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.060]   - I like both.
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:06.020]   - That's just 'cause you're a very old fashioned.
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.580]   - When I just like, I mean, as I said,
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.780]   - I put my photos there not 'cause I'm posting 'em
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:13.660]   on Google Plus just 'cause I like what they do with them.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:14.820]   It's an archive.
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.020]   - Yeah.
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:16.860]   - I dropped that.
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:18.540]   - That is nice, but I just,
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:22.820]   of the many reasons why the new Flickr app is just sad.
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.420]   I can't think of another service
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.900]   that has such a completely inverse relationship
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.620]   between how good the services and how bad
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.500]   like the mobile apps are.
[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:35.460]   And I was trying out a brand new phone in Chicago
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.060]   and downloaded the Flickr app.
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.860]   And of course it defaulted to upload everything that you,
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:42.020]   everything that you do to the server.
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:43.100]   And so to this day,
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:44.500]   'cause I haven't bothered to weed it out yet,
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.460]   there's a series of 12 photos of the inside
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.260]   of my hotel room just because I was holding down
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:51.380]   the shutter button to see how fast it takes pictures.
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:52.860]   And that's the only way that I found out that,
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:54.820]   oh, it's actually putting everything on Flickr.
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:56.260]   Not publicly, of course, privately,
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:58.060]   but even so, the fact that you,
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:01.180]   without my willful intent,
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:03.140]   I have placed photos in the cloud.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:04.420]   And the fact that it's just a shots
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:06.180]   of a messy hotel room desk,
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:08.460]   it doesn't minimize how offended I am
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:09.620]   that that's where I think it happened.
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:11.100]   - Yeah.
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:13.860]   See, I hear, so here's the trip to London.
[01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:15.420]   These are pictures that were taken
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.580]   not just on the iPhone,
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:19.260]   but on I took a Moto X with me
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:21.100]   as well on Google made a little photo album
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:22.180]   that I didn't even need to do.
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:23.140]   - Well, and I think the part of,
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:24.660]   because I have different phones,
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.300]   what I like about the Google Plus system,
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:29.820]   the photos is that whether I'm taking it
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.500]   with an Android phone or my iPhone,
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.020]   I can, everything just ends up in the same place.
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:35.580]   - So, did you, are these screenshots chat?
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:36.980]   Is that how you do this?
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.180]   Thank you, Chad.
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:39.700]   So this is the iPhone 6 Plus.
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.060]   I didn't know you got a 6 Plus chat.
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.500]   I can't see, zoom in a little bit.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.340]   Can you see?
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:45.260]   It's a little, I'm trying to change this.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:46.100]   - Yeah, my brightness.
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.260]   - It's turned down the brightness.
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.180]   It's awfully bright.
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.020]   You must, yeah.
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:49.860]   There you go.
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:50.700]   There we go.
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:51.660]   - Get down.
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:54.180]   So this is the, this is the Gmail app.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.780]   - It's the email before the update.
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:56.620]   - It's the update when it came out.
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:57.580]   And you see, it's just blown up.
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:59.780]   And you can, even there's some softness in the text.
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:03.180]   It's like, ooh, crisp, so much text.
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:04.020]   - So much text.
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:04.860]   - So much text.
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:05.700]   - And then does it do the,
[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:06.540]   - Well, that's just a screenshot.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:07.380]   - Oh, this is a screenshot.
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.220]   So does it do it.
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:09.740]   But it would do the horizontal thing.
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.220]   - Yes.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.740]   - I love that multi-pane view on the landscape
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:14.700]   on the iPhone 6 Plus.
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:15.540]   - Yeah.
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.220]   - So, like having a tiny iPad.
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:18.500]   - But I think you make a good point, Renee,
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.020]   that you don't, there isn't, for an iPhone user,
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:22.180]   a lot of strong reason.
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:24.220]   And that's what Apple wants, obviously.
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:26.300]   We used Apple Maps in London.
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:29.700]   And I did not have Google Maps on my iPhone.
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.220]   And it worked great.
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:32.220]   - If you know the place,
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.180]   the exact place you're going to,
[01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.180]   Apple Maps is really good.
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:37.260]   Their sloppy search is still nowhere nearly as good as Google.
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.820]   It's like they'll either take you to the wrong continent,
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:42.020]   or they won't recognize the place that,
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:42.860]   well, you'll type in a name.
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:44.180]   And instead of finding the one closest to you,
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.620]   it'll just go to some random Google Maps as well.
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:47.540]   - Everybody does that.
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:48.620]   - Okay.
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:50.540]   - No, I do not want to go to Italy today.
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:51.380]   I'm drunk.
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:52.740]   I don't want to go to Italy, but I'm not.
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:54.220]   And that's why I don't want to know about it.
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:55.540]   - I don't want to know about it.
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.820]   - The panorama stuff on the iPhone is specterically.
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:01.260]   Well, here's pictures from the iTunes Festival.
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.700]   In fact, I took one for you, Alex,
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:05.500]   which Google Auto Awesome, so it's completely useless.
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:09.420]   Of the setup here, this is the sound board,
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.260]   the mixing board, the jib.
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:13.660]   They had a slider, you know, one of those rail cameras?
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.340]   But they had a video camera on a slider
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:16.700]   that would just go across.
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:18.860]   I can't wait to go home and watch.
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.820]   This was the last day of the iTunes Festival.
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:23.260]   I can watch the broadcast again.
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.700]   But they really did a nice job.
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:27.220]   That was, and they had no problems with the stream.
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.020]   No problems with the stream at all.
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:32.300]   So no, I think the pictures that I took with the iPhone
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:33.980]   were absolutely the most satisfying.
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:38.220]   In some ways, competing with the pictures that I took
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:42.620]   with a fancy camera, the panoramas, let me go, let me go.
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:43.540]   Oh, there's Henry VIII.
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:44.620]   He showed up at Hampton.
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:45.980]   That was so exciting.
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:46.820]   He showed up.
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.140]   - And you walk up to his camera.
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:49.460]   - Ambolin was there.
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.740]   Cardinal, what's his name?
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:51.580]   Was he, it was great.
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:52.420]   It was so exciting.
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:53.860]   They're playing drafts.
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:55.940]   Cardinal got bored.
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.860]   Cardinal Wolsey got bored and he wandered off.
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:59.260]   - Wow, even the,
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:01.420]   the Finisley football goes everywhere, doesn't it?
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:02.620]   (laughing)
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.100]   - Not the football draft.
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:07.380]   - I'm sorry to say that I keep meaning to finish up
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:09.340]   the iPhone reviews.
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.940]   It's just that they keep getting more and more in depth.
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:15.820]   And so I think I'm ready to go back up to the surface now
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:17.340]   where there's air and light.
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:21.300]   But yeah, I'm so terribly impressed with the quality of photos
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.220]   that the iPhone 6 and the 6 Plus are taking.
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.620]   They're still not the,
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:28.740]   they still can't take the place of a quote, real camera unquote,
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.780]   because there's still camera phones.
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:34.340]   But the ability to not only take good pictures out of the box,
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:36.900]   but I can't, I can't think of another phone
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.260]   that I've ever tried where there was a,
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.460]   there's so much data and there's so much latitude
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:43.700]   inside that JPEG where if you want to change the exposure
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:45.020]   or the color or anything like that,
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:48.020]   just like pushing sliders around in an iPhone
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:50.660]   or whatever is gonna be replacing it in a couple of weeks
[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.020]   and make the photo that you want.
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:54.740]   I make it look like you didn't change a darn thing.
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:55.820]   Terribly terribly impressed.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.580]   So much so that one of the things that last night
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:01.140]   I spent some time updating my 60 photo gallery
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.900]   that I'm gonna be posting to Flickr and saying,
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.500]   you know what, I've never done this before,
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.180]   but I'm going to post the originals,
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:07.860]   but then I'm also gonna have a side gallery
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.620]   that here is what I would normally do,
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:11.220]   even with my really nice Olympus camera.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.020]   I would not just simply upload JPEGs.
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:15.620]   I would spend at least 30 seconds on each one,
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:16.740]   no more than a minute just saying,
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:17.900]   I wish that were a little bit sharper,
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:19.420]   wish that color a little bit more intense.
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:23.300]   I want the shadows to be a little bit less intense over here
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:24.540]   because you're right.
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:29.300]   When you mix in photos from the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.700]   with your regular library,
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:33.220]   it becomes really hard sometimes to tell the difference
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.380]   between the ones you shot with your darn phone
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:36.460]   and the ones that you shot with,
[01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:38.020]   you're really, really nice,
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:41.140]   almost as expensive as a decent used car camera.
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:44.660]   Yeah, I used, I brought my Sony A7S,
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:46.300]   which was a,
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:47.820]   well that's lovely, wonderful.
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:49.140]   So this, yeah, the couch.
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:50.740]   - I know, it's like it's from London.
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:52.940]   - It's a, it's in the sky.
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:57.260]   - I brought the Sony A7S and it has a Panos setting.
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:58.300]   So I shot a Pano with,
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.700]   this is from the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral.
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.100]   And then I shot the same Pano with my phone
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.020]   and I think in some ways the phone is even better.
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.540]   Look how much detail as I zoom in.
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:10.020]   - That's a remarkable.
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:12.540]   - You put your finger on something that is unique
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:13.380]   to the iPhone.
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:16.580]   I have never seen another phone that is even competent
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:21.140]   at doing panoramas and yet the iPhone is almost always
[01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:23.300]   just playing perfect right out of the camera.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.580]   - That means, one of the big things they do
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:26.420]   that's different.
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:28.140]   - And this, by the way, you shoot this in a second.
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:30.900]   I mean, you push the panorama and you go zzzzzzzzz
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:31.740]   and you're done.
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:32.980]   - And one of the things they do really well
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.100]   is they're doing pixel by pixel, you know,
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:37.380]   analyzation to figure out which pixels to use,
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:39.100]   almost all the other phones what they're doing
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:40.180]   is they're taking a bunch of photos
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:41.020]   and they're blending them.
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:41.860]   - Right.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:42.980]   - And that's why you get all these little blends
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:45.100]   and everything else but the iPhone is sitting there going,
[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:47.780]   I'm gonna, at every moment I'm gonna make a decision,
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.020]   you know, when I put that together,
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:50.700]   what pixels and what part are I gonna use?
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:52.460]   - This is a 10 megabyte file.
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.260]   This is, I don't know how many images,
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:55.500]   probably seven or eight images.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.260]   I can't find the stitch.
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:58.460]   It's perfect.
[01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.580]   - I can, well, I have to go one to one to see
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.340]   where there might be a little bit of a wobble
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:04.460]   but we're talking about like single pixel wobbles.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:06.060]   One of the things that really impresses me though
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:09.100]   is that one of my standard panorama shots
[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:11.940]   is the grand staircase, the Boston Public Library
[01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:13.340]   with all the lines and the murals
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:14.820]   and the marble stairs and everything.
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:17.620]   And there's almost always people there too
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:20.860]   and almost always the panorama is able to make it,
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:24.140]   just freeze each individual person in place.
[01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:25.220]   - That's a challenge.
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:27.140]   - That's how they're walking around exactly.
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:31.740]   And it's a great panorama in and of itself
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:33.660]   but I really wanna say this again.
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:37.780]   I can't mention another camera phone
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:40.540]   that is even decent at doing panoramas.
[01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:43.820]   It's more, if I had anything other than an iPhone in my pocket,
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:46.340]   I would simply snap a sequence of photos
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:48.900]   then stitch them together in Photoshop
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:49.740]   when I get back home.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:50.900]   - Yeah.
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.540]   It's the single processor and the A8.
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:53.540]   They're doing good stuff with it.
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:55.180]   - Yeah, really impressive.
[01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:57.300]   How does it compare to the 1020?
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:00.940]   I said on the Twitter that I thought the camera
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:02.620]   in the iPhone, I think in my review as well
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.260]   is the best camera phone on the market today,
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:06.020]   the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:09.980]   - I would not have agreed with that 5S compared to 1020.
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:12.460]   I will agree with that iPhone 6 and 6 Plus
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:13.540]   versus the 1020.
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.820]   However, this is the 41 megapixel Nokia.
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:20.340]   - Exactly, the Nokia still has two features
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:24.380]   that the iPhone 6 and no other phone can match
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:25.980]   which is it has a real flash
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:29.500]   and it has that four real 41 megapixel sensor
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.540]   which means that there are so many things where
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.900]   if you, so many photos are enhanced
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:36.100]   with just a little pop of real flash
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:37.380]   as opposed to a glowing LED,
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.580]   no matter how bright that glowing LED is,
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:43.740]   you can do those sort of things in the Nokia
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:44.900]   that you can't do otherwise.
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:47.100]   Also, as much as I might have joked about this
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:50.260]   or what nonsense, a 41 megapixel phone sensor,
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:51.500]   damn it, that actually works.
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:56.220]   You can really zoom in and make a good 8x10 print
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:09:00.100]   off of a section of a picture you've taken with the Nokia.
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:03.220]   With the iPhone, I do and I don't want them
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:06.300]   to make a higher resolution version of that sensor
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:08.620]   because there are times when I really wish
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:10.060]   I could crop a little bit tighter
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:12.180]   but I know that there just isn't enough pixel data
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:13.260]   to make that happen.
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:16.380]   On the other hand, everything else about this picture,
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:19.260]   the skin tones, the detail, the way the colors pop,
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:21.660]   the way that there's detail in the shadows,
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:23.660]   even if you can't see it on the screen,
[01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:24.740]   the way that you can tease it out
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:27.060]   by just nudging a little slider in a desktop app
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:28.260]   a little bit to the right,
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:31.020]   I would not give that up for an extra four megapixels
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:31.860]   of resolution.
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:35.500]   And do you find that the low light on the Nokia
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:39.500]   and the 6+ are comparable?
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.300]   Yes, I would say so.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:45.540]   The 5 and the 5S both had a really infuriating problem
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:49.860]   that I tried so hard to find real answers to.
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:53.740]   If you, there seemed, all I can say is my impression
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:55.900]   about the way that those two handled low light
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.100]   was that there's a point at which
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:09:59.500]   there's, it can handle the situation,
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.060]   when the look like it's lower and lower
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:02.820]   in different situations, like, okay, I can handle it,
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:05.020]   I can handle it, I can handle it, I can handle it.
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:07.340]   Okay, screw it, there's no way to take a good picture here.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.820]   I'm just gonna throw everything to the wind
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:11.740]   and just be happy with taking some kind of image.
[01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:13.780]   There, at some point when it gets the light gets really,
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:15.140]   really low, the only thing it's gonna do is
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:17.820]   I'm just gonna, not only am I gonna increase the ISO
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:19.100]   higher than it really needs to go,
[01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:20.980]   but I'm also going to obliterate all detail
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:22.380]   and take a lower resolution picture
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:24.060]   and do something synthetically,
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:26.980]   which is why the only situation in which other phones
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:28.460]   were just blowing the five and the five,
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:31.620]   that's out of the water, where interior of a museum
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:35.700]   overcast days when the light is not really that great.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.700]   It's not that the iPhone would take a poor picture,
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:40.700]   it's just that you would then zoom in just a little bit
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:42.540]   and you'd see that, oh, there's absolutely no
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.260]   fine detail in this picture.
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.780]   They completely solved that problem with the iPhone 6.
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:50.700]   I keep a preview of one of the important points
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:55.260]   from my photo review is that there is a multitudinously
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:58.660]   greater difference between the quality of the iPhone 6
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:01.300]   and 6 plus pictures and the iPhone 5S
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:03.140]   than there is between the 6 plus and the 6.
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:06.180]   I was expecting the image stabilization on the 6 plus
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:09.740]   to be a huge, huge factor, actually is present,
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:12.140]   but it's not as big as just simply the big leap
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:15.620]   that the iPhone 6 made over the 5S.
[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:16.980]   - Yeah.
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:19.060]   - Remember when the 1020 looked big?
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:20.460]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:22.780]   - Remember all this big hump.
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:23.700]   - Exactly.
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.940]   And people saying, oh boy, you know what?
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:28.820]   I'm in Paris for Nokia, designing a camera
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:30.660]   that has a lump on the side of it and like,
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:32.300]   you know what, you're idiots.
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:35.620]   Don't be interested in design, be fascinated by design,
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:37.420]   but don't be a design wonk.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:38.420]   (laughing)
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:41.140]   There's a line between design nerd and design wonk.
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.460]   If you're complaining that this camera that takes
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:46.740]   manifestly superior pictures in so many situations,
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:48.500]   he's a little bit thicker in this part
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:50.820]   than his other part, you're just a useless design wonk.
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:51.660]   Go away.
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:52.580]   (laughing)
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:55.980]   Put that down the keyboard back away from your WordPress.org.
[01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:57.700]   I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting for the Panasonic.
[01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:00.180]   That's my, I think that's gonna be my own Android phone.
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:01.500]   I cannot wait to see that.
[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:02.420]   - Oh god, god, god.
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:05.140]   - This is the, this is the Android phone
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:09.580]   that is a full on one inch sensor with a real lens on it
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:12.620]   and doesn't look like the Samsung version of that phone,
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:15.300]   which is they basically design a regular camera
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.660]   with a zoom and they just basically put
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:18.020]   an Android screen behind it.
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:19.620]   This looks like a thick phone,
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:22.820]   but a very real realistic Android phone
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:27.020]   and boy, that would be so tempting to have a four real camera
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:29.820]   with a real sensor and a real flash.
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:34.100]   It's, that said though, there's so much more to how,
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:36.180]   I'm glad I took this extra time because it took me
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:38.980]   an extra week to now stop thinking about the technical
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.740]   aspects of the lens, about taking a picture,
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:44.020]   then taking it off the camera and putting it onto Photoshop
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:46.660]   or putting it into, into aperture or light room
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.900]   and just saying, well, what can I do with it on camera?
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:51.820]   The new image adjustment features they've put into
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:55.220]   the photos app are phenomenal because you're used to
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:58.380]   the idea of not even, I'm not even gonna try
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:12:59.980]   the brightness control, I'm not even gonna try
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:02.540]   the contrast control because it's just useless.
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:03.900]   I can make it brighter, but it will blow
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.860]   out certain pixels and make, turn the shadows into mud.
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.940]   There is, it's more like you're asking a butler.
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:12.020]   You're almost, you're, you're, you're, you have a person
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:14.540]   who is knowledgeable in, in aperture,
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:17.580]   working for you inside that, that phone and you tell it,
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:19.620]   I would like this picture to be brighter.
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:22.180]   And that person understands that he wants it to be brighter
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:25.100]   but he doesn't want the highlights to be blown out
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:27.540]   and he doesn't want there to be no shadows whatsoever,
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:28.580]   angry at the image.
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:30.580]   And for every one of these little sliders,
[01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:33.940]   you're basically, you're basically indicating your intent
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:36.220]   to make a change to the picture, but then there's software
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:39.140]   that decides the best way to apply that intent.
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:42.660]   And so the ability to change things inside that device
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:46.740]   is better than any other free with the phone operating
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:47.980]   system solution that's out there.
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:50.780]   I'm not even sure that there's a better third party
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:54.740]   image adjustment software for, for any phone
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:55.940]   or any tablet out there.
[01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:59.020]   It is, it's, I have to, I've made some changes
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:02.860]   to that final review by saying that you almost want
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:05.180]   to change the way that you take pictures now.
[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:06.860]   Whereas before you were like, I gotta make sure
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.220]   I get the lighting correctly, why don't you make sure
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:09.580]   I got the exposure correct, gotta make sure
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:11.020]   I get this absolutely right.
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:13.540]   With the iPhone 6, you have such great
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:15.940]   and simple editing tools right there in the,
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:18.100]   in your camera roll that you may as well get it
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:20.580]   within about 10% of what it needs to be because you can
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:23.220]   easily make a very, very good fine grained adjustment
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:25.940]   that gives you, it's the difference between what the phone
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:28.140]   thinks is a good version of this picture to what you think
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:29.540]   is a good version of this picture.
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:31.100]   Very exciting.
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:32.220]   - I also like hyperlapse.
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:33.060]   - I love hyperlapse.
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:34.580]   (laughing)
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:35.740]   - So,
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:36.740]   (mumbling)
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:39.420]   - Now they have this time lapse capability in the iPhone
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:42.460]   camera, but it's not as good as this, right?
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:43.580]   Hyperlapse is really amazing.
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:46.820]   So this is a time lapse I shot with my iPhone 6
[01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:50.020]   pressed against the windshield of the top floor
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:52.340]   of a double decker bus as we went through London
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:53.500]   at rush hour.
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:56.140]   And so hyperlapse does, of course, the time lapse.
[01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:58.140]   And this is 12X, you have your choice.
[01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:00.980]   But this also did amazing smoothing
[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:02.340]   'cause the bus is bouncing around.
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:03.700]   - One of the things I've noticed with hyperlapse,
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:04.780]   I play with it a lot.
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:05.620]   - I love it.
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:07.820]   - Is that one of the things that it seems to be doing
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:11.340]   is when you increase the speed, it's picking,
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.660]   it's like stabilizing by picking different pictures
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:15.940]   or something because-- - Oh, interesting.
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:17.660]   - Because what you'll notice is it looks really rocky
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:20.740]   at 4X and then it gets smoother as you keep on speeding up.
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:23.940]   And it looks like it's trying to find something there
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:26.340]   to give it back to you smoother,
[01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:28.260]   but hyperlapse is really cool.
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:29.740]   - Look how smooth this is.
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:32.420]   You also, a couple of takeaways, boy, it's crazy
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:33.740]   in London at rush hour.
[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:34.580]   (laughing)
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:36.780]   - And everywhere else, I mean everywhere, I guess.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:37.620]   But look at all the pedestrians,
[01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:40.140]   it bikes, the bikes are gone weaving in and out.
[01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:41.860]   That's Trafalgar Square right there.
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:43.620]   - I wanna do one in Mumbai.
[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:45.340]   - I was so glad I did this, it would be fun, would you?
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:46.500]   - Oh man, next time I'm in Mumbai.
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.380]   - And this is a, a bus is a good thing
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:49.620]   because it stops and starts.
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:52.100]   There's something about it that it's a more interesting
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.780]   time lapse, this is all the way turned up.
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:56.620]   It's a 25 minute ride in two minutes.
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:58.860]   - I just want a speeder bike test in a forest.
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:15:59.700]   (laughing)
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:01.060]   - Might be fun, yeah.
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:03.380]   - That's another thing that is worth mentioning.
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:06.020]   The way that the video modes,
[01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:08.340]   and the built in video mode of the camera
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:11.620]   smooths out the bumps so exceptionally well.
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.460]   I just posted a video yesterday
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:17.580]   of musical performance in Quincy Marketplace about a week ago.
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:19.220]   And I'm moving around a little bit.
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:21.020]   I'm trying to hold the phone steady,
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:22.020]   but I'm holding it like this.
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:23.420]   I'm also looking behind me to make sure
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:25.580]   I'm not about to trip over a baby carriage
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:26.620]   or something like that.
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:29.780]   And it really does look like it's a steady cam shop
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:33.100]   because you can almost never see a hint of bumping.
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.380]   You can never see a hint of jittering around there.
[01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:38.300]   I'm so impressed with the video mode on this camera too.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.980]   You can tell how excited I am
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:43.780]   because I'm not someone who gets excited about video,
[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:48.220]   but it makes it so easy to take good looking video with this
[01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:50.780]   that you just really want to get up and do some more.
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:53.620]   And you tried the super slow-mo too.
[01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:54.460]   - It's fantastic.
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:56.260]   Serenity Caldwell took it to roller derby
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:58.700]   and she did the slow-mo of both 120 and 240
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:01.420]   because at 240 there's not enough light sometimes
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:04.260]   for if you're inside or it's dark conditions.
[01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:05.980]   But at 120 it looks fantastic.
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:07.420]   - One of the things you have to really think about
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:11.420]   is is that issue where it's 240 versus 120.
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:13.340]   When we do, we've done a couple projects
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:16.420]   where we're doing 1000 frames a second or 10,000 frames a second
[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:17.700]   and you think that it's just gonna be slow
[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:19.660]   and then you realize, oh we can't do that inside
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:21.420]   because there's just not enough light.
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:24.340]   We need a really good light source like the sun, you know,
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:25.180]   to do that.
[01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:27.060]   I mean, now there are places, you can go to big studios
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:30.540]   where you can do that, but it becomes a real challenge.
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:32.140]   But I just want to point out that I spent a lot of money
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:34.780]   on a camera that lets me do 240 frames a second
[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:36.460]   and I can now do my iPhone.
[01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:40.460]   Not that I'm bitter and angry.
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:41.300]   - I don't know.
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:44.260]   - But have you guys done very many tests with the 240?
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:45.860]   'Cause that's pretty much all I would do.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:48.180]   - I was one of those Benny Hana like restaurants
[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:49.460]   where they do the fire in front of you
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:51.700]   and I tried it at 120 and 240 and we did a,
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.420]   yeah it's just, it's great.
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:55.780]   - Yeah, I'm sorry I haven't posted it yet,
[01:17:55.780 --> 01:18:00.700]   but there's a, it turns out that I was one of God's beloved
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:01.860]   on the day that I was saying,
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:03.860]   I'm gonna spend nine hours walking around Boston
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:06.220]   just shooting more pictures and stuff with this thing
[01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:07.900]   because not only did an Aquindze market
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:11.180]   whether there was the stunt team that was doing leaps over
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:13.820]   banks of nine tourists like crouch down.
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.740]   So I got that, I happened across a couple of college students
[01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:18.900]   who had like the huge, like the two sticks
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:22.620]   with rope between them and making huge, huge bubbles with it.
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.180]   And you want to see like a really good example
[01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:27.740]   240 frames per second, see the shapes that happen
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:30.540]   with these like a cubic yard of bubble
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:32.740]   as it's being pulled out of this frame
[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:33.820]   and then hovering through the air
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:36.140]   and then it makes it touch with the cement side
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:38.100]   of the fountain where they're doing this
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:39.660]   and then suddenly goes, woo.
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:40.500]   - Woo.
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:43.420]   - I'm waiting for someone to shoot an entire
[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:46.060]   like high school football game with iPhone 6s.
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:48.060]   You know, so it's like you see like the slow motion
[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:49.380]   and you see the, you know, the, you know,
[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:50.460]   all the bits and pieces.
[01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:52.540]   - It gets you, it gets you so excited about,
[01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:54.900]   about using this phone and using this video camera.
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:57.620]   As I said, I'm someone who just is not terribly interested
[01:18:57.620 --> 01:19:00.420]   in shooting video, but this got me so interested
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:01.380]   in getting that sort of stuff
[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:03.620]   and you're right, the hyperlapse stuff or the super,
[01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:05.420]   excuse me, the time-lapse stuff.
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:08.860]   I had it on a tripod and I was taking shots of just a,
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:11.220]   I had my lunch in the public garden.
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:13.420]   I just, I'm rut my sandwich and had this on a tripod,
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:16.460]   aiming it at the, this foot bridge that goes over the lagoon
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:18.340]   and just not even paying attention to it
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:20.820]   then a half hour later just took it off, took a look at it.
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:21.900]   And it's the most exciting thing.
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:24.020]   It's Kwanaskatsi only without the music.
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:24.860]   - It is.
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:27.140]   - It's, it's, and it's a very pretty thing to look at later on.
[01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:29.020]   You're so glad that you brought the tripod along
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.460]   because it looks so cool that way.
[01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:31.300]   - I have a phone seven and a half.
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.100]   - I put some energy video in the chat room.
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:33.940]   - I've got it right here.
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:35.140]   I'm playing it actually.
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:39.620]   So this is one X speed of a guy going backwards at 720p
[01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:42.500]   and here's the half speed, which is 120.
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:45.460]   - Cause you can do 60 frame per second video now as well.
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:47.020]   If you want to, at 1080p.
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:47.860]   - I like that, yeah.
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:49.780]   - I also have the, I also have that music video
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:51.860]   in the, in the chat room too, if you're interested.
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:54.260]   So this is 240 frames a second.
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:56.380]   And as you said, Renee, it's dark.
[01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:57.220]   - Yeah.
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:59.900]   - It's dark, but you go down to 120 and it's not so dark.
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:04.540]   So Renee is a roller derby performer athlete.
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:06.660]   - Yeah, she's a combatant.
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:07.500]   I don't know that.
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:08.660]   - I'm a fan force her.
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:10.140]   - A fan force her.
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:13.940]   - But yeah, but she also does all the social media
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:16.260]   for the Boston Derby games.
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.700]   There's this huge league here in Boston.
[01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.060]   It's like.
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:22.100]   - And here's time there's for her watching.
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:25.460]   - Renee Caldwell is a woman with a wide portfolio
[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:26.580]   of very useful and app.
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:27.780]   - I totally adore her.
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.140]   I think she's my most talented people.
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:31.300]   - I hope that some smart publication were to snap her up
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:32.380]   because that's a good talent to have.
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:33.380]   - Yeah, somebody did, I think.
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.140]   - Oh wait, Renee, you did.
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:35.980]   - Renee.
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:37.820]   - Yeah, and she also did a lot of film stuff.
[01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:39.180]   So she can record all that.
[01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:40.020]   - That's right.
[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:41.220]   She's got a film background, film school background.
[01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:42.060]   - Yeah.
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.260]   So yeah, neat.
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:45.180]   - And one thing I'll point out here is that,
[01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:46.860]   well, this is 60 times, so it's gonna double up more.
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:47.940]   - This is not as good.
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:49.340]   You gotta say hyperlapse really.
[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:51.260]   If you're gonna do time lapse, hyperlapse.
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:52.500]   - Hyperlapse is doing it, I believe.
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:54.460]   They're using the gyroscope and things to stabilize it
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:55.540]   while you're capturing it.
[01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:56.540]   And I'm not sure what Apple does.
[01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:58.340]   I don't, Microsoft is doing it post capture,
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:20:59.580]   the way like Final Cut would,
[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:00.980]   but it's interesting to see the difference.
[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:04.420]   - Well, and by the way, hyperlapse,
[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:06.860]   while it was very successful when it first came out,
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:10.060]   I just saw an article saying that the downloads have slowed.
[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:12.220]   - That's 'cause everyone got it.
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:13.060]   - Everybody has it.
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:13.980]   - Everybody all have it.
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:14.820]   - Yeah.
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:15.660]   - If you have a Lamborghini Leo,
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:17.980]   you get to 100 miles an hour, you just get there faster.
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:19.260]   (laughing)
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:20.580]   - If you don't have it, get it.
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:21.620]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:22.740]   And when we come back here,
[01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:24.660]   picks of the week, gentlemen,
[01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:26.740]   if you would prepare those.
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:28.500]   Um.
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:33.060]   Our show today brought to you by
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:36.060]   somebody wonderful.
[01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:37.940]   Gazelle, I see it right there.
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:38.780]   (laughing)
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:40.660]   Look, this is actually a really good time
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:42.460]   to think about Gazelle because we know
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:44.500]   we're pretty sure there'll be a new iPad announced
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.700]   week from Thursday.
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:47.780]   And you can guarantee that already the price
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:49.420]   is starting to go down based on the rumor.
[01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:50.940]   But once the announcement happens,
[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:53.380]   the resale price of your old iPad goes down even farther.
[01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:56.260]   This is the time to go to Gazelle.com
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:58.060]   and lock in that price.
[01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:59.100]   It's good for 30 days.
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:02.260]   So you got plenty of time to get the new iPad,
[01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:05.020]   transfer your data, get it set up and all of that stuff.
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.260]   They even buy, you could see right there,
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:08.220]   broken cell phones.
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:13.220]   So you can just get some money for the old stuff broken or not.
[01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:18.860]   Over 2 million trade ins now, $175 million plus paid out
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:22.380]   to customers at Gazelle, gazelle, g-a-e-l-l-e.com.
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:25.780]   Not just iPads, iPhones, Android devices,
[01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:30.220]   even Blackberry phones, Motorola phones, Nokia, Samsung.
[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:32.260]   They'll buy tablets from Google and Microsoft
[01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:36.220]   with Samsung and Asus, even Amazon Fire tablets.
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:40.020]   Cash is sitting in your drawer or your closet right now.
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:41.700]   And the best way to take advantage of it
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:44.780]   is go to gazelle.com.
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:46.220]   Just get a price, get a quote.
[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:48.820]   It's locked for 30 days when you decide to sell.
[01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:50.820]   If you decide to sell, press that button.
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:53.380]   They will send you a box prepaid postage
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:55.700]   so you don't have to pay for the postage.
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:56.740]   They'll get you stuff.
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:57.660]   They'll turn it around fast.
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:00.460]   You can get a check, PayPal or an Amazon gift card.
[01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:03.380]   If you get the Amazon gift card, they bump the value up 5%
[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:05.380]   just as a way of thanking you.
[01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:11.860]   We have a trickle down policy here with the old phones.
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:15.380]   So everything trickled down to the bottom.
[01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:17.980]   And that's where we sold the iPhone 4.
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:18.860]   Lisa got a quote of that.
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:20.940]   $30 for an iPhone 4.
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:21.660]   Wait, though.
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:22.420]   She sent it in.
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:23.660]   They sent her $120.
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:25.260]   They said, oh, yeah, I had more memory than you thought.
[01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:26.700]   Or whatever, I don't know.
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:28.460]   They said 30.
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:30.100]   They could have given them 30.
[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:32.380]   But no, they said, no, it's more important that we get it right.
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:34.660]   Here's $120.
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:35.780]   Amazing.
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:36.860]   I don't know how they do.
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:38.300]   I don't know how they stand business.
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:39.540]   They do it because people love them.
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:41.180]   And they get great customer service.
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:42.340]   And you should try it.
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:43.900]   Because I'm not promising that they're
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:45.260]   going to give you more money.
[01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:46.940]   But I'm just pointing out that they will do that.
[01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:49.460]   If you forget, by the way, to wipe your data, they do that too.
[01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:52.380]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, gazelle.com.
[01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:53.940]   Get your quote today.
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:56.860]   And so your gadgets, your old stuff, the fast and easy way.
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:59.380]   With gazelle.
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:01.900]   I would like to get a pick of the week.
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:02.620]   Who should we start with?
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:04.740]   You, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:05.420]   You.
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:07.420]   So I'm coming back to a pick of many, many years ago.
[01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:07.860]   Paper.
[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:08.620]   I've heard of that.
[01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:09.060]   Paper.
[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:10.860]   So here's the deal.
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:11.980]   I'm still working through them all.
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:16.220]   But I've tried almost every touch sensitive--
[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:17.420]   Oh, these pens.
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:18.100]   Yeah.
[01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:20.620]   What I need is not so much to draw paintings.
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:22.580]   What I need is to be able to take notes.
[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:25.500]   So oftentimes, I'm saying, well, this
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:26.860]   is how big the building is going to be in the square.
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:28.700]   The same you want OCR.
[01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:31.420]   Yeah, so anyway, so this is a couple of versions
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:32.580]   since the last time I tried it.
[01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:34.260]   And I'm actually getting pretty happy with it.
[01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:36.380]   If you put this over here, it's my iPad.
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:37.260]   I can show you.
[01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:38.500]   Well, there's an iPad.
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:39.180]   I'll give you an iPad.
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:42.140]   Now, the cool thing is, is I can say,
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:43.460]   I can write on this piece of paper.
[01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:46.740]   You're writing with your I-Scribe pen on an actual notebook.
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:49.420]   It's the special LiveScribe 3 paper
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:50.100]   that you have.
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:52.100]   There's some special paper there.
[01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:54.500]   And is that going to-- but I'm holding the iPad.
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:56.060]   You're drawing on a piece of paper there.
[01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:56.540]   Yes.
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:58.660]   And it should.
[01:24:58.660 --> 01:24:59.180]   Is it going to--
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:00.020]   Of course, now, of course.
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:01.100]   What?
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:01.500]   So--
[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:02.100]   What?
[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:06.060]   So anyway, so the-- by the way, it looks just as crappy
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:08.620]   on his paper as it does.
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:09.860]   You need to work on your hand.
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:11.820]   Definitely didn't get all the dots.
[01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:13.740]   I think that we might have--
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:14.540]   Am I too far away from it?
[01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:14.900]   I don't know.
[01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:15.860]   But that's really interesting.
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:18.660]   So you can write in paper, and it will make a copy of it.
[01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:20.460]   I've never seen that thing.
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:22.380]   So of course, when I'm live on the air,
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:24.180]   it's going to be problematic.
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:27.180]   But what it does is it lets me draw right notes on this.
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:29.020]   Should I switch to feed?
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:29.380]   Maybe.
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:31.140]   I don't know why it was so--
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:31.860]   Like it's been working--
[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:32.260]   Whoa.
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:33.060]   --almost perfectly.
[01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:34.740]   Now it's the same image.
[01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:35.500]   Go back to that.
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.460]   These are other tests.
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:38.220]   It has been--
[01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:40.540]   So anyway, so what it does--
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:42.100]   this is me just testing it.
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:44.420]   And so what you can see here is I'm
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:50.420]   able to draw except for today on this piece here.
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:51.460]   And so I can draw all this stuff.
[01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:53.980]   The problem is I don't like things being stuck in paper,
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:55.980]   because to me, that is a data hole.
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:58.300]   So I don't want anyone in my company writing on paper,
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:00.300]   because it means I'll never see it again.
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:03.260]   So the idea is that now you can write on the paper
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:06.020]   and have the feeling of that and then email it to somebody
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:08.420]   or have it on your iPad and be able to grab it.
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:10.100]   And it works almost all the time,
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:12.180]   except when you're live on Macbreak.
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:15.060]   The live scribe-- this has gotten a lot better since I saw it.
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:15.820]   The first time I got it--
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:16.980]   Can I show people the pen?
[01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:20.620]   Because it looks like a slightly fat fountain pen.
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:21.540]   Yeah.
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:24.300]   And it comes with this little notebook.
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:26.820]   You do have to use their paper, because this is
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:28.540]   visible magic stuff on the paper.
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:29.660]   It's looking at it there.
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:30.620]   And so--
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:31.740]   This is what he drew.
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:32.820]   No, that's not what you drew.
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.140]   That's why I drew it right there.
[01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:34.500]   Really?
[01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:36.500]   Yeah, that's why I said there was something
[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:38.500]   about the communications not working.
[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:41.540]   But every other time, except for right now--
[01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:43.500]   And then you can record by tapping that.
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:44.860]   And then when you do there, you can talk.
[01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:46.420]   And you can actually attach--
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:47.300]   When you tap on that--
[01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:48.020]   Is that mic in it?
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.860]   Yeah, it'll actually-- so you can actually record--
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:50.740]   Your camera underneath the pen.
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:53.420]   Yeah, there's a little camera underneath where the pen is.
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:54.380]   And so--
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:56.020]   Can you still do this?
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:59.820]   You used to be able to draw a keyboard and play it.
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:00.340]   I don't know.
[01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:01.260]   I've never tried that.
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:02.380]   It's quite possible.
[01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:03.420]   There's all these little--
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:03.420]   So--
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:04.980]   And the reason you use a special paper--
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:06.260]   not merely for tracking, but there's
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:08.660]   all these little special things--
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:09.140]   Things.
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:10.260]   That you can do.
[01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:12.980]   But yeah, so you can tap--
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:15.460]   But you can-- oh, there's your keyboard.
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:17.780]   Yeah, so you can tap it to type in a keyboard.
[01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:18.380]   Yeah.
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:21.540]   So there are a lot of interesting things
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:22.300]   that you can do with it.
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:25.500]   As said, except for today, it's worked really, really great
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.340]   as I started to play with it.
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:30.380]   And again, if you're looking for something that really gives
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:32.540]   you that paper feels--
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:34.340]   But gets it digitally.
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:34.900]   It works well.
[01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:37.540]   I'd rather show up at a meeting with a client with that drawing--
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:40.180]   to take the notes that I need to if I'm not going to type them.
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:41.380]   For whatever reason-- and most of the reason
[01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:42.540]   is I'll type almost everything.
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:44.820]   The main reason that I would use this is I'm oftentimes
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:47.420]   taking notes about locations.
[01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:48.420]   That's what I do.
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:49.460]   Anyway, something to think about.
[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:50.780]   Neat, live scribe, how much?
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:52.260]   I think it's like $300.
[01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:53.220]   It's expensive.
[01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:53.740]   It's expensive.
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:55.380]   And then you have to-- the paper's not super expensive,
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:56.620]   but you do have to use their paper.
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:57.620]   Yeah.
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:58.780]   Cool.
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:00.380]   Mr. Renee Ritchie.
[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:02.620]   I have two picks this week.
[01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:05.060]   One, I was actually going to go with the app that Andy went with,
[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:06.620]   but he was faster than me this week
[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:08.180]   in getting into the spreadsheet.
[01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:10.140]   So I adapted quickly.
[01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:12.260]   One is screens from Adovia, which
[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:13.260]   you might be familiar with.
[01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:15.260]   They've updated for the new iPhones.
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:19.060]   I was primarily using screens on the iPad Mini and the iPad,
[01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:20.820]   because it's just nice to have a bigger screen
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:21.820]   if you're going to look at your Mac.
[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:22.700]   So I should back up.
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:25.060]   Screens is a VNC program by Adovia.
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:27.700]   And it lets you connect to your Mac or your Windows PC.
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:30.380]   I think Linux as well, just using your iOS device.
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:32.420]   And there's a Mac client as well if you want to do that.
[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:35.220]   But I like it because if anything ever goes critically wrong,
[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:37.900]   even if I'm away from home, even if I'm on LTE,
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:41.780]   I can still get back and do what I need to do on my computer.
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:44.980]   But on the iPhone 6 Plus, as I'm finding with so many apps,
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:48.260]   it's like a tiny tablet when it's in landscape mode.
[01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:51.540]   And this is my Mac Pro that I'm doing the podcast on right now.
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:56.780]   And at 5.5 inches, it is incredibly usable even on a phone.
[01:28:56.780 --> 01:28:58.940]   He's done some updates for iOS 8.
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:00.460]   Like there's touch ID and there's things like that.
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:03.020]   But just the app itself, the base functionality,
[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:06.020]   is so much more useful at tiny tablet scale
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:09.380]   that I'm not even bothering to reach for my iPad Mini anymore.
[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:10.580]   Or my iPad Air for that matter.
[01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:12.540]   I'm just using it on my phone.
[01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:15.220]   It's a lazy thing to do, but it's convenient.
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:16.420]   I like it.
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:17.860]   I absolutely agree.
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:18.820]   I use screens.
[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:21.780]   I'm using it since the first iPad.
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:23.340]   And you're absolutely right.
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:25.900]   When you put it on the iPhone 6 Plus, it's like, oh,
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:28.780]   I could actually in a pinch actually work this way.
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:31.260]   If I was packing for a trip, I knew
[01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:34.220]   I only would need my MacBook for about 30 minutes.
[01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:37.700]   I bet that I could use this to import this Word file
[01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:40.260]   from somebody else, make quick reads and edits,
[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:42.300]   and then put it back on a Dropbox for somebody else.
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:43.780]   And I could leave my MacBook at home.
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:45.100]   Interesting.
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:48.140]   I've even used it because I edit podcasts usually at home,
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:50.220]   but I forgot once and I hadn't put it in Dropbox.
[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:52.780]   So I just quickly connected, pulled the file over to Dropbox.
[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:54.540]   That's synced and I use my other computer.
[01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:55.500]   Yes.
[01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:59.060]   Any situation where you don't have what you need,
[01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.060]   it is great.
[01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:02.620]   And that reminded me that the developer behind screens,
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:05.260]   Luke Vondal, he does a conference in Montreal every year.
[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:06.420]   And it's coming up this weekend.
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:07.780]   It's called Singleton.
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:11.100]   And they have all the videos from the previous three years
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:14.700]   of Singleton because this is C4 available online for free.
[01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:16.980]   So you can go there and you can hear the John Gruber's
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:19.020]   and the Craig Hockenberry's and the Srenity Caldwell's
[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:22.060]   and the Dan Morrins and Jason Snell's and just
[01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:25.140]   luminary after luminary of the industry talking about really
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:27.700]   interesting, really specific subject matters.
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:29.500]   All the videos are on Vimeo.
[01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:31.780]   They're about 50 minutes each.
[01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:34.660]   Michael Jurwitz, when he was on his brief sojourn from Apple,
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:35.980]   had a great message for developers
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:37.340]   on how to charge for their apps.
[01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:40.660]   Matt Drantz was their former Apple evangelist last year.
[01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:42.820]   So just really, really smart people talking about really,
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:43.820]   really smart stuff.
[01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:45.580]   It's all free online.
[01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:49.700]   Edovia, edovia.com/screens.
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:50.540]   Screens for iOS.
[01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:53.900]   It's just VNC, but it's a kind of polished up.
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:55.700]   Leo, you could be sitting at your pool
[01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:58.140]   with your umbrella drink controlling your server form.
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:59.620]   It's the future.
[01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:02.580]   Just what I always wanted to do.
[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:05.780]   Ladies and gentlemen, from CraneCam 3000,
[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:11.300]   the future of internet telecasting, Mr. Andy Inako's hands.
[01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:11.940]   I thank you.
[01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:15.300]   And CraneCam 3000, the future video podcasting, thanks you
[01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:16.740]   as well.
[01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:19.700]   The only difficulty is that I can't actually talk and be on
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:20.860]   camera at the same time.
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:24.260]   So sometimes I have to hand puppet my way through this.
[01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:26.060]   Let's take the hand puppetry as read.
[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:29.460]   Yeah, this is a really great app.
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:33.820]   Panic Software has made my favorite FTP app for the Mac
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:37.380]   announced available for iOS aids called transmit.
[01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:39.700]   And it is an FTP program.
[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:41.900]   And your eyes are probably glazing over
[01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:43.340]   because you don't know what FTP is,
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:45.380]   or you know what FTP is, and you know it's not relevant
[01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:46.620]   to your interests.
[01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:49.140]   The fact is, if you have a computer anywhere in your office
[01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:52.460]   or a file server or a NAS network attached to it somewhere
[01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:54.900]   and you enable FTP on it, it means
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:57.060]   that you can put all of your files in one place
[01:31:57.060 --> 01:31:58.860]   and now access it from anywhere.
[01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:03.020]   And with transmit, now one of the biggest pains
[01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:06.060]   in the butt of using anything that runs iOS
[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:08.980]   is not solved but made a lot less painful.
[01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:11.660]   Just the ability to, I've got a file right here.
[01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:14.660]   I want to get it in there, or I've got a file in here.
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:16.500]   I want it anywhere else but there,
[01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:18.100]   because I want to use it on my notebook,
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:19.500]   or I want to use it on an Android phone,
[01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:22.060]   or I want to use it on another computer,
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:24.740]   or I even want to use it on my website
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:26.340]   as part of a web post.
[01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:29.140]   So I've got it, it's right now, all it's doing right now
[01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:31.940]   is just connecting to my NAS right now where I have,
[01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:35.860]   it's a central storage where I have most of my photos
[01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:40.220]   when they're done, I have most of my movies stored there,
[01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:41.620]   it's like my movie server.
[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:44.820]   So if I want to, I can play movies directly from here.
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:47.140]   This is a big thing, a big one that I've seemed to have
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:49.900]   selected backwards, so we're gonna abort that.
[01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:52.300]   But I can easily, if I want to pack for this trip,
[01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:53.380]   I can easily just simply say,
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:55.940]   I want the one of these 100 or 200 movies out there,
[01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:58.180]   I just want to download it and put it on this device
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:01.740]   so that I can watch it when I'm back,
[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:05.660]   when I'm back on my Amtrak there.
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:07.940]   But I've also got all my photos here,
[01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:09.540]   I've got documents here.
[01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:13.500]   Like Renee says, sometimes you thought that you,
[01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:15.620]   you thought that you planned correctly,
[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:18.020]   but you didn't actually plan well.
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:20.660]   And as a result, you've, oh my God,
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:22.460]   I need this photo of the statue,
[01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:24.820]   but I forgot to put it on my iPad or on my notebook
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:26.980]   before I went, well, if you need it on your device,
[01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:29.660]   I can just tap it right there, and now there it is,
[01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:33.020]   and now I can add it easily to my library.
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:36.260]   But the really cool thing is the ability to take files,
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:38.460]   because iOS 8 makes it very, very easy now
[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:43.460]   to embed exports and file systems into other apps.
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:46.420]   I was using this all the time last week as I've got this,
[01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:48.740]   I've got a picture here, and I want,
[01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:51.860]   or this movie here, and I want this to go on,
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:53.980]   I want to be able to use this anywhere else.
[01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:56.460]   Used to be, okay, am I gonna sync this into iCloud,
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:59.180]   am I gonna have to put it into Dropbox as an intermediary,
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:01.580]   what am I gonna have to do in order to make this work with this?
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:05.020]   All I do is tap share, I've allowed transmit
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:08.260]   to have access to this panel, so I click transmit,
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:12.820]   I have a pin that adds an extra layer of security,
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:15.580]   which I'm not gonna let you see, but after that,
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:19.700]   I've say, I've bookmarked the receiving folder on my NAS
[01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:23.460]   that takes files from my phone and tap upload,
[01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:27.100]   and then within mere seconds, this picture is going to be
[01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:30.340]   simply sent to my FTP server where I can get it
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:34.380]   on any device that I own at any time, anywhere in the world.
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:36.900]   It really is a terrific, terrific solution.
[01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:40.100]   It's not cheap, actually, it's not cheap,
[01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:44.460]   but I'm using cheap to say that a lot of iOS software
[01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:46.020]   is under price, it costs 10 bucks,
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:47.860]   which is what it should cost.
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:51.300]   It's commensurate with the amount of work that went into this,
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:54.500]   it's a very pretty, very clean, very full-featured app,
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:57.500]   and it's worth every penny if you are an administrator,
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:34:59.900]   if you need to move things onto websites,
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:03.540]   if you have FTP enabled, or SFTP enabled anywhere
[01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:06.220]   on your network, if you have a NAS or NAS box,
[01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:08.540]   this will solve so many simple problems.
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:12.020]   And I'm hoping that they will continue to update it.
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:16.300]   If they add AFP, if they add SMB support to it,
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:19.540]   that's what will allow it to simply find other Macs
[01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:22.020]   that have files sharing enabled and simply allow you
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:24.140]   to move files from here to there,
[01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:26.100]   or vice versa, very, very easily.
[01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:29.420]   SMB will mean that pretty much any device anybody makes,
[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:32.260]   including Windows machines that have files sharing enabled.
[01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:35.340]   Now, there will be no barrier to getting data from,
[01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:36.940]   again, from here to here.
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:40.060]   So easy, easiest pie, and a very, very pretty app.
[01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:42.260]   Can't tell, there are very few apps.
[01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:43.700]   There are a lot of apps that you like,
[01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:45.860]   that you think are useful, that you have a lot of fun with.
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:49.700]   It's rare that you wind up with an app that is so,
[01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:53.980]   so important that it really makes a lot of things easier
[01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:55.620]   and makes this a better device.
[01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:57.100]   And I think transmit is that,
[01:35:57.100 --> 01:36:00.220]   it's gonna be even better once it starts supporting
[01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:02.500]   other network storage formats.
[01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:05.940]   But if you use FTP at all, or SFTP at all,
[01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:07.940]   boy, is this gonna work well for you.
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:09.980]   It also works with Amazon Web Services content,
[01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:12.460]   but storage, but a lot of people don't use that
[01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:13.460]   unless they're administrators,
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:15.020]   but can't recommend this highly enough
[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:16.660]   if you've got a place for this.
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:18.620]   And obviously, if you're looking for something
[01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:22.100]   on your desktop, it's the way to do FTP on your desktop.
[01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:23.860]   - I've been using transmit for ever.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:24.700]   - Yans.
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:27.500]   - Yeah, I mean, panic is wonderful
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:30.300]   because they are just so good at building these interfaces.
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:32.300]   They're cutting to the very,
[01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:36.100]   to the simple features of what an interface should be
[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:38.620]   and how best to get that powerful feature
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:40.260]   into the least amount of steps possible.
[01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:43.940]   So, exciting that this app is so good,
[01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:45.380]   that it works so well with iOS 8.
[01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:48.100]   Double great that it's so pretty.
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:50.460]   It's so attractive to use.
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:51.340]   - Boy, thank you.
[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:54.140]   Oh no, you're talking about that.
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:55.620]   That is Andy Inako.
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:57.820]   He is also pretty and easy to use.
[01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:00.420]   He is-- - Check out my craycla sad.
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:01.780]   (laughs)
[01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:03.700]   - He is from the Chicago Sun Times
[01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:06.100]   and joins us pretty much every week.
[01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:10.020]   We will see if he goes to Cupertino next week.
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:10.860]   Should be interesting.
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:12.700]   - On way or another, I will be here talking to you.
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:13.540]   - One way or another.
[01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:15.260]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:17.580]   - We'll do a show next Tuesday, I guess.
[01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:19.260]   I mean, why not?
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:21.660]   But all the news will be on Thursday.
[01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:23.020]   Yes, yeah.
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:25.420]   Renee Ritchie, imore.com.
[01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:30.420]   He is also a good person to visit virtually at imore.com.
[01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:33.460]   Don't forget debug, imore.com/debug number.
[01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:35.860]   The latest one, 47 is awesome.
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:37.700]   - Yeah, 48 will be.
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:38.540]   - All right.
[01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:40.260]   And we also thank you, Alex Lindsey,
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:42.700]   for taking time out of your busy schedule.

[01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:27.420]   - Yeah, good night.
