[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.600]   Ladies and gentlemen, the show that
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.520]   brings you the latest news about Macintosh iPod iPhone
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.320]   and I, Justine.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.240]   Hello, everybody.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.400]   I'm Leo LaPart, your faithful host.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.600]   Scott Born is also here.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.040]   Thank you so much for doing it last week, Scott.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.800]   No problem.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.200]   We appreciate trying to help over at the Badango Barn.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.360]   It was a good experience for me to see
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.080]   what it was like on the other end of the Skype.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.000]   And it's a real frustrating experience.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.680]   I don't know how you guys have put up with this for so long.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.640]   It's the host you're always on, because you're on mic,
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.240]   and you're kind of in control.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.280]   And then it's just I'm sitting in my hotel room
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.520]   and sometimes the Skype is working, sometimes it's not.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.960]   I mean, I got a pee like a horse.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.440]   I mean, all that stuff.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.600]   I now-- it was a good experience for me
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.880]   to feel like what it was like to be on the other end.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.040]   I have much more sympathy for you guys.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.160]   Thank you very much for putting up with us.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.680]   Scott, you did a great job.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.960]   Everybody liked it, because Leo shut up on that one.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.560]   So I'm going to try it this time.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.600]   Well, you know, they just pick a different person
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.880]   to be mad at each week.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.000]   Scott Bourn is from theapplephoneshow.com.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.480]   He's been a busy guy lately, and we've
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.000]   got a lot of Applephone news, of course.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.240]   Andy Inako is here from the Chicago Sun Times
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.960]   in the colossal waste of bandwidth.com.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.200]   Hi, Andy.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.120]   Hello, Red 5 Standing By as usual.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.200]   And we're going to be--
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.400]   I think Andy, you're the designated Merlin man
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.800]   replacement.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.000]   Merlin's going to be taking-- he's taking time off this week,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.840]   but I think more time in the next few months off.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.280]   He's got a lot of business, apparently.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.800]   Awesome.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.120]   I'll help my hair so that I match his icon.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.880]   Well, yeah.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.480]   Actually, I have a album art with Andy Inako in it,
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.840]   but unfortunately, your head replaces Alex's.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.960]   So I'm just going to have to work on that and rotate it
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.320]   over a little bit a couple of them.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.880]   I just like parsing that sentence.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.600]   My head is replaced, Alex.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.880]   Speaking of Alex, it's Alex Lindsey from thepixelcore.com.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.440]   Hello.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.320]   Hey, Alex.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.960]   Thanks for coming up from Vancouver last week.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.240]   It was great to have you.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.520]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.520]   As always, I mean, I really should enjoy that.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.000]   I'm starting.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.280]   I'm slowly getting to know Vancouver.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.120]   It's beautiful city.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.080]   Well, you're really lonely there, though, don't you?
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.360]   Well, that doesn't mean you get to know the city
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.880]   if you're honeymooned there.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.040]   Come to think of it.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.600]   Yes, well, I don't think that's--
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.240]   Stanley Park, what's that?
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.760]   And you probably heard a girlish laugh
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.800]   in the background there.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.320]   It is-- no, that's not Merlin.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.400]   Usually it is, but this time it's I, Justine.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.960]   Justine?
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.640]   Hey, how are you?
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.240]   Great to talk to you, Justine, from the tastyblogsnack.com
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.880]   and mommypackmylunch.com.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.400]   Calling all the way from Pittsburgh.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.960]   And we brought you in because I loved your video.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.600]   It's on tastyblogsnack.com.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.280]   Yesterday, you put out a video of your iPhone bill.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.200]   Oh, my God.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   Yeah, it was some a few pages long.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   And a box.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.760]   And a box.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.360]   I know.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.440]   It was ridiculous.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.160]   What are these guys thinking?
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.720]   I have no idea.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.040]   I mean, David Pogan complained a little bit.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.600]   I guess I must be getting mine electronically.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.560]   Why was it so long?
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.160]   Well, apparently they give you every transactively everything
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.920]   that you do, every text message you send and receive,
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.440]   every call, and it's completely detailed.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.920]   I mean, it was almost 300 pages and it was double-sided.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.480]   So there's a line on the bill for every text message?
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.200]   Every single text message with our phone number, the time.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.120]   Does it have a text?
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.280]   No, it doesn't.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.960]   But you've got to figure they could if they wanted
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.440]   to make it a novel.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.440]   Yeah, apparently.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.000]   Wow, actually, that would be kind of handy
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.880]   to get the complete transcript of all your text.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.640]   It would be kind of scary, too, though.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.360]   How many did you have for a 300-page--
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.640]   It was almost 30,000, which is about average with what I do.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.640]   What?
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.440]   Your 30,000 text messages?
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.120]   I'd say that you got the unlimited text plan.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.640]   Oh, I did.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.600]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.600]   So really, this is AT&T punishing you.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.840]   This is a text plan and you get set out to prove it.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.120]   This is AT&T saying, "Justine, we do say
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.240]   unlimited, but you might want to think about 30,000."
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.760]   And here's the box to prove it.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.680]   Now, do anything but text?
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.000]   Well, I mean, a lot of it is I get all of my Twitter updates
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.080]   and I do Facebook mobile almost entirely through text messages.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.640]   So a lot of it's incoming.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.080]   Yeah, I mean, it's a lot of incoming, but also with Facebook,
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.920]   I especially will respond back through there.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.320]   And I don't even use the website.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.480]   I don't want to sound mean, Justine.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.760]   But I have this vision of you sitting at a restaurant,
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.560]   turning down a plate of food while you talk about eating
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.680]   the food on Twitter.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.760]   Yeah, that happens.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.480]   Or filming it or taking pictures of it.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.320]   We actually saw that behavior when you were in Macworld in January.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.680]   Yeah, you did.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.400]   I thought, I don't know why this beautiful woman
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.440]   sat down on her table.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.720]   That was the first thing was like, what happened here?
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.400]   And then you're on the phone like the whole time typing.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.960]   Of course, at the time, it was a trio.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.440]   It was.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.000]   I still actually haven't got rid of my trio, which I'm going to do
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   this month, which is kind of surprising,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.320]   is if I didn't still have my trio, I can't even imagine
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.080]   how many pages that them will actually would have been.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.720]   As a pro level, I mean, because I think most of us
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.400]   are really amateur level text messages,
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.080]   but you're really a pro upper pro level.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.400]   How would you compare the typing experience between the trio
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.480]   and the iPhone?
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.360]   Well, now you shouldn't do this.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.760]   Texting and driving with the trio is a lot easier and safer.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.280]   There is.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.640]   Really?
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.040]   Why is that?
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.720]   Because you actually can actually know that you're typing
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.280]   the correct letters.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.480]   And because there's a little dot on the F key.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.920]   So you know where your fingers are.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.200]   You have to look at the screen on the iPhone, don't you?
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.720]   You do, but I'm so much faster on the iPhone.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.760]   So it's a give or a take situation.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.040]   Let's be getting out of the city.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.600]   I'm hitting fewer people now.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.880]   No, those-- I think everybody on this show now has an iPhone.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.720]   You must all be getting electronic bills, right?
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.800]   Yeah, and I got 12 text messages last month, too.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.880]   Oh.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.080]   So there you go.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.760]   Just get a--
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.240]   2012.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.520]   Just so we know, how many minutes did you use?
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.720]   Only 200.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.200]   200 talk minutes.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.600]   So you really-- this is the modern.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.800]   This is the younger generation.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.040]   They text rather than talk.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.480]   My mother has to text me.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.880]   It was actually-- it really works.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.200]   I was in the movies last night.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.360]   My wife and I went to the movie, went to see the Simpsons movie.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.280]   And Henry was at home.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.680]   And instead of calling me, and I couldn't have
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.800]   answered a call in the movie, he texted me.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.560]   And it worked perfectly.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.280]   I could text him back.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.200]   It was a better way to communicate, in that case, anyway.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.120]   There you go.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.000]   Even for social networking sites, like Facebook, a lot of people
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.640]   don't even go to the website anymore.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.800]   Or Twitter, it's just right on your phone, text message,
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.440]   why even bother?
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.760]   It's quicker.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.840]   So those are my thoughts.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.720]   Well, anyway, are you going to now get online and tell them
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.000]   I won an electronic bill?
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.920]   Yes, definitely.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.680]   Because I really don't want to have an entire box shipped
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.080]   to my house again.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.680]   That's outrageous.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.560]   I can't--
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.560]   I had to get on a certain level.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.360]   It's sort of like when you pay your tax bill in pennies just
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.080]   to annoy them.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.580]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.160]   Because you really love the phone companies.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.880]   You know what?
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.880]   I want it on paper.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.840]   I want you to set-- I want you to pay for an 8-pound delivery
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.240]   every single month.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.080]   Hey, I'm not paying for it.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.320]   So yeah, go quiet ahead.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:08.880]   Give me paper.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.440]   Give me paper.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.280]   Yeah, I didn't even think about it.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.200]   What must the cost to AT&T be, though?
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.720]   Did they FedEx it?
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.600]   Did they UPS it?
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.400]   Did they postal?
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.280]   It's look great.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.280]   Yeah, it was just US Postal.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.840]   I think it was $7.10 to ship.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.800]   Awesome.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.800]   Yes.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.320]   I almost said that right now, switching my billing plan.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.240]   Stick it into the SIG-Sigler.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.800]   That's like now it only cost me $53 and change
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.240]   if you balance it out.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.040]   If you go carmically, that's like getting-- oh, that's
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:38.800]   like free money.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.800]   Oh, god.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.720]   It is.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.440]   Well, let's see.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.000]   I mean, if we all do that, I'm going to do it too.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.400]   But just see how long they can take it itemized.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.400]   I think we need to think about the trees, though.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.840]   I mean, you're talking about--
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.400]   You're talking about-- last one month before they go.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:53.920]   Oops.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.880]   OK, but I'll tell you what's going to last a month.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.840]   And that is Justine's contract with AT&T.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.200]   They're probably going to be sending you
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.280]   one of those letters saying, we'd
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.200]   like to invite you to visit Verizon's website.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.440]   I'm actually going to call them and not let them know
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.240]   that I'm actually filming.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.160]   But just see their thoughts on it
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.320]   and see how many people are actually getting these large bills
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.000]   like that.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.120]   Pope David Polk did it.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.880]   It was the first two alert us to this.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.880]   And he said-- but his wasn't 300 pages.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.080]   This was 30 pages.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.800]   I mean, he didn't know anywhere near--
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.040]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.040]   If you haven't seen the video, it's at tastyblogsnack.com.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.440]   And this is no hoax.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.400]   This is-- there it is.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.400]   Anyway, let's move on, because we have a lot of news
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:31.960]   to talk about.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.000]   But I wanted to get Justine on it,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.480]   just to talk about that alone.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.400]   It's just fascinating.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:38.960]   It's insane.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.720]   And as always, we want to begin the podcast with the little
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.040]   legalese, any or all of the contributors to TwitNet
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.440]   casts, their families, agents, heirs, or assigns,
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.640]   may hold positions and securities registered
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.320]   to publicly traded companies mentioned on the Twit Network.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.320]   Amen.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.360]   Basically, Scott Borne has like $100,000 million
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.240]   worth of Apple stock.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.280]   So anything he says can be used against him in a quarter.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.600]   I'm sorry it's no longer $100,000 million.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.120]   It's down to $50,000 million.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.600]   Did you sell off some?
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.000]   I sold a few socks.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.500]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.320]   I sold a few shoes.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.080]   A little profit-taking, Mr. Borne, huh?
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.000]   Profit-taking and dollar-cost averaging
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.520]   are two of my favorite phrases.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.920]   OK, off that iPhone bill.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.000]   Yeah, well, you buy-- what I would do is sell AT&T stock fast.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.880]   So right on the front page, by the way,
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.320]   if you go to AT&T.com, you can say-- there's a link that
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.920]   says, stop your paper bills, and it has a little green leaf
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.520]   next to it.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.520]   Learn more.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.760]   So maybe this is all about them trying
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.000]   to persuade you to stop getting the paper bill
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.480]   by giving it, sending you a really big one.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:39.980]   Wow.
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:40.980]   Good idea.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.720]   That's in now.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.560]   He might have been honest.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.640]   But no other phone company does this kind of itemization.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.840]   This is unique.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.720]   It is very weird.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.640]   It's like they're clueless.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.400]   You don't get that from your other phone, right?
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.160]   No, you definitely don't.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.000]   Who's your other carrier?
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.560]   Sprint and I had Verizon before that,
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.200]   and it was always like four or five pages.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.360]   Yeah, they don't itemize it like that.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.240]   Every day to transfer, they go on January 4th,
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.120]   you send 382 bytes on judgment.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.640]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.760]   Anyway, let's move on.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.200]   We've got a lot to talk about.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.800]   Last week, we spent some time on the new iMacs,
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.440]   the new iLife, the new iWork.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.080]   We've now had a chance, most of us, to play with it.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.120]   Scott, you've got one, right?
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.360]   Well, my iMac is not delivered yet,
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.840]   because I ordered it with the 1TB drive,
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.800]   and they're not shipping that until next week.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.040]   I got the 500 gigs, so that one came.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.080]   I came yesterday with the extreme chip in it.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.760]   Alex, you have some, though, right?
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.840]   I'm planning to get them.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.200]   I have to admit that I'm going to be a little bit of a cheapskate,
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.720]   and we looked at it, and I've decided to wait until October,
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.880]   so that I can get leopard just bundled with it.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.040]   Oh, that's not a bad idea.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.560]   A lot of people ask me, because if you come from the Windows
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.600]   world, that's your differently.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.200]   Don't want to get a new computer until a new operating
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.840]   system comes out, because that's such a pain to upgrade
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.720]   Windows, but that's not true on the Mac.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.040]   It's not a pain, but I'm just being cheap.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.240]   It's $100.29 bucks.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.240]   Andy, did you get your review unit?
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.400]   I got mine on Thursday.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.960]   As a matter of fact, I am Skyping
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.600]   via this brand shiny new aluminum pal.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.560]   It's very DeLorean-like in my office.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.560]   I like it.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.200]   I got the 24, and it's beautiful.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   I'm very happy with it.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.280]   It really is the-- I think I said this last week, too.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.000]   This is the first iteration of this big etch-a-sketch iMac
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.800]   that I actually really, really like.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.680]   But Macworld benchmark numbers out,
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.000]   and in most cases, it's only marginally,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.600]   like a few percentage points faster
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.680]   than any of the other Mac and Tashes.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.320]   What was the last time that a Mac user really cared
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.600]   about performance as opposed to, ooh, shiny aluminum inclusion?
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.440]   Exactly.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.040]   And it's what they're not--
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.000]   I mean, if they made a Mac with a cup holder,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.720]   they would bypass HP and sales.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.360]   Well, PCs have had cup holders for years.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.640]   You press that button, and that comes with a little cup holder.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.680]   I love that.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.720]   It's a little small, though.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.920]   You have to get a special cup for it.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.240]   You need service pack, too, to get that to work, though.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.480]   Ooh.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.280]   That hurts the team.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.120]   Justine, have you purchased an iMac?
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.720]   Will you purchase an iMac?
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.120]   I have not.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.000]   I probably won't.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   But it's tempting.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.840]   It's very tempting.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.760]   They're very beautiful.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.640]   I have to say you've played.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.560]   I'm sure you've all played with them.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.480]   How about the new keyboard?
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.600]   What's your reaction to that, Andy?
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.160]   Do you like it?
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.840]   I've been using it exclusively.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.360]   As a matter of fact, I've been carrying it from the iMac
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.280]   to my powerbook to every other Mac.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.280]   I'm not loving it.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.680]   I mean, it's competent.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.200]   It's OK.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.920]   It's not painful to use.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.000]   But every time I switch back to either the old standard Mac
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.040]   keyboard, or even better to the Logitech wave
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.880]   keyboard I've been using for a few weeks,
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.560]   you just say, on a desktop situation,
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.200]   I deserve so much more comfort than just adequate.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.680]   There's no travel on the key, Apple,
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.920]   selling the idea that your wrists are closer to the desk
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.120]   as being ergonomically.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.480]   That's justification.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.480]   I mean, I just don't get that same sensation of--
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.720]   I can't rest my fingers on the keys
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   because you put pressure on the key and it registers.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.600]   You just have to-- it's just not comfortable enough.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.240]   I found it hard to type accurately.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.680]   But I think some of that is because I'm
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.400]   moving from another full travel keyboard.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.840]   Yeah, I didn't have a problem with accuracy per se.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.280]   Again, it's just as comfortable to use as my MacBook
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.560]   keyboard or my powerbook keyboard.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.560]   But again, the difference--
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.120]   Well, it's the same as your MacBook keyboard.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:04.600]   Exactly.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.120]   Exactly.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.800]   I mean, so it's not like they gave us
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.000]   a substandard defective keyboard.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.520]   It's just a--
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.400]   Well, they gave you a laptop keyboard.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.200]   Yeah, that's the whole point.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.800]   I mean, motorcycles are fun.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.680]   Bicycles are fun.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.960]   But there's a reason why I have a forward or sedan
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.480]   that's because I like to be able to stretch out
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.440]   and enjoy the experience.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.560]   If I don't have to have something that's compact,
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.920]   if I don't have to have something that's thin,
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.880]   why would I bother?
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.360]   There's no advantage to this keyboard.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.920]   So why should I not have the most comfortable keyboard
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.440]   I can use?
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.080]   It is pretty, though.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:32.840]   Exactly.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.080]   It is.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.360]   When you put that little thin keyboard in there--
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.760]   I don't think the Bluetooth's are out yet.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.800]   I think there's another few weeks for those to come up.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.600]   So we have a wired one, but when you put that next to the Mac,
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.760]   the new iMac--
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.920]   You know, I really like that tiny little Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.080]   I could see myself traveling with that keyboard
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.320]   because you can just ergonomically put it
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.720]   in so many different situations.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.080]   And it's such a tiny--
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.040]   I will admit, OK, it's a cool little keyboard.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.320]   It makes you feel as though you're
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.840]   living in Logan's run or something.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.280]   If you can roll it up or fold it up, that'd be even cooler.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.960]   If you could hit people with it that annoy you,
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.200]   it is very, very sharp on you.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.280]   It is a very intimidating keyboard.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.920]   I have a Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.280]   I don't like it because I have to change the batteries too much.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:16.240]   Not your problem, huh?
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:16.600]   Well, no.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.480]   Well, again, I was about to say something
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.760]   I think I said last week that I actually like to have to--
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.280]   Oh my god.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.680]   I've been working so hard.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.440]   Oh, that's right.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.880]   I need to place the batteries on my keyboard again.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.120]   Oh, I'm working too hard.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.120]   Scott, you better take over.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.800]   I'm repeating myself.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.960]   Well, you know, I like the new keyboard.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.520]   I only got about a half hour's use of it, though,
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.800]   during the press announcement.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.960]   So I'm not in a position to make a definitive statement.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.280]   I was the most skeptical of anybody, at least out of our group,
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.840]   when they first introduced the Chicklet keyboard on the MacBook.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.960]   And then everybody was telling me how great it was.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.320]   So I re-aligned my thinking.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.360]   I think it's just like everything else.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.840]   If you're used to one system, you're
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.840]   going to probably default to that system.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.520]   Now, the big controversy.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.760]   And something we kind of missed the boat on, I think, last week.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.720]   Eye movie.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.480]   I disagree that it's a big controversy.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.320]   It's only a big controversy for the vocal minority.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.960]   Do you think most people don't care?
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.240]   Well, there's a lot of people on some of the forums
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.200]   where that whole controversy started saying, wait a minute.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.160]   Are you guys crazy?
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.560]   This is way better.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.720]   And then Apple diffused it somewhat by making
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.440]   available for download the old Eye Movie, if you prefer that,
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.560]   because that's what you're used to.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.520]   I've used the new one.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.640]   And I've got to tell you, I far prefer the new one to the old one.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.120]   Alex, you're familiar with this controversy, Alex.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.480]   What is the controversy?
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.000]   Well, the controversy is that the new Eye Movie
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.400]   was rewritten from scratch.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:46.320]   And not only is it new, an interface, a new layout,
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.400]   but they really chose--
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.880]   they kind of cherry-picked the kind of features
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.400]   they were going to move to the new version.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.160]   And so there's a lot of stuff that's left out.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.640]   So for instance, there's really not really very many
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.640]   or any video filters.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.640]   So there's no real timeline, the way
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.440]   that we would-- there's no traditional timeline
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.040]   that we would normally use.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.080]   There's very little control audio.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.440]   So for instance, if you're trying to make a music video,
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.080]   which is something I was playing with for the show
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.240]   that we were doing last week, trying
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:21.480]   to get things to time to an audio track is pretty challenging,
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.960]   much more challenging than the last version.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.960]   Other things that people have been a little upset about
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.920]   is the fact that you really need a Mac Pro or an Intel chipset
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:31.840]   to run it.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.080]   The old G-- at least the G4s, it's not--
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.600]   or G5s are not--
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.160]   Can't run it on a G5?
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:39.880]   I'm pretty sure that--
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.800]   I know you can't run it on the G4s,
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.000]   and I'm pretty sure you can't run it on the G5s.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.120]   This just came up.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.160]   System requirements says that iMovie requires a Mac
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.360]   with an Intel processor, a PowerMac G5 dual 2 gigahertz
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.920]   or a faster or iMac G5 1.9 gigahertz or faster.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.360]   So if you're on an older laptop or an 18-month old laptop
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:02.400]   or on a 1.8 dual G5, which we have a couple in the office here,
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.160]   you can't run it.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.040]   Is that the skimming feature that's eating up all that?
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.400]   It's probably a lot of things.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.240]   They're doing a lot of things to make it work.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.960]   Now, what I will say about this is that I've played with iMovie
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.760]   a lot and made little videos with it,
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.760]   and then I tried this new one.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.880]   And I'll say that it was frustrating to not have the stuff
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.960]   when you're looking for it, but I do admit
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.680]   it's really, really fast when you want to throw something together.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.120]   So for what they organized it against,
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.920]   it definitely fulfills the idea of we want to make it way easier
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.720]   to do something really, really fast.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.920]   I started playing around with the video of some stuff I shot
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.120]   and when we were up there for the lab.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.160]   And I was like, well, I'm going to see what
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.520]   I'd like to do it in Final Cut.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.560]   And I realized by the time I'd gotten through just my setup
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.320]   in the Final Cut Pro project, I had gotten--
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.480]   I had a minute already edited in iMovie.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.760]   And that was just me getting my clips ready to go
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.120]   to work in Final Cut.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.720]   And so it is really, really fast.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.360]   It does have an export to Final Cut Pro,
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.320]   which is really interesting, which means that if you were--
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.320]   especially news, like if I was doing--
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.320]   when we cover Macworld next year,
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.640]   I think we're probably going to end up using iMovie for it,
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.520]   because our ability to just slam things together
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.520]   is much faster than dealing with--
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.920]   than Final Cut for something that needs to be out really,
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.040]   really quick that day.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.240]   Any other thoughts from anybody else?
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.160]   Scott, you don't think it's a problem that they've dropped.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.200]   They've dropped-- I mean, look at all the things
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.000]   that are missing.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.720]   You don't have--
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.160]   Well, here's the thing that's not a problem.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.000]   You can download the old versions you want.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:35.960]   But it won't be updated.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.200]   I mean, it's done now.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.360]   But if you like the old version, then that's what you want.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.000]   You can have it.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.240]   I think it just depends.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.480]   If you're a power user, there are certain things
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.680]   you may miss from the old one.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.400]   There are certain things you may like about the new one.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.240]   The skimming feature is awfully cool.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.160]   And of course, I don't have any experience
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.520]   running it on a low-power machine.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.400]   All I have is high-power Intel machines.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.480]   But I have to say that, for me, it's been very intuitive.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.000]   I didn't spend one second reading any instructions.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.240]   And I was immediately putting clips
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.600]   on the-- into the bin and making it all flow together.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.200]   Now, I did not try what Alex talked about,
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.320]   which was adding special audio tracks and such.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.040]   And that might become frustrating to me,
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:23.920]   because I did do a lot of that with the original iMovie HD.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.600]   So that's something that'll be worth looking at.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.800]   Of course, if you get too sophisticated,
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.360]   people are going to just move up into Final Cut.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.720]   Yeah, but move up into Final Cut is not a non-trivial.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.520]   I mean, it's 300 bucks for Final Cut Express.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.120]   And what is it?
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.120]   1,200 bucks for Final Cut Pro Studio.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.320]   I mean, it's impressive.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.320]   Your choice is already--
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.320]   It's almost seen--
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.320]   Yeah, it's almost seen.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:44.880]   Yeah, you do a lot of video.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.640]   You do a lot of video, Justin.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.140]   I do.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.680]   But I think it almost seems like the reason
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.120]   that they did dumb down iMovie is so that people will upgrade
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.040]   to Final Cut Express and be like, well, where's
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.720]   all these features that?
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.480]   I actually haven't even got to try it yet.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.320]   I bought it the other day.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.000]   And everyone's like, don't do it.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:00.480]   Don't do it.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:00.960]   I movie.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.000]   It's horrible.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.240]   But now that you can download the other version,
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.680]   I mean, that's really not a big deal of it.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.000]   And also, when you install--
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.120]   The one thing I noticed that I didn't notice when it first
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.240]   happened, though, is when you run the install for iLife08,
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.600]   it deletes all the other iLives, all the other iLife apps
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.600]   except for iMovie HD.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.600]   So they knew that there was a problem.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.600]   There's a folder that just says "Old iMovie,"
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.600]   and it's sitting there.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.960]   And so you can--
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.200]   So actually, if you already have iMovie HD
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.480]   and you really like it, you can have the best of both worlds
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.360]   where you can use the new iMovie, or you can go back
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.960]   to the old iMovie and just use that
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.080]   if you want to do something that's more complicated.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.920]   So I think you're really looking at four applications.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.920]   Now, what we do know is that the iMovie HD probably won't get
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.360]   updated.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.640]   And within the next 12 to 18 months,
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.840]   it'll be end of-- I mean, completely unusable
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.160]   because of the way the process is almost likely.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.920]   You made a good point, Alex, saying they really should just
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.280]   have renamed it.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.080]   Yeah, I mean, I would have been more tempted to call it
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.640]   "Home Movie" or-- and I think some people online
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.080]   would call it "iVideo."
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.360]   I mean, calling it the same name as the other app,
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.920]   I think, is part of what is not managing people's expectations.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.040]   It really is a different app.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.400]   It's a completely different app.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.840]   Yeah, I think marketing-wise, that's a good call.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.400]   Marketing-wise, they kind of botched it.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.600]   Well, but now you're going to have four different video
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.600]   editing software.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.540]   That's exactly the problem that Microsoft
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.480]   faced with Windows Vista.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.000]   You just don't know which one is going to be appropriate.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.960]   I like the new iMovie because I think it's definitely
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.400]   an upgrade for people who use iMovie
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.520]   in strictly a consumer context because I docked
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.400]   like a 40 gig--
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.680]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.000]   external hardware, all kinds of video-wise shot on a cruise
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.680]   around Hawaii without really intending to do any editing with
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:42.840]   it.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.280]   But it found the content, it imported it.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.000]   It was so easy to organize clips.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   It was so easy to drop things together
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.160]   that I was able to do something with this new version of iMovie
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.800]   that I wasn't able to do with iMovie HD, which
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.120]   was to really just play with this thing
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.840]   and just have some fun seeing what I could throw together.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.800]   Whereas iMovie, although it's one of the most easy-to-use
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.440]   video editors out there, it still
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.040]   requires that you have sort of an editing suite, editing
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.640]   console type of mentality.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.280]   So I think it's definitely a downgrade
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.400]   for people who have a serious use for video.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.520]   Maybe an upgrade, though, for people who just--
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.360]   I think there's a need for people who just want to get the
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:23.000]   damn thing off the camcorder and onto the HDTV in a way that
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.440]   turns those two hours worth of tapes into something that's not
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.680]   going to be punitive to your friends and family.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.160]   Does it make a gap in the product line for something
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.200]   between the new iMovie and Final Cut
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.720]   Final Cut Express?
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:40.560]   $100 product, let's say, that it's a little more like iMovie HD.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.800]   I think it depends on how far it grows as well.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.400]   I mean, this is version one.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.640]   And this is early.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.200]   Maybe we see in the next year, maybe they updated Macworld,
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.800]   or maybe they updated it.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.600]   There's a lot of options here to kind of push things forward
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.680]   a little bit.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.240]   So we're looking at version one.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.120]   I think that also-- I want to say that I really, after playing
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.200]   with it, I don't even see this necessarily as a consumer-only
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.040]   application.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.000]   After playing with it over the weekend, I really started
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.280]   seeing that any time I need to do news gathering, any time
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.080]   I want to do a rough cut, especially because I have that
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.600]   easy-to-export Final Cut XML output.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.640]   I could totally see myself doing assemblies, putting together,
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.480]   as I said, for instance, a Mac break if we're covering an event
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.960]   where time is of the essence.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.520]   And we need to shoot something and just edit a bunch of stuff.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.800]   And it doesn't have to be timed music.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.360]   And we just got to get it out.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.440]   Those are the kind of things that would be really, really easy
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.800]   and really powerfully done in iMovie, and much faster
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.000]   than Final Cut.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.320]   I also want to say one thing about the capture.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.080]   You can capture now.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.280]   You can say I want to capture it 960 by 540 on the way in.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.400]   It appears from the testing that I did that iMovie is actually
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.880]   doing a really smart way of capturing it, which is not to get
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.440]   too technical.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.720]   But it's taking one of the fields.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.040]   If you're shooting Interlace, 1920 by 1080, which you never
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.920]   want to use on the internet, you know, the Interlace, it
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.280]   will actually only grab one of those fields and scale it down,
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.400]   which means you're getting this nice progressive scan image,
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.320]   and you're taking up a lot less room on your hard drive
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.400]   on the way in.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:16.880]   So for people doing web stuff, this is really a great application.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.560]   I don't know if there's really that.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.840]   I think people are going to have a hard time going back to iMovie
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.600]   for many-- the older iMovie, once they start playing with
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.160]   this thing, there are some-- there's
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.400]   going to be 10% of the iMovie population that's going to want
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.360]   to use something else.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:34.080]   They're going to go, oh, I need to use iMovie because it
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:34.920]   doesn't have X, Y, and Z.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:39.040]   But I think 90% of the folks, after the new iMovie,
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.600]   I think that they're going to just not--
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.440]   they're going to find the other one tedious.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.880]   Alex, maybe you can explain something to me that I didn't
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.520]   understand during my testing.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:52.080]   As luck would have it, I got a DVD that I was an unlocked DVD
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.080]   that someone had burned for me.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.520]   I want to duplicate it to send to a friend.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.480]   I happened to have the disk image of the DVD still mounted,
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.320]   not the DVD itself, but the disk image.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.920]   And I launched iMovie, forgetting that disk image was
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:03.440]   mounted.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:08.760]   And iMovie actually considered that DVD image as a video source,
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.040]   and started importing video clips from that image.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.280]   Now, is that something that the previous edition of iMovie
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.560]   HD used to do?
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.160]   You know, I've never actually tried to do that.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.240]   It was totally unintentional.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.400]   I was like, wow, dude.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.240]   That is awesome.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.760]   I didn't get exactly what happened.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.720]   So say it again one more time.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.360]   Here's what happened.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:33.360]   Now, a while ago-- I'll try not to send us down a rat hole,
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.280]   but because this is a good way to thank someone who did
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.400]   something very nice for me.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.520]   I talked about, I think it was on a Twitter cast, about this
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.240]   wonderful production of the Fralling Karamasa of Brothers,
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.160]   the Comedy of Errors, when best TV shows ever.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.640]   I usually use it as an example of, well, gee, this is why
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.480]   we need YouTube.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.760]   This is why we need BitTorrent, because we need to keep
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.040]   these old videos alive.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.040]   And it turns out that one of the sons of one of the
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.960]   performers in that broadcast is a listener of Twit, and he
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.760]   sent me, like, he replaced my awful, banged up old VHS with a
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.360]   really, really great DVD.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:03.760]   Oh, that's right.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.240]   That was like a first generation copy.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.400]   And obviously, I want to make copies for my friends, because
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.640]   I keep telling people how great the show is.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:13.080]   So the only way to duplicate is to, of course, you go into
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.280]   disk utility, you basically tell the application to, please
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.760]   turn this DVD into a disk image so you can burn multiple
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:19.720]   copies from it.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.080]   So again, this happened maybe-- I did that in the
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:22.560]   afternoon.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.760]   At night, I launched iMovie for the first time, forgetting that
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.680]   a disk image of this DVD, for all intents and purposes, it
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:32.320]   looks exactly like the DVD, only it's not the actual DVD.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.760]   And what happened was the capture mode just suddenly
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.560]   activated.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.360]   And chapter for chapter for chapter, each one of these
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.280]   video clips started loading into the editing tray, section
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.280]   after section after section.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:45.760]   Are there lots of--
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.040]   Did you have any other software that just imported it?
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.200]   Just imported it.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.440]   There wasn't any sort of a DC-- obviously it was an
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.400]   unlocked DVD.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:53.600]   Right.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.200]   It's not a commercial DVD, right?
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:55.840]   Exactly.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.520]   But again, it's almost-- it's exactly as though I had
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.520]   hooked up a camcorder.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.040]   It had recognized that a video source had been connected, and
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.640]   it just started pulling video from this thing.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.160]   That's pretty awesome.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.680]   Yeah, I mean, if it's a real feature, as opposed to a--
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.760]   I see all these video clips that seem to be on an external
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.840]   storage device, and I'll try to make sense of them.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.000]   I wasn't able-- the only thing is it was loaded with errors, so
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.440]   I don't know whether this was just maybe a bug in the program
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.040]   where it just misidentified this volume as a source of video,
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.640]   because it would seem that if Apple had released this as a
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.440]   real feature-- because this would be a great feature, because
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.840]   how many times has someone burned you a DVD of the kid's
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.560]   birthday party for their vacation?
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.440]   And you say, oh, wow, that's great.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.160]   I really want to edit it.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.600]   And you don't want to have to rip it in handbrake, because
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.960]   that does another analog digital conversion that will give
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:46.240]   you a generational washout thing.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.360]   I don't know if that's a real feature.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.040]   Now, I'm not at the point yet where I start calling people
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.480]   at Apple, because I like to at least spend the first week
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:57.120]   not relying on any unusual sources of information.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.960]   But I really want to know what the story is behind that,
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.880]   because if that is a feature--
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.080]   that's an awesome feature.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.800]   My only guess is that it could be the added compatibility
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.760]   with some of the new formats.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.280]   So there are DVD cameras.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.680]   They're shooting the DVD.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.640]   There you go.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.120]   So I think that it might be that they've added compatibility
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:19.280]   to be able to see a DVD, because they need to be able to
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.920]   be compatible with those cameras.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.520]   So my guess is listening to this, that's probably what
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.360]   happened.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.320]   It probably is new to iMovie, this new version.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.920]   And it's just adding compatibility with the cameras,
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.520]   and you just happen to be an innocent bystander
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.920]   anywhere than image.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.520]   Yeah, your new is collateral damage going by.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.160]   Alex, when I was at the launch, Apple was pimping this new
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.640]   Panasonic camera with a new HD format.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.120]   What do you know about that?
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.400]   This is the-- I don't know if it's--
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.440]   I'm not sure what the Panasonic format is.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:54.120]   There's a variety of MP4 or H.264 formats that are based
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.920]   on these that are straight to drive captures.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.120]   And so those are--
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.920]   This uses SD cards.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.320]   Yeah, you can do straight to hard drive that are internal.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.600]   You can do SD cards.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.280]   Those are the two big ones.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.880]   And there's a variety of different cameras.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.880]   There's the exact one is probably the one that most people
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.680]   that I know that like their little handheld HD cameras
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.280]   are using.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.320]   It supports the exact one out of the box.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:19.920]   It should now.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.640]   Yeah, I believe that--
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.120]   So in other words, if I take that exact SD card, plug it in.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.520]   It'll act as if I plug in on a--
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.520]   It does support that because I have the new version
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.360]   of the exacti and I plugged it in Saturday and it worked fine.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.240]   Yes, that's what we-- the Panasonic HDC SD1.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.760]   I actually have one in front of me right now.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:37.240]   Oh, neat.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:37.640]   Oh, OK.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.160]   How do you like it?
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:39.760]   I like it.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.880]   I mean, it's lightweight, small.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.760]   It's just like a toilet paper tube with a lens in it
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.840]   that records HD.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.240]   That's always the nice thing, isn't it?
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.240]   What's the model member, Andy?
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.040]   I'm reading the side.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.120]   It says HDC SD1.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:57.280]   Can you do that in that funny voice you do with the numbers?
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.960]   I have so many funny voices in it.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.320]   You think right now?
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.880]   We're just taking voice requests.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.200]   So what other features do we like in the new iMovie?
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.080]   I have to say, if you've played with a skimming--
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.040]   and that's not just iMovie.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.520]   It's a cross-eye life entirely.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.760]   Skimming is a big, big win.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.840]   I love skimming.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.320]   I hope that's going to be like a really embedded feature
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.880]   in Leppard because you go from what the hell is it doing now
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.960]   to oh, it's doing something awesome.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.320]   Yeah, it's kind of minority report in its appearance.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.760]   Can you describe what it does as a skunt?
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.800]   Well, yeah, skimming just--
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:34.240]   you drop clips into the iMovie, and then you
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.400]   think that they're just a static little icon representing
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.480]   the clip, which is what you'd be used to in other applications.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.800]   And then your mouse pointer accidentally
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.840]   wanders over the clip, and it starts playing.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.320]   You're like, whoa, what was that?
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.400]   You can actually scrub through it, which is amazing.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:52.680]   Yeah, and more importantly, you can click and edit through it.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.720]   So you can actually click in the skimmed version of the clip,
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.480]   set your in and out points, hit the E key, and boom,
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.560]   you're in any business.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.560]   Justine, you probably use Final Cut for all the video you do, right?
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.520]   Yeah, I do.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.640]   But I did just get IV8, so I'm probably
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.160]   going to install that tonight because I'm kind of excited about it.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.400]   I'd be really curious if you could do what you do,
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.640]   because you do-- some things like that parkour are heavily edited.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.640]   I would be really curious if you could do it, and I'm--
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.840]   For smaller things, I do use iMovie.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.240]   But again, like Alex said, if it's something that needs to be done quickly,
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:28.640]   because it exports in really great quick time quality, and it's fast.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.360]   There are little things you'll miss, though, and Alex, you found this out
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.680]   when you were doing it at the lab.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:36.120]   For instance, let's say you want to cut to the beats of music.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.120]   There's no easy way to do that.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:38.840]   Probably not.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.720]   And even audio editing is always very difficult, and I'm maybe which--
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.120]   Well, it's not existent now, so--
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.400]   No, that makes it easier.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.240]   You can't.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:47.800]   Add it and make it--
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.680]   You can't do it.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.000]   Writer and darker, that's about-- I mean, higher and lower, but that's about it.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.600]   Are there any other application-- you can skim in other applications, too, right?
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.080]   You can-- well, sort of skimming.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.600]   Yeah, iPhoto does the sort of thing when you put in the events.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.840]   You can skim through all the photos in the events.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:09.160]   Events represent collections of images that were all taken on the same day.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.520]   So you're skimming through all the photos in the event?
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.320]   Yeah, once again, you would think that you're just looking at an icon,
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.400]   but what you are actually able to do once you touch it with the mouse pointer
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.200]   is skim through it.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.720]   It'll mini-slideshow.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.040]   Yeah, it's very slick.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:26.240]   Once you see it, I mean, it was clearly the moment at the press conference.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.120]   I mean, you heard the audible.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:33.240]   And being able to just simply-- for grabbing clips, being able to skim through,
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.520]   and then you just click and drag and grab that part of the video that you need
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.880]   and drag it up there, it's just-- it's crazy fast.
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:40.640]   You know, I mean, it just--
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.320]   It's awesome, Julie, it's a really great thing.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.760]   By the way, the format you were talking about with the new Panasonic camera
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.880]   is an H.264 AVC codec.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.400]   Ooh.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.520]   It's called the AVC HD codec.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.920]   It's 1440 by 1080, which is pretty much what HDV is as well.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.040]   You think of it as 1920 by 1080, but really--
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.800]   Well, it's compact than MPEG.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:04.880]   It'll be smaller than the MPEG-2 format, which is what the HDV is based on.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.560]   Whether the actual video quality is higher or lower, you know, I haven't gotten to test it yet.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.040]   So that's completely dependent on implementation, right?
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.960]   Because H.264 could look-- could be high def or it can be lousy.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.920]   Well, it just depends on how high they turn that.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.440]   And a lot of times they're trying to fit it onto that little card.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:26.040]   And I think that the bandwidth, I believe, is about 1.5 megabytes per second,
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:32.480]   which is a fair bit less than-- I think we're looking at 33.5 megabytes per second for MPEG-2.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:38.360]   Now, it being just smaller doesn't mean anything because H.264 is a lot more efficient than MPEG-2.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.840]   So it could be equal or close.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.880]   It's kind of hard to tell until I actually get my hands on one.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.880]   But it is-- these cameras look really promising.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:54.280]   I have to admit that my-- I'm really looking at buying some kind of solid-state camera soon
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:58.520]   just because I have-- I love my HD-20, but I hate the tape drive.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.880]   You know, I just--
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.920]   They have real time.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.280]   It's just--
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:01.720]   It really is.
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.200]   They're selling these things at Apple.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:04.800]   Sorry.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.240]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:05.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:05.960]   Go ahead.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.640]   I was just saying because I've been knuelling with this for the past 10 minutes now.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.400]   I took it out for a spin a few days ago.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:18.680]   And it really is-- I'm about to repeat a line that one of my gun-toting friends once used
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:19.800]   and it terrifies me.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.680]   It's the sort of thing that really makes you want to shoot something.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:23.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.160]   It fits so well.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:25.880]   It's lightweight.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.000]   It's not a hassle.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.480]   You don't feel that-- you don't feel so you have to really baby it because it is all solid-state.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.480]   What's the list of price?
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.880]   What-- how much they selling it for?
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.640]   It runs about-- I think the street price.
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:40.000]   I think the list price is about $1,100 or so.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.960]   And the street price looks to be $8,900.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.080]   That's not bad.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.600]   They were really pimping these things hard at the press conference leave.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.320]   I was surprised.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.520]   They had them everywhere.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.800]   It's one chip, right?
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:58.880]   If you want-- you can spend $1,700 street price to get the 3CCD model.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.680]   Ooh, same form factor?
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.080]   Yeah, same everything.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:06.840]   So I'm looking on Amazon in the-- well, wait a minute.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:10.080]   This says 3CCD, $565 on Amazon.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.680]   That's the HTC DX1.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.000]   Oh, no.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.720]   You're looking at the SD5, aren't you?
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.040]   What's the model number on this?
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.480]   I can't remember it.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.000]   We've already used more model numbers in--
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:22.520]   I know.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.680]   --and configs in this.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.320]   We've used up our allotment factor.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:31.440]   The HTC SD5 AVCHD 3CCD flash memory high definition
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.080]   camcorder of 10-inch obstacle image stabilization
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.600]   is $9.99 on Amazon pre-order.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.960]   Or you think some naughty words that we have to spell for you.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.720]   But mommy and daddy will tell you what we're really talking about.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:45.400]   And then if you want the single CCD,
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.520]   click here to see the price.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.840]   It is $7.99.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.640]   So for 200 bucks more, you get three CCDs.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.000]   Would you recommend going that way?
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.400]   Always.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.000]   Three's always better than one.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.720]   Plus, it's a black body versus a silver body.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.000]   It's a grain issue.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.440]   Oh, I like grain.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.720]   Yeah, if you like grain, then stick with the one chip.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.960]   It does add that kind of--
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.560]   I shot it on a really camera kind of look.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.560]   Interesting.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.400]   Interesting.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.400]   I believe that both of these-- and I'm trying to find it right now.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.720]   I'm very quickly trying to go.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:20.240]   I believe they all have HDMI output as well.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.320]   Now, we've talked about this before in order for that to be useful.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.920]   You'd have to be able to--
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:25.420]   Oh, no.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.080]   So they have HDMI output.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.400]   Well, here's the thing about this with these cameras.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.200]   This is one of the reasons we got into the HP 20.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.680]   This is the Canon.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.640]   Is because the HDMI output coming out of the camera
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.040]   is actually pre-compression.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:45.040]   So you're getting the raw video that's coming off the chip.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.080]   It's at 4.22, so it's not completely--
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.760]   So on something like this, particularly,
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.080]   it would be useful since it has to compress a lot to put that--
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.720]   So if you're on the road and you just need to shoot something,
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.720]   well, you shoot it on the memory card, and it's going to be compressed.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:02.040]   But if you're in a studio environment, and you want to shoot your little set,
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.800]   and you want to have more quality,
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.920]   and this really comes down to especially when you want to color correct.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.640]   So you want to play with the colors.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.960]   You want to play with some of those pieces.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.080]   Having more data there really helps.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.800]   Now, the difference is that your HDV--
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:20.600]   your AVC HD format, the one that's going to the draw--
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:25.080]   or going to the little memory card is 1.5 megabytes a second.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.440]   It's about 90 megabytes a second coming out of that little HDMI.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.000]   So you'll need a fast drive or--
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.960]   How do you record the HDMI?
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.040]   Is there a converter?
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:33.920]   A firewire?
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.200]   You need to buy-- you need to buy-- this is when you're getting serious.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:42.000]   So you're going to need to buy-- you spend $250 on a Blackmagic Intensity
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:42.840]   Card.
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:46.680]   And the Blackmagic Intensity Card will take that HDMI in.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:51.720]   And now, the next thing you need is a drive that's fast enough to capture 90
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.280]   megabytes a second.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:57.160]   So then you're going to buy a RAID or you're going to RAID your internal drives
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.400]   on your Mac Pro, which you can do.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:03.120]   The 3CCD sounds like a good deal for $200 more.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:03.920]   It's $1,000.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.320]   I think Merlin Mann's going to kick himself,
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.560]   because this is basically the same price as the HP 20 was.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.320]   And it wasn't available.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:14.880]   When Merlin and I both made the decision to buy the HP 20s when
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.800]   this stuff wasn't available.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.280]   These are brand new cameras.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.800]   Now, he's very exciting.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.320]   It's an hour on a 4Gig card.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.240]   So it does eat a lot of--
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.040]   but it's still 4Gigs one hour.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:30.320]   That means it's-- that's a lot of bandwidth it's using on.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:34.040]   What's exciting about that, though, is the faster than real time capture,
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:34.560]   as well.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.880]   Because one of the problems is that you get an hour--
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.400]   Right.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.520]   digitize it.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:43.440]   For gigs, I can-- on a good card reader, I can pull that 4 gigabytes off
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.920]   in a couple of minutes.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.160]   You know, and clear it.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.280]   So five minutes or 10 minutes, I can pull that off that card.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.000]   And that's exciting.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Because otherwise, you're shooting for an hour.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.120]   And then you have to capture for an hour to bring it back in.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.680]   And this gets back into what I'm looking at this camera for.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.240]   What I'm looking at these solid state cameras for is I'm really
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.400]   looking at Macworld Expo right now.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.720]   And so I'm looking at I can go capture all these interviews
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.000]   and all the stuff that we do.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.080]   Then we can pull it off the drive really, really fast.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.000]   Throw it into iMovie, cut everything together,
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.720]   and boom, we're done.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.640]   You know, or at an Apple event or at a news event,
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.440]   anything we want to do quickly, these look really exciting.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.240]   According to Amazon, it's this 3CC version, which
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:29.600]   sounds like the one to get, will be available September 15.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.520]   I just ordered it.
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.920]   I did too.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.600]   It was erased to see you get it first.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.440]   It will soon.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.920]   I mean, that's-- and it's pretty small, right?
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.560]   I mean, it fits in the palm of your hand.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.600]   Andy, what's the form factor feel like?
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.360]   Does it feel pretty usable?
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.120]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.200]   It's just about as big as it needs to be.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.360]   If you--
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.360]   I keep--
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.200]   I'm not going to--
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:52.720]   I'm saying this.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.760]   Oftentimes you have the stuff where like, OK,
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.000]   this would be nice if there weren't this big, huge cube
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   that was coming off the side.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.520]   I'm going to waste it all the time, but she doesn't buy it.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.640]   I don't know why not.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.800]   Oh, that was just not--
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.600]   I was beneath you.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.880]   I'm so sorry.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.680]   I couldn't resist.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.680]   I tried, and I tried, but I just couldn't resist.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.440]   And you know how kind I was to sort of pretend
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.680]   that I didn't know what you're talking about?
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:11.960]   So that you could say, oh, no, nothing.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.800]   I didn't say anything.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.480]   I said nothing.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.680]   What are you talking about?
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.280]   I meant the camera.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.040]   Oh, OK.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.360]   Just about as big as it needs to be.
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.000]   So because it doesn't have to put tape in there,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   it doesn't have to put--
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:24.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.960]   There's no moving parts.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:30.000]   It's like a metal tube that's about two, maybe three inches
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   in diameter.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.640]   It's only about like four or five inches long.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.120]   It's squared off at the bottom, so it doesn't roll off
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.720]   at the table when you set it down.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:42.560]   The only thing that I wish it had was a little bit--
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.840]   in my hand, I find that the Zoom in and Zoom out feature
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.280]   button is a little bit too forward on the body.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.280]   I have to sort of manipulate my hand to get to it.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.320]   But then again, if you have any class whatsoever,
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.000]   you're not supposed to really use the Zoom feature,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.480]   so no great loss.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.720]   But yeah, no, it was a lot--
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.280]   again, I only had it out for a couple hours
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.360]   a couple of days ago, but it was a lot of fun to shoot.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.800]   It's the sort of thing where it doesn't--
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.360]   I've tested out so many different camcorders.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.240]   And even though I'll drive up to Vermont with the intention of,
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.600]   well, here is its autumn.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.920]   There's going to be all these wonderful things to shoot,
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.000]   all these wonderful leaves and that sort of thing.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.680]   And I'm there to really test out this camera,
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.040]   but it's just no fun to keep holding it out
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:19.880]   and powering it up.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.080]   That's the real problem, I think.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.120]   You don't want to shoot video as a tourist or as a--
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.840]   somebody who's not a pro, it's just a pain.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.440]   But somebody like Justine or Alex,
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.520]   this sounds like a really pretty cool thing.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.680]   Oh, no, no, no, that's a good thing.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:33.680]   That's a good one.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.600]   Yeah, all I was saying was that this is the sort of thing
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.480]   where it's just not a hassle to carry it around.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.000]   You don't mind blowing it up.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.520]   Well, yeah, yeah.
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.840]   In the shape.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.320]   And one of the things we've been playing with
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.040]   is using things like the--
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.680]   you take these little cameras and the lens elements
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.000]   are the thing that you have the biggest complaint about.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.560]   Because as Scott will test to, the glasses, everything.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.880]   So we can talk about all these cool little cameras.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.440]   But the glasses, really, what makes a difference
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.200]   in most of these cameras have cheap little glass.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.520]   And so one of the things-- we're going
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.040]   to be actually using it on the lab next month
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:07.760]   is the RedRock Micro, little lens adapters.
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.600]   So you can actually put these little lens adapters
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.840]   onto the front of these little cameras.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.840]   And then you can put real lenses on the front of the cameras.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.520]   And I know it sounds crazy.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.360]   But you end up with these--
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.280]   By the way, this one does come with a Leica lens, though.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.680]   It's pretty nice lens.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.200]   It's good.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.840]   It's nothing like having a-- but literally,
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.960]   you can get a lens adapter that can take all your cool,
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.280]   Canon lenses and just lock them on.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.360]   Well, of course, I better have one of those then.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.040]   What?
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.880]   You have to have one of those, yeah.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.000]   Any further thoughts on the new iLife or iWork
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.160]   before we move on?
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.680]   This one is great.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.720]   I've been playing a lot with the new keynote.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.800]   And I'm very impressed.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.160]   I can't wait to get my hands on that.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.920]   I mean, the big thing that I think I--
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.360]   we sent some emails back and forth.
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.800]   But there's a couple of things.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.000]   One is the keynote when you look at--
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.880]   they have an intro that comes with it.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.560]   And when I realized that that was a keynote project,
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.760]   I hit escape and started cutting through it.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:05.040]   And it's like a master's course on how to use keynote.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:08.680]   Because I mean, it's just really, really well done.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.560]   The other thing is, is that with GarageBand,
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:14.040]   I'm really hoping that Apple opens up some kind of development
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:19.760]   pipe or development path for the Magic GarageBand.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.760]   I don't know if you've got to play them at all.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.880]   You can create your own Magic GarageBand templates.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:28.880]   If you can imagine, if I wanted to--
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.080]   what if I knew how to play an instrument, which
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.440]   I don't really-- other than the didgeridoo?
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.760]   I could play along.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.080]   I could make my instrument there and play along.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:37.880]   No, you should do that.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.400]   And then make--
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.160]   That didgeridoo could be a front--
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:40.760]   right up front.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:41.260]   Exactly.
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.400]   I could put it in there.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.360]   But the idea is I could play more guitar riffs,
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.480]   or more drum beats, or more whatever,
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.920]   and sell those as an add-on that would make
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:55.280]   the instruments much deeper inside of the given genres
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.240]   that they've already provided.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.920]   But then I could also add genres.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:02.400]   Maybe I want Indian or Japanese or African or electronica,
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.840]   or all these other genres that people
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:09.200]   could add, people like Apple, Bandmate Loops or whatever,
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.680]   the guys that make all these loops that work with all the stuff.
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.080]   What if they started building much, much larger ones?
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:17.880]   If people really got into that, it would be quite a little
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:18.360]   industry.
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.920]   And you really could put together something that sounded
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.920]   relatively original, because there'd
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.640]   be so many different options available.
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.640]   I showed my son the Magic GarageBand.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.800]   He's actually in the studio now, recording his first CD,
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.880]   13-year-old guitar player.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.440]   He loved the idea.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.760]   He actually said, cool.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.840]   He thought it was really cool.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.920]   Start playing with it immediately.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.440]   And of course, you can customize it right away.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.880]   And even save those out.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.800]   So in a way, you could make one that's
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.200]   customized somewhat and save it out.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.720]   I'm just happy that you can finally
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.960]   send an MP3 directly from GarageBand.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.400]   They can.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.040]   Oh, that's going to be amazing.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.200]   I mean, it's the simplest little stupid thing.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.520]   And I'm like, oh, wow, cool.
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.600]   Well, they never had MP3 built in, right?
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.680]   No, you'd have to go to iTunes and then convert.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.760]   And it was a pain in the butt.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:02.560]   Now you can do it.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.280]   I mean, here's the funny thing.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.240]   You buy something like Pro Tools.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.320]   You have to pay extra to be able to convert to MP3 out of
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:09.840]   Pro Tools.
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:10.960]   They want to spend the three bucks to
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.840]   Fraunhofer Corporation.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.960]   Well, it's like-- but it's more like, you know, 39 bucks.
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.120]   Oh, wow, very much.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.520]   OK.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.720]   Justin, what would you use this for?
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:22.560]   The GarageBand?
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.760]   No, the MP3 output.
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.400]   You sounded excited about it.
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.280]   No, I am, because usually I would just create like simple
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:33.960]   loops and then have to export it into iTunes and then save
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:34.560]   it in MP3.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.520]   And that's quite a hassle, whereas you could just create
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:37.520]   something very simple.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.000]   And that's it?
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:39.520]   Just that's it.
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.320]   I thought maybe you had a secret career as a recording
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.760]   artist that you've been looking at.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.520]   GarageBand songs there.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.840]   No, but we used to make like podcasts and stuff like that.
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.480]   So it's just so much easier to start.
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.560]   You can make a podcast now straight to MP3.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.720]   Of course, that's a good reason.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.960]   I also think that when you start looking at between
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.680]   the time movie and GarageBand, these exports to YouTube,
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:00.040]   exports to--
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:03.280]   You know, you're really looking at the slowly closing gap
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:06.800]   between the creator and the distribution that should make
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.640]   Hollywood very, very scared.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.000]   Yeah, that's scary.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.680]   Well, they actually saw YouTube videos they wouldn't be.
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.640]   Yeah, well, we did exactly.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.760]   We thought that that would be the case for the original
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:18.000]   GarageBand where it had an export right away to iTunes.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.960]   And we just kept waiting for Apple to turn on the feature,
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.480]   now, you know, sell it on iTunes.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.640]   They never did.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.680]   I think the big problem is dealing with individuals as far as--
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:27.400]   I think they don't want to--
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.000]   The cash flow issue.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.400]   They don't want to write a $100,000 checks for $20.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.480]   Is there a-- I mean, I guess, E-Music or somebody's
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.080]   a clearing house?
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.400]   CD now is a clearing house for that.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:35.920]   CD Baby.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.440]   CD Baby, that's it.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.520]   There's a couple up.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.200]   There's two or three of them right now that are clearing
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.720]   houses for that type of thing.
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.280]   And there's a lot of bands that are starting to pick up speed.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.960]   I mean, one of the things we were talking about on this week
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.640]   in media was the fact that a lot of bands now are starting
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:50.760]   to give away their--
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.760]   there's bands that are experimenting with the idea
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.560]   that I'm going to give away my music and make all my money
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:55.280]   on concerts.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.680]   Well, they've always been doing that.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:57.640]   They just didn't realize it.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.800]   They just didn't realize they could just give away all the music.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.040]   You know, they were like--
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:05.280]   when you look at Prince making $20 million on his tour,
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:11.480]   the income from the album becomes a secondary thing.
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:14.560]   Lights off the first iPhone game.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.040]   It's pretty clear Apple plans to sell games on the iPhone,
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.520]   just as they sell games right now on the iPod with video.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:21.800]   We see strings in the iPhone.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.400]   We see strings in iTunes.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.520]   But some clever hacker--
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:30.400]   actually, the folks who have done it are Lucas Newman
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.360]   and Adam Betts have created a standalone app.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:36.200]   Now, you have to do this whole jailbreak bit
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.360]   to get it in there, which I haven't had the nerve to do.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.200]   Has anyone hacked their iPhone yet?
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.000]   Here.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:41.880]   Anybody do that?
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.200]   See, I don't want to mess with it.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:43.960]   I don't need it there.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.080]   I don't make me cry.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:45.640]   Really tempted.
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:46.840]   I downloaded Lights off.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.600]   I came this close.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.240]   And I just couldn't bring myself to doing this.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:53.440]   I'm just going to say three words--
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:56.320]   Leo Apple TV.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.160]   Exactly.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:02.680]   I don't have to buy a new iPhone because it went wrong.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.280]   I did a bad, bad thing.
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.560]   I told a friend in Innocence without any ulterior
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.720]   motive about this awesome Nintendo emulator
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.960]   that he just found out about the iPhone.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.320]   And so, wow, how good is it?
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.480]   I said, well, I don't know because I'm
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.080]   going to solve it.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.320]   Oh, I have a cute song on my phone.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:20.200]   And I said, yes, Jeff, I could install it on your phone.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:22.120]   Why don't you lend it to me overnight?
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.480]   And I'll show you how it goes.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:24.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:27.680]   So I was able to install all the software and see how it went.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.640]   Although I'm with you guys.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.120]   I mean, the problem with--
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.120]   I've got the whole part.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:31.520]   So it worked?
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:32.600]   You did it to his phone.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.840]   It worked?
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:34.360]   And it worked.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.720]   I haven't tried this newest game.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.520]   But this is not going to be something
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.800]   that any casual user is going to be even remotely interested
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:46.200]   in because it is a really, really sticky, cut grass stuck
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.640]   and sand down your underpants difficult
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.360]   and itchy sort of proposition.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:54.360]   I'm a person who happily takes things apart and puts them
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.640]   back together again for God's sake.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:58.160]   Next week, tomorrow I take delivery
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.320]   of six identical cell phones so that I could abuse each one
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.640]   in a different way just to see which ones will survive.
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.640]   So I'm really not intimidated by this sort of thing.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.840]   But man, I just don't like the idea
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:12.000]   of doing all that root level stuff to an iPhone.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.240]   So let me-- I'll just read you the instructions, folks,
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.680]   so you can see if you feel up to this.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.200]   Installing third party applications
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   on your iPhone is not for the fate of heart.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.440]   For more in-depth instructions on iPhone modifications,
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.320]   look at the iPhone dev wiki.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.720]   Just that phrase alone is a little scary.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.200]   One, download iActivator and use it
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:32.440]   to quote perform jailbreak on your iPhone
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:35.000]   to allow access to the entire file system, which
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.960]   is necessary to upload applications.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:42.000]   Two, install SSH on your iPhone and follow the instructions
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.160]   to copy the application to your iPhone.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.520]   You may also need to run the command
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:49.680]   CHmod plus x quote applications slash lights off
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.720]   dot app slash lights off.
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.080]   Yeah, see, that's another big problem
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.120]   with these jailbreak apps because essentially you
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.520]   have to install software that by definition,
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.080]   you have to install software on your iPhone
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:04.360]   that allows external computers to access and take control
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.320]   of the device, which means that Apple might--
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:10.120]   I just have to disable it somehow.
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.440]   Yeah, well, it's interesting because Apple
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.160]   did go out and explicitly say when people
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.000]   start hacking the Apple TV, that no, we're not
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.600]   going to do anything to try to disable hacks on this device.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.640]   They haven't made any such promises on the iPhone.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:25.400]   I think that maybe they're using this as sort of an incubator
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:29.360]   just to see what the market is going to be,
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.800]   what the palletability is going to be for third party apps.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.320]   Well, AT&T probably has something to say about that hacking
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.320]   stuff going on.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.400]   Yeah, you think maybe there's something
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.120]   contractual about how Apple model--
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.880]   --how such and such to happen?
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.960]   Yeah, I'm going to guess that they have a lot at stake
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:46.560]   because if something goes hooey with your phone,
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:49.040]   they're going to get a million phone calls overnight.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:49.840]   And--
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.720]   I think the other thing they may be more worried about as well
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:54.520]   is you're already starting to see some people using being
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:57.800]   able to set up Skype calls from the phone
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.320]   that people starting to do--
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:51:59.840]   Well, there is.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.640]   There's already a website.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:04.080]   In fact, I tried to do that today,
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.680]   because that one didn't require any installation
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.200]   that you do on the--
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:11.240]   your surf via Safari to a website.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.120]   In fact, I'll give you the site because I actually
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:15.040]   just did it today.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.760]   And I tried to place a call.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:20.760]   What it looks like it's doing is using a third party
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.360]   to place the call.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:22.960]   So you have--
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:25.120]   That's not going to get you in any kind of trouble, I'm sure.
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.040]   You give it-- well, you give it a callback number,
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:30.240]   which is your iPhone's number.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.840]   You log into your--
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:33.440]   I'm a little nervous that I've done this now.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.600]   You log into your Skype account.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.200]   And so you're giving it your Skype
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.800]   login and password through this website.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.440]   And then--
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.440]   My name is Mrs. Kadifa from Nigeria.
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.440]   And then you give them your iPhone number.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:46.280]   I hope you make free phone calls.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:46.840]   I did this.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.480]   So look, if it backfires, it'll backfire on me.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:49.920]   And I'll let you know.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:52.720]   Neil, the report was arrested today for channeling money.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.120]   So here's what you do.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.800]   You log into your Skype account on this website.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:59.240]   Remember, it's on the iPhone, so it looks like it's an app.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.640]   And you give them your phone number.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:01.640]   And then you get--
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.080]   I mean, all of a sudden, you see all your Skype contacts
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.960]   and everything in there, just like it looks like Skype.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.200]   And then to place a call, you enter in the number.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.880]   And then it says, we'll call you back.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.440]   I waited and waited and waited.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.360]   Nothing ever happened.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.320]   So I don't know.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:15.760]   Oh, something happened, Leo.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.840]   Somehow it happened.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.880]   Your little Skype account's got a little calls from me.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.200]   Oh, you--
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:24.240]   The credit card transaction on that camcorder.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:27.160]   They didn't go through, did it.
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:28.600]   Have you seen me--
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.040]   I'm not sure.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.040]   I think it's a Mac Daddy world that they created some sort of hack
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.440]   to do two-way video conferencing?
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.640]   And it's so obscenely stupid looking at what you have to do.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:39.200]   It is.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.880]   I'm like, you know, at what point in time do these people
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:44.640]   stop to think about what they're actually doing?
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:47.640]   Well, if you stand on your left foot in the middle of Niagara
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:51.000]   Falls on the third Thursday of the month at 5.03 AM
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.080]   and scratch your head, you'll be able to do this.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.280]   Yeah, but I mean, we're looking at what's--
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.080]   People are saying that sort of thing about the right brother's
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:57.520]   like three weeks after their first flight.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:58.520]   That's right.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.320]   60 days later without any support or encouragement
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.520]   from Apple, they're doing some incredible things on this thing.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:06.920]   I mean, imagine when Daddy gives him permission, finally,
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:07.640]   to go to the--
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.000]   Daddy actually gives him the keys to the car
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.800]   instead of having to sneak out with it.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.640]   Oh, man, just--
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:14.640]   I guess that's why I haven't--
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.040]   I think I'd voice it.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:18.440]   We'll be glorious.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.800]   It is a good day to hack.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.640]   I guess that's why I haven't put all this stuff on here,
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.560]   because I just keep thinking any day now,
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.080]   Apple's going to open this up.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.880]   Well, I do have an immediate solution to this problem.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.840]   We should open up.
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.360]   We have MBW ideas.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.040]   We should have iPhone hack ideas where people could just
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.560]   send us their iPhones to play with.
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.880]   And then we'll put these hacks on and then we'll add it.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:44.760]   So, well, if you want to try it, it's skypforiPhone.com.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.680]   If you want to try it, and maybe I was a fool.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.960]   Have I been a fool?
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.400]   It would be my recommendation that you do not try it.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:51.900]   OK.
[00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:52.800]   I don't know if you've been a fool,
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.400]   but you have been reckless.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:57.760]   I have been reckless.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:59.360]   But I was so excited that I could do it.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:00.280]   That's your job.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:00.960]   Your job is to--
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.760]   Our job-- all of our options to be reckless
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.320]   so that our support is--
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:05.920]   I took a bullet for our audience.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.440]   So you give me your Skype name and password,
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.160]   and your phone number with area code.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:11.640]   You tell them what kind of Skype plan you have.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.240]   You give me your--
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.040]   You give me your--
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:14.880]   No, but you're where?
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:15.720]   Security number.
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.240]   And you're credit card.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.640]   Oh, I did it.
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:22.440]   I suddenly noticed that I had 5,000 minutes left,
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.920]   and then I had two, and then I had 6,000, and then I had two.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:29.320]   This was an AT&T delivered a 12 pound bill.
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:31.840]   Oh.
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.720]   Three chipped it.
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:35.760]   It's from Shape Services.
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.680]   It's trouble sometimes.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.880]   Oh, I just feel like, oh, I'm was stupid.
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:44.840]   All right, just for that, I'm going to hack my iPhone right now.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.160]   Just since I've already screwed the pooch,
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.280]   I might as well go all the way and buy a generator.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.760]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:52.600]   OK.
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:53.080]   All right.
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:54.600]   So they'll build it into a baseball hat.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.040]   I'm downloading the--
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:57.320]   Downloading iActivator, and we'll--
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:00.520]   I'll do this during the show while we're talking.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.000]   And I'll perform a jailbreak, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.320]   right here live on the radio.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:11.400]   Have you guys seen that Universal is releasing DRM-free?
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.320]   Yes.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:13.240]   Isn't that exciting?
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.560]   It's the beginning of the end.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.720]   No, they decided, didn't we talk about this last week?
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.920]   Did we not talk about this?
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:19.480]   I don't think--
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:21.000]   Well, we should talk about--
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.600]   I don't think you and I talk about it,
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:23.680]   but I don't think we talk about it.
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.960]   And we talked about it on Twitch.
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:28.440]   So what happened was EMI released their results,
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:29.760]   and it looked really good.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:33.960]   They sold considerably more on iTunes than they had before.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:37.680]   Dark side of the moon, so like 300% more sales.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.760]   Now, their overall revenue went down,
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.760]   because CD sales were so dropped so much.
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.360]   But I think Universal said, hmm, they worked for EMI.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.560]   Let's try it.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.160]   But you're right.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:49.280]   They're not doing it on iTunes.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.560]   Of course, remember, Universal's the one that
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.000]   went two months to month with Apple,
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.960]   so they're kind of have a tense relationship anyway.
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:57.800]   I think that I think they're trying to figure out
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:00.040]   how-- whether they can start to weaken iTunes
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.800]   by providing other more interesting outlets.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.040]   Well, they're right, because right now I
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:08.080]   could go to Rhapsody by Universal Music at 256 kilobits.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:11.160]   I mean, really high quality MP3s without any encoding.
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:13.200]   Now, they do put-- just in case you
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.600]   feel like you're then going to share it on the net,
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:16.760]   they do encode information into there, just as Apple's
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:19.680]   doing with the EMI stuff, so that it is yours.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.720]   But it's not protected.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.640]   So you can play it on your iPod.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.320]   And that's the thing.
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:26.520]   I can now buy iPod music on Rhapsody.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.280]   Is it Rhapsody that makes it available?
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:28.760]   Rhapsody is one of them.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.320]   They're a number of stores they're using.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:33.280]   I believe the Google also is helping them out
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:39.160]   with some of those pieces as well with their new G-box.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:41.520]   I have it right in front of me here.
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.360]   So there's a couple different outlets
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:44.360]   that they're going to try.
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.920]   But all of them-- I think there really
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.560]   is a push to try to see if they can undermine iTunes
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:49.480]   by doing this.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:51.160]   But I think that what it's really doing
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:54.080]   is undermining the interest in DRM at all.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:56.320]   Well, it's a really interesting thing, though.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:57.680]   Steve Jobs has stepped forward.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:00.600]   We don't want any copy protection.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.920]   But it's kind of interesting that these companies are saying,
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.200]   OK, Steve, but we're not going to sell it on iTunes.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.040]   We'll sell it on other stores, strengthen other stores,
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:10.560]   and strengthen our position, our negotiating position,
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:12.880]   with the number one digital store.
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:13.760]   That's very interesting.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:15.680]   That's actually credit to Universal
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:17.840]   for doing something smart.
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:20.560]   I think this is just a negotiation strategy myself.
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:22.120]   Well, it's a good one.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:22.920]   It is.
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:24.920]   And of course, there are ultimate goal
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.400]   is to force Apple into paying them for nothing,
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:29.480]   like they did in Canada, where they got--
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:32.440]   and with the Zoom, stuff like that, where, oh, you sold one
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:34.320]   of those, we get a check no matter what.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:34.880]   Right.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.880]   And I still think you get into this problem with people
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.960]   like me that just too much trouble.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.080]   You know, like, I just look at it,
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:42.000]   and I'm like, well, I'm still going to buy myself a iTunes.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.680]   And if it's not there, I'm not going to do it.
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.120]   Just don't want to deal with it.
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.240]   I don't want to deal with--
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.240]   That's the idea, too.
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:50.000]   And that's the issue that they're going to get into,
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.400]   is that a lot of people who are doing it--
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:52.320]   I don't think I'm the only one.
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:53.960]   You're the same way, Justine.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:56.960]   Yeah, if it's not on iTunes, then I just don't buy it.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:59.720]   And now it's very important, isn't it?
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:02.320]   And now I have to admit that I'm getting into a position where,
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:06.120]   if I can't-- if it's not from EMI, a lot of times, I go,
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:08.480]   well, maybe I'll get the-- maybe I'll go to, you know,
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.680]   and get the disk.
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:10.680]   [LAUGHS]
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:13.480]   I don't want to-- because now I'm kind of sensitive about the--
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:18.120]   I became much more sensitive to the DRM issue after the EMI--
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:22.200]   after I had the choice to get higher quality, not DRM-free.
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.200]   That's why I'm so curious to see how these--
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:26.640]   this DRM stripping really plays out,
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:28.560]   because my attitude has always been
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:32.600]   that if I am interested in more than three or four
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:35.240]   tracks on a CD, I want to go down to Amazon,
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.280]   and I'm going to order the CD.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:39.120]   I mean, just last night, I was on iTunes.
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:42.680]   I was buying, like, about $20, $30 with the tracks.
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:46.520]   And I found so many songs on the Sam Co-comp Best of CD
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:48.520]   that I actually couldn't contain myself.
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:50.720]   I actually drove down to the Forgot Sakes, the mall.
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.640]   Oh, you're weird.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:54.480]   The analog Amazon, I actually bought a physical--
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:55.000]   No.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.240]   --a candid money to a Pimply-based teen.
[00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:00.040]   So you wouldn't buy it on iTunes, why?
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.640]   Because, I mean, if-- and this is what I do for all CDs.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.560]   It's like, if I buy it on CD, it's uncompressed.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.400]   It's unlocked.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.680]   I have physical media.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.640]   So if I have a hard drive crash, I still can re-rip the CD.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.280]   I can re-rip it at any bit rate I actually want.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:14.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.080]   I mean, again, at a certain-- and also, there's also
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:20.960]   sort of a loftier, you know, crushed velvet suit sniffing
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.400]   a lily sort of pursuit, which is that this is the way
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.680]   that I get to listen to music that I'm not interested in.
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:28.360]   I'll get this-- the half dozen songs that I actually want.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.720]   But then I'll also get to listen to 11-- in this case,
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:34.080]   11 more songs that I would not have bought otherwise.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.000]   Well, you know, one thing about the any competitor,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.800]   whether it's a real live one or one that's
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.040]   just trying to negotiate with iTunes,
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.880]   the one thing that I read about the other day, which
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.920]   just shocked me, was the number of locations
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.640]   that sell iTunes gift cards.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.640]   Yeah, you can get them at, like, gas stations and roster stores.
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.800]   Are you ready for this?
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.240]   It's in the hundreds of thousands.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.360]   They ain't selling universal cards there.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.080]   They're selling iTunes cards there.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:08.160]   Ironically enough, the universal ones are actually quite limited.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:09.560]   Yes.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.560]   They're not universe.
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.760]   Get it? That's a semantic check.
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:15.800]   I can say, because it's universal and you can buy it at Rhapsody.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:17.280]   We'll dub in some laughter later on.
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:17.960]   Don't worry about it.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.360]   We can fix it on the post.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:25.400]   Any other stories before we get to our picks of the week?
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.400]   Going once, going twice?
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.560]   I'm ready with my pick.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.400]   Good to go.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.920]   The only thing I'll say, and this is like a 20-second thing,
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.880]   I really am impressed with--
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.520]   going back to iLife for one second--
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.240]   I really have to give props to pages.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.720]   It's the first time that it's actually
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.040]   been a useful tool.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.240]   I was using--
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.000]   I was testing out the word processor,
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.480]   just to test out the word processor.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.920]   And for God's sakes, it's been my main word processor.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.280]   Over the past three, four, five days.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.560]   It's slick, it's efficient.
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:53.080]   It doesn't do everything that word does, but it does enough.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.600]   Makes me kind of sad, because Nisys Pro just came out,
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.440]   and I really wanted-- I'm rooting for these guys.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.640]   I bought it.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.800]   But I have to say, I'll probably end up using pages.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.000]   Pages, rocks.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   It's really amazing.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.800]   It hasn't-- I worked in the biggest boon.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.680]   It used to be keynote and the free apps you get with keynote.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:12.720]   And now, it's actually a suite of three really solid businesses.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.000]   That's the big numbers seriously for anything yet.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.880]   I've been opening looking through Excel files with it.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:19.360]   There you go.
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.200]   And it worked seamlessly.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:25.400]   I fixed my best friends 14,000 record Excel-based,
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.560]   comic book database with it.
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.200]   And quite appropriately, because now you
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.800]   can embed the images of the comic book in there.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.000]   And I had to build how to file spectacular Spider-Man along
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.520]   with amazing Spider-Man.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.920]   Not knowing that that actually split
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.480]   remembering in '19 before he--
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:44.400]   So did it import it quickly and effectively before I get--
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.400]   Yep.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.000]   He was having problems with the old version.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.360]   The opening at an Excel--
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.880]   14,000 is huge.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:50.560]   It's huge.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.920]   And number is open to just fine, navigated through it,
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:53.800]   just fine.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:54.640]   Wow.
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.080]   How about you?
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.440]   What did you do with it, Scott?
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.800]   I imported four years with a stock data in an Excel sheet
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.800]   into numbers, and it was just boom.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:02.920]   Well, that doesn't take very long.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:03.400]   Wow.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.200]   Apple, watched it go up.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.040]   No, no, no.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.120]   I'm talking about lots of numbers.
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.320]   I'm talking about--
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.280]   Eight seconds for calculate the depth of your money crib
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.280]   is now 11 feet.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.360]   Of course, that really ribbed.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:17.840]   It's just because--
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:20.080]   How much would that be if that was only $100 bills
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.160]   instead of $1,000 bills?
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.840]   Wow, that would be--
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.400]   I'm talking about performance data.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.480]   Yes.
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.960]   So are you going to use--
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.560]   instead of Excel, you're going to use numbers for all of that?
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:35.280]   I happily, this morning, removed Microsoft Excel
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.400]   from all my computers.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.200]   So you're going to trust your nest egg to an--
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.440]   I happily removed word from all my computers
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:45.800]   when I got that thing, eight abby word or whatever.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:46.360]   Right.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.280]   And the reason being is they just--
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.920]   they run so slow under the Intel processors, they're like--
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.000]   I really thought--
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.560]   It's really nice to not have any Microsoft software.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.040]   Yeah, and that's the other thing.
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.800]   It's like, I love being a pure blood.
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:03:59.460]   Yeah.
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.480]   I always go with the best thing available.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.360]   I don't get any added joy out of it
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.440]   not being a Microsoft product.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.560]   You always have to put your money where the best solution is.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.680]   Well, I agree.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:09.960]   That's how Macintosh got its start.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:15.160]   And the good news is, though, we don't have to use Macs anymore.
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.280]   I mean, Microsoft anymore.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:17.880]   I don't know.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.880]   I never was comfortable with Microsoft Office on my Mac.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.560]   It seemed like the memory management from day one
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.200]   was different.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.320]   It was just more Microsofty.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:25.800]   I don't want to--
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:25.800]   I don't want to--
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.800]   I don't want to--
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.200]   One thing that I thought was interesting
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.000]   is there was an article in PC World about Apple
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.560]   beating Microsoft at its OpenX, XML game.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.160]   So that--
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.000]   Right.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.680]   The new Apple apps actually support the OpenXML
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:41.200]   before the Mac versions of Microsoft Office.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:44.400]   That's how it's set.
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:44.600]   All right.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.000]   Before we get to our software picks,
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.120]   let me get a book pick for you.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.520]   Of course, this program brought to you
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.280]   by the good folks at audible.com.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:54.480]   We are so happy to have them as a sponsor for the Twit Network.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.760]   Because we're Audible customers, we love Audible.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.960]   We listen to Audible books.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:02.600]   And just-- you know, I just finished Harry Potter.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.760]   And I just-- you know, I love audiobooks.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.760]   I think books like that, especially,
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.360]   just sound so much better when you're listening to them.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.320]   Audible has tens of thousands of books
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:14.920]   from every publisher under the sun read by the best readers.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.240]   They just sound fantastic.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.280]   They've got some great management tools for you,
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.440]   like My Next Listen, where you can automatically put books
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.120]   that you want to buy automatically
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.280]   with your subscription when the time comes.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.440]   There's also a wish list so you can keep track of books
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:30.880]   you want to read, but haven't gotten around to reading yet.
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:33.040]   And of course, all the books you've ever read on Audible
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.560]   are there available for download later.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.960]   I've got hundreds of them, and that's really a nice feature.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.520]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:43.240]   And by the way, right now, if you join Audible,
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.840]   you get a free credit for a free book.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:48.480]   If you go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:51.200]   And I think Andy Inaco has a book he'd like to recommend.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:55.520]   I mean, I still have the George De K. book on my list.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.440]   Could it be better?
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:01.160]   Uh, uh, uh, as an entertaining, but in a different way.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.600]   This is a book that I really, really enjoyed.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.000]   And even though it came at me by real surprise,
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.280]   I bought it as cassettes like four or five years ago.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:13.440]   I grew up-- I wasn't the kid who was into the top 40 records.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.840]   I wasn't even the person who was into the, hey man,
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.440]   I go to the used record store, get all the really good European
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.240]   imports.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.840]   I was into comedy albums.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.960]   I was a guy who was looking for Stan Freeberg albums,
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.920]   who was looking for carpenters.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:28.280]   You know, I could tell you every stroke of a Bob Newhart
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.640]   routine to the word.
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:31.680]   And I really wish that there were still people making
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.120]   great, well-produced comedy records
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.440]   like the National Lampoon used to.
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:35.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:38.040]   So, uh--
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.920]   Or the Fire Sign Theater.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:40.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.440]   I mean, basically just 40 minutes of just straightforward
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.680]   performance start to finish.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:48.080]   And I had a really great blast from the past when I wound up
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:51.440]   buying Al Franken's You're Good Enough, You're Smart Enough,
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.600]   and Dog On It, People Like You.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.800]   This is obviously based on his Stuart Smolly character
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.080]   from like 10 years ago, Saturday Night Live.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.440]   When that was that, when he had the movie out and was really,
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.680]   really, really, pod for the character,
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.840]   he also came up with an actual book of daily affirmations.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:08.000]   I love that.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.840]   But this audio book is totally different.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.200]   This is-- it's a comedy album in which you're listening to
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:17.240]   Stuart Smolly in the studio trying to record his self-help
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.680]   visual-active, actualization record.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.080]   It's not going well.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:23.520]   And it's not going well because he's like, now, I'm a
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.480]   perfectionist, so I've decided that we have to use
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:31.160]   everything that we record.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.880]   We don't have to record everything I say, but if I
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.880]   otherwise, I'll be editing and I'll be rethinking myself,
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.760]   then you hear a voice from the control room.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.720]   So should I not have been recording that?
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:40.480]   What?
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.360]   I think about--
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.800]   You recorded that!
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.640]   And then there's silence.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.880]   That five seconds later.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.680]   I-- this is Stuart.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.880]   I had to take two weeks off from the recording.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.840]   We're now really, really, really--
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.000]   It is so funny.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.920]   It is so-- you know, it's funny that you recommend this
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.520]   because tomorrow on the giz was it's my pick as well.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.280]   I agree with you.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.280]   And I got it as a cassette as well.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.920]   And if you've-- you might have listened--
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.480]   By all the out Franken books are great.
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:07.200]   He reads lies and liars and he reads Rush Limbaugh's
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:07.840]   a big fat idiot.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:10.320]   He reads them all in his voice and it's hysterical.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.920]   The new O Franken factor also.
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:12.680]   But I agree with you.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.200]   Go back in time to Stuart Smallman.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:15.960]   Can I play a little bit?
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.280]   This is actually part of the piece you were talking about.
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:21.440]   It's so-- he is so good, so funny.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:24.080]   I would never finish it.
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:28.640]   So before I started, I made a tone vow to myself not to
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.000]   edit, no matter what.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.920]   That whatever I do would be good enough and it doesn't have
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:37.360]   to be perfect because I'm a human being and human beings
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.440]   are not perfect.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:39.240]   OK.
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:42.080]   So this tape will not be perfect.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.920]   And that's OK.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:48.360]   It will be perfect in its imperfection.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.600]   OK.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:53.160]   Before on the tape, I said the guided visualizations
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:56.680]   are powerful stuff and that I am not a licensed therapist
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:59.640]   and that I was afraid that I did not know what I was doing
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:03.160]   and that possibly I could harm someone.
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:06.360]   And I think that was thinking, thinking, and a form of
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.440]   beating myself.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.320]   Anyway, it's not long.
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:13.800]   It's 49 minutes, but it is very, very funny.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.520]   Oh my gosh.
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.360]   One of the funniest things I've ever heard.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:19.520]   Highly recommended.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.600]   Don't use your credit for that though because it's only
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.120]   $8.
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.120]   Use it for some else.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.400]   Any of the Al Franken books would be a great fix.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.440]   If you want to take advantage of this offer,
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:35.160]   go to audible.com/macbreak, A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/macbreak.
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:36.240]   We do thank them for their support.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.120]   And I agree with you, Andy.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:37.880]   Great pick.
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:38.880]   I love that.
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:39.720]   Love that.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:40.920]   Very funny.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:42.440]   Time for our software picks.
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.280]   Who wants to start?
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.000]   Let's see a show of hands.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:45.800]   Anybody?
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:46.560]   Anybody?
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:47.080]   I'm a burst.
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:47.960]   All right, Scott Borne.
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.160]   You said you had one?
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.200]   Go for it, dude.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.800]   It's actually a hardware pick, though.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:54.520]   OK.
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.480]   I have to preface this pick by saying that if you've
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.720]   had any experience with Bluetooth headsets,
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.480]   you know that there's a universal truth.
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.920]   And that is that they all suck.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.640]   But that having been said, there are some that
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.280]   suck least than others.
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.320]   And the one that sucks the very least
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:14.720]   is the new Bang and Olafson Air Set 2, which I picked up
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.240]   at the Apple Store over the weekend.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:20.480]   And if you want a really cool, sort of bored looking
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.320]   Bluetooth headset to go with your iPhone,
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.480]   and you don't mind spending more than half of the cost
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:26.760]   of the iPhone at $350.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.320]   This is the Bluetooth headset for you.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.080]   Has the best range of any of the Bluetooth headsets I've tried.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.680]   Has the most comfortable fitting, the best sound.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:39.760]   It's not exactly $350 worth, but it is cool.
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:40.800]   It's beautiful.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.440]   Right here only, I noticed.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.600]   It is right here only.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.600]   And there's no negotiation on that point now.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.920]   Do they make a left ear version?
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.200]   So you could buy both.
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.120]   I don't know.
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:49.880]   That would be cool.
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:51.200]   And you could sort of do mono some.
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.160]   You could spend 700 bucks on the--
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.280]   The thing is, I wrote about this on the blog.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.920]   I did sort of expect to hear the voice of God for $350.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:02.960]   And I didn't.
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:05.760]   You could have healed several sick children
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.320]   by spending this money in Africa, Scott.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.320]   I know.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:09.320]   But no.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.480]   Clean water for half of a--
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:10.960]   Half of a--
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.400]   --of a Chad, but no.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.720]   It is the best.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:17.160]   It's just only marginally better than the ones
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.760]   that are like $129 bucks.
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:21.440]   So unless you just want to have the best,
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.400]   you don't really need it.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.080]   But it's my pick because I want to have the best.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:24.580]   Yeah.
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.400]   I read your blog comment on it.
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.600]   It was very tempting, I have to say.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.280]   You know, I'm using--
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.840]   I can't remember the name now.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.840]   I'll have to find the name for you.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.440]   I've been waiting for this sure connector, of course.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.680]   And that's the one I'm going to get when it comes out.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:41.520]   The one that will not only be an adapter for the iPhone,
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.720]   but also have the mic built into it.
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:44.480]   And then you work with it.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.240]   I've got one of those that works really well.
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:47.800]   But not for the iPhone.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.840]   Yeah, you can pick it up at the Apple Store right now.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:50.680]   Oh, it's out.
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:51.180]   Yeah.
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:52.800]   And then you could plug your edomotics into it
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.720]   or your expensive shores.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.240]   Oh, I thought it wasn't going to be out yet.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:56.960]   I pre-ordered it.
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:57.520]   I didn't know that was--
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:00.400]   They have it sitting at the Apple Store on Stockton Street.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.360]   I'm running on it.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.920]   It's like 30 or 40 bucks.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.560]   That way you can use your good headphones.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.000]   Still have the microphone capability.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.120]   Does it also have the click to pause and the double click
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:11.920]   to move on?
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.640]   It has complete functionality of everything that you have.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.400]   The only bummer is you've got all these wires hanging around you.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.520]   Yeah, it's a little more wiring, isn't it?
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:20.680]   Yeah, it's kind of clugey.
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.480]   The only way to make it work was to do that.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.280]   But you're right.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.240]   I mean, I got a bunch of other nice headphones I want to use.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.520]   But when you don't want headphones,
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.600]   you just want to head sat, the bang and all of a sudden
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.120]   is pretty cool.
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.960]   And I will say that it is the closest to looking
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.120]   like a Borg I've ever come.
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.960]   I don't know why they put that laser pointer above your ear.
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:41.440]   But no.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.600]   Why do they do that?
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:46.000]   The bright blue light shining from the back of your head.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.120]   What is that supposed-- it makes you look really weird.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.040]   You're on.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.520]   I will do my pick.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.320]   I've been struggling with Firefox for so long on the Mac.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.160]   And Firefox 2, it's just been a little less powerful.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.760]   And so I'm really trying-- but there are features
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.800]   I really have come to need from Firefox extensions, things
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.120]   like the delicious extension and so forth.
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.720]   But I want to use Safari because I really feel like I'm
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:13.200]   on a Mac.
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.200]   I should be using Safari.
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.440]   And I have to say, it is faster than Firefox.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.320]   It really renders very quickly.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:22.720]   And Merlin mentioned one great extension, Puka.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.160]   In the past, it's one of Merlin's picks for Delicious.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:27.080]   And I've got a great little quick time script.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:30.240]   And I just press Control-D just as I did in Firefox.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.040]   And I'm able to post to Delicious.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.840]   So that kind of solved that for me.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.960]   But now I've got a plug-in for Safari that I just love.
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:39.800]   We haven't talked about Inquisitor.
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:40.760]   Have we recently?
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.200]   I don't think so.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:46.360]   This really might turn you into a Safari lover.
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.200]   Believe it or not.
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:47.960]   It's Inquisitor.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.040]   It's free.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:51.720]   It's a Safari add-on.
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:55.680]   It's InquisitorX.com, or if you can search for Inquisitor 3.
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.760]   Basically, it adds spotlight capabilities to that Google bar.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:02.320]   So as you start typing in the Google bar, Inquisitor will
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:05.680]   start giving you spotlight style search results.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.720]   Auto-completing as you type, including Amazon Flicker,
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:10.600]   MSN.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:13.080]   If you just hit Return, it'll go to the standard Google search,
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.440]   just like before.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.320]   But the auto-complete really adds some value to this,
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.880]   as you're typing.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:19.920]   It's absolutely free.
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.720]   It's from InquisitorX.com.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:24.840]   And if you do use Safari, highly recommend--
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.440]   and these are the same folks who do NewsFire, by the way,
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.880]   which is a great RSS reader.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.200]   And if you don't use Safari, this
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:36.080]   might be enough to get you back on a track with it.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.760]   I have to say, is anybody here using Safari?
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:39.160]   Are you all Firefox, guys?
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:40.160]   Firefox.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:40.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.400]   I don't even own Firefox.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:45.000]   Firefox, I find crashes a lot for me.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:45.480]   Or--
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:45.980]   You do.
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:46.640]   --speechballs.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:47.880]   You two, just need.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.040]   Every so often, yeah.
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.760]   But it's better than Safari for me, though.
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.160]   Well, and there's things that, for instance,
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.160]   like Google spreadsheets, you have to have Firebase.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:54.880]   It won't work in Safari.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:55.480]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:56.320]   And that kind of--
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.760]   I have to admit that I use Safari primarily for all
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:02.200]   of my RSS reader type stuff.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.880]   I've played RSS reader, yeah.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.480]   Yeah, so being able to stack 30 different ones together
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.360]   and have it part of my regular web browser
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:11.800]   and have my delicious tags in it,
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.920]   and all that other stuff, and having one place.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:15.400]   That's how I post.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.520]   I do all my delicious--
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:19.560]   all my research for Macbreak or Twint this week in India,
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.800]   or whatever, is all done in Safari.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.960]   And then I do a lot of stuff in Firefox, yeah.
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:24.480]   Right.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.440]   Take a look at Inquisitor.
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.440]   I think it's the kind of thing that makes you go, wow,
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.120]   I've got to go back to Safari.
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:32.400]   Free from Inquisitorx.com.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.920]   Andy, you have a pick for us today?
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.200]   Yes, and it's a dull one, but it's actually
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.480]   one of the most valuable ones.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.400]   It was-- recently, I realized that one of the best $30
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:46.640]   I ever spent was to upgrade from QuickTime to QuickTime Pro,
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:49.720]   because it's one of those tools that, once you have it lying
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.280]   around in your system folder, once all those hidden features
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:54.120]   of the free QuickTime get unlocked,
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:56.320]   you use it all the time.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.280]   That's true.
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:00.000]   Every time I record a podcast on my desktop,
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.880]   I don't use GarageBand because it's way overkill.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.880]   When QuickTime can record audio, it'll
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.640]   do it much, much faster, much, much more reliable.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.800]   Even simple editing, like just I want
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:12.160]   to delete all the "uhs" and delete all the "oh"
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.280]   Andy, you're such an idiot.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.240]   We're going to start all over again, all over again.
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:17.280]   It's easier to delete those things when you're just
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.640]   flocking it from a timeline and deleting it.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.440]   And then I use GarageBand just to clip all those things
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.400]   together.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:25.960]   Whenever I want to convert video into an iPod format into or to
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:29.600]   3G format on my phone, I use QuickTime Pro.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:33.040]   Over and over and over again, it's just that little thing
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:38.840]   that's inside your system now that will take a really, really
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:41.920]   hard and unmanageable problem and turn it into a very, very
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:46.200]   quick five second fix, whereas before, again, if I've just
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:51.320]   converted a DVD with handbrake and it's a DVD that I burned
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:54.480]   off my TV when I wanted to delete all the commercials, in
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.760]   iMovie, it's a long process and I've converted to the
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:58.600]   DVD format.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:01.000]   It's going to take up hundreds and hundreds of gigabytes.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.080]   QuickTime Pro, it's perfectly happy to just take this 500
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.400]   megabyte file and just let me clip out the commercials.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.360]   It's fast.
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.440]   It's efficient.
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:11.520]   And it doesn't eat up another 10 gigs of hard drive space.
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:14.960]   Again, you buy it for the 30 bucks.
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:17.760]   It's done and then you will surprise yourself at how often
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.920]   you'll wind up using it, especially if you do any
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.120]   business in media.
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:23.520]   I have to say, one of the compelling, one of the first
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:26.280]   reasons you would buy it for the full screen playback is now
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:26.840]   longer--
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:30.720]   no, move because Apple upgraded that capability so you can
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.400]   now get full screen playback.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.600]   The key is being able to edit your little videos.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:37.520]   I just want to cut this little bit out.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:40.640]   You can't do the trimming in the free version.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.320]   No, that's a nice feature.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.160]   Or even if it's a simple thing to taking two clips and making
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.400]   one big movie out of it without re-encoding the whole
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.480]   damn thing.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.640]   I'm so used to all these features because I've always
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:53.640]   just buy QuickTime Pro the minute the new version comes in.
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.400]   And I'm really spoiled because we have all these Pro apps
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.720]   and it automatically installs with all the Pro apps.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:00.000]   And so you always end up with QuickTime Pro and I'll go to
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.160]   some computer that doesn't have it.
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:04.040]   I'm like, how do you guys operate without QuickTime Pro?
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.920]   Like, what the--
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.600]   Hey, I should mention, by the way, was we get--
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.600]   thank you for your pick, Andy, as we go on with these picks
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:13.120]   that there are two websites, two now two websites that keep
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.360]   track of our Mac break weekly picks.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.440]   I want to thank Jerry Bredo.
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:21.440]   He started a new one called MBW Picks of the Week.com.
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:26.120]   And literally, it's got every episode with the picks and
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:27.200]   lots of notes.
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:33.360]   And then there's another one that's frankly quite beautiful.
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:36.000]   These guys are putting a lot of work into this stuff.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.760]   It's very, very nice of them to do this.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.080]   And this one comes from--
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:41.640]   who is it?
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:44.080]   I've got to get his name right because I want to give credit.
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.160]   Where credit is due.
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.520]   It's a Matthew Pocky.
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:52.120]   It's MBW Picks.com.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:56.200]   He doesn't put his name on here, but it's a beautiful--
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.360]   Paul Mason.
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:57.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:58.880]   Thank you, Paul.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:00.360]   Paul Mason did this.
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.120]   So a couple of places you can go,
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:06.880]   MBW Picks.com or MB Picks of the Week.com, if you want to
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:11.240]   get our picks, because we're too lazy to do it ourselves.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:12.120]   Who wanted to go next?
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:13.800]   I heard a voice.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:14.640]   Was that you, Alex?
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:15.960]   Did you want to go next?
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:16.920]   I have one.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.520]   By the way, while you were talking, I installed the
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.400]   Inquisitor, and it's fantastic.
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.600]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.800]   Suddenly, now I have something that I'm going to say, oh, I
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.240]   can't live without it.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:29.400]   In fact, I typed in Mac break week, and I got Mac break
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.200]   weekly show notes.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.200]   Isn't that great?
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.520]   Yeah, it's really, really, really useful.
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.760]   So I'm picking into the future.
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.320]   A pick from the future.
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.600]   I'm picking into the future, because I'm really excited
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.040]   about an application, and it's not available yet, but they
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:46.440]   have a website, so that's good enough for us right now.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.600]   I think that they're going to have a beta that's starting
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.880]   soon.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.200]   They're saying that they're having a beta soon.
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.280]   And this is called Pixel Mater.
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:55.560]   Have you guys seen this?
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:56.640]   Yes.
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:02.000]   Oh, if this-- you can't really tell until you actually play
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.160]   with it, and I haven't played with it yet, but it's
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:05.640]   PixelMater.com.
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:08.360]   I think it's open source, too, right?
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:09.360]   I don't think it's open source.
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:09.840]   Oh, it's not.
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:10.880]   But it's going to be free.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.000]   Or no.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   I don't think this is going to be free either.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:14.720]   I don't think so.
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.080]   And to be honest with you, I hope not.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.760]   I hope that they make some money on this.
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.640]   I hope they make a lot of money on this, because I really
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:21.160]   want this to progress.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:26.040]   Now, what this is, it's like a little Photoshop.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:30.720]   So it appears when you're looking at it, that it's been
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.160]   written completely--
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.320]   it looks like a Coco app.
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.480]   I mean, it doesn't look like it's--
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:39.120]   I don't think it's completely a Mac editor.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:43.160]   It is using a lot of the features and a lot of the--
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:46.520]   all the interface stuff that Apple gives you.
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:49.160]   But what you do is a lot of the stuff that you would normally
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:49.800]   do in Photoshop.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:52.880]   Now, I don't think that I'm going to be using this instead
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:54.680]   of Photoshop anytime soon.
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:56.960]   But I know that one of my big frustrations when
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.760]   we're doing stuff on the lab or when I'm doing stuff
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.360]   for Macbreak or other things like that
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:05.840]   is finding an application that is inexpensive enough for people
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:07.960]   to actually play with.
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:11.080]   And I think that this is more of an issue now,
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.840]   because Photoshop CS3 is now--
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:18.320]   they're using that really idiotic registration process
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:21.680]   that they were infected by from Macromedia.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.000]   Macromedia did this.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   And I literally stopped using their applications,
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.840]   because I was tired of--
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.760]   a computer would go down, and then I had to move it,
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:31.160]   and then I had to de-register something, and re-register it.
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:34.240]   And I was like, oh, and I just literally just stopped using.
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.160]   And that was the last time I used Flash was years ago.
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.880]   I was just like, I'm not going to do this anymore.
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:42.960]   And so now it's infected the entire CS3 lines.
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.720]   And I love CS3.
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.360]   It's a fantastic upgrade.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.840]   And the registration system is asinine.
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:49.520]   And so--
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:52.280]   It has an infected light remotely enough.
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:55.440]   Yeah, yeah, because they're not in the leadership position yet.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.920]   As soon as they're in the thing--
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:58.760]   but what they've done, though, here's the thing,
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:02.400]   is that casual piracy is gone.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:05.480]   People who just happen to get some--
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:09.880]   their friend had the installer and the serial number is gone.
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:12.960]   And what that does is it opens a gap for somebody else
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:13.480]   to move in.
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:17.720]   I mean, it's a really bad move on Adobe's part,
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:19.760]   because they're going to open stuff up for applications
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.240]   like this.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:23.080]   So these guys are the beneficiaries of that issue.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.600]   And it looks like a gorgeous app.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.080]   I don't know how much it's going to cost,
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.920]   but I bet you it won't be very expensive.
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:31.360]   And I think that people should go check it out.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.800]   And they should also-- if you were interested in beta,
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:35.600]   and you should go up there and tell them you want to beta.
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.120]   Have you been able to get a copy?
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.120]   I haven't got copy.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.920]   I filled out the form and everything.
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:42.640]   I don't think the beta starts until later this week,
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:43.320]   I think it's going to be.
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.400]   I just want to point out--
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.840]   I always get a little nervous when I see this beautiful
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:49.960]   presentation, but no code behind it.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:52.720]   That it's easy enough to do a great website.
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.480]   There is an open source core.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.560]   They're basing it on image magic, which is open source.
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:57.840]   So that's encouraging.
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.000]   And these two brothers, and they're
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.560]   very open about who they are, it's a London-based company.
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:07.280]   I agree with you.
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.400]   I've been watching this with great interest,
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.680]   waiting to see if it actually materializes,
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:13.880]   because it's just gorgeous.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:18.600]   It's a delicious generation product.
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:20.680]   If you know what that means, right?
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:21.200]   It's a what?
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:21.680]   It's a--
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:23.800]   The delicious generation.
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:27.440]   That's what they're calling the latest really beautiful Mac
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:30.600]   apps based on the delicious library, the success
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:31.440]   of the delicious library.
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.520]   And on spec, it looks fantastic.
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:36.920]   I just want to see a release version.
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:39.280]   I thought that meant that you looked at the apps while you're
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.600]   at the house of Brian and Eve.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.040]   Yeah, I know.
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:45.720]   Now, that's what they're calling all of these slick new apps.
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.720]   Because delicious library said, look,
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:51.360]   you don't have to have a brushed metal window.
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.880]   You can do something else, and have
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:55.240]   beautiful graphics and so forth.
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.000]   And this is very much in that style.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.040]   Yeah, it looks really cool.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:03.080]   So hopefully we'll have more to talk about that later.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:04.280]   I agree with you.
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:05.480]   Justine, you got to pick for us?
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:06.160]   Yes.
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:06.560]   I do.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.200]   I'm not sure if you guys have checked this out yet.
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:09.520]   It's Mailplane.
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:09.920]   No.
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:10.520]   You've seen it?
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:11.520]   Mailplane.
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:14.760]   Mailplane, M-A-L-P-L-A-N-E.
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:16.800]   It's mailplaneapp.com.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:19.840]   It's basically just a skin that you can wrap around Gmail.
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:22.000]   But it's good because I have multiple Gmail addresses,
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.320]   which most people do.
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:25.640]   So instead of having to log out, log back in,
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:28.680]   it'll have an account overview that you can just click
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:31.640]   from each account to each account,
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:33.360]   and it'll just show up in this window.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.400]   And you can also use shortcut keys,
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:37.080]   and it has different drag and drop,
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.640]   and you can just send pictures directly from it.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.880]   So it's really cool.
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:44.360]   And it also uses notification, too, which is great.
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.760]   And if you click on the notification,
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:48.960]   it'll take you right to the message where you can just reply.
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.600]   And it also has a built-in--
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:51.040]   So it's--
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:51.600]   --it's an app chat?
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:54.920]   It's a client for Gmail that runs on the Mac, kind of?
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.680]   Yes, it's still in beta, but I know there's
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:58.040]   some invites running around somewhere.
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:00.480]   But it's changed my life for email.
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:02.000]   It makes me want to reply to people.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.760]   Do you have to use it on the web?
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:05.280]   No, no.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:06.040]   It's a downloadable--
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:06.720]   You're downloading.
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:07.640]   OK.
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:11.800]   And no doubt it was developed by AT&T.
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:13.480]   It's probably was.
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:16.040]   So it's mailplaneapp.com.
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:16.560]   Yes.
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:17.720]   And I agree with you.
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:20.160]   It would be nice to customize and make more Mac-ish.
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:20.760]   Make Gmail more Mac-ish.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:21.480]   It is.
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:22.960]   Yeah, it's very Mac-ish.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.280]   And you have multiple Gmail accounts,
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.360]   so they all look different?
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:27.840]   Well, no, I mean, they each are the same.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:29.240]   It's just a different address, because all you
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:31.200]   use one for personal and the other for business.
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.440]   So it's great to have them, both there at the same time.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.040]   In one mailbox, I get it.
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:35.520]   I get it.
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.280]   So it's really cool.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:36.880]   Very cool.
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:40.520]   Mailplane for Mac OS X. That's a real find.
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:40.960]   It is.
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:41.520]   Very cool.
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.920]   And then the NOTCO.
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:44.960]   Would you send me an invite?
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:45.400]   Thank you.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:45.920]   I will.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:47.000]   Thank you.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.760]   Andy NOTCO.
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:51.560]   Well, I was looking around the other day,
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:52.840]   and I realized that was--
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:55.080]   This sounds like just the talk that I have is actually
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.200]   sending in the $30 for a quick time.
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:57.720]   Bro.
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:58.360]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:25:59.200]   You already did that.
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:25:59.720]   Stop it.
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:00.200]   Stop it.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:00.640]   Stop it.
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:01.000]   Stop it.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:01.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:05.000]   If I left anyone out, I think I haven't.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.080]   Just yourself, maybe.
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.000]   No, I did mine.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:07.720]   Inquisitor.
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.840]   So we're done.
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:10.520]   I forgot.
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:11.240]   I forgot.
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:11.880]   We're free.
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.040]   We had lost.
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.320]   Merlin Mann will be back next week with his picks
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:17.600]   or anti-picks.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.840]   And that was fun last week, by the way.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:20.960]   I like the anti-picks.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:22.160]   Yeah, we might do that.
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:25.160]   We might alternate that.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:26.800]   The lot of votes on other--
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:29.480]   in fact, somebody sent me an anti-pick.
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.440]   That was really good.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.080]   He said, oh, and I'll see if I can find it in my email.
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.120]   Because there isn't enough hatred in this world.
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:38.520]   We need to up anti.
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:40.840]   These are Mac apps we hate, Justine,
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.800]   that we wish we didn't have on our computer,
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:45.720]   that there's no reason for.
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.000]   Good news listeners, we found the address of the person who
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.720]   came up with that spreadsheet program we all hate.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.360]   He's going to be out of the house next week,
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:54.240]   so bring those for you.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:56.680]   Anyway, guys, hey, thanks so much for joining us, Justine.
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:59.400]   Go back to perusing your AT&T bill.
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:00.040]   I will.
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:01.840]   You can catch Justine in her great videos
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:05.320]   at tastyblogsnack.com and mommypackmylunch.com.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.720]   Anything else you want to plug in?
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:10.320]   Are you still doing the iJustine.tv?
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:13.200]   I am, of course, about month number three.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:15.880]   Oh my god, so you're on camera right now?
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:18.320]   I am, and everyone's wondering what I'm doing.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.160]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:22.440]   So it's justin.tv/iJustine.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:24.760]   Or you can check it out at iJustine.tv.
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:25.800]   Or just go there directly.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:26.800]   Either one.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:30.520]   I can't believe you haven't stopped.
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:33.480]   I can't believe it either, to be completely honest.
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:36.120]   I thought by now you long ago given it up.
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:37.000]   Oh, that's great.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.040]   That's great.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:39.680]   iJustine.tv.
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:43.800]   Andy Inaco is not on TV all the time.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:44.440]   Not all the time.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:46.720]   We're going to be on the CBS Morning show in a couple weeks
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.720]   doing horrible things to those cell phones I talked about.
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.000]   Oh, that'll be fun.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:50.720]   That should be fun.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:53.080]   It should be-- again, I'm not sure if it'll be anything useful.
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.480]   But it'll be great TV, and I'll get a free trip to New York
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:55.880]   out of it.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:56.880]   There you go.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:57.720]   Oh, well, win.
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:59.840]   You can catch Andy, of course, in the Chicago Sun
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:05.240]   Times and on his website, CWOB, the colossal waste of bandwidth.com,
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.200]   CWOB.com.
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:10.400]   Alex Lindsay is at the Pixel Core, where they are not only
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:13.520]   training the next generation of 3D and video and graphic artists,
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:17.320]   but getting them work as well and producing podcast
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:20.160]   after podcast at pixelcourt.tv.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.240]   You just did a swim.
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:22.440]   Is that the latest one?
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.200]   We did a swim over the weekend, and then we're
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:25.120]   doing another one tonight.
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.560]   And then I got the VFX show.
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.360]   The VFX show is--
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.760]   we're recording late at night as well.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.160]   And then we have a new one.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:36.440]   If you go to pixelcourt.tv, it's called Mac Break Tech.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:40.080]   And it's a much more geeky conversation.
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.600]   I'm not actually in it.
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.120]   So it's geekier than me.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:47.920]   So John Foster and Ben Durbin and Ken Giacado
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:48.800]   are kind of hubbing that.
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.880]   They have a couple other guys that are coming in for that.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.480]   But it is starting to build.
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:54.240]   I mean, it was funny.
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.480]   I thought it was too--
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:57.520]   I thought it was too niche to have any kind of--
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:00.160]   it was like, I was like, well, you guys can play with that.
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:01.840]   But I don't know how many people will listen.
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:04.440]   And I asked John the other day, and he was like, I think they
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:04.960]   were--
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:06.640]   I don't-- you never know what the numbers really mean.
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:09.160]   But it was in the tens of thousands.
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:11.880]   Well, there has been an episode since May, unless I'm wrong.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:13.640]   So you've got a new one coming out.
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:14.840]   No, no, no.
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:15.920]   They're coming out.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.520]   There was a little bit of a break over the summer.
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.440]   But they just put another one out last week.
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:19.920]   OK.
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:21.440]   Well, it's not on pixelcourt.tv.
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:25.160]   So you must immediately update pixelcourt.tv.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.880]   But it's a fun new one.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:29.560]   And definitely worth checking out.
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.320]   You can also just go up to iTunes and search for it.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:32.520]   Mac Break Tech.
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:34.600]   For the hardcore Mac cats.
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:35.600]   Exactly.
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:38.920]   Scott Boren continues with the Apple Phone Show at applephoneshow.com.
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:40.640]   And there's plenty to talk about.
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:42.040]   Still, you know what I chickened out?
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:43.200]   I didn't upgrade my iPhone.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:44.520]   When I saw what I had to do--
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:45.040]   Good.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.040]   I said--
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:46.760]   Feel better for you.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:48.080]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:51.960]   By the way, we want folks to stop by because there's a few weeks left.
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:53.640]   You have a chance to win an iPhone.
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:55.840]   All the details are on the blog.
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:56.520]   So get in there.
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:57.280]   Last chance.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:59.680]   Last few weeks to get in there.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:03.720]   And I think that wraps up at this particular episode of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:05.920]   We'll see you again next week.
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:07.560]   Another Mac Break is broke.
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:10.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:14.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:17.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:20.020]   (upbeat music)
