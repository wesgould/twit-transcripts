[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly Andy, Alex and Jason are here. Jason's back from his
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.440]   Adventures in New Zealand with stories to tell. Apple has a big announcement.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:17.840]   Yellow. We'll talk about that. We'll also talk about a new free program that Alex says he loves.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.280]   The story of the untitled Goose Game. And then, of course, the rumors. There are lots of them.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.320]   We'll cover them all and give you our predictions for what will happen in the next few months.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.840]   Next, on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.880]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we talk about the latest news from Apple. But before we
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:51.360]   begin, this is just in a special express package from London, England.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.880]   I wonder what the customs declaration is.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.760]   You say it is. Yes.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.080]   medical prosthetic. It says gift bag.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:16.320]   That's from James. Long time listener. He says, "For everyone, it is this. I have one for each of you."
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.760]   So we'll forward those along. This is Johnny Ives, Red Nose. We talked about it a few weeks
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.960]   ago designed for Red Nose Day, March 17th. It snaps on. I thought we could do the whole show like this.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.880]   It isn't, I have to say, not the best Red Nose I've ever had. Clever design.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:48.080]   But I think the foam ones are better, to be honest with you. This is, but you know,
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.640]   what the hell? Inside there's a scared for a surprise. So Red Nose Day is actually an important
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.520]   charitable day, which is funny because it's comic relief. And I believe it was started in the US,
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:07.360]   but it has become a bigger thing in the UK for some reason. But if you go to comicrelief.com/rednoseday,
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.000]   you can find out all about it. Get your Red Nose. Donate if you wish. Everybody here wearing their
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.080]   Red Nose. Thank you, James. Now, let's see. Will we have time to get this to you? We're gonna have
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.840]   to FedEx these out to get because Red Nose Day is 10 days off. We're gonna have to get these to you
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:39.840]   quick. Customs says it's a gift bag. Hello, Jason Snell, sixcolors.com. Welcome back from Kiwi Land.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.480]   You know, a panelist is never earlier late. He arrives exactly when he intended to.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.400]   I left you as Jason the Gray, but I return as Jason the White. I don't know. One does not simply
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.800]   walk into Macbreak Weekly. I'm out of joke now. You shall not pass. Where's your staff? Your
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.880]   wizard's staff. It's true. I left it in the other room, but it is. You know, I yes, I was in New
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.200]   Zealand, the land of Lord of the Rings, and they won't let you forget it. Did you see Hobbiton?
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:15.440]   We drove past Mount Doom. We went to Hobbiton. We did. There's the volcano that is that is
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.560]   and you look at and you're like, oh, that's it. It's very cylindrical. We drove past Mount Doom.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.600]   We went to Hobbiton and let's see what else do we do. Oh, we went to the Weddle Workshop in Wellington,
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.880]   which Peter Jackson's got all of his props. Yeah, we did the Weddle Cave, which is just in like a
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.760]   suburb in Wellington. It's adorable. Then we had a you went to a cafe afterward and you know, had a
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.040]   had a tea and a meat pie as you do in the New Zealand cafe. It was great. Awesome. Two weeks
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.480]   well spent could have spent three, four, five weeks. So you did you know you did a walk about
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.560]   except you drove about instead of walking, but you did about 1500 miles. They're big islands. I
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.800]   mean, it's there's a lot of there's a lot of driving to be done. There's a lot of sites to be seen.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.760]   You did both is correct. Say both. North and South Islands. Yeah. Yeah, we yeah, I'd say South
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.680]   Island is more spectacular, but and you know, but it's way down there. Like there's not much
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.840]   other than the southern tip of South America. Yeah, we spent three days in Queenstown and we went
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.000]   to Milford Sound and and had to took a Queenstown beer tour, which you know, if you ever take any
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.280]   wine tasting kind of tour, it's like that for beer. So you can't stand up anymore. Yeah, actually,
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.480]   that's really good. That sounds delicious. And let me tell you, I like the idea of taking a
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.440]   plane somewhere where it's summer instead of winter. I know. I know it's freezing here. So you
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.040]   actually missed our California. Yeah, we missed about five inches of rain. I don't mind. Yeah,
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.880]   and a lot of snow in the hills. Anyway, welcome back. It's great to have you. Thank you. Good to be
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.360]   here. What happened? Yeah, nothing. We had that's a funny thing is nothing. We had good replacements.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.760]   Marco Armand was on last week, which was a lot of fun of course, Dan Moore in the week before that.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.280]   So awesome. But nobody, nobody matches the snow. So thank you for coming home.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.520]   Thank you. You shall not pass there. Thanks. Thank you. Yeah, you got it all in.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.280]   And please don't call me Shirley. Oh, no, that's another movie. And there's Andy and I
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:12.000]   go believe it or not from GBH in Boston. Hello, Andrew. We've we've had first podcast. What about
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   second podcast? Second podcast. I like that. That's like, give me exactly what I had to cover.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.440]   On the West Coast, technically, Mac Brig Weekly is 11. Yes, there are 11.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.120]   I don't know if they know about second podcast. Yes. All it's all one large, long podcast to
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.960]   Mr. Alex Lindsey of office hours dot hello, hello, Alex. Alex, you sent us some great
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.000]   wonderful mid journey images from last week. And you're doing it for every show. And I just,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.800]   they're fun. They're good. I love what they're fun. Yeah. Do we use it last week, John Ashley?
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.880]   Yeah. Oh, God. Yes, he says.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:53.520]   Oh, there it is. The warm apple bath. It exudes, you know, comfiness, you know, like,
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.240]   it was perfect. Yeah. Alex is nice because he sends us four and we get to pick.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.600]   And then John Ashley picked that one. It was very, yeah, those are.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.840]   Personally, it doesn't top one of the ones he sent for last week's Twitter with the fetch.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.120]   The fetch happens. Yeah. Those are good too. I love those too.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.880]   Well, it's not a requirement, but we sure appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.200]   Yeah. It's really fun. Yeah, it's really fun.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.640]   Gosh, there are some stories, but mostly rumors. I hate to say it.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.920]   Do you leave? So here's a question, Jason. Long time journalist. Do you lead with a rumor?
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.640]   Or you lead with the news? No, I think the big breaking news of this week is that Apple has
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:38.720]   discovered a new color. They have called it yellow. Oh, yellow. Is that a rumor or is that real?
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:45.040]   No, it's real. Go released. It's real. There's they. This is the Apple Spring color refresh where
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:53.040]   they say, Oh, no, no, we forgot a color for the lower cost iPhone, yellow, yellow. So now there's,
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.640]   that's your winner. If you had that in the lottery, what the color would be,
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.040]   Holy cow, come down and pick up your turkey. It's a yellow. That is so yellow.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:07.120]   Let me see if I can. There it is. Whoo. They call me mellow yellow. It's sunshiney yellow.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:14.560]   And it is available. Not though for you pros. No, you have to have. No, dude colors.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.880]   No, it's a bright color. It can't be in a pro phone. No, we can't have that.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:25.120]   Too whimsical. Yes. Okay. So that was a rumor that turned into fact. So that's good. You saved
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.680]   me. There you go. That's the news. But that's that's something that's something we have to add to the
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.760]   like the Apple annual metronome that this is a second. Is this the second or the third year in a
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.520]   row that they've had a spring color for the iPhone? Third. I think. Sorry. Thank you. Third.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:45.840]   Plus like an edition of and here's our new spring line of watch bands because it's it's fun. I'm glad
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.680]   this is this old school Apple. I'm glad that like they're still remembering that this is the same
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:55.760]   company that did Apple that did iPod socks. This is, you know, this is this is it's okay to simply
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:01.600]   say that we're just there's no real reason or need for us to add a yellow phone. It's not as though
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.480]   we're missing. There's a reason. Oh, that's why that's why sales of the iPhone 14 were down.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.920]   We're we're there are people who are waiting for a yellow one who've been holding out. There you go.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:15.520]   The yellow color is the the spring colors tend to be kind of Easter eggy colors. So here's the
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:22.960]   spring watch band collection, which is kind of an orange sherbet. A lavender weave. They aren't
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:29.440]   sherbet is Polly. You know, is the sport band the rubber band a light blue. I would say I would say
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:37.760]   Robin's Egg blue. Let's let's keep it in the spring and egg yolk yellow. They're pretty bright. Yeah.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:43.520]   Yeah. Pretty. Yeah. Pretty bright. And you know, all of us nerds are going to be like,
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.400]   come on. It's just colors and it's true. They are just colors, but this is a fashion kind of thing.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.240]   And not everybody buys a phone in the fall. And this will get them through the rest of the year.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:57.600]   It also allows Apple to kind of reengage and and have some ads that are not the same old ads
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:03.920]   that about the same old phone. And I know as silly as it is a bit like, Hey, it's yellow. That's
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.520]   like that's Hey, everybody. It's yellow, but it does let them remind people like, Hey,
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.720]   here's the iPhone and and maybe you want one now and how about this? And if you don't like this
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:20.800]   color, we got some other colors and look, it is as fashion and and sort of silly from a tech
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.880]   perspective as it is, it obviously works for them or they would not keep doing it. Sure.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:33.360]   Sure. Here's actually the official names. Sprout green. Oh, please. I call I call that puke green.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:42.800]   Canary yellow, olive solo, purple fog. That's the lavender one. Those are the new ones. Okay,
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.920]   that's in the solo loops and then the braided solo loops. We've got bright orange
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:59.040]   and olive braided in the sport bands. We've got bright orange olive. So I guess, oh, yeah. Okay.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.200]   I guess there's nothing new for the high end watchers. We're already just stick with
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.880]   the same old colors. Maybe there's any sport loop. Nothing.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:15.280]   They don't did they put out a press release. Yeah. There's there's there's not a one on Apple's
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.680]   press release. Yeah. All right. Apple newsroom. I should have been in there this morning. I don't
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:25.200]   know what I was thinking. Hello, hello yellow again. Hello is the yellow. Hello yellow. How
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:31.680]   yellow is your my idea of fun is like how many like youtubers and whatever like had a
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:37.600]   halter butts and a Cupertino for a briefing because that is to on the on the yellow on the
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.400]   yellow iPhone, even though it's just I mean it's yellow. Got it. Send me a photo. Good. Thanks.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.200]   Got it. No, no, no, we we really want to walk you through the. Okay. Here we go. You think they did.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:53.600]   No, come on. Look, I can I can neither confirm or deny. No, Apple says. Oh, I could all I could
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.640]   tell you is that I might have spent 20 minutes. Oh,
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.680]   Hondering my yellow. Harshing my mellow and wondering my yellow. What could you say about
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.960]   yellow that hasn't already been said. Like I said, I think it's an opportunity for them to
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:11.200]   reengage on the phone and basically like software and what software updates they've done recently
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.800]   and he features that they've added but also just sort of also this is the lower end model.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.880]   So I think it may be a lot of reviewers are like, you know, they cast it off in the fall
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.520]   because they're focused on the pro phone and you know, it's a chance we hear about the plus sales
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.800]   flagging. Maybe it's a chance to point out the virtues of the of the that plus model as well.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.200]   And you know, but in the end, yeah, it's just it is Apple waving and say, Hey, over here,
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.680]   remember the iPhone and forget it seems to work for them. We're still here. Yeah. Yep.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:43.120]   There's a there's a reason. Also remember the Samsung does their like big flagship drop in
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.720]   February. So that's getting people's attention. Google also chooses mid season to do their
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:54.880]   a series phones where they'll do like the Pixel seven and then they'll do the like $400 seven a
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.360]   likely like usually in April and May. So it is it. It's I don't I don't think Apple needs to
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.640]   necessarily compete necessarily, but it's it's an additional good excuse to make sure that you
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.360]   remind people that buying a new iPhone is something that they're capable of doing if they have like
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:15.920]   seven or $800. So you thought there wasn't any news is where you go. Hello, yellow.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:22.640]   Right on top of it, breaking news as timely as today's headlines. How could I have missed it?
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.400]   All right. Well, back to the rumors.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:32.640]   No, there are I think benefit. I think benefit 2.0 has got it. I think they're both more mature.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.680]   They're at a better place in their lives. I forgive the back tattoo. I think I think this
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.240]   is a winner here. The back tattoo that says Jen Garner.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:46.320]   Yeah, this really huge like tattoo. Oh, God. That was interesting.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:55.680]   Is it a tramp stamp if it's on a guy? Yes. I'm gonna say yes. I'm gonna say yes. Descriptively.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.480]   Yes, because lower back tattoo just doesn't have the same sort of.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.320]   No, no, it doesn't rhyme. No judging. No judging. No judging.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:11.520]   Other news Microsoft has made a redesigned outlook available for free to all Mac users.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:17.600]   No longer do you have to buy Microsoft 365? It is Apple Silicon based. I of course,
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.280]   because I'm a dedicated journalist downloaded it, installed it,
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.320]   got a little throw up in my mouse and then still leave it. But you know, you know,
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.640]   here's the I'll tell you something crazy. I may actually install outlook on my computer.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:38.880]   Why? And here's why. The exchange causes so much damage in mail for me that I think that I would
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:44.320]   like to just put anybody who interacts with me exchange in my company as exchange server.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.200]   Here's the problem is, is that there's certain things that exchange does.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.600]   Right. That nothing else does. Right.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:56.400]   And it ruins if you're in dark mode on on in mail, what happens is exchange explicitly defines the
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.720]   text color. It doesn't allow it to work can. You can get into a state where it's defining that.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:05.040]   And so people will start like, especially when people start coloring the text inside of their
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.520]   thing, which is evidently a windows thing that people do all the time, drives me crazy. So people
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.040]   put like, they start coloring names of like this person and this person to make it stick out.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.920]   Well, the problem is you make that dark blue over and it defines that as dark blue. And I can't see
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.880]   it. What happens if you use Apple's mail? It just doesn't show up. It just shows up. Well,
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:28.240]   so there's a couple of things. One is that it is Apple mail just looks it just dark over dark,
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.560]   you know, and so you can't see what they're doing. And then the way it handles threads is just a
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:38.160]   disaster. The exchange servers, managing of threads inside of mail is just a, you know,
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.600]   and it doesn't happen anywhere else. Google mail and all these other mail servers that don't
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:46.000]   don't have a problem with it. But exchange just destroys it. And then the other thing that happens,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.160]   which is unique is that if you create any, I create a lot of folders. So I create rules and
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.760]   folders, put this here, put this here, put this here, put this here. I cannot do that.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:02.000]   If the person I'm talking to as an exchange server, because it will copy it into a folder and for
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.640]   whatever reason, however it deals with the exchange server, it comes out as no content. So literally,
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.240]   I see that they sent me an email and I could go to my phone to figure out what they did. So I had
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:15.280]   to pull it all out. So I have to leave all my exchange interactions in the main feed inside
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.920]   of mail, because mail, whatever it I don't, I'm going to assume it's exchange server doing
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:25.840]   something funky, because everything else works. Every other mail service I use works, except for
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:31.120]   exchange, and it will not pass the content of the stuff to another folder inside a mail.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.960]   So as a result, I have been looking at like, well, I might just take my work email because a lot of
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.800]   my, for whatever reason, both, oh, and I know, and a lot of our clients are on the exchange server.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.200]   And it's, and it kind of screws up my mail. So I was thinking, I'll just take all the exchange
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:48.640]   people and put them in an outlook. And you can't use that look. I connected it to fast mail and
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:55.440]   you can use it for your calendar contact. And for email, it works with IMAP. But you would say,
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.040]   just use it for the weeks. I mean, how can you use it for people that I just,
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.640]   just people that I deal with, I would just open it like, I'll just use it for my work mail and just
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.920]   put it in there by itself and not have any of the other stuff there. And then I just check it. I
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.000]   just means I'll check it less because I wouldn't has all these emails coming in. And then the other
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.720]   one, I got to open that up and take a look at it. Agree emails from IRC, Knox Harrington says,
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.880]   yeah, if you need to log into an exchange server, it's still much better to use that one.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.640]   Exchanges Microsoft's own mail server. Go ahead.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.600]   Yeah, even though even though other services definitely supported. I'll, I think that's,
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:34.080]   I actually have that as my pick of the week. Oh, sorry. No, no, that's okay. But because I do,
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.880]   I do use Outlook as my mail provider. I've been using it for like five or 10 years, actually very,
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:45.680]   very, very, it's been a little doc. Well, no, I've Microsoft Office. My, my transferred my email
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.000]   domain to Outlook back when the month I've been using for 15 years, suddenly, you know what,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.280]   maybe 50 megabytes of mail storage is not enough for me. Maybe I should find something that, but the
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:02.560]   thing is, it's a, it's a really good sign because it is, I had, I wasn't using it until a couple of
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:08.480]   months ago, because it was the typical like Microsoft sort of arrogant user interface design, or rather,
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.680]   hey, if this, if it, because this is an office type app, it has to run the same way on every single
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:20.640]   operating system. So as a result, on Mac, it really looked vomit inducing. It was really, really,
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.400]   like, hey, look, everyone has bigger screens. That means we can put more buttons and more
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.400]   dropdown menus and more things in here to make things more complicated. But they did streamline
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.880]   the design. It looks a lot more Mac like it supports a lot more of the built in interface.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:38.480]   Now, if it sits alongside all of your other productivity apps really, really nicely.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:44.320]   And I'll have to say that in terms of when you're getting like a real like industrial
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:51.120]   amount of email every single day, every single week, I like Outlook for its ability to really
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:55.920]   have intense tools for clearing it up and triaging things and scheduling things. I think it's a,
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.680]   I think it's a nice app and I was nicer to use. And it's now it's free. You don't have to pay a
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:06.080]   monthly fee to use it. Do you, is it the call in box sweep still? What do you use that? What is
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:16.080]   it that you use? Yeah. Well, I like that it basically has two switches, rather two switches on your
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.800]   inbox, one in which stuff that it think it's pretty sure this is stuff that you want to know.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.960]   And then the stuff where it looks like this is bulk email, not necessarily spam, but stuff that
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:30.080]   is not necessarily personalized towards you. And I found that to be very, very effective. The spam,
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.480]   anti-spam features have been gotten, actually they've gotten a little bit squirrely in the past
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:40.160]   month, but that just shows how well the anti-spam has worked before then. That's the fact that I'm
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:46.560]   noticing a couple of spam emails out of like hundreds of emails a day. That shows you how well it
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:53.360]   was working before. I think that mail, mail.app works great. But the reason, the way that most
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:20:00.880]   people get to use it in a power sort of position is when they learn how to integrate it with other
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:08.160]   Apple technologies, other Mac technologies, like again, making it part of a workflow or putting
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:14.240]   it into Automator or something like that. All the people who really use mail.app in that sort of
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.680]   same industrial sort of way are people who've customized it with their own scripts and their
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.760]   own workflows, which is great. I haven't actually tried workflows and stuff without like, yeah,
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:30.720]   I don't know what the support is. But mail is something where it really is like dipping my hand
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:36.160]   into fire. I want to get my hand out of there as quickly as possible. So the idea of building tools
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:41.360]   to work on my mailbox is not something that I'm really inclined to do. So I'm not saying it's
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.440]   the greatest outlook. It's not the greatest mail client that's ever been made for the Mac,
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:50.480]   necessarily. I think this can be a very individualized decision. But I think that it's actually very,
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:55.360]   very good. It's no longer the afterthought. Oh, okay. Well, we just do the few last holdouts
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:00.560]   we're using Mac on an office network that we haven't managed to look to lobotomize yet.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.960]   We'll throw them a bone to let them use like the Windows 95 version about like, it's actually a
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:10.800]   very good app, I think. Jason, anything you want to say about outlook?
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:18.480]   I use to use it. Great. I mean, I remember entourage. That was also a thing. I think it's
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:23.360]   cool for them to make it make it free. I'm an entourage. There's a name.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:29.840]   What would I have not heard? There's a name. Crossing the streams. You're crossing the streams.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:36.160]   We're in Lord of the Rings mode. Sorry. I'm going to introduce the Ghostbusters. I mean,
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:44.720]   it works in the in a in a thousands of years ago in middle of there was an entourage a fellowship
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.640]   or an entourage, if you will, of the ring. How about that? There you go.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:55.200]   See, I'm going to the one was played by Matt Dylan. It's a more broier version of four rings.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:06.960]   Okay. Now you've thrown me. All right. Let's go back. Let's go back to the news. The news,
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:15.120]   the untitled goose game. Cable sasser. We've talked about it many times before panic. He
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:21.840]   created that little thing with a crank that you love so much. And he played it. He also as well
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:29.680]   known for their, their really nice apps for the Macintosh. What does it transmit? What is,
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:35.680]   what else does panic do? Sure. They used to have coda and now they have nova, which is nova.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:43.360]   I still use from time to time. Yeah. Anyway, they also have a hit, which is good because
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.240]   because frankly, those other programs probably don't make them a lot of money
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:53.760]   called the untitled goose game, which is a really good fun game, which you could play on PCs.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:59.360]   And I guess, I don't know, I, I don't know if I've ever played it on the Mac, you played on your
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:09.920]   consoles. Cable, a tooted, which I like on Mastodon, a short story. Yesterday, in fact, he says,
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:15.600]   a short story, we once submitted untitled goose game to the Mac App Store, because they thought,
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.480]   well, well, you know, let, let Apple people download it from the App Store. It was rejected by the
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:27.600]   reviewer because they thought you couldn't skip the credits, which is a weird reason to reject it.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.040]   So we explained that you could skip the credits. You could, in fact, by holding space.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:37.680]   So the Apple said, oh, huh. And then rejected it for something else. And at that point, we just
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:43.360]   gave up and never bothered to resubmit the end. Yeah, it's on Steam and itch and stuff like that
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.960]   for the Mac. They were going to put it the Mac App Store. This is everything about Apple's,
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:53.360]   you know, curation that it's like one of these archetypal Mac App Store or App Store in general
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:59.120]   stories where things that shouldn't be in the stores are allowed in and things that are perfectly
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.520]   fine. And there's no reason that they should be rejected or rejected for reasons that are baffling
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:09.680]   or or don't actually exist. You hear that, you hear developers all the time saying they submitted
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.320]   something that's literally been approved a million times. And then suddenly they flag something that's
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:20.160]   not new and say this is in violation or or we couldn't get this to work, right? Or there were a
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:26.560]   so much of Mastodon clients got rejected because they thought somehow that the client author
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:32.880]   was the owner of Mastodon and controlled the whole service. Like it's just one of those examples.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.760]   Like I'm not saying the App Store curation is not a hard job, but I'm saying like Apple's the one
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.400]   that forces it to be the curator of everything. And if they're going to do that, they need to do
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:47.760]   their job. And this is just yet another story of a stupid, you know, a reviewer that's not paying
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.760]   attention and you get a stupid rejection. It's ridiculous.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:56.880]   Stefan at GardenState.SocialTutedbeck, quote, please title your game.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:03.360]   Which would be, you know, I could totally see it being the reason for rejection.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:12.160]   Then somebody else said it is the Apple has created the HOA, the Homeowners Association of
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:21.680]   Software. True, true. And honestly, if Apple is an eel dash to its success, fun prevented.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.880]   If Apple is in fact, by the way, it's a great game. If you haven't played it, you get to play a
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:32.880]   goose. So good. Pestering a farmer, making a mess of things, just being annoying.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.160]   Ruining a whole town. Yeah. Yeah. You're the bad guy. It's great.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:42.960]   Yeah. I got to say, just as an aside, that in the first five minutes, I was embarrassed and
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:49.040]   thrilled by how much fun I had just turning on a tap, forcing someone, then the farmer comes on
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.880]   and turns it off again. And then this will be turning it on again and forcing the farmer to come
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.840]   back and turn it off again. I am embarrassed by how much I enjoy just annoying this random non-player
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:04.880]   character. That's really great. It's so much fun. It's so much fun. So, but you're not going to get
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.120]   it at the App Store because Apple just, you know, Apple doesn't like games. This is the problem.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:14.800]   Apple is really trying to establish themselves. Didn't they invite a bunch of influencers just a
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:20.080]   couple of weeks ago to the campus to see games, not the untitled goose game I'm guessing.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:25.680]   Anyway, these things happen. What are you going to do? You know, I, I've submitted a couple apps to
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.920]   the, to the store. It's taken between two and four submissions over two weeks to get them in.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.240]   They give us back something. We fix it. We think it was back something else. We fix it.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.480]   And usually I can see, I may not agree with what they say, but I can understand what their,
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:44.960]   what their thought process is. And, you know, it just, I've never had something not get in to the
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.680]   store. We just, you know, just move things around until Apple's happy with it. There's, I guess,
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:54.320]   I have to admit that I work in a lot of countries. I live in a state where the only, only part of
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:59.280]   the state that I like is that my wife likes living here. So, so the only, so the thing is that,
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.360]   you know, there's a lot of things that are imperfect in everything, you know, and I think that,
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.600]   you know, Apple can obviously do better. Everyone can always do better. It's a lot of people submitting
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:12.480]   things, you know, into those things. And it's not just a matter of hiring more people. It is,
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.760]   it is a matter of just a serious amount of flow, you know, and, and it's just an intense,
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:23.520]   intense amount of flow. And then, and this is one sample. There are millions of people that
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:28.400]   seem to be able to figure out their way to get into it, like pretty, pretty effectively. And if you,
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:33.200]   you know, I've just, I just, again, I talked to other people that I programmed with, or that I've
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.800]   worked with on, on submitting them, they can't remember a time that they couldn't get it in. I
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.720]   talked to people who work on, on the, on apps that are, again, people that I know that are putting
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.520]   these things in and they're like, you know, sometimes you go back and forth a little bit,
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.920]   and then you get it in. And they don't, they don't have, I mean, I agree.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:52.240]   And I, it's one of me, sir. To be fair, we have someone who ever says why the second rejection
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:57.360]   happened or it sure sounds like, again, oh, fine, whatever, and get rid of someone who can get a
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.760]   lot of, but there's millions of people that are figuring this out.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:04.720]   Well, they have other apps in the store, don't they? I mean, I'm not sure, but I think,
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.920]   oh, yeah. I mean, the app isn't, and the app isn't like, it's not the only game app in, in the store.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.680]   You know, there's lots of things out there. And so someone's figuring it out. And I guess,
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:19.840]   I, and I, I, you blame panic. I'm just, I'm just saying that it's, if you're pragmatic about it,
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.080]   and then you figure out how to make it work, you just get it in.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.600]   So here's, here's the thing is, is it,
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:27.360]   you know, here's the truth of it. Panic is lots of games in the store, Alex,
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.120]   panic has lots of fire watches in the store. They got lots of apps in the store.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.240]   The fact is they were on all these other platforms. They're working with a development
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:38.160]   company. They're the publisher. They get, they get to these two ridiculous rejections.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.400]   And you know what they said? They said, you know what the Mac App Store doesn't matter to us.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.640]   It doesn't matter to our business. It's not worth our time. We were going to do it to be nice,
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.560]   basically, and to say we were in another place, but that, that, and that's actually one of the
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:55.520]   beautiful things about Mac App Store not being a monopoly is you can't do that in the iOS App Store.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.720]   But in the Mac App Store, you can just say, you know what, it's not worth the aggregate,
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:03.760]   aggravation. Well, we're not going to give Apple any cut of our sales. We'll do it on
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.840]   Steam and Twitch instead. And they, and they walked away. And you know, of course they could have
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:13.440]   gotten it through, but I think it's telling that after two capricious rejections, they just said,
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.080]   stick it and walked away and quite rightly so.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:20.240]   They are on PC. They are on Mac via Steam, it's your epic. They're on Nintendo Switch.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:26.000]   They're on PlayStation 4. They're on Xbox One. But no, they are not on iOS.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.800]   Yeah, that's, that's, that's an important point. Realize that this company had the ability to
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.880]   walk away and say, this isn't worth the trouble. A, because they're a big company and they have
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:42.960]   lots of other projects going on. And C, they had, there was, it's a multi platform, a multi platform
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:47.200]   game that if they could walk away from Apple completely and still have some successes,
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.920]   but they also had the ability to still offer this to Mac users because there was an alternative
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:58.240]   app store that they could actually offer it through. And this is why Apple has to answer a whole lot
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:04.560]   of pointed questions about how they run the iOS store. Because I mean, I appreciate, I appreciate
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:10.240]   Alex's point that it's a, it is a huge job. I also appreciate the point that there are people who
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:15.360]   have had problems with the app store approval process, but managed to navigate them. That doesn't
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:20.640]   change the fact that Apple should be ashamed of the fact that the fact that the app store is broken
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:25.760]   is part of the app store's brand at this point. This isn't a, this isn't a recent thing. This is
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.840]   historically, you know that this is part of the burden you're going to have to suffer if you're
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:33.840]   going to be dealing with Apple and trying to sell things through their app stores. And the fact that
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:38.800]   some people are not having these problems doesn't mean that the problems that some people are having
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:44.320]   don't exist or shouldn't be solved. That's not what I'm saying. Okay, but I appreciate that. But
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:50.400]   I'm saying that I have to say, I have to, I have to keep raising this point, Apple isn't too
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:55.440]   hippies in a garage. They have two trillion dollars if they, and they have solved problems
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:00.080]   that are at this scale before if they want, if they feel as though it's important for them to
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:05.040]   solve it. If there was a bureaucracy that doesn't work, Apple would, Apple would be ashamed of
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:10.240]   themselves if this were a simple defect in the iPhone that caused a similar percentage of users
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.800]   to have a two week problem getting their iPhones up and running. They would think people would be
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:20.080]   fired. There would be like having press releases, they'd be left and right. I don't know why Apple
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:25.120]   doesn't want to at least create the illusion that they think that this is a problem, they agree that
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:30.000]   this is a problem and they're trying to do something about it in an active way. I think it would be
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.520]   pretty presumptuous to think that they're not trying to make it better. Like they're not trying
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:38.080]   their true. They're trying and they're failing. I think they're banned. Again, I don't think that
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:43.840]   I think that the, I guess I just, and I admit that what I view, I look at everything is broken.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:48.320]   Like everything around me is broken all the time. So I look at how the state is broken,
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.320]   every program I was broken, everything I do is broken, everything is broken. Like everything's
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.360]   broken. Nothing's working perfectly. There's things that are falling apart all the time. I don't know
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:02.240]   a single thing that I think isn't broken. So I have to admit that I look at it like, well,
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.760]   you make progress. And as someone who works in a lot of things with a lot of people,
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:10.960]   nothing's perfect. And you sit there and you go, well, let's figure out how to keep on iterating.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:15.120]   And I think that Apple is going to keep on iterating in those areas. But I think that if I needed to
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:19.440]   get something in, if it mattered to me, and it has mattered to me to get things into the App Store,
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:24.960]   it hasn't been that big of a lift. It's not like it's been traumatic to get it in. And I will say
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.880]   that as someone who is now, right now I'm designing apps that are going to go in the fall.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:38.480]   And these are made actually be a for sale product. I don't want it to be easier,
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.880]   because I know that I'll get in. I'll figure out what I want. And what I mean.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:52.320]   The reason for that is that I want the maximum confidence of the user that when they download it,
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:58.400]   what I prioritize as a developer is that I want the user to have the highest level of confidence,
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.160]   even if it means that it's harder for me to get into so that they're more likely to go,
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.400]   oh, that looks interesting. I'll just buy it. I have a certain trust as a user. That trust is
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.760]   huge for small developers, because I'm going to put something out that isn't going to be
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:14.080]   usually work with larger companies and so on and so forth. I'm going to put something out
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:19.280]   that's smaller and everything else. And I need them to trust that me. And what Apple does,
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:23.520]   even if it's high friction and imperfect, they create a high friction system that means that
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.440]   there's a much more likely, I would never put it. I mean, the Google Play Store is not that way.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.000]   Like, I look at stuff on my Android phone, I look at it and I go, well, like, you know,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.600]   like, I don't know what's going to happen there. And so, I don't know what the interface is going
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.080]   to be like. I don't know if it's going to be stable. I don't know if it's going to be safe.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.960]   I don't know all kinds of things about it in any other store. On an app store, I look at it and
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:47.120]   I go, well, I think I can, I mean, I'll give it a shot. I download things all the time that I just
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:53.360]   want to see if it works. I don't, if I lose, if the users lose that trust, the developers that
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:59.840]   hurt the most are the smallest developers because they don't get that automatic trust that it went
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:04.880]   through this filter. Regardless of how imperfect that filter is, and sometimes it lets things in,
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:10.000]   it shouldn't. Sometimes it'll stop things. It's an imperfect filter, but the trust level is so much
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.120]   higher in the iOS store than anywhere else. I don't think we can argue with trust level being
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:20.400]   higher in that store than anywhere else because that filter is hard. And so, as a small developer
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.960]   working on something for this fall, I want that trust level to be the highest. I know that I'm not
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:28.000]   going to have any problem. I know that it might take me three or four submissions to get it in.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.680]   And then it'll be there and when people see it and they think that it might be the thing that
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:36.400]   will solve their problem, they'll be likely to just go, "Okay, I'll buy it." And so, that's the
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:41.760]   difference for the smallest developers. That trust is a huge issue. And for the fact that some people
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:46.160]   have a little harder time, I would rather than pay for that so that the small developers can
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:51.840]   have that level of trust that they get by being in the store. Okay, I'll try to make this brief.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:57.520]   But number one, I am never going to make an excuse for Apple's failures in the App Store.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:02.560]   I don't think it's the be all end all of how Apple runs this business. It doesn't mean that
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:07.440]   this is a total disaster and we need a regime change. But I don't think that Apple has earned
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:12.160]   any sort of excuses made and how it runs the App Store. Again, we're talking about generations
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.280]   in which they know this. Not just, "Oh, well gosh, they have a highest narrative quality. It's
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:21.200]   hard for us to maintain that." No, it's these arbitrary things that like, guess what? Well,
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.920]   we've decided to, there's a simple form to fill out, but we're going to put it on the top of a 20-foot
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:30.240]   ladder that's coded in bare grease. Why? Well, because we're just making it harder for you.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:36.880]   And that's what it often feels like. And secondly, the App Store has all of the same problems of the
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:43.200]   Google Play App Store just in a smaller scale. That is a big advantage, but that doesn't mean that it
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:50.560]   is just a small... The problems that it has are a smaller, more contained dumpster fire than the
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.640]   dumpster fire that's going on in the Google Play Store. So I don't think that Apple can justify
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:00.720]   that, "Oh, well, look at the benefits that we're delivering by making this process so difficult."
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:06.160]   Again, people aren't having a problem because they, gosh, they put a... They used a different
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.400]   type of control or they didn't... They put the used placeholder text where they should have put
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:15.120]   final text. That's simple stuff. That's crossing the... That's crossing the T's and dotting the I's.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:19.920]   They're having problems with... You've approved this five years... Five years in a row. Last year,
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.400]   we quit our jobs because we're making enough money off of this app to sustain us. And now you're
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:29.440]   telling us that you're going to be turning off all of our revenue because of an arbitrary reason
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:34.400]   that's going to be really, really hard, if not impossible, for us to arbitrary. These are... I'm
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:39.440]   just saying that this is the reason why Apple is being called in front of world governments
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:44.880]   to say, "Explain how you run the app store, explain why we should allow you to continue to have the
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.800]   level of autonomy that you have." And I don't think Apple has a lot of good answers to that.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.080]   They're not getting called in front of the government because of this. They're getting called
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.840]   in front of the government because rich companies want to give 15% instead of 30%.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.040]   No, that's not right.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:01.680]   Let's be clear that there's no... No, no, absolutely not right. No one would even hear this conversation.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:07.680]   Like, the reason that they're having it is because European companies want to have European laws
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.200]   and American companies want to have your American laws to cut down on how much they pay
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.640]   because they want to make instead of 100 million, they want to make 150 million.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.840]   That's true.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:21.280]   But that's the only reason that the lobbies would not... The lobbies... I mean, you're not being
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:25.840]   in real... You're not being realistic there. Like, the lobbies for the little... These little
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:31.360]   things would never, ever turn the corner in the United States or Europe. This is not what's
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:36.160]   taken there. It's taken it there because rich companies want more money. Like, that's the only
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.360]   reason that it has enough force to get through that system.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:45.440]   I believe that lobbying is an influence, but no. The EU is not having all these, but every single
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.600]   company because the International lobbying committee on every single court is doing this.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.760]   There is a movement basically saying, "Nah, it's not so many saying that Apple, you need to be
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.240]   punished or Google, you need to be punished." It's that we have basically been underregulating
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:04.160]   you people since the 1990s and underregulating you has worked out really great for the world
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:12.000]   and for individuals. No doubt. But now is the time to ask. Now that you are secure, now that all
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.640]   these technologies have been completely matured, is it time to simply say that, "No, you can't run
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:21.520]   these things exactly the way you want." That maybe there are existing laws that we have not been
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:27.680]   prosecuting on or at least examining you on. Again, lobbying is always going to be the filthy
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:33.120]   fingerprints that are on every single part of government and law enforcement. However, to say that
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:43.360]   that Apple is only being asked about this stuff because another rival game store wants to avoid
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:48.480]   paying money or just because Spotify is upset that they're having competition inside the Apple
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:53.920]   Music Store. No, it finds people inside a government who believe that, "Yeah, why is Apple allowed to
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:59.200]   have an exclusive on this? Why is Apple allowed to do things with its own music app and its own music
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:07.760]   service that doesn't allow other music services to do?" I'm not going to reject that lobbying is an
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.960]   influence. I will reject the idea that that's the only reason why this is happening.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:17.840]   One of the things that is possibly going to happen, there's a lot of pressure to get Apple to allow
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:28.160]   non-webkit browsers on iOS. According to 9-to-5, Google's ready. They quietly unveiled a new effort
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:36.560]   to port the Blink browser engine, Chromium's browser engine, to iPhone. They can't do it yet,
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:42.480]   but I think they're preparing for a day when maybe perhaps you can have third party browsers.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.480]   I'm sure everybody listens to the show knows that when you're using anybody's browser
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.560]   on iPhone, you're really using WebKit under the hood. It's really Safari with a different UI.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:59.360]   Google and others would like it to be Chrome, the Blink engine. So, there are your screenshots
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:07.280]   of the minimal Blink-based browser running on iPhone 12. Seems to work. Okay, we shall see.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:13.920]   9-to-5 Google actually built the prototype browser from the source code on,
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:21.040]   because it is an open source project. We're able to show their site running on iOS
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:30.480]   in the Xcode simulator, not on an actual iPhone. So, progress proceeds. Do you have a problem, Alex,
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.240]   with that? Or would you prefer that all the browsers are Safari?
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.840]   Sure. You can do it. I mean, all 3% of the people that want to download it,
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.400]   I'm sure will download it. Well, there's some reason you might want to download a non-webkit browser.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.400]   Quite a few reasons. I don't have any problem with that. Yeah, I mean, I think it's fine.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:50.560]   I think it's, I don't think there's anything wrong with having them download and put another
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:55.440]   browser. Apple's not going to do it, of course, unless forced. Unless they decided strategically
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:00.400]   that maybe, you know, like a plea bargain. Okay, well, if we give you this, we'll let up.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:05.440]   Or that I'll take the heat off, right? Like even if nobody's saying we may make you do this,
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:09.360]   if they're like, look, look at how open we are. Just like when they did default apps,
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:13.600]   right? It would be a little bit like that. And there are, I mean, Leo, I'm glad you mentioned,
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:18.320]   there are lots of reasons for it. Alex is right that the home field advantage is strong, right?
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:23.040]   Like just getting anybody to download anything over what's already on the phone is.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:27.280]   It's the only explanation for why I don't know if Explorer was used for so many years.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.840]   Yeah. It was the default. It's the default, right?
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.760]   People don't, and we care, but other people don't care. But I was thinking about how,
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.760]   you know, a few years ago, there were a whole bunch of these, and they're still out there.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:43.280]   Things like Zencaster and Cast that are like, for our business, like you can do podcasting in a
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:47.280]   browser and it records locally and then sends the file back. And it's like a one-stop shop.
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:51.440]   There's only one catch. It doesn't work on Safari because for whatever reason,
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:55.920]   there were certain web standards that Apple just decided not to implement in WebKit.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.040]   And so they still don't work. And these aren't esoteric, there's standards,
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:04.160]   and they're not there. And so that means iOS devices are just out of luck.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:08.000]   But you look at this report and I immediately think, oh, like that whole class of things that
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:15.280]   doesn't work on iOS will probably work if I can run Chrome on iOS because it will have all the proper
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:21.040]   like web RTC extensions and file support that I need. And that like, it's a little thing.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:27.040]   It's a niche thing. But for if somebody's building their web app on what they think are standards,
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.400]   but it doesn't work in Safari, that means they're locked out of iOS right now.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:35.760]   And although most people won't do it, I have gotten people to download Chrome literally just to use
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:42.720]   one of those apps. So it's nice as an option. But you're right. Homefield advantage is strong.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:50.960]   Unless somebody, a regulator, forces Apple to not include Safari on, and I have a hard time
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:57.600]   imagining that somebody's going to order that your smartphone must be sold empty. It seems unlikely
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.560]   that that's going to happen. So I think that it'll always be dominant.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.320]   If those people want privacy and so they use DuckDuckGo's browser,
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:10.240]   I guess you could do that on top of a web kit, but you're very limited to what Apple will allow
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:14.800]   and what they won't allow. I guess that's the way it is on iPhone entirely.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:20.880]   I'm just glad the idea that Safari will have competition on that platform because I do think
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:26.640]   that it will, I don't think that Safari is in need of a major revolution. But I think that it would
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:31.520]   benefit by saying that, oh, well, if they see that they're losing ground to Chrome,
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:36.800]   it will say, well, we better support more standards. We'd maybe like loosen our grip on certain things.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:41.440]   The only thing I'm worried about is that we've seen about how certain scummy, like social media
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.600]   apps, oftentimes they make you, they'll put a, if you tap a link within a social media post,
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:50.320]   they think you think that you're actually opening it in the regular Safari browser
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.960]   or the Chrome browser, you're actually opening it inside a web view inside that app where the app
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:58.080]   can have more closer observation over what you're doing.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:02.480]   That's almost all it's like, you know, when you buy something on Instagram, you're still an Instagram.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:06.640]   Right. Yeah. So, so I'm worried that they will replace that. Oh, great. We have, we now have
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:11.440]   the Instagram browser. We have our own browser engine specifically for iOS, specifically to keep
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:16.240]   an eye on what you're doing when you're inside the Instagram app. So they're both sides to this.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.360]   I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, I'm glad Safari exists. Otherwise,
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:25.040]   Chrome would have something like 99% of all browser, browser usage, or Chromium,
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:30.640]   Chrome based browsers like Microsoft's Edge. So you, and I don't think a browser monoculture is a
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:35.440]   good thing. On the other hand, I'm sure Alex as a developer, it would be nice if you could develop
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.840]   for one browser on the web. It's always nice to develop for one thing. Yeah.
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:46.000]   But I think it's risky too to have a monoculture, you know, I mean, it's nice that bananas are very
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.240]   consistent, but at the same time, you get a disease, all those bananas are gone. And I think that
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:56.240]   security is the issue with the monoculture and browsers. Well, I think security will be the
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:00.640]   issue with you. I mean, I think if there's any security issues with any third party browser,
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.440]   Apple's going to bury them. Like they're just going to, they're going to use that. I mean,
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:07.360]   the thing is, is what this is an easy place for them to handle little freedom out and let people
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:12.000]   screw it up and then pound it. Well, and so the thing is that, you know, like the zero days that
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.640]   Apple just patched were in WebKit and they were zero days they were in the wild. So Apple has no
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:22.560]   standing if they say, well, look at all the flaws in Chromium. Well, they, whether they have the
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:26.000]   standing or not, they're going to use it. Like, you know, like the thing is, is that, you know,
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.160]   like that, you know, so it doesn't matter whether they have the standing or not, they're just going
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:32.720]   to, it's just, it'll just be a good point for them. And if someone, you know, especially power,
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.320]   I think what you're going to find is that people are going to build third party browsers. They're
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:40.800]   not going to be as efficient as Safari and Apple's going to point that out in some keynote. You know,
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.160]   like that's, you know, that'll be what the next. Yeah, that's certainly the case with Chrome on
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:50.480]   Mac, right? Google is what? Holy smokes. It takes up so much, you know, it's just a huge CPU draw.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.680]   And, and, you know, there's a lot of things like that. I mean, that's what happened with Flash is
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:57.040]   that Apple didn't support Flash because they wanted battery life, right? You know, like, you know,
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:01.680]   and, and it's, and so, so I think that that's going to be Apple's thing. Like, I don't put any
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:06.080]   Facebook, I don't put any meta apps on my phone, but not because I have a security issue. I don't
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.920]   put them on, I have, I'm on Facebook on, on my computer. I don't put them on my phone because I
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:16.080]   like having my battery last all day, you know, and by putting anything made by meta on including
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:20.400]   WhatsApp, I mean, it's just going to chew my battery into the ground and I just don't need that.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:24.400]   Yeah, it's notorious for that. But it's a double edged sword for Apple too. They can't push too
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:29.360]   hard. They'd love to have it be a complete walled garden, but they can't push too hard either. So
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:35.760]   they're going to, they're going to do strategic, uh, uh, concessions. Pretty good at trying to draw
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:39.200]   a line. I mean, they'll, they'll fight really hard in some areas and allow other things to slide
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:43.120]   slowly, right, you know, some direction. And it's, you know, it's kind of an ebb and flow kind of thing.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:48.640]   Yeah. I just hope that the idea of controlling the whole widget continues to be something they do
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:52.720]   because they consider every single possibility and decide that this is the way that provide the
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:59.040]   best value for users. I hope that as Apple grows older and as it starts to, at the point where it
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:04.320]   loses its, its CEO, the CEO that had such a close relationship to one of the founders of the company,
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:08.080]   I hope that doesn't simply become dogma that, well, if this came from outside of Apple, we're
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:11.200]   not going to trust it. We're not going to use it even though there could be an advantage to other
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:17.520]   people. But we'll, we'll see how that turns out. Yesterday, the EU in this regard had a,
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:24.560]   what they called a stakeholder workshop, uh, talking about the digital markets act. That's the
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:30.160]   thing that really is holding Apple's feet to the fire. Of course, Spotify was one of the panelists,
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:35.520]   nine to five Mac reporting. Spotify's, uh, director of global competition policy,
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:41.360]   uh, talked about the topic of giving choice to app developers, how to implement the rules
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:47.360]   related to in app payment systems. These are the three issues, steering and consumption only apps.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:54.000]   He wants two key changes. Spotify wants two key changes. And he believes that the law, the DMA,
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:48:01.040]   forces it. One, allow an alternative option for in-app purchases on iOS to allow developers and
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:04.880]   companies to have direct communications to the consumers. That is a real burn the saddle for
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:09.680]   Spotify. And a lot of companies that Apple protects the privacy of the user and does not let the
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:17.840]   app developer have access to the user's identity. Um, and Spotify says this is the, uh, this is the
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:25.360]   clause of the DMA that gives them legal clout. The gatekeeper shall not require end users to use
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:31.120]   or business users to use to offer or to interoperate with an identification service,
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:37.120]   a web browser engine, or a payment service or technical services that support the provision of
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:44.720]   payment services, et cetera, et cetera. Uh, of that gatekeeper in the context of services provided
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:49.120]   by the business users using that gatekeeper's core platform services. I'm sure in the original
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:56.560]   Dutch, it makes much more sense. But apparently that's the clause and I can see when this
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:59.840]   is, when this is, when this is set to music, it's going to be the highlights of the opera season.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:05.840]   I promise you Spotify doesn't like the 30% Apple tax and, and when they, when they use the word
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:11.920]   suppression, I'm guessing that there's, they're talking about the app approval process. I'm guessing
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:16.720]   I don't know what that, you know, the only one of these, these, these three things where I really
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:23.520]   do say that Apple should definitely give is the idea of allowing, uh, software developers to have
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:28.880]   a closer relationship with the users. I do understand, I do understand the privacy aspect of this,
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:34.160]   but nonetheless, I think it's way too hard to, it seems as though Apple is saying you don't get to
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:38.240]   exploit our users. Only we get to exploit our users. And sometimes in a company like barebone
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:43.360]   software, you know, our friends, Rich Ziegel and the rest there, it's like you kind of want to
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.800]   have a close relationship with barebones. You kind of want to have a close relationship with
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.560]   panic because they're great, they're great companies and they are probably going to do you
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:54.800]   extremely great. And the idea of making it harder for you to develop that relationship with your
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:59.680]   customers also harder for you to figure out who are our customers. What are they responding to?
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:04.400]   What are, what part of the segment, what segment of the marketplace are we ignoring
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:08.800]   here and that we should probably be, uh, be, uh, be trying to appeal to? I think those are really,
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:13.200]   really important things. And I think that Apple, again, at least needs to explain why this is such
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:17.440]   an important thing that, that there's such a strict ban on it. Well, 95, says Apple had a
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:22.320]   representative at the stakeholder workshop who spoke on the topic. And again, I think in the
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:27.840]   original Flemish, this might make more sense of fostering contestability, web-based apps,
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:33.280]   sideloading and alternative app stores, compliance models, uh, credit nine to five,
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:37.360]   what Apple's really saying is it, it believes the app store model is the best approach for
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:43.040]   security and privacy. But they acknowledged that they will have a legal obligation to comply with
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:48.080]   the digital markets act. And Spotify said, well, Apple doesn't really have a monopoly on security
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:54.320]   and privacy. And, uh, it's better for everyone to encourage more competition. I think, I think that
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:51:00.320]   the, uh, as a user, I don't want to give up my privacy because a user, I don't want to, if, if you,
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:05.520]   if there's some reason that you give me in the app to go to your website and download, you know,
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:09.360]   and to get more information or something and build that relationship up 100% behind it. But if I
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:13.120]   download your app, I don't want you to have my information because when I delete that app,
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:18.480]   because I decided I didn't like it anymore, you still have all my information. And if you look at how
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:23.360]   gooey, if you, one thing Apple's start is, has gotten good at with the, with ATT is you're like,
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:27.360]   really, you're selling my data? Like, this isn't, can we use your data for our own use? This is,
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:31.680]   can we sell this data to other people? That's when that every time you see that little window
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:38.560]   come up, remember it, they're asking, can I use you as a product? You know, and, and, and so,
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:44.160]   that's how often they are using us as a product. And so that's why we don't as users, I don't want
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.760]   to give them that information. I don't want to, you know, I don't want to, I don't want them sharing
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:52.480]   it. I don't want to, I'm not by buying their app. I'm not giving them the, I don't, I'm not,
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:57.920]   I'm not okay. And now if Apple says, I think the step that Apple will probably take, which I think
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:04.320]   is probably fine is can, or do you want to share your contact information with this app developer?
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:08.560]   And that can be something that comes up and 70% will probably do the same thing with that they do
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:14.080]   with ATT, which is no, you know, like, and so, but, but the giving the, you know, I think giving the
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:19.120]   user choice to have that happen, I think is probably okay, forcing Apple to do it to every person that
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:24.240]   buys it, not okay, you know, and I think that I don't think that I think that you're going to find
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:30.080]   more and more people are getting as they realize how much they're being just resold, like, you know,
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:36.880]   like a market pig, that they, that they, they're going to realize that people are going to start
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.080]   turning more and more against it. For a while, we were in this turn where everyone thought,
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:43.520]   well, you're just going to give up all your privacy. I don't, that's not the direction that most of
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:47.520]   the world's going now. Most of the world's going to, I don't want to share anything, you know,
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:51.120]   and Apple's making that possible. We wouldn't even have the ability to say, I don't want to share
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:56.800]   anything if the iOS didn't exist. And so I think that, because everyone, everyone else wants to,
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.880]   wants our data, you know, and so I think that that's going to be, that's a harder one. I think the
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:05.280]   biggest problem for Spotify is that they're falling behind, you know, Apple music, I use both Apple
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:09.840]   music and Spotify almost equally, just because I have some playlists on Spotify that I haven't
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:14.000]   been able to get out of Spotify. And I'll just tell you that the operating, I find that the, that
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.640]   Apple has passed them, you know, as far as ease of use across all my devices and my system,
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:24.480]   in the ecosystem, I think Spotify has bigger problems than, than, than, than just being able to get
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:31.200]   in and out. It's just not as good an app anymore. I still eat Spotify, but I do see your point.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:36.560]   I think I wonder, I wonder what spot, if why Spotify is still not making the same commitments to
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:40.480]   high resolution audio, not making the same commitments to, I mean, they've been announcing it.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:45.600]   They've been at all on content. Yeah. And that's, that's bad too. I do, I do like Spotify because
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:50.000]   I have the opposite sort of experience, but that just shows you how experiences are different
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.560]   across users. I do find that Spotify, it's very, very, I love the, I love the fact that
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:59.920]   I'm listening to, I'm listening to Spotify on one device and I have the Spotify app on my phone
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:04.080]   and realize, Oh, you're, you're playing it through your TV and your home speakers right now.
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:08.320]   Would you like to me to take over and just act as a controller for you? Or would you like to
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:13.040]   override that without being quite so modal about it? But yeah, it's, it's a thing.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:17.680]   One thing that still hurts my heart is the acquisition of Prime Fonic, which is the classical
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:22.720]   music app that I subscribe to and loved and Apple has yet to replace it with something.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:27.040]   In every case, you know, whether it's Spotify, Amazon, music, YouTube, music, Apple music,
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:30.960]   they have classical, but it's, you know, it's all mixed in. It's just not as good an experience
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:35.600]   as Prefont, Prefont, I was and I, you know, sad that they've never, I mean, they killed it and they
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:41.120]   have yet to replace it. They say they're gonna, it drives me nuts. Every single time I want to
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:46.080]   hear classical music, I'm compelled to go through an unpleasant process to get to it.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:54.400]   Mike, my only real complaint about Apple music is that it's, it's so melded into the,
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:55:01.200]   the, the, the streaming service that if you want to listen to music files locally,
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:06.080]   which is not the, I'm not the way that most people listen to, but it's not as though it's like this
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:09.920]   free. You ever go on an airplane, you need it, you have to have, yeah. And the way that they make
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:14.640]   it really, really confusing about here are your files, here are the stuff that you actually own.
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:19.280]   Here's the stuff that you've got on your home web server. Here's the stuff that you have like,
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:24.960]   in a, in a directory on your drive. No, I don't know Apple. I don't need you to re-organize this.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:30.160]   No, I don't want you to replace these files with Apple music files. I don't want to have
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:34.960]   be in a position where I've got my device out someplace else. And I suddenly realized that I
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:38.800]   can't listen to this stuff on the plane because I forgot to sync or because I forgot to tell Apple
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:43.600]   that this is something that I want to take with me. I really wish that there were something that was
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:48.480]   more like iTunes, even if there were, even if it were a separate app, this is to create this
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:54.400]   really wonderful app just for listening to local music files. I know Vox is not the be all and end
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:58.560]   all, but that's why I pay a lot of money for a Vox subscription because I have all my stuff stored
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:03.840]   on Vox and that's what it is basically. It doesn't have a streaming component. You just, you, you,
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:09.040]   down. I think a few weeks ago, I recommended another free app that was, it was, I loved it.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:14.320]   I still use it because it really is like iTunes, like iTunes pre-Apple music service.
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:18.320]   Remember that. Yeah, what was it? Third party opportunity. I have to, I have to tag into it to
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:23.280]   find it. Somebody will find it though. Somebody remember. Yes. And Apple, you know, ScooterX just
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:30.000]   posted another Mac rumor saying 16.4 beta two has, has classical music. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've been
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:35.120]   hearing it after a long time. I'm not getting my hopes up on that one. Now, I think it's just,
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.560]   I think it's just because Johnny, I think it's just because the people inside Apple like to listen
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:44.480]   to Prime Phonic, then what let us use it either? It just hurts my heart. I mean, it's not the end
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:51.200]   of the world. I can find classical music, blah, blah, blah, blah, yeah. Sad. And it's just one more
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:57.840]   way that the pop world has dumped on the, on the great music of our, of our life.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:03.360]   So do I mean my Peter Biscala? Come on. So to speak. I know. And the other reason I bring
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:07.520]   up is because I know you and I agree on this one thing. He's killing it and longer and forgot
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:15.360]   say, so no speakers are going to support Apple music spatial audio starting March 28th. Apple
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:20.400]   isn't the only source of spatial music. I know Spotify and Amazon both say they have it. It's
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:25.440]   and I think it's Dolby at most in all cases, right? Unfortunately, I don't have any of the
[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:32.240]   speakers that will support this. Not the older Sonos speakers. You'll need an era 300,
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:37.520]   the arc or a second generation beam sound bar. But if you have though, and I, you know,
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:42.960]   I listen to Sonos music on my moves, but they are not, they're not supported apparently. So,
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:47.840]   no spatial for you. I have to say, and Jason, I know you didn't, you did a review of the,
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:55.280]   the new HomePod, newly released HomePods. And your biggest complaint was that they dropped out,
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:00.080]   and I have experienced some of that. But I put HomePods, I replaced the minis with full-sized
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:05.920]   HomePods in our bedroom, one on Lisa's, I went on mine. And the spatial audio on it is really,
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:10.000]   actually, really good. I can, as I wander, I don't know how they're doing this, but I say,
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.800]   I wander around, I even go around the corner into the bathroom. It still feels full stereo and
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:19.040]   spatial. It really sounds great. So I don't know what trick they're pulling there and the sound
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.680]   quality, I think, is just as good as the original HomePods.
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:27.520]   They're doing a lot of processing on the old one and the new one, right? The spatial audio is,
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:33.520]   ultimately, it's got multiple stems of audio. And then on the device or devices, they're computing
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:40.400]   their place and maybe your place. And then they're creating a kind of a dynamic mix where they're
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:47.440]   trying to, you know, bounce things around and get it to feel like you're not getting sort of one
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:53.440]   sound or two sounds left and right. And sometimes it is magic and sometimes it's not. Although I have
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:59:00.960]   to laugh, sometimes with things like a two-point source like headphones, you end up with this thing,
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:08.640]   which is what, like, it's just headphones. It can't match up with seven speakers. And the answer is
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:13.920]   frequently like, yeah, but you only have two ear holes, right? So there's a lot like, like...
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:18.080]   It's really amazing what they could do. You could, right? Like in the end, it is...
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:23.600]   When you put up seven speakers or eight speakers, it really is just sound bouncing off walls going
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:28.640]   in your two ear holes. So if they can emulate that, and sometimes they can do that and sometimes it
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:32.640]   works well and sometimes it doesn't. But I appreciate what they're trying to do. Sometimes, you know,
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:38.560]   like in my home theater, it sounds great. In my ears on AirPods, I don't know, I could take it or
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:44.160]   leave it. Sometimes I prefer the regular stereo mix at that point. But I think it's a fun idea.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:49.760]   And that in certain circumstances, it can really sound more isolated and kind of full
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:54.720]   than if you only got two sources, right? Because in the end, that's what it is, is they just got
[00:59:54.720 --> 01:00:01.600]   more sources and are doing more dynamic output by the little computer that lives inside those speakers.
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:07.200]   There's only, as you kind of try to fake it around for someone without having the street speakers,
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.880]   there's only so much resolution you can have. So that's the big problem is you can't have the
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:16.880]   resolution of where those things are. I do a fair bit where I have doing stuff in 5.1 and 7.1.2 and,
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:21.840]   you know, 5.1.4, 7.1.2, 5.1. And there's just a lot of more places to put it. There's a lot of
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.560]   calculations that we do specifically when we get into height that you're doing this kind of
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:32.720]   comb filter that tells your brain that it's above you. And in those areas, as we start to calculate
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:38.320]   that, it becomes your mix, it's just very hard to separate everything out. When you have those
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:43.680]   explicit speakers, you get a lot more resolution. And so that's the big advantage. But I think that,
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.360]   I mean, the spatial audio works pretty well. I mean, I do think that it makes a big difference.
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.520]   What we find is that if you fill up, I have to compose for some of this up at times. And
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:57.120]   when I don't compose, I mix, but we're build the system to mix it. And when you start filling all
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:01.120]   that space out, you are hearing things that are just coming down the center channel will sound
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:06.480]   more centered because your brain is being tickled into those, you know, by those other things. And
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.320]   it builds a bigger space in your head. So I think the spatial audio is pretty interesting.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:14.560]   I have to admit that when Sonos bricked my hardware, I stopped buying them. I'll never buy them again.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:18.720]   Like, like, I'll never, like, Sonos doesn't even show up on my radar. Like it doesn't,
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.640]   the product doesn't exist anymore.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.120]   Yeah, that hurt that hurt. We have a lot of Sonos.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.800]   I have 14 of them studio. Yeah.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:25.440]   I have 14 of them.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.840]   How many do we have in any or John, you know, you ever count them?
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:34.640]   Six fives and a three. Whatever that I for 13, 33 to me. But anyway,
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:40.880]   and then there's new speakers era speakers are the are the ones that specifically are supporting
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:48.800]   spatial, but they're 450 bucks. I think the home pods sound great at 150 bucks less than that.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:54.400]   So I'm pretty happy with a big home pods. I did note, Jason, that I get the dropout you're
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:58.240]   talking about where they lose pairing and then one turns on and the other one turns off and it
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.960]   goes, that's extremely annoying. It happened to me most when I was airplane from a Mac.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:06.640]   When I'm airplane from my phone, it doesn't seem to happen that often.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:12.160]   It does happen, but yeah, it's variable. I tried it with all the devices and sometimes it works
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:16.320]   and sometimes it doesn't and the stereo pair adds difficulty to the whole thing.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:20.960]   It's so bad when it happens that you really, it's a, you know, it really stands out. But when it
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.720]   works, and mostly when I'm just saying, you know, I'm mostly just saying, hey, Shlomo,
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:31.200]   play me some, you know, fine music. And I listen to that and I'm walking around getting ready for
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.440]   work or whatever. It sounds great. I have to say, I'm really pleased I put those in the bedroom.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.480]   So they're good. And we have, we still have Sonos and a lot of other, we have Sonos in the
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:47.280]   kitchen and a lot of other places. And those are great speakers. I was wrong spotify. I thought
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:53.920]   they did. They don't offer 3D spatial sound, but Amazon does. My problem with Amazon unlimited is
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:59.360]   it's half podcast ads now. I'm going to there because I want to listen to music. I know where
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:05.440]   to find podcasts. You don't need to flog them. And I speak as a podcaster. So I don't know what
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:12.000]   Amazon's just like all in on podcasts. Spotify used to be. I wonder now that they're losing money
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.240]   on it. I'm not sure that they have the same joy and thrill in podcasting that we hear on the other
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:23.680]   side do. All right, let's take a little break. When we come back, I will do all the rumors. There
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:30.560]   are so many, so many rumors. And some of them very, very, very exciting. So we'll talk about that in
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:38.160]   just a little bit. Andy Inaco, WGBH Boston from office hours.globalalexlindz and back
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:45.200]   from his walkabout in New Zealand, Mr. Jason Snell, six colors.com. You might have noticed when
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:51.360]   you see the full studio, the beautiful signage for those great folks at ACI learning. I want to
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:57.440]   tell you about ACI learning, not only are they studio sponsors, but you know them because
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:05.200]   ACI learning merged with ITPro. Actually, it's been more than a year now. And so all of you and
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:14.560]   many of you I know have become ITPro users. You should know that ITPro has paired with ACI learning
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:22.160]   and now can do so much more. Not just ITPro, but auditPro. They've got practice labs.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:28.000]   They even now have hubs, places where you can go in person for in-person instruction. And you
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.200]   can mix and match. And I love that. The most tech savvy people in the world serve in the military,
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:39.040]   right? That's a great way to get your first tech chops. But then, you know, you're mustering out,
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:44.240]   you got to decide how to transition to civilian life. ACI learning wants you to know they
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:50.320]   proudly support veterans who are looking for a civilian career in IT or cybersecurity.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:56.880]   Those vets are really ready. They're really good workers. They're smart. And they often have a
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:02.480]   lot of experience from the military. And now you can get that job. The Bureau of Labor Statistics
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:11.520]   reported IT will add over 667,000 new jobs between now and 2030. Veterans are so perfectly
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:15.840]   qualified for these vacancies. Because in many cases, you've already used the most advanced
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:24.480]   technology in the world. And of course, security is number one job number one with IT in the
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:29.360]   in the military. Many service members already have the training to protect systems from attacks.
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:34.560]   IT is a natural transition for you. If you like that, you really ought to consider ACI learning.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:40.560]   IT is a huge field, of course. Many opportunities that are very popular, especially for veterans
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:46.640]   including cybersecurity. Did you know the average salary for a cybersecurity specialist is 116,000
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:53.280]   a year? ACI learning's information security analyst and cybersecurity specialist programs
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:59.200]   can help vets start their career. Network administration also a great place to start.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:03.600]   You know, you'll always have a job if you know how the network runs the average salary for an entry
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:10.000]   level entry level network administrator is 75k. ACI learning's network support specialist program
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.480]   provides the training needed to pursue or advance a career in networking. So you're ready to take
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:21.200]   the CCNA cert or the CompTIA security or network certification exams. Those certs are a great way
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:27.760]   to get that job. IT project management also important the average salary of an IT project manager,
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:34.640]   a hundred five thousand dollars a year projected to grow 11% in the next 10 years. ACI learning's
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:39.200]   senior technology project manager program, certified students and the skills they need to
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:45.920]   become a project manager. The world awaits you and we need you. We desperately, desperately need you.

[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:24.240]   I'm excited about some of these rumors. In fact, I've had to rethink my my Mac buying strategy based on
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:34.000]   one of these. Is this a surprise, Jason, that maybe the new 15 inch MacBook Air will have an M3 in it?
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.600]   I didn't think that was going to happen. I am not a believer, but it would be a big surprise
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:45.120]   for them to turn over from the M2 to the M3 in less than a year. Remember that was a WWDC
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.960]   announcement last year of the M2. And so if the M3 is coming sooner rather than later,
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:57.840]   I'd be a little surprised. I think the real question is sequencing. Is this 15 inch MacBook or
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:05.760]   MacBook Air coming out soon? And then there will be a M3 version of the MacBook 13 inch
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:10.800]   MacBook Air that we know and love. According to the rumor. According to the rumor. But yeah,
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:15.840]   that's I guess there will be for sure. But will it be this year? Will it be this summer? Will it be
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:21.760]   this spring? But I guess my question is the sequences. Would you, if your Apple come out with this
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:28.480]   big 15 inch laptop that you want that's not a pro with an M2 and then three or four months later,
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:36.640]   go to M3. Or would you hold off and release an M3 air and the 15 inch together? And I think,
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:42.320]   you know, from the outside, that's what it looks like. But from the inside, it may entirely be that
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:47.840]   the 15 inch was always intended to be the trail end of the M2 generation and that the M3 generation
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:52.640]   would start with the air. And you know, from the outside here, we look in and we go, well, wait,
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.880]   why don't you ship those things together? And so now we've got two rumors, one of which says they're
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:02.720]   going to ship together as M3 laptops. And the other says, no, this 15 inches much further along.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:07.360]   And it's going to come first and there and it'll be an M2, which I think is reasonable.
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.520]   But you know, the only the only thing is, if your Apple, you're you might say, well, are we not
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:17.040]   going to sell as many of these because we're going to eclipse it with the M3 in a few months? And I
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:22.480]   that's a good question. Because I think ideally they would ship them together. But it may be that,
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:27.200]   you know, the truth is that they needed the extra time after they shipped the 13 inch to ship the
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:32.960]   15 inch. And do they want to wait until the summer? I don't know. But I mean, it's exciting that the
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:38.880]   idea that the M3 could be coming at the three nanometer process, maybe even ahead of where the
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:43.200]   iPhone ships have been, which would be a first for the Mac version of Apple. So it would be an
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:47.280]   interesting statement because right now it's a laggard, right? You put it first in the iPhone and
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:52.720]   then you put it in the Mac late like a lot later, maybe a year later. And that's even though we know
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:58.400]   they're different, you know, they're really different chips. It would be kind of nice for the Mac to
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:03.360]   get the pride of place for once. Yeah, it would it would be great. And for people who might say,
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:07.040]   well, what about the iPhone? The iPhone's the most important effect is the iPhone uses an A chip,
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:11.840]   right? And other than nerds who are saying, well, what kind of core is in there, right? The rest of us,
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:18.560]   if Apple says, no, no, for this time around, we're actually going to do the new cores in a Mac first,
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.640]   and then the new cores will come to the iPhone later, I don't think it really matters in the end,
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:27.520]   but it would be fun to see, right? That rather than debuting your cores and your phone and then
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:32.480]   having it come to your computers later, maybe this time around, whether it's CPU cores or GPU
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:39.120]   cores or both, and this new three nanometer process that they're not on for the iPhone to have it
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:44.240]   debut in the M3, that would be pretty sweet. And it feels right to me. It feels like this.
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:48.960]   The M2 was German Mark Gurman at Bloomberg called it a stopgap, but it feels kind of like,
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:54.560]   and one in M2, we're all about just like getting on Apple Silicon. And then M3 is obviously the
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:57.840]   next wave of like, well, now we're taking the process size down and we're going to do some
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:03.280]   next generation stuff. And that's really exciting. That might be this summer. That's really exciting.
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:10.640]   We know that TSMC is what we've heard. The TSMC is producing these three nanometer chips, the M3s
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:18.320]   now 45,000 wafers a month. It's not in the volume that you'd need, frankly, for an iPhone, but it
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:24.320]   might be the volume you need for a Mac. So there's somewhat of a war. Ming-Chi-quo says, no, no, no,
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:30.240]   the 15 inch MacBook or is it MacBook Air? We don't know what it's going to be called. We'll have an
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:37.440]   M2 or M2 pro in it. Gurman says, mmm, I hear it's going to be an M3,
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:44.560]   which would really screw up my buying plans. There's also, of course, the issue of a 24 inch
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:51.440]   iMac. He says that's coming. He says, with an M3, this is a Gurman with M3. He says,
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:56.400]   Apple is scheduled to watch about three new Macs between late spring and summer, summer being
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:01.280]   WWC, I think. Yes. Summer with, I think that's like late,
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:07.920]   in WWDC is almost late spring actually. Right. It's early June. So, yeah. Okay. So he says,
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:13.920]   I am told Apple is launching three new Macs between late spring and summer. Those three models are
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:20.560]   likely to be the first 15 inch MacBook Air J five 15, the first Mac pro. Oh, yeah, the Mac pro,
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:26.320]   whatever happened to that with homegrown Apple chips, the J 180 and an update to the 13 inch
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:32.880]   MacBook Air, the J five 13. And he says, the remaining question is which processors will these
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:38.160]   run? We already know the Mac pro will include the M2 ultra. Oh, do we know that? Okay, which will
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:46.320]   provide up 24 CPU core 76 graphic cores top out with 192 gigabytes of RAM. We also know that
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:52.160]   Apple has developed the next iMac on the same timeline as the M3 chip. So Mark says I'd expect
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:59.200]   it. That means by the way, he's not this is not what he's heard. This is what he's predicting. So,
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:04.960]   I expected to be one of the companies first M3. So important. Renee Richie told us how to read
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:13.040]   Mark's that's right. Mark's rumors. So this is his thinking, not his sources. That would be
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:17.440]   when he was at nine to five, it was all sources. But Bloomberg is like, but the narrative, you must
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:22.480]   have the narrative. And so now he has to do that kind of like, well, I expect and all of that to be
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:28.320]   one of the companies first M3 based machines. This is the yeah, the iMac. But the chip destined
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:34.320]   for the new MacBook Air models is slightly less clear. And remember that quote said M2.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.960]   Gurman says, if those machines launched in a few months of the M2 chip, they'll quickly become
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:44.240]   outdated. That's what you were saying, Jason, a 15 inch MacBook Air with an M2 may still excite
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:51.440]   consumers. But a new M2 13 inch MacBook Air is unlikely to be compelling. We already have an M2
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:56.640]   13 inch MacBook Air. Yeah, that's the part that I thought was especially perplexing is Mark Gurman's
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:01.440]   report says there's going to be a new MacBook Air model. And he doesn't know whether it'll be an M2
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:07.760]   or an M3. And I see it in three marks. Mark's a smart guy. But duh, of course, it's an M3. Like,
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:14.320]   what, unless like, no, it's the same, but they changed the colors or something. Like that's a,
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:19.520]   that's a dumb dumb product. So my boss. So the MacBook Air has got to be an M3, right? So the
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:26.400]   question really is, do you release an M2 15 inch laptop knowing it's going to be surpassed by an
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:30.720]   M3 and just figuring, look, people are just going to want the 15 inch laptop. They're not going to
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:37.040]   care. Or do you hold on to that product and release it at the same time? I think the reason you would
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:42.320]   release it early is because you've been making them for a while now. And they're on another production
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:47.040]   track and you need to get them out the door. And they just didn't line up. And as we see with the
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:52.480]   iPad, especially Apple is actually not afraid to release products in a sequence that don't make
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:58.320]   sense. Because they've done it when they have to with other products that are in like the, like,
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:03.280]   the iPad that's got the weird pencil and but it's got the good placement of the camera and like,
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:06.640]   they're all over the place with that. And sometimes that has to do with whatever is happening on the
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:11.520]   inside in terms of manufacturing. So it may be that they're, you know, they're remaining M2 chips
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:16.800]   are going to go in this 15 inch laptop. And then separately, they've got this new air and they and
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:21.120]   they'll say to themselves, yeah, yeah, yeah, and the fall or the winter will put the M3 in that 15
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:24.720]   inch laptop too. But we're not worried about it for now. Are they trying to get on a yearly
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:29.840]   case? Is it in their interest? I understand now in the early days, you're kind of stagger
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:33.200]   stepping. But eventually you'd want to do a yearly cadence of all this stuff.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:38.160]   German says, I mean, german says it weirdly. He says they they have said they want to go on a yearly
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:43.200]   cadence. And I know they've never said that for the series chip. But given that the A series is on
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.160]   the yearly cadence, I think it would be great. Because the alternatives are either these 18
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:54.240]   months cadences where you have to skip certain generations. Two years is too far. So yeah, I think
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:58.320]   in the end, what they'd like and what we're starting to see is maybe they want the chips every year.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:04.240]   But the some of the model skip years, right? So the iMac skipped a year. Maybe the Mac
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.480]   Studio skips a year. The Mac Pro will certainly skip a year. And so maybe you'll end up in a
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:14.400]   situation where like Macbook Air and Macbook Pro get updated every year. And then at Mac Mini and
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:19.680]   iMac and a few other models, it's a it's an every other year kind of thing. And that would would not
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:24.800]   be a little at all. Yeah. Yeah. I guess some of this is dependent just as they used to be
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:30.960]   dependent on Intel. They're now dependent on TSMC and what TMC SMC can do. But they the story was
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:38.000]   they had bought up all the three nanometer chips. Yeah. So they got them. However many that is.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:47.520]   So he says last year, Apple introduced the first M2 chip at WWDC in June. If Apple were to stick
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:53.440]   again, this is his speculation to stick to last year's schedule and M3 chip alongside a new Mac
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:18:00.240]   book air WWDC 23 would make sense. The company could then follow up with the M3 iMac later in the
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:08.000]   year and the M3 Pro and M3 Max based MacBook Pros in 2024. He says the M3 will also land next year
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:14.320]   in a revamp. This is the most exciting paragraph, frankly, in a revamped iPad Pro with OLED screens
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:20.080]   scheduled for the first half of 2024 and looking further into the future, even more exciting Mac
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:25.360]   upgrades as early as 2025. And this is the line I like that likely includes the first MacBooks
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:32.640]   with OLED screens and touch support. Hmm. That's an interesting roadmap. Again, this is Mark's
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:38.480]   speculation. You have to go back a few paragraphs to where he's been told things.
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:43.600]   And he's previously reported that about the touch that they were. Yeah. Yeah. We've talked
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:48.560]   about it in his. Yeah. It's good to get we're getting out the 2025 rumors now. I mean, we'll
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:53.840]   get why not we can. Yeah. I saved him for the second half of the show. It's below the fold.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:58.880]   We can talk about it now. I am for the next two years. Yeah. I know.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:08.480]   I mean, I just bought the M2 MacBook Air and I love it as you did. It's great. It's great. Amazing.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:15.760]   Yeah. It's so good. But boy, I also was, I would have if I could have, but I needed it, but I would
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:20.560]   would have held off for an M3. I'm very excited. I feel like the M3 is the next big leap,
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:23.280]   not the M2. The M2, as you said, is a stop cap.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:29.680]   And when you get to the bottom of the list, it's always that do you need a Mac now? Yes.
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.960]   Okay. Then get it back now. Oh, yeah. There's no, there's no three in the bed.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:37.920]   There's lots of handy. So long as you didn't find that one page on the Apple store that still has
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:43.840]   an Intel Intel CPU in it. There's nothing. Because I mean, it would bum me. It would bum me out if
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:49.120]   they came out with an M3 based Mac mini like in October, because I'm almost certainly going to be
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:56.160]   buying one like in the spring. But it's like I so desperately need a Mac mini right now.
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.600]   And it's going to be so much of a leap over what I want to do. And it's going to have a good
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:07.360]   five years worth of life. But again, if they say, oh, Apple, Andy bought his Mac and April,
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:11.360]   time to introduce a new one in May. Well, that was my life story for decades, right?
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:16.960]   And I think I'd have to take that personally. Yeah. I think that what I really love about the
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:21.680]   Mac minis. And I have so many of them is that you buy them, they still do what they want them to do.
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:29.760]   You can use them. I literally have one here that is 12 years old. Wow. And what it does is this.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:35.280]   See, my little, my little, yeah, that's all it does. It's it's there in 12 years later.
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:40.000]   Yeah, we have an old one in the conference room for our zoom. Yeah, they're great. They just
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.680]   and so they have and they don't have to do all the other things that didn't pay extra. I paid for
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:48.800]   a CPU and some connections and some, you know, and it's and I buy them all the time and I buy
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:53.760]   them without a lot of regret because I know that I'll just keep using them for what they're what
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:59.280]   they're good at. And the M ones and the M and I have an M two, I'm going to use them for a long
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:03.360]   I mean, I'll use them for another decade. Part of the excitement about getting a new Mac mini is
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:09.280]   knowing that my 2012 Mac mini that's going to be replacing won't be going into storage. It won't
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:15.360]   be given away. It's the excitement is, Oh, what can now what can I use this Mac mini for if it's
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:19.440]   just something that's going to be on all the time and able to do just background processes.
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:25.200]   It's like, Oh, do I do I have a Mac mini as my Plex server? Like, no, no, no, that's that's that's
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:30.080]   not enough. That's not enough for to do. Let's have it. It's it's, you know, we because we had kids that
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:35.360]   had, you know, 12 Mac minis at a time because they're just glue. They did all of our scopes,
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:38.640]   audio scope. There's Mac minis for the audio scopes. I'm Mac minis for the video scopes,
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:43.520]   Mac mini for all these other things. And so we just have them a walk we're a wash with Mac minis.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:48.400]   And we always have we have been for the last decade. And they're just again, that's why I'm always
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:53.840]   like, this is the easiest thing for me to buy. And then everything else, I'm like, wow, how long
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:59.600]   is that going to last? And what am I going to do with that? You know, so the 13 inch Macbook Air
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:05.520]   with the M2 came out July. So it would be almost a year if they announced an M3 based version
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:09.680]   in June at WWDC, which is when they announced the
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:15.040]   year. It would be exactly a year. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. And then a 15, it would make sense
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:21.600]   to wait till then the here's the problem. Ross Young, another supply chain guy who's usually
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.640]   very accurate, says the 15 is going to be in April.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:31.520]   Yeah, and they're looking at the factories, right? So unless something weird happened,
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.320]   and there's no M3 wouldn't be ready for it. It couldn't be an M3 if that's the case.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:41.040]   Yeah. Yeah. If they're building them now for an April release,
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:47.120]   he's turning into Jim Dowerimple. There's his tweet. Yep.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:51.440]   He forgot to renew the trademark.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:23:00.000]   So I don't know. What do we think? What is our consensus?
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:06.160]   I'm going to assume that you don't have the same sources as a german,
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.280]   Russ Young isn't calling you on the phone. No, I'm not. I'm not rooting around in those
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:18.720]   factories either, but my gut feeling is that that 15 has been rumored for so long. So it's
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:24.160]   reading the rumors, right? I think that 15 inch laptop is real and an M2 and is going to happen.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:29.600]   Yeah. And then and it's the and what's causing the confusion is we're watching the end of the M2
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:34.880]   cycle, but up against the beginning of the M2 cycle. And so this is a this is a follow on.
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:41.440]   Remember that air got really delayed too. So I suspect that the air's delay led to the 15 inch
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:47.600]   laptop delay and has slid it all the way back to almost when they're ready to turn it over to M3.
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:51.920]   But that's my guess. And I think the truth is, and somebody in the in our IRC chat said this point,
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:55.520]   and I think you're absolutely right, people who are buying Apple's consumer level laptops,
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:24:02.080]   the MacBook Air, whether it's the 13 or the 15, do not deeply, deeply care about specs at a level
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:07.840]   where they're going to necessarily shy away from an M2 15 inch laptop, just because there's also an
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:12.960]   M3 13 inch laptop, because what's going to motivate them to buy that 15 inch laptop is not M2 versus
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:17.840]   M3. It's the screen size, right? That's what's going to motivate them. So I think in the end,
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:21.760]   they won't lose a lot of of sales for that. So I think that's most likely. And then the 13
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:26.080]   inch will just get the M3 this summer and and motor along. I mean, I think when you're buying it,
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:29.520]   I mean, with the air, I think a lot of the consumers are just looking at what bag it fits in. You know,
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:34.080]   like, does it? Absolutely. I mean, because I have a bag that doesn't reason I got the 14 inches,
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:39.520]   I have a bag that doesn't fit the 16 inch. Now I'm not happy with the 14 inch for me, but but I bought
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:43.920]   it. Never let your bags take your purchases. If you're not a pro,
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:50.080]   they all do they all do what you want if you're not a pro. So when the and I think that's the
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:54.720]   motivation behind that 15 inch laptop, if it does exist, is it really it's just like some people just
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:01.280]   want a bigger screen. I don't want to pay to grand for a MacBook Pro or even more for the 16 inch.
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:05.600]   They just want a bigger screen on a on what and probably it comes from people buying the MacBook
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:10.480]   Air and Apple going to them in a survey and saying like, what would you change? And the answer being,
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:14.640]   I'd like a bigger screen, right? And they're like, okay, that's an interesting idea. So I think
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:18.880]   it'll just be, I mean, I'm curious what Andy and Alex think, but that's if I had to bet that would
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:22.160]   be my bet is that it's just going to be an M2 and they'll do the M3 later.
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:27.920]   Yeah, I think so. I agree. I'm interested to hear what people have to say about how,
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:34.160]   I mean, Alex mentioned like the famous prison lunch tray MacBook, like the 17 inch, which is
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:40.720]   when you when you you you the number 17 is a number you're familiar with. You think you have an idea of
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:46.960]   how big this MacBook is until the first time you actually see one and you're like, though,
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:53.120]   that's that's bigger than is that I think is that 17 feet or 17 inches? And I'm always
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.720]   always curious about like,
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:26:02.640]   are is there a poor is there a mobile external display solution that would do the trick for
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:05.920]   you for for having extra screen real estate? You know, when you just want,
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:10.960]   because it's it's it's a hard that you really do need a special bag to carry this around it.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:14.960]   It's not going to fit into my backpack. I mean, I have a rush 24 that I would all that everything.
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:19.600]   I mean, I put two or three laptops in, you know, into my into my rush 24. I will admit three,
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:24.560]   but I you have a backpack that could serve you for like two months after the collapse of all
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:28.400]   civilization. So that's the best part about the four. I will say the one thing about the 14
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:33.840]   and 14 inches is it fits in that little pad against your back with an eye with an iPad, like
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:38.880]   you put them both in there. That's where I stick them. But the, but the 17 inch, the big thing was,
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:43.520]   is that you get to a location, you open it up and you don't have to do anything else. So I don't
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:47.360]   figure out how to plug things in or where to plug things in. I just open it up. It's on it's,
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:52.000]   you know, it's it's going to have a big battery. It's going to last a long time. If I'm on a flight,
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.040]   I could do real work, you know, so assuming that I'm not in economy economy, but I exactly when
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:03.520]   I had a 17 inch, I was mostly not an economy. So, so the, yeah, usually the right, the bigger the
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:10.320]   lap top, the bigger the seats. Well, a lot of apologies to the center seat. A lot of apologies
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:15.840]   to make that the left, the right. No, the thing is, is that I was when I was when I had a 17 inch,
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:22.080]   I will say what came with the 17 inch is a maniacal obsession with the exit row. So I always knew
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:25.520]   where the I was always like waiting right to when I could get into the exit row because back then
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:30.000]   you had to go the day before and, you know, go online and, and like the moment I was able to do
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.880]   what I would get on the exit row so I could get that extra so I could open it up because you
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:36.880]   couldn't open the 17 inch in economy or you'd be afraid of someone was going to open it against
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:40.560]   you. But the bottom line is you could open it up, you could open up a couple windows,
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:44.960]   you could do what you needed to do. And it was just, and it was powerful and it did all the
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:50.400]   things it needed to do. And I can only imagine what an M2 or M3 would with, you know, the kind of
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:57.040]   memory, I mean, battery, the battery probably last 20, 20, 30 hours on a 17 inch. And so it would be,
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:03.680]   you know, it'd be great. The 16 inch will be fine. It's fine. The, but the 17 inch was a great,
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:08.400]   was a great computer for a lot of us that were doing work on the road, like really doing like
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:15.120]   graphic work on the road. The 17 inch was, was really special, but nothing's ever been.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:20.000]   I think the 16 small bezels and stuff will come pretty close to scratching that edge.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:26.240]   I would think it might, it might, it might. Yeah. If I is 24 gigs enough for him, do you want more,
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:30.320]   you want more? Don't you? Yeah, I would always want more. But I mean, I think 32 is a good number
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:34.000]   for a lot of those things. But 24 is not too bad. You can do on a laptop, most of what you're
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.760]   going to do on a laptop. It's not, it's enough. I'll tell you the only reason I want, I have 24
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:43.120]   in my M2 backboard gear, but the only reason I'd want more is because I'm running Windows and
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:48.400]   there's an ex, you know, VM running that you would like to have a little extra RAM for that.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:53.120]   I mean, there's definitely things like I have, you know, I have some processes that I do that will
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:59.680]   not run under 64 gigs. Like, they literally won't. It just says there's not a frame. I can't,
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:04.480]   I can't do what you need me to do without more RAM. So those are photogrammetry and some,
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:09.840]   some other calculation stuff that is required that it needs to load everything into RAM or it
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:14.480]   starts swapping horribly, you know, so those are things that where the more RAM makes it,
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:18.080]   makes a difference. But it's usually a lot of texture maps or a lot of parallel processes or a
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:23.280]   lot of other things that are pretty deep edge cases. I think most people are fine with that.
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:28.880]   Thing that makes me drool and I'm still going to root for it is that June come June, WWDC,
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:34.480]   Apple announces a 15 inch MacBook Air with an M3 chip in it and 32 gigs of RAM.
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:39.200]   I still think the pro, I think the pro is probably what I would expect it dubbed up,
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:43.200]   you know, like that's the thing that I think is going to be the big, I think the pro potentially
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:47.520]   the goggles. Actually, I would buy the pro. It's not much thicker than the air and it has all
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:53.040]   those ports. So I guess I could, oh, I mean, the pro pro. I mean, the big pro, the Mac pro.
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:57.920]   I think the Mac pro was the one that it was. Oh, well, that's for developers. Yeah.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:03.760]   Right. I mean, that's when the when the pro that we have now, I believe was at a at a WWDC is when
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:08.000]   it was announced. So you think they'll do that to the exclusion of everything else and then
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.800]   and then like a month later? And I think that the goggles might be out.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:13.840]   The goggles. We're going to have that. Yeah. You know what? They're going to have a lot to
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:17.200]   talk about. You're right. You don't want to fill it up with too much stuff. Yeah. Yeah. And that'd
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:21.680]   be the only reason I wouldn't be surprised if they did the pro earlier just to get it out of the way.
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:25.600]   Like two weeks before, a little better a month before doing event, get the pro out of the way.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:29.280]   If they're going to do the goggles, they're going to want to talk about it as little as possible,
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:34.000]   you know, because that's going to be everything for them. So if they're doing that, if it doesn't
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.480]   happen this year, then we get to wait another year for AR, you know, like because it's the time
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:44.240]   to the possibly the time to announce it is March or April, the to wet, you know, wet everybody's
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:50.160]   appetite for WWDC. But otherwise, it's going to be WWDC is when you announce the goggles,
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:54.800]   you put it out as a developer, you tell people it's going to ship for developers only in September
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:59.600]   or October. And you kind of prep everybody with all the new classes of code.
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:02.560]   That reports out there already, right? I mean, I think we're pretty much guaranteed that
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:06.720]   WWDC is going to be an illicit slips further. If it works. And then Matt, yeah. And then Matt,
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:12.000]   I've heard, you know, I've heard from people who've heard from other people who've said that it's
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.480]   basically ready to go. I mean, remember, there was a there was a there was a there was a dubbed
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:25.040]   DC where there were all the graphics were in the shape of an Apple TV and no, and no, you never
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:30.560]   know, never Apple TV like there was no one I know like chickens before their hatch, but I know the
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:35.200]   Mac, the Mac Pro would be perfect for WWDC, right? Because that's the audience for it. And also,
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:42.560]   I would I would argue that there is something to be said for releasing your M2 ultra, but still M2
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:47.440]   based Mac Pro, a little in advance of you flipping the calendar over to.
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:51.040]   That's a good point. Don't mention him. Not exiting on the M3.
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:55.600]   I'll be really interested to see if the Mac Pro lets you swap the process around.
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:00.640]   That's good. That would be just it's enough.
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:06.000]   It'll be that you could do that you're thinking. Yeah. And it'll be part of the
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.960]   ongoing discussion of how does Apple define the word pro these days. And one of the things that
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:17.520]   still on the books is does pro mean on the desktop? It means that you can expand it later on or you
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:22.400]   can reconfigure it as your needs change or you know, if you're if you're spending if you're spending
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:28.160]   $10,000 for workstation where just the case itself has an $800 bill of materials,
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:32.880]   should you be okay to be able to replace this old processor with a new one?
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:38.720]   It is a good advantage of unified memory that that is now on the on the on the die.
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:44.560]   So it could put it in a card. I mean, some kind of card that yeah, as long as the bus is fast enough
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:50.880]   for disk I owe, it doesn't have to be fast enough for RAM anymore, like or GPU anymore.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:56.400]   So it does make sense. You could have a daughter card that is the CPU and the RAM and the GPU.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:33:02.480]   Those are all on a fast, fast, fast internal bus. And the drives don't have to be
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:09.360]   well, it's not just drives. It's it's having PCI, you know, like PC PCI cards are right.
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:14.960]   Yeah. So you have being able to add four to six cards, being able to have, you know,
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:19.280]   not so much ramp, you know, but external ramp. I mean, being able to swap out drives
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:24.560]   have external cards and have a lot of IO in it is a lot is a very valuable and the
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:31.360]   ability to switch that chip out or switch the card out would be a huge value as far as a pro
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:36.880]   pro app or a pro piece of no kidding. And totally doable because of unified memory and unified GPU.
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:41.760]   Totally doable. I think right. Does PC I get complicated?
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:48.560]   It works in my head. It works perfectly. It's so well. It's so amazing.
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:52.320]   So amazing. It works in my head.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:59.680]   Apple has released a 600 megabyte firmware update for your studio display.
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:06.240]   It's basically an iPhone with a with a giant screen. I was yeah.
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:11.120]   Yeah. This is beta firmware, but yes. So you have, do you have a studio display?
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:14.320]   Who has a studio? Anybody I do. And you're on the beta.
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:18.400]   I am not on the beta. So I don't know what beta good is. I'm missing.
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:19.440]   This is beta two.
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:22.720]   It's green 600 megabytes is the goodness.
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:24.720]   You're missing 600 megabytes.
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:30.000]   No release notes, no clues as to what's changed or improved with the release
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.600]   agreement on nine to five Mac public bills will be coming out later.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:35.840]   And at that point they will have to put out release notes.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:43.600]   I'm, you know, I'm still fascinated by why that display runs iOS that I'm sure there are all
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:47.440]   kinds of efficiencies they can get. I'm sure that saves some some problems running,
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.200]   running firmware. But I think all of us are still thinking about
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:56.000]   what are they building? What are they? What, how are they going to train?
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.640]   What's going to happen like in 2024, an update that says, congratulations, you now have an augmented
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:10.800]   reality, augmented reality display target or congratulations, you now have also a completely
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:15.040]   working Apple TV, or you now have an, you now have an independent iOS.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:22.000]   And now you don't know something that can sideload, excuse me, you now have something
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.440]   that can independently run iOS apps as to offload some of the processing power off of your
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:32.640]   iPad for using that as a productivity thing. I'm still flabbergasted as to what this thing
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:37.600]   could do running iOS. And finally, before we get to the picks of the week,
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:45.200]   some great talented pianist and composer from Toronto has turned the iPhone alarm into an
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:52.480]   entire concerto. I posted it on Insta. Let's see how many takedowns I can get for playing this.
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:36:02.400]   We'll just give it a shot and see.
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:14.720]   Oh, I like the little bass line here. It's a jazzy. I could dance to that.
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:23.200]   It's like the iPhones and credits music. I love theme from iPhone.
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:26.320]   The love themes in the iPhone. People bracing.
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:35.200]   It's a little more, it's dramatic. I think it's adding some backstory to the iPhone,
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:40.320]   you know, some drama, like maybe some broken hearts. Love gone wrong.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:49.280]   But it all ends in a redeeming third act. And the iPhone says goodbye to the iPod.
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:55.120]   Of course, of course, you know, the problem with this composition, if you're playing it in
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:37:00.800]   concert, how will you know that someone forgot to turn off their phone? That apparently happened.
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:08.560]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. It was a famous YouTube video of someone. Yeah. New York Philharmonic Orchestra in
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:18.240]   2012, Marimba. So there you go. This is Tony and I immediately opened down E and extracted the
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:22.800]   audio from this. I'm trying to decide if I should make it my ringtone. It seems a little over ambitious,
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:30.480]   perhaps for a ringtone. 18 million views on Israel. It's been liked 1.3 million times.
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:33.840]   And now just add one more view.
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:40.640]   Is that the hit they're saying on I'm more that it's the alarm?
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:45.280]   Is that the alarm? I don't hear that as an alarm. I thought it was a ringtone. But anyway,
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:49.920]   it's now an alarm. I guess. Yeah, it's a ringtone, isn't it? Yeah.
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:56.640]   It should be played on a Marimba. Let's face it. Let's face it. I didn't know this, but apparently
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:03.600]   this is John Anthony Dessato writing at imore.com. Apple's never revealed the creator and origins of
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:11.360]   Marimba. Although in a 2013 article by Forbes, Brian Romo notes the huge similarities between
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:16.960]   Marimba from the original iPhone and orchestra Marimba digital instrument from GarageBand
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:26.400]   Jampac 4 Symphony Pack Instruments released in 2005. So, uh, Remily makes a conclusion that
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:32.560]   GarageBand's software developer Gerhard Lingling could be the original creator of Marimba. Wouldn't
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:38.880]   that be funny if the kind of the distinctive world famous iPhone ringtone was created in GarageBand?
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:46.800]   It would be even funnier if it were like a later movement of a classical piece that is well
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:52.160]   known to like classical heads. And so, and, and kind of like how the Lone Ranger theme like was
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:57.040]   only only got stolen away from the original composer when it became the Lone Ranger theme.
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:02.320]   It's like now it's like, oh, this used to be a beautiful piece of music that I wrote my PhD thesis
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:08.960]   on and it was hard, but now it's just the ringtone that everybody gets annoyed by. Funny story. My
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:20.080]   washing machine, which was a Samsung plays this song when it's done. And I've invented lyrics for
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:25.520]   it. Right. Like, and now my wash is done and I am giving you the new clothes. It's so chunty.
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:31.520]   Yes. That is Schubert. It is called D. D. Florella. You can get orchestras and things playing it.
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:35.200]   And it's nothing funnier than hearing an orchestra play your washing machine song.
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:41.600]   So yeah, they're out there. Andy is telling the truth. It's a real thing. Samsung really loves
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:48.240]   having very music. Actually, all of my Japanese appliances are very, yeah, all the, all the,
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:52.480]   all the Asians, especially Korean appliances like to play music at the end. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:59.040]   I have a Samsung, I have this Samsung washer and dryer. And then I have the, you know,
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:05.120]   rice cooker and a water boiler and the sand. And I have everything sings to me. Oh, yeah.
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:08.320]   Whenever it's like, the rice cooker plays to make a little star. Yeah.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:16.800]   Yeah. Yeah. So and he's dear for the four. Yeah. Which is like the trout or something is the
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:22.640]   trout. Okay. So there are lyrics. Do you sing this?
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:30.160]   I have no, I, I, I, more laundry themed. That's a bully German man.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:30.960]   What's your top?
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:37.760]   The best thing about the Samsung implementation is it goes on forever and it gets to the end and
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:42.240]   you think it's over and then it keeps going. Right. That's the best. But did, did, did, did,
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:47.360]   did, did, did, did, did, did, what are you doing Samsung? Why do you do that?
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.600]   You get to reproduce at the end. A little reprise.
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:54.880]   It's amazing. It's, I mean, I, it's just so charming that obviously there is a philosophy
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:58.480]   there that's like, we want our, our appliances to be friendly and part of your home. And one of the
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:04.320]   things that they'll do is they'll play music to you. Nothing like they'll play the same 18 notes
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:08.640]   through their little tiny speaker every time you press the power button for as long as you have
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:15.600]   the washing machine. Right. Like maybe not. Maybe don't do that. So a while ago, my, my Google
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:20.320]   Mac speaker, I got a firmware update so that when you connect to it, used to make this really like
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:26.320]   loud, like bass note. Right now, and now, and now it does this arpeggio that to my mind
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:32.400]   sounds exactly like the intro, like little flourish before the song in Hamilton, you'll be back.
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:37.760]   So I always imagine like my, now my, I had to rename my speaker King George because
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:46.800]   we'll be back. We'll be back. Wait and see. Human brains are weird, man. You remember, you belong to me.
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:51.360]   Now your laundry is done.
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.280]   Hi, and now your laundry is done.
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:42:02.720]   You guys, just a reminder that if you were using Twitterific or tweetbot,
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:10.960]   and of course, Twitter unceremoniously pulled the plug on those apps, Apple requires them to
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:18.080]   offer you a refund for any outstanding time. But those companies are small, and they are
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:26.160]   beloved by our community. And they have asked that you not ask for your refund. It could put them
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:32.880]   out of it. It could literally put them out of business. Both apps now have screens. Here's the
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:39.680]   Twitterific screen. Thanks to John Gruber explaining that you have a choice. And if you have an
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:44.800]   active subscription, Apple says, you know, you, you have to offer a refund, but they give you a
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:49.600]   button that says, you know, I'm satisfied with what I got out of Twitterific. And I do not want to
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:57.040]   refund at this time. I was going to get charged against the company and they're going to have a
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:04.480]   huge, those refunds will will kill them. Yeah, they're not big companies. So I would suggest,
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:09.760]   as does Gruber, as do all of us, here's tapbox. Now one of the things tapbox is lucky because they
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:16.000]   had ivory, which is a mastodon version of tweet of tweetbot, which is a great app. So you could
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:22.320]   transfer your subscription to ivory, which is what I what I did, just to support ivory. But at the
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:28.160]   bottom of all of these, I want a pro rated refund. You could do that, you could get your money back,
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:33.200]   but just a word of a note of warning. It's going to be hard on those companies. And you got to
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:38.960]   understand your money's not in the it's it's in their app. But in this device, it's
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:48.800]   yeah. And listen, the way Elon did it was so horrific. But he's become the king of horrific.
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:54.240]   They just pulled the plug without telling him without warning him. A week later, they said,
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:59.600]   yeah, we did it because you broke the rules to which they said, but we've been here for so many
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:04.240]   years. What rule do we break? And then they hemmed and hawed and they said, this one,
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:12.400]   we just added yesterday. And there was just a nightmarish bad faith thing. And certainly within
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:16.400]   Twitter's rights to say we don't want third party apps, they actually have done it before.
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:23.280]   But to do it that way was not very nice. So just to, you know, a note, don't if you can afford it,
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:31.360]   say, I don't need the refund. Keep the money. You deserve it. All right. The king of horrific,
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:39.760]   isn't he? Unbelievable, unbelievable. Let's take a little break. Speaking of subscriptions,
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:44.560]   I just want to do a little plug before we get to the picks of the week. First, I want to do a thank
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:48.960]   you to our club to it members, because a lot of them are making a big difference. As you might
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:54.000]   have noted, there was only one ad in this show. And this has been a problem over the last few months,
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:01.520]   podcast advertising globally is declined. NPR took a hit of $300 million and laid off 10%
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:06.960]   of their staff because of it. And we're feeling the pinch just like everybody else. But we have
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:10.720]   something very special. We have a club and thank you to club to members for making this,
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:17.440]   making a big difference in our lives, the lives of our staff. What do you get for seven bucks? So
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:22.800]   all the seven bucks a month is nothing. A couple of cups of coffee, a buck less than a blue check
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:27.520]   on Twitter and you get so much more ad free versions of all the shows this show and more,
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:32.400]   plus special shows on the Twit Plus feed, like Michael Sargent's hands on Macintosh. We have a
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:36.560]   hands on Windows show with Paul Thorot, the entitled Linux show. There's special events that go on
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:41.120]   in the club all the time. We do triangulations. In fact, we could only do triangulation thanks to
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:46.560]   the club because it's a show we don't do all the time. So there's no advertisers for it. It
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:51.520]   costs us money to do it, of course. But the club members foot the bill. Thank you,
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:56.800]   club members seven bucks a month. Oh, did I mention you also get access to the best darn social
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:07.280]   network in the world, our club Twit discord with the line is Super Mario. So if the discord
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:11.520]   is a great place to hang, not only during shows, and of course, we're in the Mac break weekly chat.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:16.480]   We have a stage where we can now give you a chance to ask questions. And we have conversation
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:23.440]   about every topic that club Twit members like to talk about from beer wine cocktails to coding
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:29.440]   to comics to Linux to movies and music and software and travel. It's all in there and
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:33.600]   great conversations going on all the time. I hang out in the coding section. We have some
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:42.000]   great coders in there and they are an inspiration to me. So that's my, that's my pitch. I'm not
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:48.960]   very good at begging. You know, I hate pledge breaks on public broadcasting. But honestly,
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:56.400]   I'm only doing it because we needed Twit TV slash club Twit. Thank you so much for your support. Oh,
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:02.640]   and brand new. Now, is this club only? So I also have a big announcement. Thank you for
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:09.520]   reminding me, John Ashley. Thanks to club members. Home theater geeks is back. It is a club only
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:17.280]   show every Thursday. You can actually listen in as Scott and his guests talk about home theater.
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:22.080]   This was a show that many of you asked us to bring back. And thanks to the donations,
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:27.040]   the very generous donations of club Twit members. We have now brought Scott Wilkinson's home theater
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:35.840]   geeks back in the club. All right. So thank you club Twit members to Twit TV slash club Twit.
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:42.400]   Hey, everybody, Leo LePort here. I am the founder and one of the hosts at the Twit podcast network.
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:46.400]   I want to talk to you a little bit about what we do here at Twit, because I think it's unique.
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:54.240]   And I think for anybody who is bringing a product or a service to a tech audience,
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:48:00.640]   you need to know about what we do here at Twit. We've built an amazing audience of engaged,
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:08.000]   intelligent, affluent listeners who listen to us and trust us when we recommend a product.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.720]   Our mission statement is to build a highly engaged community of tech enthusiasts.
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:18.400]   But already you should be your ears should be perking up at that because highly engaged
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:23.040]   is good for you. Tech enthusiasts, if that's who you're looking for, this is the place.
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:28.480]   We do it by offering them the knowledge they need to understand and use technology in today's world.
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:33.840]   And I hear from our audience all the time. Part of that knowledge comes from our advertisers.
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:40.320]   We are very careful. We pick advertisers with great products, great services with integrity,
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:47.120]   and introduce them to our audience with authenticity and genuine enthusiasm.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:52.960]   And that makes our host red ads different from anything else you can buy. We are literally bringing
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:49:00.160]   you to the attention of our audience and giving you a big fat endorsement. We like to create
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:06.000]   partnerships with trusted brands, brands who are in it for the long run, long term partners
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:11.520]   that want to grow with us. And we have so many great success stories. Tim Broome,
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:18.000]   who founded ITProTV in 2013, started advertising with us on day one has been with us ever since.
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:23.600]   He said, quote, "We would not be where we are today without the Twit Network."
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:29.120]   I think the proof is in the pudding. Advertisers like ITProTV and Audible, they've been with us
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:35.680]   for more than 10 years. They stick around because their ads work. And honestly, isn't that why you're
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:41.280]   buying advertising? You get a lot with Twit. We have a very full service attitude. We almost
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:47.760]   think of it as kind of artisanal advertising, boutique advertising. You'll get a full service,
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:52.880]   continuity team, people who are on the phone with you, who are in touch with you,
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:59.760]   who support you with everything from copywriting to graphic design. So you are not alone in this.
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:06.800]   We embed our ads into the shows. They're not added later. They're part of the shows. In fact,
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:11.840]   often they're such a part of our shows that our other hosts will chime in on the ad saying,
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:17.440]   "Yeah, I love that." Or just the other day, one of our hosts said, "Man, I really got to buy that.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:23.360]   That's an additional benefit to you because you're hearing people, our audience trusts,
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:29.600]   saying, "Yeah, that sounds great." We deliver, always over-deliver on impressions. So you know
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:35.360]   you're going to get the impressions you expect. The ads are unique every time. We don't pre-record
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:40.720]   them and roll them in. We are genuinely doing those ads in the middle of the show. We'll give you
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:46.800]   great onboarding services. Adtech with pod sites that's free for direct clients, gives you a lot
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:51.360]   of reporting, gives you a great idea of how well your ads are working. You'll get courtesy commercials.
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:56.320]   You actually can take our ads and share them across social media and landing pages. That really
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:01.200]   extends the reach. There are other free goodies too, including mentions in our weekly newsletter
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:07.600]   that sent to thousands of fans, engaged fans who really want to see this stuff. We give you bonus ads
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:14.080]   and social media promotion too. So if you want to be a long-term partner, introduce your product to a

[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:34.560]   We've been with him for 16 years. Mark said the feedback from many advertisers over 16 years
[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:41.200]   across a range of product categories. Everything from razors to computers is that if ads and
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:46.480]   podcasts are going to work for a brand, they're going to work on Twitch shows. I'm very proud of
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:53.920]   what we do because it's honest. It's got integrity. It's authentic. And it really is a great introduction

[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:11.680]   partners that we've personally and thoroughly vetted. I have absolute approval on everybody.

[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:42.080]   Now it's time for our picks of the week. I don't usually do a pick because the whole show is my
[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:47.680]   pick. So there. But I did want to mention this because it's only good for a few more days.
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:54.720]   And it's only for T-Mobile customers. But if you're a soccer fan, T-Mobile Tuesdays is offering
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:53:02.720]   a one-year subscription to MLS Season Pass on Apple TV for free. You obviously have to be a
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:08.320]   T-Mobile customer. But that was good for me because I actually would never pay for the MLS
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:13.360]   Season Pass. But getting it for free, I'm going to watch some of it. I think it's good. So I just
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:20.320]   mentioned only good through the 14th. So you've got a few more days if you haven't done it yet.
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:26.160]   One more week. You need the T-Mobile Tuesdays app on your iPhone or Android phone to do that.
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:30.800]   Jason Snell, your pick of the and this is not an app for T-Mobile. I have no association with
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:33.520]   T-Mobile except on my customer. Your pick of the week, Jason.
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:42.560]   I was just in New Zealand. It's far away. And it's in a different day.
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:49.360]   It's in a different day. In fact, funny, you look it up and it says it's plus 21, which is
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:52.880]   that's a lot to add. But you could also just subtract three. It's a lot easier.
[01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:58.080]   It's like going from New York to San Francisco. It's from San Francisco to New Zealand. It's
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:05.040]   until we do spring forward. It'll be three hours, which is nice. But it's tomorrow, which is weird.
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:09.600]   So anyway, one of the things is time zones. How do they work? And if you don't know how
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:15.520]   time zones work, I recommend a really nice iOS and through Catalyst macOS app called
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:21.680]   Zones colon time zone conversion from score collapse. Add in the cities that you care about.
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:25.600]   It shows you the times and the weather, I think, actually in the different places that you are.
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:30.000]   We'll sync between your devices over the cloud. It'll give you little reminders.
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:35.840]   Very simple app, but it's nice. It does the job. And if you are somebody who is just trying to do
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:40.880]   the math and your head around your fingers for when the time zone, where am I? When is it? What
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:45.920]   time is it? How do I get there? Is it where is it where you are? Can I call this person now?
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:49.760]   Are they going to be there? Oh, it's daytime. Oh, but it's going to be Saturday. That's confusing.
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:54.880]   Right. Like time zones. They're very confusing. Use an app and then you will be less confused.
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:55:00.880]   Be like the insane clown posse and use use it. Actually, I love this. It has an iMessage.
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:07.840]   Is it a sticker? I don't know what you would call it. But you so when you want to set a time
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:11.680]   with somebody, you could say, it's this time your time, this time my time.
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:19.360]   That's pretty cool. I like that. Just a real simple, nice, friendly, helpful app if you struggle
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:25.040]   with time zones or are going to places that have weird time. Some squirkel apps, LLP time zones,
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:33.520]   or sorry, zones called time zone conversion. Good luck finding it. That's always an adventure.
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:37.680]   You know what? Go to our show notes. That's the best place to hit that TV slash mbw. We'll put a
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:41.040]   link in the show notes, right? And then you can just jump right. I think if you search zones,
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:46.160]   it's the second one that comes up or something. But yeah, Mr. Andy Naco, pick of the week.
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:52.240]   Mine's kind of a revisit of a previous pick, but there is news about the play date. We've talked
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:58.640]   about that earlier today about panics, like really quirky, interesting game, handheld game console.
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:06.560]   That's got a it's got a crank. It's the Jason has one too. I got to say, I love this device. I
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:13.200]   have to admit, I took a I took a bit of a flutter on it because obviously you had a pre you had a
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:19.760]   preorder it. It's not cheap 180 bucks. Plus, it's like, okay, they've never done a mechanical device,
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:25.200]   a an actual physical device before. Are they going to actually ship it? And the oh my goodness,
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:32.240]   all the there's so much drama over so many different like retro style, like game game systems that
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:36.480]   you know, got a lot of got a lot of interest and attention and investment, but then never shipped.
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:41.040]   The only problem is the only it does ship. The only problem is that it's so popular that if
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:46.800]   you order today, you still have to wait until late 2023 in order to get it. But I absolutely love it.
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:52.240]   It's the build quality is it's not cheap at all. It feels like a very high quality product.
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:57.440]   I thought that maybe this crank would be like the first thing to break, but it is solid as anything.
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:04.400]   People reviewers earlier were complaining that the screen is not backlit. That's a fair cop.
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:11.280]   But the thing is it is like super super super high contrast. So if you have any amount of light
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:15.200]   whatsoever, it's going to be very, very pretty and easy to read. And it's part of what makes it
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:19.920]   kind of unique. The fact that it's not the fact that it's not like another color display that's
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:24.800]   not terribly great, but maybe okay. And it also means that the battery lasts weeks and weeks and
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:30.160]   weeks and that it's super super flat. And the games are exactly as I hope them to be. I'm not
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:37.280]   I'm not the person who spends weeks on a $60 triple A game, getting myself sort of all like
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:42.400]   worked up about making the next level or solving all the problems or speed running like that.
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:47.200]   I want something that will give me a good half hour of amusement from time to time. I want something
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:50.800]   in my pocket when I've got a day in the city, I know that I'm going to have to like have
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:54.400]   final distraction, some fun throughout the day, absolutely everything that I wanted to be.
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:59.200]   So I'm very, very happy with it. But two really two really interesting pieces of news today,
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:05.040]   today they announced that they have finally their on device game store called catalog.
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:12.480]   The development system for this is really super and super open. You can go up for since day one,
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:19.360]   you can go to itch.io and buy like third or free or free or for pay third party games on this thing.
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:23.040]   And a lot of super creativity has gone into this stuff. So there's a lot of games on here. You
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:28.160]   won't see anyplace else. But now they have their own curated catalog alongside that. They're not
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:33.680]   locking anybody out. But it's an easier way to find the super top quality games. And though the
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:38.640]   trailers for the information about it is a lot better than what you'll find on itch.io. So super
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:43.680]   high of recommendation. Also, recommendation that maybe you want to order it sooner rather than
[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:49.680]   later because the other announcement they made today is that remember that they planned this way
[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:55.360]   before the way before COVID way before supply line shortages. And so they feel as though they
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:59:00.320]   have to raise the price by $20 starting in April, but they told they're telling people about a
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:07.200]   month in advance that the price goes up on April 1 from $179 to $200. So if you are on the fence and
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:12.480]   you're sort of thinking about getting it, maybe you want to order it right now. They do offer 100%
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:17.760]   refunds anytime before it ships so that you can if you can for if you're going to afford to park
[01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:23.600]   180 bucks for several months, park it while you think about it. And if six months from now,
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:27.920]   you decide that that was stupid. I don't really want this anymore. They will refund your money.
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:34.000]   Again, another thing that's different from this, this from other like retro console projects or
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.840]   people's take your money and then while they're gone there, they spend they spend it trying to
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:42.880]   trying to pay the pay the rental fee on their office furniture. No, that's you can trust these
[01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:47.760]   people. So I do recommend you give it a float. The only the only other recommendation I'm going to
[01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:56.160]   make is that you can for an extra 20 bucks buy this magnetic little cover for it. I absolutely
[01:59:56.160 --> 02:00:02.640]   recommend that you get it because I don't think the surface of this screen is going to stand up to
[02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:08.640]   tossing in your bag, tossing your pocket willy nilly. Whereas if you put this on it, this is I've
[02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:12.240]   had this for several months now and there's just not a scratch on it. So that's definitely a good
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:17.600]   investment. I think it's the this plus the cases 200 bucks at at March prices. So again, high
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:25.280]   recommendation. I love it that Krista Morgan, the panic video and podcast hosts is wearing a
[02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:32.080]   untitled goose game sweater in the video for the new. It's all connected. It's all connected.
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:35.360]   Because this is of course, from panic, same people published untitled.
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:40.640]   Oh, I forgot to mention that you do you do get 24 games with it. They commissioned a season of
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:46.400]   games so that it's not as though like that was part of the risk mitigation that, okay, at minimum,
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:51.920]   I know that I will be getting 24 games like for like so basically for seven and a half dollars each
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:55.520]   for a couple months, I get to like get to play interesting games at the rate of two a week and
[02:00:55.520 --> 02:01:01.280]   I get a free player with it, so to speak. So that there's now a library about 400 games for it. So
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:05.440]   again, a lot of really creative people have done some great stuff, not just stuff that uses the
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:09.840]   crank either. So the crank isn't just like this gimmick that spawns a whole bunch of, oh good,
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:14.720]   another fishing game. Oh, good, a space fishing game. And now here's a fishing game in which
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:22.560]   you're fishing. Okay, thank you. Playdate is at play dot date. If you would like to order Alex
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:28.880]   Lindsey, your pick of the week. So, you know, I got back into podcasting. I know it sounds crazy.
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:35.920]   What are you talking about? Everyone's going out. I go ahead and go. So the, you know, but I,
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:39.760]   we work on Michael Krasney show. So Michael Krasney has this podcast, Leo's been on it.
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:45.920]   We're going to try. That's a good show here. Yeah. And so, but, but so the, it's a great show.
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:50.800]   It's a great interview. And we bring people in from all over. And a lot of folks, you know,
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:55.520]   a lot of them are pretty high profile, but they, you know, oftentimes it's amazing how
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:02:01.520]   under equipped they are, even though they've been showing up on CNN and things like that. And so,
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:05.520]   we send them out mics and we do the best we can to make it sound better. But it still comes back
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:09.280]   and we have to do a little bit of work on it and to make it sound as good as it could,
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:14.160]   as, you know, with, with what's happening. So we send out some MD7 mics, but even then we,
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:17.600]   we still want to do a little bit of work on it. And I just have to say that I don't know how I
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:23.760]   would do this every week without isotropic. So a lot of people, isotropa, I use RX 10 and a little
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:29.120]   bit of ozone. And it's just like, Oh, I need a DS or I need to, I need to pull this out. I need
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:31.920]   to fix this thing. I need to, you know, there's a little bit of clicking in here. There's a little
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:37.920]   bit of something else. And it's just this RX especially is just something that I use on every show to
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:44.000]   fix something, you know, and Alex, me too. It's really, it's like magic, the, the de-reverb. If you
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:49.040]   get somebody back away room, I just like, well, this, this audio is unusable. Even if the vague echo,
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:53.680]   and you press a button and walk away for like 20 minutes and it just, it's magic. It just
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:57.440]   goes away. It's shocking. How good it is. Which bundle should I get?
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:03.360]   I have a month. You get the most expensive one. Oh, thank you. Okay. It's that or I have a
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:06.960]   subscription. I have a subscription. I don't remember it being that high. I can't find it,
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:09.680]   right? I was trying to figure out what I'm paying every day, every week, every month,
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:14.800]   or it's like 20 bucks a month or something like that. And I have RX 10 and ozone are the two that
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:20.240]   I have there. So it's some kind of, you can buy it for, you know, I think the RX is not as expensive.
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:25.360]   I have, yeah, again, I have this bundle and it's worked. Again, it's worked really, really well
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:30.720]   for me. And, and I just, you know, I tried to do it without it. I got a demo of it and I was like,
[02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:34.880]   oh, this is pretty good. And then I tried to do work without it. And I was like, oh, this is taking
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:39.840]   so much time, whatever, whatever, whatever it costs, make it go away. And so.
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:44.560]   So just have an editor in it or no, this is not the, you know, I have just in logic.
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:49.040]   Okay. Yeah. So I have an, I have it in logic. So I, you know, it's all plugins.
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:52.800]   You could just use it. Yeah. But there is an app that has all of them in it that you can use.
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:57.040]   And I actually preprocess my files in their app. So there is, there is an app, but you can also
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:03.520]   just put it in. And when you cut, what do you cut the show in? I mostly using logic or, you know,
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:08.400]   mostly using logic, basically, when I'm on the Mac, but I will pre-process my files. Even if I'm
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:14.560]   using fair write on the iPad, I'll preprocess the files on in the isotope app. I do it in advance
[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:18.320]   because that way I can completely control what it looks like and then playback is super smooth.
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:22.640]   I keep my originals, but I, I'll process the files and then drop them into the editor,
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:26.720]   especially for like the D reverb, because that is an incredibly intensive
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:32.560]   calculation to do that magic. Yeah. I think I have my own studio and it does take like a second
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:37.040]   when I hit play. There's like a second of it because I'll, I'll put in this last one had
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:44.400]   D S or D plus of D. D. It was a D S or D plus of D. D reverb. It slows down a little. And it just,
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:47.600]   just, it was just like, it just takes, you hear this like weird little echo for the first couple
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:53.360]   seconds, like one or two seconds, and then it just plays out after that. And so, so the, but yeah,
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:59.040]   the, it's, they're super powerful. And again, I find that the amount of quality, the amount of
[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:05.200]   work that I can do after that, I send it, I send it to a friend of mine, Mickey, Mickey does,
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:10.400]   after after after, if I can't fix it with RX and ozone, I send it to the Philippines.
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:14.240]   It's worked on. And so that's, that's the only, it's funny because I was thinking
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:18.880]   literally the Philippines to be worked on myself. So yeah, it's, it's, yeah, exactly. You know,
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:23.520]   I have, I have a, I have a, I have an audio ringer in, in Manila. Yeah.
[02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:28.080]   That's the stuff's been around for so long. I think I used it in the early days of Twit.
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:32.960]   I've used it on and off and, but now that I'm doing it every week and I'm, you know,
[02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:36.800]   I do this one kind of myself and it's been good. I, I have to admit, I was getting a little rusty
[02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:40.960]   and logic. And now I got all the keystrokes back and I'm kind of, you know, cutting through stuff and,
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:45.680]   and it's, but the, my final pass before I start doing the compression on the whole thing is to
[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:50.000]   take all these ozone ones. I usually pull them back a little bit. They're a little aggressive, but I,
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:54.240]   you know, go through there and kind of process everything. And it just makes a big difference,
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:57.280]   especially for the far end of the, of the podcast.
[02:05:57.280 --> 02:06:04.400]   Well, God willing, I'll never have to do it myself again. But if I do, I'm keeping this, I'll
[02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:12.880]   bookmarking this and I'll keep it around. Iso tope, IZOTOPE.com. And I did, I did just to price it out.
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:15.920]   If you buy everything, it's 1,300 bucks, 1,200 bucks.
[02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:18.400]   Twelve, forty nine. I don't have every 50. Yeah, you don't need it.
[02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:24.320]   I'm just checking, you know, just to see. And I am told that they have regular deals. So
[02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:27.120]   they do. Yeah. Keep an eye peeled for an eyes.
[02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:30.320]   They have regular deals and they have a subscription. And, and I think that the only thing that I've
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:35.760]   used outside of IZOTOPE that really works is called a Zenaptic and it's called Unveil. And so
[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:40.640]   IZOTOPE can't fix it. Like, if it's really broken, I've had some pretty echoey rooms and
[02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:44.720]   unveil will do some crazy work, but it's like a $100 and does one thing.
[02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:48.560]   Yeah. Adobe's working on something. They've got a like a web thing that they're doing.
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:49.680]   Yeah, they're a little podcast thing.
[02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:52.880]   They have podcast. Yeah. That's got a machine learning thing where you can upload.
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:57.840]   And depending on the track, that's like magic. So we may, we may be at the threshold of like a
[02:06:57.840 --> 02:07:02.480]   whole new era. IZOTOPE has a lot of machine learning based stuff in those plugins too. So
[02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:06.640]   the ability to take something that sounds terrible and press a button and have it come out sounding
[02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:12.000]   good is rapidly approaching. It's great news for all of us who have friends who are recording
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:17.440]   podcasts and they forgot which microphone they were selecting or which end to talk into, you know,
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:22.560]   like the blue is the killer. It's like, there's like six settings and like one way to do it.
[02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:25.280]   And if you do it any other way, you end up like doing live.
[02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:29.680]   I just got I have friends who say I've got a perfect room to record a podcast and it's all
[02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:35.840]   glass walls. Oh, yeah. Perfect. Sounds so good. Yeah. It's perfect. Beautiful. Great.
[02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:42.240]   I can hear you many times. Yeah. I just bought the effort to test
[02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:47.760]   roads, new NT one, the fifth generation just came out with 30. They say 32 bit
[02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:54.240]   recording. So we're going to show that and test that on Sunday with us, the tech guys.
[02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:59.360]   If you're looking for a good microphone, actually, what we're really going to talk about is what 32
[02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:06.960]   bit float recording is and why it's a good thing. So good. Yeah. Yeah. Should I upgrade? I have a
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:16.480]   US I have a mix, USB pre three, but it's not the second generation. And should I spend 800,
[02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:22.560]   900 bucks to get the second generation with 32 bit float recording? No, yes. The real thing.
[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:27.920]   So here's the thing. This is the sound devices at home. I mean, I mean, at the office, I don't
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:33.120]   know if you need it. I will say that the killer thing about the mix pre three, two is the noise
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:38.640]   assist. So you it's another plug in. It's a $300 plug in that you add to your mix pre. Yeah. And I
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:44.800]   mean, right now you're hearing me through it. Like I have fans and things and just all up,
[02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:49.840]   makes it all go away. You know, like so on our bigger on our kind of mid range and higher end
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:56.160]   kits for Oh, and I know we send we send out a mix pre with that noise assist turned on. And it
[02:08:56.160 --> 02:09:00.080]   just solves a whole bunch of problems. A little bit of the echo, a little bit of the reverb and
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:05.200]   all of the fan noise that's out there. So the mix, that's the big thing. I mean,
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:10.800]   the firmware that you put on the mix pre because it's a hardware. It's a it's a plug in that you
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:16.800]   buy for it. And it's and it needed more, it needs more processing power. So the mix pre three by the
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:22.240]   first one didn't have the processing power to do it. So basically what noise assist does is a lot
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:27.360]   of what cedar does. And I will I actually think that noise assist sounds better than cedar most
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:31.840]   of the time. Noise assist has in cedar is the big one. Like that's the one we used to use for
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:38.560]   everything to clean things up. But the but the noise assist I think is a softer touch. And I
[02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:44.160]   with cedar, if you turn it up too much, I hear it. I can hear the the bits as it cuts into it.
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:50.240]   But the but with noise assist, I can turn it up pretty high. I don't know how easy it is for me to
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:53.840]   that's okay. I can turn this off for you. We should say this that could be a pick for another
[02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:57.920]   dad. I don't you already did you pick? I don't want to add a whole nother pick to it. But can you hear
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:08.240]   that? Yeah. And just. Oh, go on. That's what we need here. So it's just it works. Well, if I ever
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:12.880]   get into podcasting, I will call you and they'll figure it out. Yeah, yeah, to figure it all out.
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:18.320]   Mr. Alex Lindsey does this great thing cut office hours and this you just got a little sample right
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:23.440]   there. Little office hours sample. That's that's that's what that's what every day looks like.
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:29.120]   It was just fiddling with something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We today's show was the lower third show
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:33.920]   where you dissect. Yeah, we literally just look at other people's lower thirds and talk about
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:37.280]   we talked a lot about construction. We talked about what we like about and what we don't like
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:41.680]   about the technical pieces of it. The you know, like we definitely like digging in.
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:47.280]   To be clear, the people's lower third items on a video track, not their actual like lower.
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:50.800]   Oh, not their body lower third. No, no, no, right. Like the the
[02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:57.520]   call the car. Their knees. Yeah. The knees are just looking at his knees. Not the torso though.
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:01.120]   That's not the torso. That's not the torso or so lower. They're knees. Okay. Yeah.
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:06.400]   Capri pre preprance of very, very big office hours committed. Yeah, exactly. And I and
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:12.720]   Thursday's going to be ruthless reviews. So you I mean, I specifically, this is what people like
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:17.120]   the best about you guys is when you speak. But there's a lot of other information to
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:22.560]   we it's the cool thing is that this week we're talking tomorrow. We're talking about five dot
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:27.440]   we're talking about some surround audio in general and just what the different ones are and what
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:32.160]   all the numbers mean five one five one for one for all the stuff and then and then we're getting
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:35.600]   ready. We're going to have some other experts on. So we're trying to we're all talking about it
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:40.000]   first before with the experts come on. So we, you know, that's a couple weeks out. And then the
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:44.800]   on Thursday, we're talking about not just the ruthless reviews, but how it looks in HDR. So we're
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:51.040]   slowly moving to streaming HDR to YouTube. And so how do people look with their lighting, not just
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:57.200]   in regular SDR, but how they look in HDR because it it's unforgiving. And then on Friday, Friday,
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:00.800]   you'll finally get to see what our sets look like. You'll see what the rest of my room looks like
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:05.440]   Friday. So we show because a lot of us look relatively normal in front of it. But any time
[02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:09.200]   you see over the shoulder of all of us, it's like this giant, like all these monitors and
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:14.080]   everything else. And so usually people don't see that. So we're going to turn the camera around.
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:16.560]   I love it. Yeah, we're going to turn around and show people like what it looks like.
[02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:21.040]   Office hours dot global is the website. They put them up on YouTube, but you could also
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:25.680]   join the zoom calls. If you want to be part of it, all the information is there office hours dot
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:33.920]   global, including schedules, schedules, Mr. Andy and I code GBH this week.
[02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:38.960]   No, I just found out I just got bumped because there's a big local news story that just dropped
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:42.400]   today. So they're going to be using my time to talk about that and other things, but go to
[02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:47.920]   WGBH news.org to listen to it. I'm sure it's going to be a great show tomorrow. Even without me. And
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:52.080]   you go to WGBH news.org and search for my name. And you'll find my previous tech segments. So
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:56.560]   the next one I think is next week will be kept to that big news story here actually just come in.
[02:12:56.560 --> 02:13:02.000]   Apparently GarageBand has a security flaw in there. Apple's pushing an update out. So no,
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:08.480]   rare update to GarageBand. You know, I would normally say, yeah, come on. How big a deal could
[02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:14.560]   this be? But we have now learned that the last pass hack involved getting in through an unpatched
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:21.760]   version of Plex, Plex, and a senior developers laptop at home. So it does. It is important that
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:25.680]   you update these other things that you've got running. He hadn't updated Plex in years. And
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:31.600]   as a result, LastPass was hacked. So it's important. Keep those updates.
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:36.880]   Let me talk about the I trust hack that happened last month.
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:41.360]   I don't know about that one. What's that? There was an I think I'm sorry. There's an e-commerce
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:45.360]   service that a lot of commerce sites seems to basically are a million dollar.
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:51.360]   Yeah, that basically, so you don't know that your transactions are going through this third
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:56.160]   party that does verification. It turns out that that company got themselves hacked to the
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:14:02.800]   230 million, 30 million user data. I got I got a I got an notification from have I been
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:08.080]   pwned saying, Oh, yeah, I did too. I got that notification too was something else. But it's nice,
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:13.040]   isn't it? Get those notifications. It's nice to know that Oh, something horrible has happened
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:17.680]   this out of your control. Just change all your passwords everywhere. You'll be good. Oh, dear.
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:26.160]   Ignorance is very peaceful. Yes. Mr. Jason Snell. Welcome home. A little like a culture shop.
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:31.520]   Yeah, shock or how hard has it been to get back and the same? I mean, I just have a my solution is
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:37.040]   just not to leave the house. And then it's fine. Although I did have some where and I was on the
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:40.800]   other side of the road from I was the same side of the car though, since I was a passenger before
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:45.520]   and I was driving this time. Yeah, no, it's great. It is always a shock as you know, Leo, from all
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:50.640]   your travel to get back to the to your life after you've been out of it for two weeks. So then good
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:56.560]   news is it was a real vacation for me. I didn't think about work at all. And that was nice. Now,
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:14:59.920]   now so I now I get that moment where like I'm serious when I said at the top of the show,
[02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:07.040]   which is like anything happened. I just wasn't paying attention. But it was good. Good refresher.
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:11.120]   And great to see we've been planning that trip since before the pandemic. And then
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:15.680]   it got delayed and delayed. And I'm so glad we finally got a chance to see that country is
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:20.880]   beautiful. I need some meat pies, you know, that's funny. Because we have we're going on a pandemic
[02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:28.720]   delayed trip a couple of weeks. We had a plan to cruise in 2020 from Singapore round trip to
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:32.480]   Singapore and the Philippines and Hong Kong and stuff. Of course, all of Asia was shut down.
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:38.320]   They canceled it. They canceled it again. Finally, we said screw Asia. We're going to Europe.
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:44.720]   So we're going to Europe in a couple of weeks. Same thing. You know, we paid for this in 2019.
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:49.680]   Right. I mean, sometimes these things happen. Anyway, I'm glad you got to go on your trip.
[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:53.680]   Welcome home. Thank you for filling in having those guys. We had some great
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:16:00.320]   jobs. Yeah. Yeah, it's great. Find out what Jason's up to by going to six colors.com/Jason.
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:05.680]   And I say that because no one's got enough time to talk about all the shows Jason.
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:11.760]   No, it's AI based now. I just have an AI speak with my voice and watch it. Watch the shows for me.
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:15.280]   And I'm tired of covering your butt, Jason. Okay. Thank you. I mean, we're friends, but
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:22.160]   any any are you see you're back at all of them now. Yeah. Yeah, the fill ins were the last two
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:26.960]   weeks. And now now I'm back. I'm back to the grind. Only two podcasts today, only one yesterday.
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:34.240]   I'm easing in. I'm easing in my God. And this is why I stayed out of the whole podcast thing.
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:37.600]   Because it's just nuts. It's just a good idea. Don't do it. Don't do it. There's too many shows
[02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:43.200]   that way. Don't do it. Thank you, Jason andy. Thank you, Alex. Thank you all for joining us.
