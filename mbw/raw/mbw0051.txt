[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   We got a bunch of rich people who own Apple stock on the show this week,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   so I just want you to know that if you're taking any stock advice,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   we're the wrong people to listen to.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   There you go, Scott Born.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   That's for Scott Born's attorney.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Scott Born is an Apple shareholder.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   All of us may or may not own some tech stock.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I've told people I've owned 10 shares of Google.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   I don't own an Apple stock, but we probably should say up front,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   and we have never said this explicitly.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Yeah, and by the way, those 10 shares of Google,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   that's why those people are camped down in front of your house.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   (laughter)
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   You know, I've always wondered about this.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   There have been some journalists who've gotten in a lot of trouble,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   but we're not exact.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Well, maybe we are.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   I'm thinking of one guy in particular who had a column.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I think it was in the Wall Street Journal,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   but in some important financial journal where he was talking about stocks all the time
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   and never disclosed that he actually had ownership in some of those stocks.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   In that case, I think he was giving stock advice,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   and I'm not giving anybody stock advice.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Exactly.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I will tell you where to get a really good cut of roast beef in San Francisco.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Oh, where's that?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Oh, that would be the house of prime rib,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   because technically prime rib is roast beef.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   It is.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   It is.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Of course, Merlin Mann was the guy who turned us on to the house of prime rib.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Beef eater Merlin Mann, do you have anything to disclose?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I'm still holding some, I've got some pets.com,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   and a little bit of home grocer.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   (laughter)
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And I'm pretty, I'm pretty, I'm a little bit exposed in peepod right now.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I'm bullish on peepod, yep.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I think peepod is going to go places now.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I don't, basically, this microphone and a computer.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   That's bad.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I don't even on the microphone.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   It's in Hawk.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   It's leased.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   It's leased.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Remember Cosmo?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Was it Cosmo?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I think my Christmas shopping was Cosmo.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I loved Cosmo.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Everybody, everybody was a customer of Cosmo, loved it,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   but if you really thought about it, there couldn't possibly have been any money
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   in the business of delivering a pack of cigarettes to a guy in the mission district
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   at two in the morning.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Having a business in San Francisco where some guy could call you at 11 o'clock
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   and order just a quart of Hagen-Das, I'm just saying San Francisco is not the place
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   to go with that business.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   So it was San Francisco New York, it was guys and bikes.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And you could buy what?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Ice cream, cigarettes, and oh, they'd bring you videos, right?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   One day I ordered all CDs for all my family members and a case for my palm five.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   (laughter)
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   It was there in an hour.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   (laughter)
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   They lost so much money.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Anyway, we do not own that stuff.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   They're on the snickers.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And one of the analysts was always saying, you know, I know these guys
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   don't even go out of business any minute, but I wish they wouldn't because my wife loves them.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Well, that's exactly it.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   This was a company that made its customers very happy.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   It's stockholders.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   That's so happy.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Alex Lindsey is also here from the Pixel Core, Pixel Core.com.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   For those who are interested, Alex, do you have anything to this claim?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I wish I had stock.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I think that would be it.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I have a virtual stock, which I've done very well on my smartphone.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   That's right.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.400]   I put about 400,000 into a handful of companies, and that 400,000 in three years has grown
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.000]   to about 3 million, and I really wish it was real.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   So what site is that?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   It's called Mocatocracy.com.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Mocatocracy.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And what they do is that it manages your...
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Basically, it gives you a million dollars to work with.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And then you can just say, you can build your own little fund, and you build...
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And mine's like the Alex Media fund or something like that.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And I put money in Apple, and Pixar, and Nvidia, and ATI, and Adobe, and a couple of other ones.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Just stuff you love.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.720]   Yeah, and that's their whole argument, is that people invest in areas that they know a lot
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.520]   about their own industries could do very well.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.280]   And so anyway, I did it, and every time I get a weekly report on how well I'm doing,
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.000]   and it's really hard.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.840]   I really wish it was real money.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.840]   That's all I could say.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.840]   So that's my only disclaimer.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.240]   Otherwise, I don't own any publicly traded stock.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.240]   I have stock in my own companies.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.600]   I guess to do this, and we'll probably have to do this from now on, to do a serious disclaimer.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.680]   People who are on the podcast on the Twitter network may or may not own stocks in the companies
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.120]   we're talking about.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.000]   If you are investing, you should see serious advice from people who know what they're talking
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.480]   about, and not us.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.440]   That seems like that would cover everything there.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.320]   And I will say that if it comes to a discussion of Kentucky Fried Chicken, I'd be seriously
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.320]   biased.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.320]   Against it.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.840]   For or again it.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.280]   It used to be for, but now it's against because it really sucks to use your iPhone after going
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.080]   to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.080]   Yes.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.960]   And I have to say, do not wear face powder if you use an iPhone either.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.640]   I don't want to crud.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.640]   That's it for Merlin.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.640]   He knows he doesn't want one.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.880]   If I have to choose between iPhone and drag, don't do that to me.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.880]   Oh, you look at this.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.600]   I have to admit, I noticed when I leave the lab, you know, in Vancouver I get a lot more
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.360]   strange looks if I forget to take my makeup off.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.400]   When I was in San Francisco, I'd leave, you know, call for help or screensavers and I'd
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.360]   forget to take my makeup off and people would look at you and you'd get like the second
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.400]   look and then I'd be like, oh, yeah, I can just go do it.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   It fits right in.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.000]   You can walk around naked in San Francisco.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.600]   Is it Pride Week again?
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.240]   Didn't we just have Pride Week?
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.880]   We just had it.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.120]   So I have, is there any Mac news at all or should we just continue to talk about disclaimers
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.120]   for the rest of the show?
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.960]   No, we got to talk about three billion songs.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.040]   Three billion songs.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.040]   Wow.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.120]   That's got to be news if nothing else is.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.560]   And that's it went from two billion to three billion in two hundred and three days.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.200]   I was going to say it seems our little boys growing up so fast.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.080]   It seems like just the other day, their first million songs.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.520]   Wow.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.160]   And and by the way, one billion iPod sales in six months.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.040]   That's going to be a big record.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.200]   One billion in iPod sales?
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   Yes.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.960]   Sometime in the next six months, they, is that what they said?
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.960]   Well, that can't be right.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.400]   That's kind of a viewer.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.440]   This is where the playlist mag was a bad headline.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.240]   Six months to one billion, six months to one billion.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.960]   It means everybody in America owns four.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.040]   No, no, it's it's one billion.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.560]   And I and this is my fault.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.240]   I I I just read that that I was typing quickly.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.720]   So it's one it's one billion six months to one billion.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.720]   It took I get it.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.720]   It took a little less than three years to sell the first billion, a little less than a year
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.040]   to tell the second billion.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.000]   And now in six months, they just passed the three billion mark.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   So this at this trajectory by the end of the year, we hit four billion or actually even
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   by November.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.280]   That's 57 songs a second.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.520]   720 carabytes per month and three billion dollars.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.480]   That that the not for Apple that the nobody grossing gross money moving through the bank
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.480]   account.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.560]   Let me tell you hold on to that for 18 hours and that makes you a couple hundred million.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.560]   The float alone exactly.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.920]   It's going to be interesting to watch those two trend lines cross as as more of these,
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.560]   you know, I had this sounds unkind, but to watch the bricks and mortar kind of fall
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.040]   away and to see, I mean, gosh, I mean, how many?
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.160]   I mean, how does that compare to what's being sold in the malls of America and the tower
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.480]   records sold 23 songs last week?
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.920]   Well, they're out of business, aren't they?
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.920]   That's the best.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.640]   That's why they only sold 23.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.320]   I would hate to be in the record store business these days.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.880]   I think it's it's not even just the deal.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.160]   It's the convenience of the whole thing.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.400]   I mean, I have this bad habit now of, you know, as I was shopping with my kids over the weekend
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.480]   and I was buying them some books, you know, for themselves.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.320]   For me, I sit there with my iPhone and I take pictures of the books that I want to order
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.680]   and then I order them on Amazon because I don't want to carry them around.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.000]   You know, that was the worst part is I don't even care how much it costs.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   I just don't want to put them back in.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   I'm traveling.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I was traveling.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   I was in Pittsburgh.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.360]   I don't want to put them in my bag.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.680]   You know, I'd rather just run an order and if I could take a if I could do like a like a
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.960]   delicious library of the ISBN number or the little code at the bottom in the bookstore
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.880]   and have it in have it ordered from Amazon, I would be I'd be a happy camper.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.560]   But that's that whole movement of, you know, it's not even just saving money.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.880]   It's actually the convenience of it.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:51.000]   Well, we were just talking about TV shows and and Merlin was pointing out that he would
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.160]   this is before the show began that he would buy something and it arrives even with Amazon's
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.080]   prime and we would rise two days later, you go, what was I thinking?
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.560]   It's too much of a delay between the time you buy it and the time you actually get it.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.560]   It's true.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.560]   There's two Merlins.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.560]   There's like, I don't know.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.560]   You have Netflix, right?
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.840]   I had this with Netflix all the time.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.280]   There's like smarty pants ordering Merlin and then there's like seven in the evening,
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.640]   you know, what am I going to watch?
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.920]   Fingers down the front of my pants hanging out sitting in a lounge chair, Merlin.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.600]   It's like, man, true faux movies.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.720]   What am I going to do with this?
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.600]   You know, I have to assure disclaimer here.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.440]   Some of the members of the Mac break weekly podcast may in fact watch TV with their hands
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.440]   down their pants.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.120]   You know, just kind of in a kind of albundi comfortable way.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.000]   I don't think that implies anything lurid.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.640]   I should really, okay, listen, I should just climb at this point.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.360]   I, um, I, no, I'm not going to.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.360]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   I know what you're going to say.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.000]   I've got it anyway on tape from before, so I'll just stick it in right here.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.640]   You're going to fix all this in post, right?
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.800]   As usual.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.360]   So who is Neil Cavuto?
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.920]   And, uh, and as the British would say, Oh, Z when he's a home.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:59.680]   Now Neil Cavuto is one of the, um, instapundits at the, um, Fox, I'll say Fox news.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.440]   Fair and unbiased, unbalanced, fair and unbalanced.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.440]   I think their model is we distort.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.160]   We decide something like that.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.000]   Anyway, he's an iPhone.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Hata.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Of course he is.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.360]   Well, you know what?
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.880]   It's not a bad thing to be an iPhone.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.880]   Hata.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.880]   No, it's, it's a great idea.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.600]   If you want to get traffic to your website, if you want to, you know, stand out from the
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.800]   crowd, it's, you know, being a hater makes sense in all likelihood.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:31.280]   Neil Cavuto had no idea what the iPhone was until June 29th and then said, Hmm, I could
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.680]   get some traffic by saying how sucky this thing is.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:42.720]   So he was making some hay on the fact that AT&T said only a 147,000 phones were activated
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.640]   in the first 30 hours.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.840]   And if you're listening to us now, Neil, and we know you are, I challenge you to a debate
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.440]   on the Apple phone show.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:57.000]   Then interesting, according to John Gruber, interestingly, the transcript of this statement,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.960]   which is not untrue.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.480]   As long as you say it's AT&T that said it and it was activations, not sales, the transcript
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:10.320]   magically was disappeared magically changed to 270,000.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.600]   You know, they have a habit of those changes occurring at the Fox news transcript.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.300]   The change it's made is it says, so they changed it to from low and behold, where it's sold
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.480]   146,000 iPhones were activated.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.680]   So to 200, 270,000 iPhones were sold in the day and half.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.520]   And this is that same thing we were talking about was it last week where, you know, that
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.280]   there's a big difference between the number that got sold and the number that got activated
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.320]   and it's just hilarious.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:38.360]   A lot of people, again, iPhone, hey, Taz were saying to me, well, come on, that tells you
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.200]   there's something wrong or somebody's lying or.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.320]   And when I said, well, you know, don't you think a lot of people bought phones that they
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.320]   didn't activate right away because they gave them as gifts or they like somebody like Mr.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.840]   Born here who bought 300 for his friends and family.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.600]   There were a lot of phones sold that get in that get activated, but they got activated
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.600]   eventually.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.520]   And, and people were saying the person I was talking to saying, Oh, come on, you know,
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.520]   that's not true.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.520]   They just didn't sell that many.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.480]   Oppenheimer was lying, I guess, that's what they're saying.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.320]   The Apple CFO.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.800]   So here, here's what I want to do.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.720]   If you've got evidence, whoever you are out there, if you got evidence that Apple was
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   lying, put up.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   Or the Apple was.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.760]   And there's no evidence to that.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.840]   If there was, it would be a federal crime.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.440]   So let's get the SEC involved to put up.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.320]   Let's find out.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.240]   Otherwise you're just blowing smoke.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.560]   Are we, are we still happy with the iPhone?
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.560]   I am.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.400]   I tell you, I stay show it to people and still people are still going, wow, that's cool.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.920]   I'm trying to figure out how to do a, I'm trying to figure out how to do a demo like
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.000]   Merlin would do a demo if he owned an iPhone.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.520]   How do you mean there's no keystroke combinations?
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.720]   He's not going to happen.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:53.200]   I'm trying to, I'm trying to think of like maybe a that phone guy's approach to showing
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.400]   somebody the iPhone.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.200]   It would be kind of cool.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.600]   Hey, you know, have you done any of that phone guys lately?
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.560]   God, now I'm way behind.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.600]   Maybe you should do some iPhone phone guys.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.640]   We did that one at Mac world.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.800]   Oh yeah, but I mean, do something like, you know, keep mucking the iPhone a little bit,
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.800]   just a little general.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   Hey, the truth.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.360]   I mean, I, now this is going to become my hobby horse each week, but I think that's.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.360]   Too obvious, huh?
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.320]   Well, no, no, I was just going to say, I, you know, I think that, that I think I'm starting
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.640]   to unpack what it is that I found so frustrating about the iPhone mania.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.280]   And I'm realizing that in my head, anyway, a lot of it was just the iPhone as object
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.280]   fetish.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.280]   Right.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.320]   And I think what, what is neat is now we're starting to see more people saying, showing
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.000]   like what you can do on it.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.160]   And like this week, I think, I think it was this week of backpack by 37 signals came out
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.120]   with an update that added some really neat features and has some, some backpack ability
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.240]   or some iPhone ability.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.960]   And I think more and more what you're describing exactly what's in the demo.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.240]   I mean, I think, you know, what are you, what are you doing with this apart from enjoying
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.240]   the interface?
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.560]   Because I think that's kind of what the story is.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.160]   I'm finding it actually a very, very good phone.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.560]   I mean, I, I find it, you start to get used to the idea that you can make these calls so
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.800]   quickly that you just touch a number and it dials it, that the voicemail is right there.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   I'm just finding that kind of addictive.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.800]   Is it just, is it still?
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.880]   I mean, I guess maybe I'm missing the point because I mean, I'll see you that it's a great
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.880]   experience.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:18.960]   But at this point, is it just the way it feels to use that's still kind of the primary feeling
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.960]   about it?
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.040]   Yeah, I'd say so because there's a lot of functionality missing.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.280]   I'm, you know, I see all these new Safari apps like the backpack and stuff, but I find
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.720]   that frustrating because it's buried in Safari and that gives me, there's two disadvantages
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   to that.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.720]   Unless you're near a Wi-Fi signal, it's too slow to use.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.200]   I mean, I just cannot wait.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.520]   I'm sitting there with Edge and it's just, I don't even, I don't even want to demonstrate
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.960]   anything that requires internet access because people just say, okay, yeah, yeah, show me.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.960]   Okay.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.960]   It just takes too long.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.880]   And secondly, it's buried because there's no button on the front.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.240]   You have to go to Safari and find the page.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.480]   And admittedly with the, with the bookmarking and the multiple pages, it's easier to get
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.800]   to a Safari page than it is on most phones.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.040]   It's still too many steps for me to make it, to expose it.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.760]   How solid have you found the Wi-Fi support?
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.760]   Mine's been excellent.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.960]   You know, I have it set up so when I'm at home, when I'm at the office, when I'm downtown
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.400]   in Petaluma that we've got Wi-Fi there.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:16.280]   And in every case at the gym, at the, at the restaurant I go, in every case, it doesn't
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.280]   say anything.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.120]   It just recognizes it and uses it.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.120]   Are you using your iPhone at the gym?
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.280]   I take pictures and, and upload them.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:30.600]   I only ask because I have this, like this 80D thing where I'm, I've actually got to this
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.040]   habit now of I, because I do a lot of stationary bike, you know, and I get bored.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:39.480]   So, so I, so I'll be stationary biking and watching, you know, whatever's on TV on my,
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.000]   well, I mean, I can choose the channels on my, my stationary bike.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.200]   So I'm watching TV surfing the web on my, you know, on my iPhone and biking all at the
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.200]   same time.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.400]   Do you put on your mascara too while you're doing that?
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   No, no.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.400]   There's no mask.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.400]   You should get a driver's license.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.560]   Anyways, yeah, no, that's why I don't fit right in.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.480]   There was one point where I was eating a sandwich and drinking at the same time while driving
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.000]   about 80 miles an hour and I realized that I really shouldn't dangerous.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.120]   I just saw a stat that something like 80% of all teenagers text while driving was some
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.440]   huge number.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.160]   Just made that illegal in the state of Washington and I was thinking to myself, you needed to
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.160]   make that illegal.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.160]   It should be.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.320]   Oh, I've done it.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.320]   I've done it.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.320]   I have to.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.240]   When I first got a blackberry, I spent a lot of time, uh, sending a receiving email while
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.720]   trying to go down the highway one on one.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.400]   Well, see, the iPhone was built to deflect that because of the touch.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   You can't do it.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.400]   You can't do it.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.280]   So they were trying to save us all from ourselves.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.280]   I do.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:36.160]   I do have to admit that now when I go to my sandwich shop that has Wi-Fi, I'll sit down
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.720]   and launch the Google reader, which does a beautiful job, uh, on the iPhone and I will
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.360]   go through stories and I, you know, I will share them or, uh, book a storm as for later
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.040]   use when I get back to the office, uh, for, for shows and so forth.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.160]   And it's actually, I don't read the paper as much.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.400]   I'm going to be reading my iPhone, which really looks stupid.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.840]   Well, the Google map thing, we just, we just wrote about this on the blog.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.640]   I mean, the functionality of the Google maps, if you really stop and look at it, there's
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.640]   a lot of cool features there, like being able to bookmark something, being able to,
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.920]   you know, instantly get directions to it, being able to turn it into a contact with the
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.920]   hit of a button.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.840]   I mean, that's what's really started to be profitable for me.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.480]   I put something in Google maps and man, I got it wired from here on out.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.120]   I just, again, it's too slow an edge and it's just not usable when it's not.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:26.240]   Fortunately, here in San Francisco, we live in the cloud.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.960]   So you're always on wifi?
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.560]   There's 23 wifi connections on the city corner I'm on right now.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.400]   And is it, and so you're able to, you don't make any effort today.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   It automatically joins us.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.120]   I thought you didn't use open APs.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.120]   I don't.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.120]   I had, there's plenty of secured ones you can subscribe to.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.120]   And, right, right.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.100]   For instance, um, Alex and I have the same thing, uh, we belong to the same company that
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:51.320]   gives you that access and you pay $30 a month and you get you.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.960]   So you can't say T-Mobile now.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.800]   Are you a shareholder?
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.040]   I was just, you know, trying not to sound like a commercial for them.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.400]   No, no name names.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.400]   I think it's useful.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.400]   We don't have to.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.680]   I always hated it when you, when you watch a show and they say an unnamed.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.680]   All right.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.680]   T-Mobile.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.680]   I have a T-Mobile.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.680]   I use that too.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.280]   It's $30 a month and it works at like any Starbucks, any borders and, you know, so there.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   It's a key.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.280]   It's in the key here.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.280]   Wi-Fi.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.320]   And, uh, there's, you know, there's tons of Wi-Fi connections around where I live and
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.320]   work.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.680]   So I, frankly, I don't think I've been on edge more than five minutes.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.600]   I'm on it all the time, but I always on edge.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.600]   I guess I get a presentation.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.600]   I just have it.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.880]   I, uh, I find myself typically, you know, I end up with this like late night taxi ride
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:39.640]   back from, uh, you know, from SFO a lot and, uh, I find myself, I just go through CNN and
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.760]   I like read articles on the way home and that, you know, it's slow, but it, you know, it
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.280]   takes me just a second for it to load up.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.760]   But it doesn't, it's not really that bad.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.760]   I mean, it's bad.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.080]   Like I wouldn't do anything that I wasn't a rush to do, but when I'm waiting in line,
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.280]   I don't want anything better to do.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.680]   So it kind of works out fine.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.320]   But yeah, for me, the T-Mobile thing, which I think is hilarious that I'm, I got an 18
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.400]   T phone and then I spend a lot of time.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.400]   It's kind of funny.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.920]   But, um, but the T-Mobile, the fact that it works at every Starbucks, I literally know,
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.200]   you know, I have this radar in the back of my head that just saves, like it just archives
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.680]   every Starbucks I drive by so that I always know where I can go to check my email.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:18.360]   I think it's going to, I think it's going to be really interesting when the iPhone software
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.240]   gets to a point where it can do stuff with the Google suite.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.040]   I mean, can you do like, you can't do Google Docs right now, can you?
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.800]   You can download or you can't edit.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.800]   You can't.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.360]   I have just, there is a fantastic, you know, there's Zoho and there's a number of Docs applications
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.680]   you can use on the iPhone.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.200]   Who is it that does that word processor, Scott?
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.040]   That's G, it's G, or G office.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.040]   That's right.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.960]   I just recently got into the Google calendar and documents and stuff like that.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.720]   And I hadn't spent much time with them for a while, and I just can't believe how far
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.720]   they've come.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.720]   It's really amazing.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.480]   And, you know, the documents, the Docs in particular, Scott is a lot of itches that
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.160]   I've had with mobility issues.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:02.600]   And I just, I think it's, there's a part in the back of my head that wonders, boy, that
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.960]   just, you think about those two little clouds of functionality and what could happen if
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.440]   they got hooked together.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.400]   If you could eventually start doing, you know, the way that, the way that Google right now
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.760]   lets you take so much of what you do into one place, right?
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.520]   Your office stuff, really everything but contact management and task management at this point.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.800]   I guess you do some contact management and Gmail.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   But you know what I mean?
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.360]   Being able to take that and to put that all into one place, I think is a really fascinating
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.360]   idea.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.560]   And that's the frustration for me with the iPhone that it doesn't allow third party apps.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:38.000]   It's so close to being the machine, you know, the final thing, the final portable computer
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.760]   and it just misses by, you know, just enough to make it frustrating.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.120]   But I'm sure it'll be fixed and time it will be that thing.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.120]   It's got the keys.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.120]   They're there, the functionality is there.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.960]   Did you ever see that though?
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.960]   Hack it in.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.960]   They're starting to hack it in.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.000]   They are that hello world application though.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.800]   It's so painful to make that anything work.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.680]   I don't know if anybody will do that.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.680]   Why?
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.120]   It's just the beginning.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:05.440]   The question is really whether the real question is whether Apple's going to do it.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.200]   I think it has to come from Apple.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.200]   No, they can go one way or the other.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.120]   They can do what they've done in the past, which is saying we're not going to support
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.120]   it.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.040]   We're not going to promise that it'll always work, but we're not going to stop you from
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.040]   doing it.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.040]   So I would do that.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.040]   Why wouldn't they just go out?
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.920]   Well, I'm a movie did that, which is I'm a movie they basically did not release an SDK.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.640]   People were verse engineered how to make plug-in.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.640]   Really?
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.120]   There's no published way to make a plug-in.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.440]   You just have to figure it out.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.440]   I think there is now.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.160]   I think that there's some kind of rudimentary one.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.680]   But for years when I'm when I'm a movie came out and there was no SDK, you had to figure
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.840]   it out on your own.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.720]   But in Apple wouldn't really support it.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.840]   But they also didn't close it off.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.840]   So if you figured out how to do it, you could do whatever you wanted to do with it.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.360]   And part of that comes down to Apple not.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.120]   There's a lot of sensitivity, at least with the people that we've talked to, where they
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.800]   don't release the SDKs immediately because they want the room to innovate.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.760]   They want to be able to continue to change the OS, change the other pieces without having
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.920]   all these guys complaining to them that now that their plug-ins are broken.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.680]   And so it's not just part of it is they want to figure some of the stats.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.400]   Well, that's why you release an SDK.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:10.360]   You release an SDK to say, okay, because otherwise everybody develops is developing on thin ice
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.120]   because at any time Apple could change it.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:16.560]   The point of the SDK is say, look, these are the things and you just be clear.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.920]   These are the things we're going to stick with.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.880]   I understand they want full room, but you'd be crazy to develop.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.640]   Well, look at Haxes, for instance.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.720]   These guys fight OS 10 constantly because OS 10 is constantly pulling the rug out from
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.720]   monitor them.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.720]   Right.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.720]   Publish an SDK.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.720]   That's the whole point.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.360]   Encourage developers.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.040]   How can you go wrong with that?
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.360]   Well, I think that it comes, I think that the issue is I know with some of the graphics
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.160]   apps and I don't know about the iPhone at all, but I know with the graphics apps the
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.000]   problem is that they are literally still changing lots of stuff within the core.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Well, that's a mistake.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.680]   They need to settle down.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.720]   Yeah, and that's, it's an Apple.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.040]   There's a culture there that is that we're not going to settle it down.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.200]   We're going to make sure that it is exactly the way we want it before we really make it
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:01.000]   easy for everyone to do it because if people want to figure it out on their own, they can,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.640]   but we're not going to promise them anything.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:08.200]   I think that history has now proven that that's a mistake.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:13.040]   To some degree, but I think that the issue is with, for the developers who do figure
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.400]   it out, I know that the guys, I'm fairly certain talking to some of the guys that did
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.520]   some of the iMovie stuff early on, they made a lot of money because they were the only
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.520]   ones out there.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.240]   You know, so the people who developed it, who get through that, that, you know, Briar
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.480]   Patch can do really well because there's not a lot of other competition.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:33.880]   And I don't think that Apple's going to keep it that way forever, but I think that especially
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.680]   early on as they're figuring out stuff, as they've just released something new, I think
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.720]   that because I'm in the same boat, I'm dying to see apps.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.720]   I'm dying to write apps.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.360]   I'm dying to have more applications.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.720]   I'm not interested in the web apps at all.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.560]   It just drives me crazy because I have to find them and I have to do this stuff.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.680]   And I haven't found any of them particularly in a format that I want to use.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.000]   So I agree with you that I really want to see the applications.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   And I think we're going to see it.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.840]   I think that, but I don't, I think that what's interesting is people are already starting
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.840]   to put them on.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.920]   And I think you'll see more and more people playing with it.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.800]   The big question is whether Apple will thwart them or just let them just kind of run along.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.240]   That's one we'll know.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.240]   Seriously.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.880]   All that tells me is that there's huge demand and Apple should sit up and listen because
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:20.560]   it all of it, all of its customers are saying, open up the platform.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:26.440]   Actually, I'm sorry to be the negative spin on this part of it, but that's not what I
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.440]   hear.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.600]   I think that's the, I think that's the loud battle cry from, you know, the technology
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:37.800]   elite and the super users and the 5% of people that really know what they're doing with a
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.960]   smartphone.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.480]   The average mom and pop, I don't think cares whether or not they open up the phone.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:47.160]   I think they're on the contrary excited about the fact that their phone doesn't crash because
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.960]   they've loaded 23 third party apps on the average mom and pop are even buying the iPhone.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.960]   Right.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.960]   I don't know.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.400]   I could be wrong, but I know that I think only adopters are buying.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.760]   I'm just looking at surveys, Lee.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.480]   I'm just looking at surveys that have been published that talk about the percentage of
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:07.680]   people that in general use smartphones and the access that they make to third party apps
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.520]   is less than 5% of the users take advantage of that.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.400]   Yeah, but the, I mean, they sucked.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.080]   Yeah, and I'll say that could be.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.080]   That could be.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.720]   I was just going to say that the, I mean, it may not be anything that people even realize
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.720]   that they want or need, but you know, the development of this stuff, if you, I suspect
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.840]   that a lot of the stuff that's gotten good over the last few years has gotten good because
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.840]   of that bleeding edge part of the curve and people who have pushed what you've been able
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.080]   to deal with that.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:38.600]   So I mean, I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be asking people at the far left end of the
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.160]   curve what they think about development for the iPhone.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.680]   I'm not, I mean, I'm not sure that that's really the best.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.640]   Probably neither end of the curve left or right.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.960]   You know, it's the grand middle, but on this, in this case, I don't think the grand middle
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.160]   of the iPhone is the, is the average consumer.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:57.120]   I think the iPhone is still a specialty product for, for early adopting audience.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.880]   And part of the reason is lack of functionality.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.040]   I think a lot of people look at it, you know, and it's sad because I also see people who
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:08.080]   buy it thinking they're going to get GPS, you know, thinking that Google Maps is really
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.320]   GPS or I mean, I talk to people all the time who think the iPhone could do things it can't.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:21.120]   But that when people really find out, Leo, and what, what GPS means to the phone, you
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.360]   know, let's talk about what it did.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.360]   You're in 95.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.160]   It sucked about half your battery life out.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.720]   It takes, it takes four or five minutes to find the satellites.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.720]   Come on.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.720]   I agree.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.160]   You know, I haven't yet seen GPS well at the minute in the phone, but I'm not disagreeing
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.160]   with you on that.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.600]   I'm just thinking that there are people who aren't buying the phone because of the things
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.600]   it doesn't do.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.480]   And there are also people buying the phone thinking it does things that it doesn't do.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:48.720]   Well, I have a Tom Tom, I have a Tom Tom right now, a little GPS that works great.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.640]   I don't need to be built into the phone if they were just let them write an application
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.640]   that could see it.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.000]   You know, I mean, they're sitting here, you can have an application that's using Wi-Fi
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   or whatever.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.080]   Even just stereo Bluetooth for crying out loud.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:04.200]   I have stuff to plug in these lame ass Apple iPod headphones.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.360]   I've got a great stereo Bluetooth headset that would work really well with this if they
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.880]   just implement it, if they just put it in.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.880]   Right.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.480]   I mean, there's lots of things like that.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:18.960]   The fact that it can't take a movie is just bizarre.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.200]   I mean, the functionality is there, they could make a movie.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.200]   It can't shoot video.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.360]   Oh, okay.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.360]   That's bizarre.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.040]   I mean, you've got the functionality already there.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.240]   I don't understand why you know.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.240]   By the way, I was surprised.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:38.640]   I think we all thought that there would be a patch by now because of this Safari vulnerability.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.760]   I'm still holding out for tomorrow.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.680]   Every day, every week you say tomorrow.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.080]   I just can't.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.240]   I can't believe they're going to let it go to the Black Hat Conference unpatched.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.240]   Do you think that?
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.240]   No.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.240]   I mean, that's what's puzzling.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.400]   When's Black Hat start now, right?
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:57.360]   I think it's, well, I don't know when we're going to air this show, but I think it's Thursday.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.360]   Okay.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:03.960]   So you're saying, by Wednesday, if they don't, as far as I'm concerned, they got egg on their
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.960]   face.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.200]   Well, my iTunes isn't going to check until August, well, I'm going to check my iTunes,
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.800]   but I think it says it's not going to check until August 7th or 8th.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.880]   August, well, but you can check anytime you want.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.400]   You can, but the, but it won't be automatic.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   Right.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.680]   Let me see when it says it's going to check next.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.520]   It says next August 5th.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.680]   So it's not going to check till too late.
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.000]   You might need to check yourself.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.680]   I might have to push that check for update button.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.800]   I think, I think it's a mistake not to do it unless they're trying to somehow bluster
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.840]   and bluff and say, well, it's such a small thing we're not going to worry about.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.520]   I think they need to fix it.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:44.000]   Is that date, by the way, because I activated it on Saturday or whatever?
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.840]   And it's just been a week, a week, a week.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.840]   So is it different for everybody with the update?
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.080]   Yeah, mine is different.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.080]   I can't remember it.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.440]   Mine's on Sundays for some reason.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.440]   Okay.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.480]   So it is different dates.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.040]   You can rest assured we'll be notifying people when it happens.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.960]   We'll do a special.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.280]   But my hope is that when it comes out, there'll be some extra functionality too.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.080]   Well, there are four empty slots there on the bottom of the phone.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.320]   I want to point that out.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.280]   No, we've been saying that for a while.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:14.040]   Meanwhile, there's a big hack just came out for, and I think a really great hack for the
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.040]   Apple TV.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.440]   It's too bad it's so hard to do.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.680]   But finally, you can use an external USB drive as storage.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.240]   Do you feel like you eat that?
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.400]   No.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.800]   But there are those who do.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.920]   This is the problem is that the Apple TV is just like an iPod.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:37.920]   You have to have enough storage space on your Apple, your Mac to mirror it.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.520]   So I got a, I have 160 gig Apple TV.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.520]   I upgraded it.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.520]   At first, I did try to do it myself and I botched it badly.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.400]   So I ordered another one from weeknies.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.320]   It was upgraded for me.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:57.640]   And so it's 160, which is more than I'm on a dedicate anyway on any of my Macs.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.280]   So I don't really, I realized, but what did I buy that big drive for?
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:05.520]   The only reason is if you hack it and you've now got some extensions that allow you to download
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.520]   stuff directly to it.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:10.120]   Then you might want, because you know, you can hack it, put BitTorrent on it and so forth.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.920]   Then you might want to have a lot of, you might want to attach a Drobo to add a terabyte
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:14.920]   of storage.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:19.920]   And you could keep, you know, every single one of the King Kong films on there or something.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:26.440]   I never heard the post mode among your, your disk drive expansion for your Apple TV.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.320]   I'm just, I guess I'm all thumbs.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.960]   So I bought a, you know, it's just a laptop drive.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.120]   So I bought a 160 gigabyte laptop drive.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.680]   And I followed the process, which is pretty well documented of, you have to open up the
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:47.600]   Apple TV, take out the internal drive and use DD, a command line tool to image it, which
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.200]   I've done.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.840]   And then you take the new drive, you plug it into some sort of interface and I have a
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:57.800]   USB, one of those new tech USB interfaces are plugged into that and DD back onto it.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.680]   I did that then you've got to do some rigamarole.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.520]   This is where it fell apart for me to expand.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.600]   Because it's, it's, it's, it's now copied the same partition sizes from the smaller 40
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.280]   gig drive onto the 160.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:15.600]   So you have to expand the data partition and through some magic commands again in the
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.600]   command line.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.640]   And I know I'm doing them right, but it just never, I can never format that data partition.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.960]   Then I tried, so I, okay, well, at least I've got the old drive, a drive, I put it back
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.560]   in, but it doesn't go in quite as beautifully as it did the first time.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.680]   And the thing makes a little liney noise now.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.680]   Oh, no.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:36.640]   And of course, my wife who was living with the Apple TV, because we have it in the bedroom,
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.040]   when it was quiet, NASA says, what is that?
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.320]   There's something going, it's not that loud, but it's loud.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.280]   Leo, I'm hearing a second wine.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.040]   There's another wine.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.240]   Here's another wine was enough having you wine.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:54.960]   So she unplugs it every night, which doesn't do wonders for the Apple TV.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.480]   So finalize in our end, I'm getting into it.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.080]   The new one, 160 gig drive is silent.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:04.360]   So they obviously weeknies put a drive in without adding to the noise level.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.600]   So my advice, if you want to do this is to know what you're doing.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:11.440]   Now, there is a way to get SSH on one of these drives without opening it up, but it's the
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.280]   most hideously complex thing.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:20.720]   It involves booting from a special OS 10 partition on a USB drive, an emergency recovery partition
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.040]   and doing stuff that I'm just, I'm done.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.640]   I actually use the Apple TV.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.200]   I'm done messing with it.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.080]   I just want it to work and it does now and it's quiet.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.080]   My wife doesn't know.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.360]   I'm afraid trying to change the hard drive on my last laptop, which made it my last laptop
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.200]   instead of my current laptop.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:41.960]   I kind of beat me, beat me into the ground of not really playing with my Apple hardware.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.360]   This thing, here's the thing I think I left off.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.920]   And I've got it right in front of me.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.520]   There are these little silver pads that I thought, well, that's just kind of magical
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:53.240]   thinking that are on the drive.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.600]   And now I'm realizing there must be some sort of noise.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.480]   There's some little noise dampening thing they've done, these little silver pads.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.480]   Ah, yeah.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.240]   So from by Rick, whatever.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.560]   Plus I lost some screws that didn't help.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.560]   They're here somewhere.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.280]   We've always bad when you end up with two or three extra screws.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.280]   It's not good.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.120]   We've always thought you had a few screws.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:17.280]   Anyway, my advice is either you don't need a truth as you don't need a giant drive, but
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:23.200]   now you can if you want, put a Drobo or some massive USB drive on there for reasons I
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.200]   don't, I'm not completely.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.200]   I just find that I don't feel like I need it.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.200]   I mean, I feel like I'm using it.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.600]   Do you use the Apple TV or are you using it?
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.600]   Yeah, we have one in the office.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.600]   I don't have one.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.320]   Oh, you don't use it personally then?
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:37.640]   No, no, no, I, I, um, I don't have a TV.
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.920]   And Merlin, oh, shut up.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.360]   And Merlin, you sent yours back, right?
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.360]   No.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.360]   You use it?
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.360]   Oh gosh, yeah.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.360]   We use it every night.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:50.080]   And like I say, I never know if I can mention this because I don't, I think this is legal,
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:55.480]   but I mean, we actually ripped DVDs that we own because I would rather use Apple TV
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.240]   than my busted ass $35 DVD.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.240]   Yeah, me too.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.240]   And I love it.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.320]   I, I, a couple of things.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.360]   First of all, I, I too feel like I don't need a big drive.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.360]   Right.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.360]   I've got, I've got-
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.280]   You can stream for one thing.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.520]   You can stream okay.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.680]   Let me see what my setting is.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.240]   I think I set mine to say, because movies are the biggest thing.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.560]   I've said 10 most recent un-watched movies.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.560]   Me too.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.560]   Yep.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.560]   And then selected movies.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.600]   And so if I want to make sure something gets back in line, I can do that.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.480]   I've been pretty happy with that.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.240]   I haven't come near filling it up.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.360]   And you have the 40 gig.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.360]   I've got the 40 gig.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.400]   And also I really, I got to say I enjoy doing things like I put podcasts on there.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.560]   I kind of like having that on there.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.560]   I've been loving it.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.440]   I think this is a product that really got under noticed.
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.440]   It deserves more attention.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.920]   I know it's a specialized audience, but boy, this is one of my-
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:48.960]   I was going to say it's something that I don't really feel like, you know, as much as I'm
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.520]   an advocate for things like being able to hack on the iPhone, I don't really feel any
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.120]   need to do anything to this.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.800]   If they can get that YouTube thing, my YouTube thing still is not working.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   Mine worked right away.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.960]   Well, I mean, I've got very few videos showing up.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:07.000]   But I got to tell you, I would like nothing better than to sit around all day throughout
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.200]   the day tagging stuff as favorites.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.280]   Yeah, my wife, my kids do that.
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.840]   Well, again, I mean, again, to come back to this Google thing, because I guess it's on
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.480]   my mind, but think about that.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.360]   Think about it that they really got this thing working and tuned well so that through the
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:24.600]   day you're at work, you're seeing stuff you want to look at later, you're basically kind
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.400]   of flaguing up YouTube videos.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.400]   Same as you would in iTunes.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.400]   Good idea.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.400]   How bad would that be?
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.400]   And then you get this nice full version.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.840]   You can sit there and say, "Show me all the videos that I flag today."
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.240]   I wish they'd get the higher quality videos out there though, because-
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.920]   Yeah, they're pretty janky looking.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.480]   I watched Chocolate Rain on there the other night though, and that made me feel good.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.800]   Leo, have you heard Chocolate Rain yet?
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.520]   You know, everybody's talking about it.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.440]   Check it on the YouTube and do a search for Chocolate Rain.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.200]   Is it a musical?
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.840]   It's a young man singing a song, a very repetitive-
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.800]   Were you talking about it on that at night?
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.280]   I didn't quite get it.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.520]   Really annoyingly catchy.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.720]   My wife hates it maybe more than anything in the world and now she's singing it.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.640]   It's funny, my wife just watches dick in a box over.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:13.640]   [music]
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:17.640]   [music]
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.640]   [music]
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.640]   [music]
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.640]   [music]
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.640]   [music]
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.640]   [music]
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.640]   [music]
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.640]   [music]
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.640]   That's not his real voice, is it?
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.640]   Apparently.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:34.640]   The kid looks 12.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.640]   He sounds like Robert Goulay.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.640]   [music]
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.640]   [music]
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.640]   [music]
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.640]   [music]
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.640]   [music]
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:42.640]   [music]
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.640]   Oh, I like the little-
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.640]   Rain.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.640]   Rain.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.640]   It's a cent- it's centaurian, for sure.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.640]   So what is it-
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.640]   Actually, it would be great if the new manuma kid would sing that song.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.640]   You know what?
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.640]   Check out the views on that though.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.640]   2.3 million.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.640]   I'm gonna- you know what?
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.640]   I'm gonna do- I'm gonna record a lip sync right after this show.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.640]   Of chocolate rain.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.640]   It's really long.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.640]   It's really long.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.640]   The prison's made.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.640]   You wonder where it went chocolate-free.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.640]   That can't be his real voice.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.640]   Do you watch, can't, and save the world we're driving?
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.640]   Tom, he does karaoke rick astley as well.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.640]   You can check that out.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.640]   Same guy?
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.640]   Oh yeah.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.640]   Karaoke rick astley?
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.640]   His name is Tay Zonde.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:25.640]   That's right.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:26.640]   Is he famous?
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.640]   He's an internet- he's an internet sensation.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.640]   Good Lord.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.640]   There is already a Darth Vader remix.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.640]   Yeah, that's pretty funny.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.640]   Is that funny?
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.800]   Yeah, I mean it says- it's a guy's realizing he's thinking he sounds kind of a lot like
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.640]   Darth Vader so he adjusts the sound just a little bit to turn it into a bona fide-
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.640]   Oh, clear rain.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.640]   Wow.
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:49.640]   But you know, for 2.4 million views it only has three stars.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.640]   Well-
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.640]   There's Tay Zonde haters out there too, aren't there?
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.640]   I think that any kind of-
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.640]   I think that any kind of thing you see a lot of highs and a lot of lows.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.640]   Anyway, so I watched that on the Apple TV.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.640]   It's not a great chocolate rain.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:03.640]   Chocolate rain.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:04.640]   You're going to be singing it all night now.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.640]   He's the Sammy Davis Jr. of the YouTube- I mean look at him.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.640]   He's doing the face of everything.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.640]   The green.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.640]   Oh, I like that.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.640]   Do we have his wings?
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.640]   Do we have his wings?
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.640]   The camera out and see the live chocolate rain.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.640]   That's what I'm going to buy one.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:19.640]   What are you going to buy?
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.640]   The next rev, when they come out with the 2.0 product, that's what I'm going to get.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.640]   Well, this is the 160 now they offer.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.640]   That's kind of-
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.640]   Yeah, but I mean like, you know, a complete like, you know, the next thing.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.640]   I don't know.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.640]   I think Apple is this is kind of an orphan.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.640]   I wonder if they're going to keep making it.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.640]   I do too.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.640]   Oh, wow.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.640]   I really do.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.640]   Did you hear the rumor this week that they're going to abandon the mini?
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.640]   That rumor's been going around for months.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.640]   I'm buying another one just because of rumor.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.640]   Okay.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.640]   That'll, that pretty much be-
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.640]   And then the next day they'll be a new one.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.640]   That's the death bell of the existing mini right there.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:58.440]   I was using my mini yesterday to rip for my Apple TV as a matter of fact, using visual
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.440]   hub.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.440]   Family guy.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:06.440]   I really think the mini is the version 2 of the Apple TV.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.440]   I, you know, maybe that's really-
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:13.440]   If they would add Apple TV functionality to that mini, that is the same thing, isn't
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.440]   it?
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.440]   That would be-
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.440]   That'd be awesome.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:20.440]   I mean, we have a lot of guys in the office that are using them for- using them for media
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.440]   servers now.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:27.040]   You know, with their, their, the ITV, I guess, you know, so they can record stuff and, you
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.280]   know, and, and it keeps it all in a nice big drive and you can have the extensibility.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.760]   You can have a lot of the things.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:32.760]   I like that.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.320]   You don't have that out of the box Apple TV kind of feel, but you can do most almost everything
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.040]   else with it.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.040]   And didn't know-
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.480]   But Gatto come out with something that competes with the Apple TV this week.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.480]   Did they?
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.480]   Oh, I love Elgato stuff.
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.480]   I think they did.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.480]   So we got to look into that.
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.480]   You need to see ato.com.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.480]   Let me see.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.480]   I got something-
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.480]   I got something-
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.960]   I got a press release on my desk.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.120]   I didn't have time to read it.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.120]   Well, I'll just-
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.120]   Hello, Turbo 264, no.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.120]   Oh.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.240]   Turbo Charge exports to your iPod and Apple TV.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.240]   I don't think that's the new product.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.560]   I mean, no, that's kind of neat.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.560]   That's kind of a good idea, which is-
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.480]   There's some testing in the USB.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.480]   Oh, here it is.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.880]   HD Home Run for the Mac.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.280]   Networked Digital TV for all your Macs.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:19.200]   It has, it supports QAM, which means you could watch HD.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.200]   If you connected it to a-
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.200]   Oh, it is.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.520]   It's a network connected HD tuner.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.080]   So you can, you can hook it into, you can hook your cable network, your, your, your, your
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:30.120]   digital cable network into this and then hook it via ethernet to the network and then
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.240]   you could watch it on different machines.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:37.080]   But can you listen to chocolate rain on it?
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.960]   Who has to be bawling yesterday chocolate rain?
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.760]   I want to keep playing this.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.160]   I love it.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.320]   I think I know what we're going to be tiling this up.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.320]   I love it.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.320]   I can't-
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.320]   But you got to see the video.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.320]   It's not the song.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.320]   You got to see the video.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.320]   It takes a breath.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.720]   He has to get away from the mic to take a breath.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:58.360]   So he does this kind of little, little jivey move that's, that's infectious.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.960]   You're occupied right.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.480]   Did he write the song?
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.800]   I think he did.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.440]   And, and it's, it's a quote my, my coach teacher from college.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.880]   There's no need for it to ever end.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.600]   It might as well go up forever and ever.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.600]   Cause it's really, there's no, there's nothing.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.600]   There's not even a-
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.600]   It's not even a melody.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.600]   Does it change?
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:19.000]   It's my college roommate says used to say of rush, it's all overture.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.280]   Let me go to the end and see if it, it's all overture.
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:28.280]   Let me go to the, let me go to the end and see if it changes.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:35.280]   It's just making up crap.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.280]   Now, does it answer?
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.280]   I never made it to the end.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.280]   He said GDP.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.280]   He said GDP.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.280]   It might be an Easter egg if you make it to the end.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.280]   I've never made it to the end.
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.280]   Let's just stand there.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.280]   That's the end.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.280]   He's not standing there.
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.280]   That's the end.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.280]   He's not standing there.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:54.280]   It's just listening to music.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.280]   He's looking at you and smiles.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.280]   And that's it.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.280]   And he sits down.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.280]   Two million views.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.280]   Two million views.
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.280]   And we're going to add a few right here.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.280]   I think there's something very disturbing about our-
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.280]   Shuck train.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.280]   You got to see it, Scott.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.280]   You got to see this fight.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:15.280]   As soon as we finish this recording, I will hopefully enjoy it enough to put it there
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:18.280]   in the annals of my new minuma video, which I try to watch.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.280]   Once a week just to get a good laugh.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.280]   Somebody's going to do the new minuma of this.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.280]   Although this is- There's already lots of people doing-
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.280]   There's a lot of parodies.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.280]   There's a lot of- What would be great is when I get my motorcycle, I could ride down the
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:38.280]   street and have Alex on a chase vehicle sideways with the video and I would be lip syncing
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.280]   to chocolate rain as I drew it back.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:43.280]   Here's his version of "Never Gonna Give It Up".
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.280]   He's one of hat now.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.280]   He kind of looks like Sinatra.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.280]   If he were 12 years old and black.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.280]   We have no strangers to love.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.280]   This is the younger Tae-Zan Day.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.280]   This is before he really matured as a talent, I think.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.280]   Chairman and the board.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.280]   Only- So we got a new show coming on, don't we?
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.280]   We called "Mac Break Weekly's Got Talent".
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:12.280]   We should send us your videos.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.280]   We'd like to hear- That's so scary.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:25.600]   (Singing)
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.460]   Could be, could be a big hit.
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:29.460]   Mmm.
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:30.960]   What other, is there any other quick?
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.540]   We've got a couple of software updates to talk about, got the new airport extreme update.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:35.540]   Oh, I didn't see that?
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:36.540]   Yeah.
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:38.140]   That's for the Intel Macs only.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.180]   I didn't get that.
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.700]   Did that must have come out today?
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:41.700]   It did.
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.100]   And also we've got the, the Pro Services.
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:48.940]   Update, if you own stuff like Final Cut and Soundtrack 4.01 came out.
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:50.740]   I got that installed.
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:53.740]   What does the airport intend to make any difference, but it was great.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:54.740]   It was all good.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:55.660]   I mean, I was, I mean, I was, I was.
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:44:01.280]   The airport update, it just says, report, users reported crashes and instability relating
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.900]   to network, networking wirelessly on Apple's own support forum.
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:08.180]   So this allegedly acknowledges that issue.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.580]   There were some drop, drop network issues, I think recently.
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.540]   A lot of people were suffering from drop networks.
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:17.940]   So you think, I have to say my airport extreme works like a charm.
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:21.740]   I was like, I'm dropping a ring.
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:22.740]   Sure.
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:23.740]   My hat's trouble.
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:24.740]   It makes me crazy.
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:29.620]   I still can't believe that anytime I want to make a change, I've got to restart the
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:30.660]   freaking router.
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.900]   That's just wild to me.
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:35.780]   Mine is out here for three months and never missed a beat.
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:38.180]   And it's, it works better than any router I've ever had.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:42.220]   I don't know if you ever have to change anything about it because your next activity will go
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:43.220]   down.
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:47.860]   But here's the thing, Merlin, there's certain bliss in not being a super user.
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.620]   I plug stuff in and forget about it.
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:57.340]   I have a bunch of airport expresses and it's like a network of aphasias.
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:02.500]   It's like they've all had some traumatic head damage.
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.860]   And I frequently have to re-educate them.
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.860]   And it's vexing.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:06.860]   Anyway, no one cares.
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.660]   You know, I have to, I went to, there wasn't, there's no Apple store around where my kids
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:10.660]   live.
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.660]   And I've got my iPhone talking to it.
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.900]   I've got my laptop talking to it.
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:18.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:20.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:22.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:24.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:25.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:26.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:27.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:28.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:29.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:30.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:31.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:32.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:33.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:34.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:35.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:36.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:41.900]   I'm going to change the direction completely.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:42.900]   Yes.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:43.900]   We can't break.

[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:51.900]   I'm going to change the direction.
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:52.900]   I'm going to change the direction.

[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:13.900]   I'm going to change the direction.
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:15.900]   By the way, I'm downloading it right now.
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:16.900]   Wow.
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:18.900]   I told you it was any day.
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:19.900]   I told you.
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:20.900]   You were wrong.
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:21.900]   You said tomorrow, dude.
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:22.900]   I said bye tomorrow.
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:23.900]   Oh, okay.
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:24.900]   You're right.
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:25.900]   Fireball.
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:26.900]   Fireball.
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:27.900]   So that's it.
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:30.900]   Now, 1.01 implies really that the only thing that's
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:31.900]   doing is fixing that Safari bug.
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:32.900]   I would guess.
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:33.900]   Well, I don't know.
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:35.900]   There's probably some other bugs that they've addressed
[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:36.900]   as well.
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:37.900]   We'll find out.
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:38.900]   It doesn't apply new features.
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:39.900]   Maybe that's why they did that.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:40.900]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:41.900]   Cool.
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:44.900]   Well, it says it's going to install when the download is
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:45.900]   complete.
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:47.900]   Are you downloading yours?
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:48.900]   I am.
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.900]   Isn't this amazing?
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:51.900]   This actually happened while we were taping.
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:55.900]   And I just got a firmware upgrade from my hipster PDA.
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.900]   If you'd get your hand out of your pants, you wouldn't have
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:04:59.900]   that problem.
[01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:00.900]   You know, it fixed.
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.900]   It fixed.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:03.900]   I don't know what to say to that.
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:04.900]   Chocolate rain.
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:05.900]   It's good.
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:06.900]   Anytime.
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:07.900]   What did it fix?
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:12.900]   Oh, no, actually, you know, I had a problem with the binder clip
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:13.900]   catching on my pants.
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:14.900]   I am now.
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:15.900]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:17.900]   Now it just slides right in, doesn't it?
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:18.900]   Slides right in.
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:19.900]   No lubrication necessary.
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:20.900]   Fixing in books.
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:23.900]   This is going to no longer get the clean tag.
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.900]   I'm just changing that right now.
[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:29.900]   So anything else, MBW ideas, by the way, folks, if you want to
[01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:31.900]   help us and avoid these rat holes, you can.
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:34.900]   Just go to Delicious and post my videos.
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:39.900]   I can.
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:44.900]   Anything at all, I will talk about it as long as you tag at MBW ideas.
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:47.900]   I think, Leo, I mentioned this because it's something that I'm
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:48.900]   going to do.
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:51.900]   I didn't talk about this before the show, but I kind of like the
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:52.900]   idea of occasionally taking a call.
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:53.900]   I think we should get the kids involved.
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:54.900]   You want to do that?
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:55.900]   I mean, too late.
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:56.900]   Do it next week you want to take a call?
[01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:57.900]   No, no, no, no.
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:58.900]   Not this week.
[01:05:58.900 --> 01:05:59.900]   Not this week.
[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:00.900]   I'm just saying it might be fun.
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:01.900]   Maybe take one or two calls.
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:02.900]   Not a lot.
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:05.900]   But you know, until we get to call coming in right now.
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:06.900]   Really?
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:07.900]   Let's take it.
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:08.900]   Let's punch up the line here.
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:09.900]   Who is this?
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:10.900]   Hello?
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.900]   I'm giving you an opening, Mr. Phone Guy.
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:15.900]   Chocolate Rain.
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:18.900]   Wait a minute, extracting software update package.
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:20.900]   This is exciting.
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:22.900]   I swear to God, I thought you were going to play chocolate rain.
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:23.900]   I did too.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:25.900]   That's what I was sitting there waiting for you to do.
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:26.900]   I already closed that window.
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:27.900]   What are you talking about?
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:28.900]   I'm busy downloading.
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:29.900]   All right.
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:30.900]   I'll go back to chocolate rain.
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:31.900]   Chocolate Rain.
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:34.900]   It is obscenely catchy.
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.900]   I'm trying to find what this thing does.
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:38.900]   So you think it's just bug.
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:41.900]   Buryfying existing iPhone software.
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:46.900]   Oh, oh, my iPhone has like that little apple with a firmware upgrade going on right now.
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:48.900]   Are you doing this too?
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:49.900]   We're at the same time, Scott.
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:50.900]   Well, I'm downloading.
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:54.900]   It's not working as fast for me because I got a couple other things going on.
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.900]   This feels so good.
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.900]   You and I together, Scott, we're updating our firmware.
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:00.900]   Wow.
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:03.900]   Let's just keep this in perspective, folks.
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:07.900]   This is the Apple phone guy and I'm updating firmware with him.
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:09.900]   You should just name.
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:14.900]   Did you see David Pogues tirade about his AT&T bill?
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:16.900]   Have you got a million?
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:17.900]   I haven't got a million.
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:18.900]   Yeah.
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:19.900]   David's right.
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:21.900]   AT&T itemizes every data transaction you make.
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:26.900]   It doesn't give you details, but it says three bytes on December 4, 1927.
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:28.900]   Four bytes on August 4, 19.
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.900]   I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.900]   Like 20 pages of it.
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.900]   And he points out, nobody cares.
[01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.900]   Don't you don't have to give us that information?
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:44.900]   Speaking of journalistic integrity, the fine journalistic home of integrity, the New York
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:51.900]   Post, lambasted Mr. Pogues for writing a book about the iPhone while at the same time covering it for the New York Times.
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:53.900]   That's a good point.
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:54.900]   Why?
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:55.900]   Is that a good one?
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:59.900]   Well, because it's the New York Post and they don't like the New York Times.
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:01.900]   But it also means he has an interest in iPhone sales.
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:04.900]   He's writing about the iPhone while he's writing about the iPhone?
[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:05.900]   How's that a problem?
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.900]   No, because it means that he would...
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:08.900]   Well, you're right.
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:09.900]   But he's promoting iPhone...
[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:14.900]   In theory, in order to promote the sales of his book, he would want to promote iPhone sales, right?
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:19.900]   In other words, if you've got an economic stake in the success of the iPhone, you're not going to downplay it.
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:21.900]   We should get a rabbi on here.
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:26.900]   If you can write, you can come in and settle these Talmudic issues.
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:28.900]   What about Roger Ebert?
[01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:29.900]   Roger Ebert puts out books.
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:30.900]   And reviews, movies.
[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:31.900]   And reviews, by the third era.
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:32.900]   And writes movies.
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:38.900]   By the third paragraph of Pogues review, he was attacking the phone.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:41.900]   I know David very well, and I know that he is...
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:44.900]   He takes care of very deeply about being objective.
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:47.900]   But you apologize on my behalf to him about the whole journalist thing.
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:50.900]   Tell him he's accepted from that, because he seems pretty cool.
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:51.900]   David's great.
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:52.900]   Well, you know what?
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:53.900]   He's been on this show.
[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:55.900]   He was on the very first episode.
[01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:57.900]   And we'll have him on again.
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.900]   He's just a great guy.
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:00.900]   It's the kind of guy you really like.
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:01.900]   I mean, I'm not...
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:02.900]   He's going to...
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:03.900]   He's going to think on...
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:04.900]   He's going to think on an APC.
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:05.900]   He's going to think on an APC.
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:06.900]   We should have him on next week.
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:07.900]   Should we?
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:10.900]   If it looks like they're going to do some kind of announcement.
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:12.900]   I'm afraid my iPhone firmware update is stalled.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:13.900]   This could be...
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:14.900]   You could hear me.
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:17.900]   You could actually hear an iPhone being bricked right now.
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:18.900]   Oh, quit.
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:19.900]   It's not moving.
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:21.900]   We'll just be patient.
[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:22.900]   I can't.
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:23.900]   I'm going to unplug it.
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:27.900]   Maybe that'll fix it.
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:29.900]   That'll certainly help.
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:30.900]   I'm just going to take it out of the dock.
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:32.900]   That's okay, right?
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:33.900]   Yeah.
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:39.400]   Let's just follow the example of the guy who bricked his Apple TV and figure out what we
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.900]   shouldn't do.
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:43.900]   Sorry, not hyperventilating.
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:44.900]   I need some joy.
[01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:48.900]   This is the first ever podcast where live, but later on tape, people can hear.
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:51.900]   Something this momentous occurring in real time almost.
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:52.900]   It's pretty exciting.
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:56.900]   And Andrew Keene said there's no future for internet media.
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:57.900]   Yeah.
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:00.900]   This is sort of like watching the spaceship get ready to launch, isn't it?
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.900]   He never heard chocolate rain.
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:03.900]   That's the problem.
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:04.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:05.900]   He's going to change his tune.
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.900]   Now, here's the question.
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:10.900]   Should I play chocolate rain while I'm updating the iPhone?
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:13.900]   That could cause some sort of positive shift.
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:16.900]   But not too late.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:22.900]   Ladies and gentlemen, take Sunday at Chunk Ridge.
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:24.900]   Chocolate rain.
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:25.900]   Oh, God.
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:28.900]   Some stay dry and others feel so sorry.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:31.900]   Some stay dry and others feel the pain.
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:34.900]   Are we going to get to some pics at some point in time?
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:35.900]   Right now.
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:36.900]   Okay.
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:40.900]   You start Scott Boren ladies and gentlemen with his pick.
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:45.900]   My pick is iBloNlines.com.
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:51.020]   If you happen to be an iPhone user and you want a really cool RSS reader, there are several
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:53.900]   out there, but I like blog lines on my regular computer.
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:55.900]   Better than Mac Reader and better than Google Reader?
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:56.900]   I do.
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:00.900]   I'm sorry to say because I've gotten used to it and it works fairly reliably.
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:06.180]   And iBloNlines has a bunch of cool features like you can put a pin on something to sort of
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:09.900]   market for looking at it when you get back to your laptop or your desktop.
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:11.900]   It's very iPhone friendly.
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.900]   The menu is very easy to read on an iPhone.
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:15.900]   It's restarting.
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:21.380]   And you can use your same login information as if you have an existing blog lines account.
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:25.300]   And best of all, it is a zero Alex pick.
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:28.780]   No, that's exactly why I like the Google Reader because I already had all my articles
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:29.780]   in there.
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:30.780]   You know, my feeds in there.
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:31.780]   Oh my God.
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.900]   The icons are now black and white.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:34.900]   Wow.
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:36.900]   What an improvement.
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:40.900]   Oh, you must have got the film noir update.
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:44.820]   Did you see there is a hack to change your icons?
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:45.820]   It's black and white.
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:46.820]   Yeah.
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:47.820]   Like anyone who would want to do that.
[01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:49.460]   I guess you could do anything you want.
[01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:52.020]   But it comes with iris edit.
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:53.500]   I think it wants to go online.
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.060]   It says you must disable airplane mode.
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:58.820]   So excuse me if you get some GSM noises.
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:03.380]   That's just my iPhone calling home to tell Apple it's done.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:06.060]   It has been done.
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.860]   Oh my master.
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:12.100]   The update has succeeded.
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.780]   The report phone has been fixed.
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:16.500]   All right, let me try typing my name.
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:20.340]   That's the first thing he wants to see if they fixed that bug.
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:24.100]   You know, that was pretty much what all of Cooper Tino has been working on since June
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:28.500]   29 L A P O. Nope.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.020]   The O got really small still.
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:32.180]   It's still really small.
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:33.700]   Damn you Steve Jobs.
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.340]   Damn you.
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:38.300]   Do you have a pick, Mr. Alex Lindsey?
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:39.300]   I do.
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.220]   I have a pick.
[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:44.740]   So my pick is, and one of the reasons I thought I should pick it is because I don't think
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:47.820]   we've talked about it, but we did talk about it in the last lab.
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:48.820]   And that is Wirecast.
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:49.820]   Yes, yes.
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:50.820]   It is.
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:54.940]   We've been testing it and it's a really, really nifty application.
[01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:56.780]   This is by Vera software.
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:13:03.180]   And this is the full version of Wirecast is about a little over half an Alex.
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:04.180]   So it's not.
[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:07.540]   But there are a bunch of people who don't speak Alex.
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:08.540]   Sorry.
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:10.900]   It's about 300 bucks for those of you who don't speak Alex.
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:11.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:12.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:13.900]   So we actually have to say up.
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:14.900]   Right.
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:15.900]   We can't 450.
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:16.900]   It's 450.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:18.660]   It's $450 for the full version.
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:19.820]   Now there's two other versions.
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:25.900]   So there's a there's Wirecast HDV, which is a smaller thing, which is about $100.
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:29.940]   And there's video queue, which is really, really a basic one that a lot of people who
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:31.260]   just want to get started could use.
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:32.260]   And that's about $40.
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:34.500]   So there's they have different versions of all this stuff.
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:35.980]   But Wirecast basically creates a.
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:37.940]   I mean, to give you an idea.
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:40.620]   I mean, $449 might seem like a lot of money.
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:46.060]   But if you get a hardware version of what they're doing, you're really looking at, you know,
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.620]   starting at $4,000 or $5,000.
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:50.740]   You need to do it at the same at the same level.
[01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:53.220]   So it'll you can basically have two or three different.
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.420]   You can have your video.
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:55.780]   It'll actually do the key for you.
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:57.300]   You can have lower thirds drop in.
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:58.620]   You can have graphics drop in.
[01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:01.580]   You see you can you can do cutting from different angles.
[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:07.660]   And it'll either record it all to a to drive or you can actually stream it to a quick time
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:08.660]   server.
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:10.540]   So it's for people who want to do that type of stuff.
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:16.980]   And we're playing with the idea of doing live wire, you know, live broadcasts, you know,
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:18.540]   related to Mac break and stuff like that.
[01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:20.980]   And so we've been doing lots of tests around that.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:23.540]   And it's funny to say that because I want to do the same thing.
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:27.180]   I'm doing a lot of Ustream now on the radio show and I was thinking of that's why I wanted
[01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:28.340]   to get those XL2s back from me.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.740]   I was thinking of saying up a three camera.
[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:30.740]   Can you use three cameras?
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:31.740]   Yep.
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:32.740]   You can use it.
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:33.740]   It's a matter of money.
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:34.740]   Or I mean, how would you?
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:35.740]   You just look them up.
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.540]   You can do Firewire, USB to the same machine.
[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:38.540]   On the same machine.
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:39.540]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:40.540]   See, that's really good.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:45.380]   I was thinking of doing that and having a switcher and actually switching the show while
[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.380]   I'm doing it.
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:48.500]   And that would be the way you'd be able to do it.
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:52.540]   Can you, you know, one of the inputs be the screen?
[01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:54.540]   That I don't know you.
[01:14:54.540 --> 01:15:00.180]   Well, here's what you could do is that with CamtWist, you could because CamtWist has a
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:04.140]   screen display module and gets seen as a camera.
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:08.220]   I'm not positive, I haven't tried to do that because we have a different pipeline for that.
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:13.220]   But what we're looking at doing actually for that specifically is taking the, there's
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:17.620]   a little converter that'll take DVI and convert it to HDMI.
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:22.060]   And then there is a, then the intensity card, a black magic intensity card will take HDMI
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:24.460]   and then convert it back to video.
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:27.500]   And so what we're looking at doing is actually converting, going out of one computer with
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:31.860]   a screen and go right into an HDMI in and record that drive.
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:32.860]   And that's what it is.
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:35.860]   You would get a DVI to HDMI.
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:36.860]   DVI to HDMI.
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:37.860]   I see.
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:40.900]   So then one of the inputs would be the HDMI input from the black magic.
[01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:42.180]   Now we're just getting ready to test this.
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.180]   We haven't tested it yet.
[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:47.540]   But with Wirecast specifically, we've had great capture experience with the black magic
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:49.300]   card.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:52.700]   So that's actually worked really, really well from our HDMI cameras.
[01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:56.700]   But this isn't kind of another pipe because you know how we get really impatient about
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:16:00.940]   our screen, you know, waiting for our screens to, you know, screen captures.
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:03.940]   And we've gotten around some of that with I show you.
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:05.820]   But it creates stability issues.
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:11.020]   And then, and then, snaps is more stable, but it can wait for a long time.
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:14.860]   And then, but with this, what you'd end up doing is taking just your standard DVI out
[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:17.140]   and then it just converts it to HDMI.
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:20.860]   And it's like a little, I mean, there's, you got to get these things used to cost $3,000.
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:24.220]   And it's just like this little converter that'll convert it to HDMI.
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:27.860]   And so what we're planning to do is then run that into a, into another computer that is
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:32.060]   capturing, you know, from the black magic and, and recording to drive.
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:36.580]   And then it's just done, you know, it's recording and when it's done, it's done to make us happen.
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:37.660]   I'll be very interested here.
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:38.660]   But I'll switch with Wirecast.
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:42.140]   I'd be very interested here how that comes out because I want to actually try that with
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:47.060]   the, you know, we have about 2000 people watch the U stream of the radio show.
[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:48.060]   Right.
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:51.100]   And I'm thinking of doing that on, you know, to you streaming this, if we wanted to take
[01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:55.140]   calls next week, Marilyn, we could do that by a U stream.
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:56.900]   That many, they watched the video.
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:59.020]   1000 people watch me sit there and talk.
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:02.780]   Is that crazy?
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.220]   Now we understand why chocolate rain so popular.
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.220]   Chocolate rain.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:08.860]   I might sing chocolate rain during the commercials.
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:12.420]   I do actually perform a little bit during the commercials.
[01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:14.740]   That could have something to do with it.
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:16.180]   You know what we all ought to do?
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:20.340]   We ought to, the four of us do something we rarely ever do, which is physically get together
[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:25.260]   and do a chocolate rain video, the four of us.
[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:26.700]   That would get five million in one.
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:28.460]   Can we work up a dance?
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:29.460]   Yeah.
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:34.460]   We can do it at the big sound stage with the green screen that Alex can put something cool
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:35.460]   behind it.
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:36.460]   Chocolate rain.
[01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:37.460]   Sure.
[01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:38.460]   Sure.
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:41.100]   We can actually have it raining nestly quick.
[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:45.340]   I think the problem is, I think the problem is that it, by the time we get around to actually
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:48.380]   doing it, no one will ever want to hear it again.
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:50.980]   The fad will have passed and we'll go for it on to something.
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:56.740]   I regret telling Leo about it already.
[01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:57.700]   I want to give you an up.
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:01.220]   So that's your pick, by the way, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:02.740]   It is, what did you say?
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:04.700]   I didn't realize it was that expensive.
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:10.740]   Yeah, it's, you know, for the full version, but the HDB version or smaller, DV version
[01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:12.060]   is only like $99.
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:13.060]   Oh, okay.
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:16.660]   So if you're using smaller stuff, the unlimited version is a little bit more expensive.
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:18.660]   I'll probably get that though.
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:19.940]   And you can try before you buy.
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:20.940]   You don't have to.
[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:21.940]   Yep.
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:22.940]   You can try before you buy it.
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.740]   And I would definitely try it and see if it works for you.
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:28.420]   But I think it's the best thing that I've seen so far to do that.
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:32.020]   And we've been, there was another one called Channel Storm a long time ago.
[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:34.180]   And they just never upgraded it.
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:37.900]   So it looked like it was going to go the right direction and then nothing happened.
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:45.460]   And this is really the best solution that I found of a software mixer recording process.
[01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:47.020]   Very cool.
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:48.460]   I want to give you, I actually don't have a pick.
[01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:51.780]   I just want to give you an update on my Mac Heist experience.
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:52.780]   Mm hmm.
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:53.780]   I like it.
[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:54.780]   Went great.
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:55.780]   I'm actually stunned.
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:57.900]   I got full versions of all the applications.
[01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.980]   I mean, this was, we did this a couple of weeks ago.
[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:01.980]   It was, what was it?
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:02.980]   49 bucks.
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:05.540]   And it was like 12 applications.
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:09.540]   And I was a little concerned, but I got browse back.
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:10.620]   I got Amadeus Pro.
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:13.460]   Both of those are worth 40 or 50.
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.260]   What I paid for it.
[01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:20.420]   I've been using little snitch, which is possibly the most annoying application ever.
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:22.740]   But I make, it makes you feel more secure.
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:24.820]   It's constantly telling me, you know, he's trying to get on it.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:25.820]   He's trying to get on the internet.
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:26.980]   It's well named.
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:27.980]   It's better.
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:28.980]   It gets better.
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:29.980]   Yeah.
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:30.980]   You train it.
[01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:34.420]   And I, you know, I have the same misgivings about all firewall, all outward bound firewall
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:39.140]   programs is that there's this fatigue factor that sets in and after a while you say, yes,
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:41.380]   yes, yes, yes, just let it go all the time.
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:42.500]   I don't care.
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.300]   And then it's not doing anything.
[01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:46.740]   And I got a bunch of stuff.
[01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:54.340]   I mean, pixel mader, private beta, flow private beta, right room.
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:56.500]   This was, this was a, I have to say a good deal.
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:01.060]   And because I bought late in the cycle, all of them had been unlocked.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.060]   Nice.
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:05.620]   So yeah, I was really prepared to say this doesn't work.
[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:07.220]   It's a scam or whatever.
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:08.220]   I don't know why.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.060]   It just seemed to be good to be true.
[01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:11.460]   And it isn't.
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:14.060]   I will, I will, I don't know about the next one.
[01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:15.600]   I don't know anything about that.
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:20.020]   But as far as the last Mac heist that worked, that's Mac heist.com, probably worth paying
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.020]   attention to.
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.020]   It's Philip Ryu.
[01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:23.780]   We've talked about him before.
[01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:30.540]   He's the guy who did disco and didn't he also do the, the contest that you and I were
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:31.540]   judges for.
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:32.540]   I can't remember what the name of that was.
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:33.540]   Yeah.
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:34.540]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:35.540]   He did.
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:36.540]   But it was a good, I'm spacing it.
[01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:38.540]   It's a, what was the name of it was?
[01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:39.540]   Shoot.
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:41.500]   I was like a American idol for applications.
[01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:42.500]   Yeah.
[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:43.660]   And I'm still waiting by the way.
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:48.500]   I know they're actually developing the winning application, but we haven't seen that yet.
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:49.900]   Some waiting to see what happens with that.
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:53.780]   But that was, you know, it was, you know what this guy, if nothing else is a great marketer,
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:21:00.540]   he's clearly done a good job of getting these developers together.
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:01.780]   I hope they're making money.
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:06.180]   That would be my biggest concern, but obviously they're entering into it themselves, you know,
[01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:07.540]   and apparently glad to do so.
[01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:09.340]   So boy, and it was a good deal.
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:10.900]   I got a ton of software.
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.700]   Some of which I don't care about, but some of which I was very happy to get.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:14.700]   I already think.
[01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:15.700]   I digress Leo.
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:16.900]   Has your phone finished updating?
[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:17.900]   Yes.
[01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:18.900]   So what do you think?
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:19.900]   What do you think about it?
[01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:20.900]   I chat.
[01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:21.900]   No.
[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:22.900]   Where?
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:24.140]   You don't, you don't want to I chat?
[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:25.140]   Is it on there?
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:26.140]   Where?
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:27.140]   You don't have it on yours?
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:28.140]   Shut up.
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:30.460]   You lie.
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:33.380]   It doesn't look like it's any different in any way.
[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:34.380]   It's not.
[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:35.380]   I'm just.
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:36.780]   And by the way, it doesn't in any way take off.
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:38.660]   I mean, had a lot of messages and stuff.
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:41.780]   The weather icon is different.
[01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:42.780]   Is it?
[01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:43.780]   Yep.
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:45.140]   Does it now give you the temperature?
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:46.140]   It does.
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:47.140]   It now matches.
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:48.140]   It now matches.
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:49.620]   It gives you the matches.
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:51.020]   The temperature of your front page.
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:53.740]   Temperature and sun condition.
[01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:55.380]   That's something I thought I should do a while ago.
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:56.380]   That's really great.
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:22:02.020]   Now, as soon as I get the stock price to reflect Apple's stock, I'm hitting that button right
[01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:03.020]   now.
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:04.020]   Right on front there.
[01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:08.740]   They should have the little stock, the Scott Bornstock icon.
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:09.740]   Yeah.
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:11.980]   Just says how much 3176 that clothes.
[01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:15.020]   How rich, how much richer you are down almost 10 bucks.
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:16.420]   I'm much poorer today.
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:17.420]   6%.
[01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:18.420]   Wow.
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:19.420]   Wow.
[01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:20.420]   You look at that one week graph.
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:21.420]   It's not good.
[01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:22.420]   Why?
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:23.420]   Thank God for dollar cost averaging.
[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:24.420]   That's all I got to say.
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:26.820]   Dow Jones average only down 1%.
[01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:28.660]   146 points though.
[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:30.140]   This sounds like a radio show now.
[01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:31.900]   Let me see.
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:35.900]   I just want to make sure chocolate rain is still on my...
[01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:38.900]   Just because that would be terrible for it.
[01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:40.900]   Let's just...
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:41.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:43.900]   What a relief.
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:48.860]   So we just want to report and you'll be the first to hear it here that the new iPhone
[01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:53.060]   update does not happen in any way your ability to watch chocolate rain on your iPhone.
[01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:54.060]   Thank goodness.
[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:55.300]   Can you tell any difference, Scott?
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:57.180]   Because it doesn't seem in any way different to me.
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:59.020]   Except for that one weather thing, which is great.
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:02.700]   Yeah, I've had a few seconds to sit here and play with it.
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:08.620]   Obviously not much that I can pick out other than immediately noticing the weather icon matching
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:09.620]   the true conditions.
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:10.620]   Good call on that.
[01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:15.900]   The clock does not show the time, unfortunately, but you already see that on your front anyway.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:16.900]   Right.
[01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:17.900]   So...
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:22.060]   Looks pretty much the same, but a welcome update.
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:23.060]   I guess.
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:25.140]   Merlin, did you have a software pick?
[01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:26.140]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:27.140]   Merlin, software pick.
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:31.660]   Oh, I got a... I got a quickie.
[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:35.140]   I actually posted about this on the site.
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:36.140]   Have we done...
[01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:37.140]   Gosh, why?
[01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:38.580]   I need to get some kind of medication.
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:39.580]   We need to do.
[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:44.260]   We need to get a page and everybody's telling me this where we show all of the picks.
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:46.700]   And I don't know how to do that because I don't have to...
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:48.700]   There's somebody who's keeping track of this.
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:49.700]   Well, if you are...
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:50.700]   If you are, please stop.
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:52.260]   And now there's another one.
[01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:55.940]   Please send me an email, whoever's keeping track because what I will do is I will create
[01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:59.700]   a page at Twit.tv, but the problem is I don't know and I don't want to listen through all
[01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:02.420]   of our old shows to get the old ones.
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:03.420]   So...
[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:05.060]   I guess I'll have to.
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:07.220]   Have we done Roo Switch?
[01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:08.220]   No.
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:09.220]   Good.
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:10.220]   Roo Switch is awesome.
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:11.220]   I download that.
[01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:12.220]   Yeah, what does it do?
[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:13.220]   I have it on my...
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:14.660]   I just posted this on the site today.
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:17.020]   I learned about it.
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:20.020]   I think I learned about it a few months ago and then I was reminded of it by somebody
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:21.540]   in Omni Group.
[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.900]   If you've ever had something where you're using like a...
[01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:27.780]   Let's say you're using a beta of an application or you've got a new version of an app and
[01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:30.780]   you want to be extra safe and make sure that your data doesn't get clobbered with the
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:33.420]   update, this does this really simple little thing.
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:38.740]   It's this program where you drop the icon for say mail.app or Omni Outliner or whatever.
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:43.180]   You drop the icon, you know, you drop the app under this app.
[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:46.860]   So you take the icon, you drop it onto the app.
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:49.020]   I'm going to have it on the app.
[01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:54.940]   What happens is this application finds all of the preferences and application support
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:57.220]   library stuff that's associated with it.
[01:24:57.220 --> 01:25:01.660]   And so in the case of mail, it'll find like one point, in my case, one point whatever,
[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:06.540]   gigabytes of stuff associated with mail.app and back it up in these separate profiles.
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:10.940]   So you can have like a backup of what you just did, have it create a new blank entry
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:12.300]   and so on.
[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:15.740]   And so if you're testing, this is kind of for geeks and software developers.
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:17.260]   This is going to be most useful.
[01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:21.580]   But it's a really sure way, especially if you're on an alpha or a beta of software, to make
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:23.420]   sure that your data stays intact.
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:27.700]   Now, it will not back up the documents that are associated with, you know, a document
[01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:28.820]   creating app.
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:32.580]   But it will make sure that all of your settings and preferences get set aside and taken care
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:33.780]   of.
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:34.780]   And I love it.
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:37.660]   I'm using it on several apps and I like it a lot.
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:40.100]   It's 1495 shareware.
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:42.620]   It's 147th of an Alex.
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:47.420]   And then the new RUSWIC is at rubasoft.com.
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:49.860]   When you said RUBA, they have another program, RUVID.
[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:51.340]   But has that been a pick before?
[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:54.100]   Because that's what I thought you were going to talk about, also from RUBA Soft.
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:55.100]   What is that?
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:56.300]   I don't refresh my memory.
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:58.700]   I can't remember if we, this is what I downloaded.
[01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:01.380]   And I can't remember if we downloaded, if I downloaded it because I heard you guys talk
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:05.340]   about it or just because it was something I was looking for.
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:07.380]   You must have talked about this, Alex.
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:08.860]   I don't think so.
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:14.300]   You should actually, you create profiles about how you want video exported from QuickTime
[01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:16.100]   or iMovie.
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:19.620]   And then you can have the pre-selected profiles.
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:23.140]   So basically, if you're somebody who makes a video podcast, as you do Merlin, for instance,
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:27.700]   you'd create with RUVID a bunch of profiles and then automatically it would export the
[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:30.780]   video into all those formats.
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:32.580]   That's not, oh, that's fantastic.
[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:34.140]   Same people, RUBA Soft.
[01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:35.140]   Huh.
[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:36.140]   Yeah, it's RUBA.
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:38.860]   It's kind of like getting some of the features you'd have with Compressor or something like
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.060]   that, but it would be...
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:41.660]   It probably uses Compressor.
[01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:44.300]   I mean, it probably is still using those technologies.
[01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:46.300]   It's just a way of saving profiles.
[01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:50.620]   Oh, and in Compressor, and the compressor that comes with Final Cut Pro Studio, you can
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:54.180]   save all that stuff, you know, and just set it up as a batch and so on and so forth.
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:56.420]   But when you just use the QuickTime, of course, you can't do that.
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:59.380]   And so this would give you some of those features.
[01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:00.540]   That's probably what it is.
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:02.660]   That's exactly what it is.
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:05.460]   So that's two for one from RUBA Soft.
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:08.340]   Just go to RUBA Soft and get all the RU software.
[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:10.540]   I wonder if I have to go to the front page now and see what else they do.
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:15.300]   RU Switch, RUVID, and that's it.
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:16.580]   Which is good because we're out of time.
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:19.780]   So let me just say one thing before we go.
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:22.340]   The paint chocolate rain.
[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:27.100]   A baby born with Abby for the sin chocolate rain.
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:29.140]   What do you say with Abby's foreskin?
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:34.540]   That's my daughter he's talking about.
[01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:36.380]   What is he saying?
[01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:40.020]   This cool book saying it can be here again.
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:41.020]   Chocolate rain.
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:45.260]   I think this cool book say it can't be here again is probably pretty much the best way
[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:47.620]   to end that song.
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:48.620]   Folks we want to thank you.
[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:50.740]   We have ground to a complete halt.
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:55.060]   But I do want to remind everybody that any stock picks you've heard on this show are
[01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:58.620]   absolutely fallacious.
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:04.940]   If you get your financial advice from a podcast, you better think again, buddy boy.
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:05.940]   Folacious.
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:06.940]   Folacious.
[01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:08.740]   Say that carefully, Scott Born.
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:11.100]   I know we're going to go get some editing down here.
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:16.740]   ApplephoneShow.com is the place to find Mr. Scott Born when he's not playing with his
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:19.660]   Apple phone.
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:23.820]   Also Merlin Mann at 43folders.com and the MerlinShow.com.
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.580]   Always great to have you on.
[01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:27.620]   Alex Lindsay at PixelChord.com.
[01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:32.020]   And of course the great PixelChord podcast at PixelChord.tv.
[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:34.220]   I ran out of room, Alex, on Twit.tv.
[01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:37.060]   I can't fit any more links in there.
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:38.700]   So I took the...
[01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:39.700]   Please don't take it personally.
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:42.260]   I took the PixelChord.tv link off there.
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:44.820]   But I just have to make the thing wider.
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:48.340]   Because when we took comments off the front page on Twit, I want to make sure that people
[01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:51.700]   could get to the free forums at town square.
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:52.700]   Right.
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:53.700]   I pushed.
[01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:55.460]   Do you want to leave comments for Mac Break Weekly?
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:57.780]   Where do they do it now?
[01:28:57.780 --> 01:28:58.780]   Up there, but...
[01:28:58.780 --> 01:28:59.780]   No.
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:00.780]   I'm sorry.
[01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:01.780]   Oh, that was hostile.
[01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:02.780]   Oh, it's hostile.
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:03.780]   It's hostile.
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:05.780]   You know where that came from.
[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:06.780]   Oh, really?
[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:07.780]   Chuck, let it rain.
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:09.460]   So they can go to...
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:10.460]   There are a couple of places.
[01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:15.500]   Of course, if you're a donor and all it costs is a buck to donate and you get to the forums.
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:19.740]   And frankly, just the fact that people have to pay a little bit, even a buck, makes those
[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:20.740]   forums great.
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:21.740]   That's Twit.tv/forms.
[01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:23.620]   But again, you have to donate.
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:27.780]   If you don't want to donate, you want to be in the free open market, go to Leoville
[01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:28.780]   Town Square.
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:31.340]   And there's a link on the front page there, leovilletownsquare.com.
[01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:34.900]   And there is a Twit podcast section just for you.
[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:38.140]   And I read them all and I participate both places.
[01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:39.980]   And we also put an email address and so forth.
[01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:42.540]   So you can always contact us there.
[01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:47.100]   You actually do have comments now on pixlecourt.tv for a while.
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:48.100]   You didn't.
[01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:49.100]   For a while we didn't.
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:50.100]   And then I think we do now.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:51.100]   So I come and go.
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:52.100]   Yes.
[01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:55.060]   Because sometimes people see you kind of go into this thing where you really want them
[01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:57.460]   because you want to see people are saying I love having the feedback.
[01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:59.500]   But sometimes the feedback is not so useful.
[01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:04.380]   Mainly, I'm concerned about, well, we had spam problems, but more importantly, I'm
[01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:10.500]   concerned about negative comments on the page of the podcast convincing people not to listen
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:11.820]   to the podcast.
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:17.260]   My favorite one was the one where the guy said that I was at the Phoeba users group in
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:20.780]   Santa Rosa showing off my Breitling watch.
[01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:23.540]   And that's the problem with that is I've never spoken to.
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:24.980]   They were talking about Guy Kawasaki.
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:28.500]   Oh, no, they were talking about me, but they thought you were Guy Kawasaki.
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.060]   You could go back and read the comments.
[01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:31.660]   You'd see that I think you misunderstood that.
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:33.140]   That person was talking about Guy Kawasaki.
[01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:35.740]   Oh, well, that's because Scott has a Breitling watch.
[01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:37.420]   I know I'm strictly a Rolex man.
[01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:39.100]   So that's how I knew it couldn't be me.
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.100]   Part of the name.
[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:41.740]   Oh, see you.
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:45.060]   So you might want to be taking stock tips from this guy, frankly.
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:50.300]   Anyway, we are going to wrap this up before I get in any more trouble.
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:53.780]   Any other disclaimers, just basically forget anything we've said.
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:58.180]   It's all a great list.
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:30:59.740]   See you next time on Mac Break Weekly.
