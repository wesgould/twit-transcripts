[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.640]   Time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that talks all about Macs.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.800]   And of course today it's going to sound exactly like the Apple phone show because
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.800]   we've got Apple phone show all over it.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.920]   You've got Apple phone show on my Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.080]   You've got Mac Break Weekly on my Apple phone show.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.560]   That's Scott Moore in laughing at my merciless jokes.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.560]   Hello Scott.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.560]   Hi, how's it going?
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.200]   Well, you know, at the Apple phone show we're the kind of
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.200]   Sherry people who like to contribute to the podcasting community whenever we can.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.240]   Sherry people.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.240]   Leanna LaHooa with the gratuitous laugh.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.240]   Hello, Leanna.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.240]   Thank you for joining us again.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.240]   Oh, you're welcome.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.240]   Good morning.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.240]   Thank you for having me.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.240]   From girlsgonegeek.tv.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.480]   Oh, I see Chris Breen is also here.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.480]   Hello, Chris Breen from the desert.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.680]   Hello, Leanna Port from here in the desert.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.680]   Yes, it is.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.680]   In the desert.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.320]   Brother, it's gorgeous here.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.680]   And guess who just popped in?
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.680]   Can you hear me?
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.680]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.880]   Can you hear me?
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.880]   Alex, can you hear me?
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.880]   Lindsay.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.880]   Hey, Alex.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.880]   Hello.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.960]   We got a big round table today to talk about absolutely nothing.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.280]   All I got is a red email that says, look and see the specials at the Apple store on
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.240]   Friday.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.600]   But no, that's a big news.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.600]   That's a big news for the week.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.520]   That is it right there.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.520]   Ready set shop.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.440]   Don't miss our special one day shopping event, but they don't tell you what's going to happen.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.360]   Do I have to go there or can I do this online?
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.360]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.360]   Online.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.960]   I never want to leave my house the day after Thanksgiving.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.960]   Ever.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.600]   So it's only online.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   No, it's both.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.600]   Oh, OK.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.680]   Oh, that's fine with that.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.320]   It says the ready set shop invite says, come back to the Apple online store the day after
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.040]   Thanksgiving for a special one day, only holiday event.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.800]   Now, in the past, they've actually had some pretty good discounts, 100 bucks off Mac books
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.040]   and iMacs.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.680]   You were going to get an iMac for mom, right?
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.160]   I got one for mom.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.000]   Oh, waited a black Friday.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.120]   I know I should have, but it is nice to show up to your parents house for Thanksgiving
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.640]   with a Macintosh in hand.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.880]   It's better than a bad bottle of wine or a turkey.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.880]   That's nice.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.880]   Did you wait?
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.880]   Wait, what?
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.880]   You got the 20?
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.880]   Yeah, I got the 20 inch.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.480]   I got the medium one, the $1,500 ones.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.400]   And honestly, it was a selfish gift because I'm tired of getting calls from her saying,
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   how do you do this?
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.560]   And her old Mac wouldn't run leopard.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.040]   So I'm going to get run leopard on this thing.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.160]   And then I'm just going to be able to go in through iChat and say, step away.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.240]   I'll let you know when you can come back and touch your computer again.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.400]   Has anybody used back to my Mac yet successfully?
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   It's very successful.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.280]   I haven't even stopped leopard yet.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.280]   It's very quiet in here.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.400]   I'm a little bit afraid still.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   No leopard for Leana.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   No leopard for Leana.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.920]   I'm a little bit afraid still.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.800]   I'm going to wait probably for another couple of weeks.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.880]   I do have a friend who had been using it in the Starbucks.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.080]   And it's been interesting because he said he's had more issues with it when he's at Starbucks.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.720]   I don't know what that would have to do with it.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.400]   But the Wi-Fi is not right.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.880]   I'm able to get it work at all.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.880]   How about you, Chris Breen?
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.880]   Yeah, we ran it in the labs at Macworld.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.880]   And our results were not terribly good.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.440]   We were looking forward to it working.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.880]   And honestly, we just couldn't get the thing to work properly.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.400]   We had the briefing with Apple.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.160]   And we said, so this back to the Mac thing, how's that working out for you?
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.680]   Oh, no issues here.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.440]   Supposedly the new update that just came out fixes problems.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.000]   Yeah, we'll see.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.960]   I haven't left my computers on at home, so I can try it.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.000]   But I have taken leopard out on my laptop, which is sort of the big test.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.840]   It's like I'm out here on the road.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.640]   I'm just surviving on leopard alone.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.640]   And it's been interesting.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.560]   We knew there were going to be issues, Leo.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.800]   When the first evidence of the back to my Mac not working was somebody accessed Bill Gates
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.800]   computer by mistake.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.480]   You've got windows.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.080]   I can't see my Mac.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.560]   I've done the internal sharing works great.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.800]   And it's fast and great.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.800]   Once you know, inside a LAN.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.800]   And I've been loving.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.200]   I've been sharing files back and forth.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.600]   And that's really nice.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.640]   But I have yet to see and I have all back to my Mac is turned on all my Macs.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.480]   They're all logged into Mac fine, but I don't see them.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.480]   They're not showing up.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.640]   I think you have to when I asked Apple about it, they said, well, you have to have either
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.480]   an Apple airport extreme, which I do the latest.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.480]   Or you have to do open ports or have unplug and play working or PMP that's something called
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.560]   PMP net that I'd never heard of.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.760]   So it has to open up ports, but I just before you before it's visible.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.640]   But I still yeah, when I had the briefing, they said, yeah, if you use airport extreme,
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.680]   all those ports are open, you don't it's transparent.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.280]   And they said, and modern routers should do the same thing.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.520]   But I'm not sure where that line is where they say, now, this is no longer modern.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.960]   And that's we actually recommend people turn off universal plug and play because it's
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.680]   actually pretty dangerous.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.000]   Yeah, it allows a it allows a program to without warning or any request permission.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.040]   It allows it to modify your router settings to open up.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.520]   And that's great because it makes things like, you know, back to my Mac work fine, but it's
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.840]   not very safe if it's a rogue program that's not even on the airport extreme.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.640]   The airport extreme, I haven't disabled it or enabled it.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.120]   I'm it's a stock airport extreme.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.760]   And I still don't see any of my Macs.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.960]   So I don't know what's going on.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.640]   Yeah, you shouldn't have to touch the airport extreme.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.280]   They say by default, it just works.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.480]   Oh, well, so much for that.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.640]   We'll find out.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.640]   Oh, well, I was off to a rip or and start to think that Andy and not co was most excited
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.520]   about by the way, Andy, not with us is mom.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.600]   He's with his mom in the hospital, who's I'm sure going to be fine, but just wanted
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.560]   to let you know he can't be here today.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.200]   But that was the thing he was most excited about.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.440]   So it's a, you know, it's a little disappointing if it doesn't work.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.840]   Oh, it's high on my list too.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.120]   We're talking about, you know, if you're looking forward to it.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.640]   And that was huge for me.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.640]   Great.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.640]   I can I can access my Mac from the room.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.080]   I mean, we all could do this anyway, you know, if you're geeky enough, but it's nice that
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.280]   normal people now if they've left a document at home and they left their Mac on, they can
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.840]   just go and get it.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.380]   And I think I talked about this before, but I mean, it was I went I was in India with
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:20.120]   Apple remote desktop, the preview, you know, more geeky version of this and able to go
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.440]   to my go to my into my office computer and find another computer on the network and then
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.280]   FTP stuff, you know, back to myself because I forgot some files I had to use for presentation.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.760]   And I just completely was sold on this process.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.480]   And it's exciting if it gets to a point where you can actually just quickly turn it on and
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.480]   off.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.480]   So.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.040]   Well, it doesn't seem to work.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.520]   So so much for that.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:47.080]   However, what more importantly, does windows have a voice good enough to make its own rap
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.080]   song?
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.080]   That's my question.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.040]   This is have you heard this?
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.980]   Alex leopard just can't get enough.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:00.280]   This is this is the Alex voice and leopard named after our own Alex Lindsey.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.080]   Listen carefully.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:16.320]   Are you a depesh mode family, Anna?
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.960]   You're the only one young enough to actually appreciate this.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.720]   When I do baby, I go out of my head.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.520]   I just can't get enough.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.680]   I just can't get enough.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:34.040]   All the things you do to me and everything you said, I just can't get enough.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.440]   I just can't get enough.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.200]   We slip and slide as we fall in love.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.600]   That's pretty good.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.800]   Actually, he's got a good voice that better than the Peche mode version.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.720]   It's a it's more emotional more deeply emotion.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:54.600]   Where deeply felt that is wild.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.040]   That's from Apple Gazette.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.600]   Michael did that, I guess.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.800]   I don't know it that he doesn't.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.360]   It's not credited, but I presume the the post authors, a guy did it.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.360]   Maybe not.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.360]   I don't know.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.360]   Isn't that cool?
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.360]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.360]   It's from it.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.360]   Here it is.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.360]   It's from Dazzaruni.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.360]   Dazzaruni.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.680]   What's the story behind this?
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.960]   It's Alex the voice Alex from leopard.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.960]   Got it.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.600]   There's actually quite a few Alex voices on YouTube.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.240]   You want to hear another one?
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.040]   Don't player hate on me.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:37.080]   Player, somebody else, yo, yo, yo, I'm a gangster where my dogs at.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.080]   Barque with you, my dog, yo, yo.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:46.120]   My kids, my favorite thing to do is come home and make Alex say dirty words.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.360]   Nipple.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.680]   And they'll laugh.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.560]   Yeah, he's only 13.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.400]   That's what a boy that's what a 13 year old boy does.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:00.920]   I am Alex and I have cute puns.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:06.360]   At least they're getting something out of this $3000 computer.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:12.880]   So have you been following the IMEI tracking a brew ha ha ha?
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.760]   Yeah, no, no, no, no.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.840]   Okay, who's following it?
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.520]   Well Apple phone show, of course we followed it.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.000]   Chris and I just recorded a segment about it.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.720]   It's a non story.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.080]   It's like all these things.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.760]   You know, somebody writes something about the iPhone 200 million blogs immediately repeat
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.760]   it without checking it.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.360]   It's not true.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360]   It's not true.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.960]   Okay, first of all, Chris can explain this.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.760]   First of all, credit to Dan.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.280]   This is last name, Farada, Fanata from Uneasy Silence.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.560]   Great site by the way.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:51.600]   He looked, he used a little hex editor and found that the URL that's sent when you check
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:58.640]   weather and stock prices in your iPhone includes your IMEI number, your unique identifier
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.200]   to your phone.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.840]   The unofficial Apple web blog has done the same.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.760]   They've confirmed that that is in there.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.080]   So what's the story?
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.080]   Morning, glory.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.200]   Chris, you want to take the Oh, Chris, just I mean, we lost Chris.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   We're getting him back now.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.200]   Are you there, Chris?
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   I'm back now.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.200]   Yeah, you see.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.520]   So I met to my parents house as soon as we mentioned this Apple iPhone hacking.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.880]   You dropped right off.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.240]   No, no, what they see is in these retirement communities, they, the internet service works
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.240]   in such a way that if you haven't done anything for like 10, 15 minutes, just drop.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.400]   I figure you can fall asleep.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.400]   Right.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.400]   Sure.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.400]   So Giz.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.200]   Giz Moto says that no actual IMEI data is being sent.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.640]   The unofficial Apple web blog confirms that that IMEI is in the URL.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.320]   What's the story, Chris?
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.000]   Well, the story seems to be that no, that isn't in there.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.840]   A couple of security firms looked at that and said, no, it's identification information
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.160]   for the applications themselves.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.520]   But if an official Apple web blog in like the last few minutes has said that that's not
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.880]   the case, then I think we have a discrepancy in reporting here.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.880]   Well, no, no.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.400]   They actually in an update say that Hiza online has tested.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:16.680]   It actually came from Sean Lee, who's a hack, hackintosh person.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:25.240]   And according to Hiza, the code says IMEI, but apparently the actual IMEI is not being
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.240]   transmitted.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.200]   They used a sniffer, which is a little more sophisticated than looking at the hex.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.160]   Right.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:37.400]   So they get the strings that are actually sent when you check your stock.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.880]   So apparently it's not the case.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.720]   Oh, shoot.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   I liked that story.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.120]   I thought that was full of, full of Vim.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.680]   Well, it has Vim and Zest.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.160]   But Scott and I were talking about this earlier.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.520]   There's so much great stuff that people could sniff on your phone if they wanted to.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.760]   And why would they want to look in the weather widget because what?
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.760]   I know.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.760]   Whether it's where you are.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.720]   And your stocks, you know, I'm tracking six stocks.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.720]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.080]   If you're going to track something good.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.080]   That's a good thing.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.080]   Can you imagine the staff?
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.080]   It would require an Apple.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.080]   Oh, there's a little report on there.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.080]   Oh, look at the little of the data.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.080]   Oh, they just need a database.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.960]   They're computers are for who needs a staff.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.120]   Well, you, well, okay.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.600]   So you have this database with a million and a half iPhone users stock tracking.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.640]   Somebody's got to look at it if it's going to be, you know, there's like some guy named
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.240]   Ernie, at least in the back room checks it once in a while.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.960]   You got to have a staff.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.800]   Yeah, he got Ernie.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.880]   Ernie's Ernie.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:41.120]   So there is now another jailbreak, 1.12 jailbreak that includes activation.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.720]   Leanna, have you tried this yet?
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.320]   I haven't tried this activation yet.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.160]   I'm still trying to get my old phone back to 1.0.2.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.800]   I'm trying to reverse it.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.800]   Yeah, I still try to reverse back.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.600]   This is from the iPhone Touch Dev team.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.600]   They're working hard.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.440]   I tell you, conceited softwares provided.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.440]   Yeah, download.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.440]   Pardon me?
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.440]   It does.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.440]   There's nothing to talk about.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.840]   I might as well just fold up our tent and go home.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.720]   Firefox 3.0 beta now downloadable.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.720]   Anybody care?
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   No.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.680]   Oh, I don't even like Firefox 2.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.120]   I want 1.5 back again.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.120]   You know, the whole new world is crappy.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.880]   Vista sucks, Leopard sucks, Firefox 2 sucks.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.320]   Is there anything good that's new?
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.960]   Look at the Kindle.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.200]   What a piece of junk that is.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200]   Anybody excited about the Kindle?
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.200]   I'm glad you said that.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.840]   I was feeling like I was going to Twitter yesterday.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.040]   Am I the only one not ordering the Amazon Kindle?
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.040]   I don't know.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.660]   I think your worst part is that I heard the word Kindle and I heard the
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:46.200]   description of it and I immediately went credit card in hand to thinking, "I should
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.480]   just get this and we'll figure out whether it really works or whatever."
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.320]   I saw it and I was like, "Mm, it's ugly."
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.840]   This is Amazon's e-book reader.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.880]   Three years in the making got the front cover of Newsweek and seven pages inside.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.480]   Big article by Stephen Levy.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.800]   It's the second coming.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.480]   I don't think they gave as much covers as the iPhone, frankly.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.040]   I don't know what they must be in bed with Amazon.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.380]   Well, lots of people are.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:18.500]   Mr. Schobel, our friend, wrote a post on his own blog, I guess, saying, "Hey, cool.
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.180]   They're paying me to put my blog in this kiddle thing.
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.180]   It's thanks Amazon for all the extra rest."
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.700]   So he is going to get paid because that was the other thing.
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:31.300]   You can read blogs on it, but premium blogs are $2 a month to Amazon and he gets 30% so
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.460]   it's in his interest to talk about it.
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.900]   Oh, that's interesting, isn't it?
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.460]   That's why so many bloggers are blogging about it.
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.460]   Oh, interesting.
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.460]   Yeah, but it's all DRMed.
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.280]   Yeah, newspapers are all getting something too.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.920]   Yeah, everybody gets an issue, but I mean, it's like $2,000 to fill the thing up.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.080]   This is a product designed around a business model, not designed around what consumers
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.080]   want.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.080]   That's pretty clear.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.040]   And the same screen as the Sony re-reader, which has not been a big success, I actually
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:02.240]   have a Sony e-reader and I like it and I use it, but it's not any better screen.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.240]   It's expected.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.960]   You know how many of those readers have been sold with, really?
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.880]   I've heard estimates from Alice's few is two or 3,000.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.120]   Yeah, I believe it.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.120]   Nobody wants this.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.120]   It's a product.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.120]   It's a product.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.280]   Yeah, I'm the one of the few people who wants it.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.280]   And I don't even want the Kindle.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.080]   I actually, it's like I have the Sony e-book reader.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.080]   Why does it have a keyboard on it?
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.400]   Well, that was the big thing I looked at.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.800]   I was like, well, I don't want any kind of, maybe it's just because of the iPhone now,
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.360]   whatever, I don't want any interface.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.680]   I mean, I don't want any buttons.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.320]   I mean, I just want to be able to click on stuff and get to where I need to go.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:38.360]   I don't want to, at worst, I want a screen keyboard, but at most I just want it to be
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.360]   smaller and get that.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.200]   That's a huge area wasted space as far as I'm concerned.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.040]   Who wants to carry around a keyboard when Steve Gibson made this point, when you're going
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.120]   to use it once in a while, sure, but not all the time.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.680]   The Sony e-book reader is nice and small.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.720]   I have almost 100 books on there.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.040]   It's not easy to read.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.640]   It's not as easy as a book.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:59.640]   It's much more expensive.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.120]   I've already lost one in an airplane, but I like the convenience of having all the
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.720]   books on there, but I don't think I can see.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.720]   I wouldn't be surprised if it's only a few thousand.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.840]   I don't know why Amazon is getting so much attention for this Kindle.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.040]   It's right behind the segue.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.760]   It's segue going to be the new revolutionary transportation device.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.120]   What they didn't realize is you look like a dork on a segue.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:24.160]   But now if you can read your Kindle, double dork.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.160]   That's the ticket.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.160]   Okay.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.160]   That's a chick magnet right there.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.760]   You see a cute guy coming down the street.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.040]   He's got a helmet on.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.040]   He's standing on a segue.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.680]   He's like eight feet tall and he's got a Kindle.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.680]   Mad love.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.680]   Leonton, do you crazy?
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.400]   Yeah, I think we just turn around and go the other direction.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.200]   I don't think that one will grab me so much.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.200]   That's you.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.680]   Because he's probably got a zoom on his hip as well.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.680]   Can I say that?
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.680]   Run away!
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   Run away!
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.680]   Run away!
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.680]   Oh dear.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:59.560]   You see the big posting guy brought his power book in and had a dead pixel.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.680]   The four book to the Mac store, they said, "That's going to take us a couple of days
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.760]   to fix this here.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:09.640]   We're going to give you a MacBook Pro loner."
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.600]   And they never saw him again.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.920]   Would you go back?
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:22.480]   The guy has a 17 inch power book, 1.67 gigahertz power PC, a gig of memory, 100 gig hard drive.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:29.040]   They gave him a 2.4 gigahertz, core two, two gigs of RAM, 160 gig hard drive.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:34.480]   I think that's good business if you can get the guy back because I guess they got his
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.480]   credit card number.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.600]   Because he's going to try that MacBook Pro and he's not going to want the power book.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:45.160]   That's like a package in her tune up and getting a Corvette loner.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.880]   No kidding.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.880]   Thank you Apple Store.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.880]   I might break my power book.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.560]   And what's up with these guys and their pixel peeping?
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.840]   I get these guys email me all the time.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.480]   My iPhone has a dead pixel.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:02.280]   If you run this program on Thursday while standing on your left foot, 403 times, you'll one of
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.440]   those times see this one dead pixel.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.440]   Well, that's annoying though.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.240]   Once you see a dead pixel, can be annoying.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.560]   It depends where it is, of course.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:16.480]   But if you have to run software to find it, I'm sorry that doesn't qualify.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.360]   Did you see this story from Plainbuzz?
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.120]   Did you talk about this in the Apple phone show?
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.760]   Which no, I don't think so.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.760]   What is the story?
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.760]   Okay.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.760]   Then I'll know.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:33.360]   The guy, a guy is, they're on an airplane here.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.360]   I'll read it to you.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:39.840]   This is from Plainbuzz, which is a flight blog.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.800]   One of our subscribers sent me this story today.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.760]   We all knew it was inevitable when the latest iPhone commercial rolled out now, didn't we?
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.760]   Oh, joy.
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.000]   I can't wait for the next ground layer, long taxi due to weather somewhere to get some
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.040]   smart ass with a freaking iPhone showing it, showing it in my face saying it's not raining
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.040]   there.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.040]   See?
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.040]   Too late.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.040]   It already happened to me.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.040]   We push back.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.040]   I guess this is a pilot writing.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.040]   We push back, get advised of a ground stop at MEM due to storms in the area.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.880]   Gotta wait.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.880]   My captain, oh, he's must've been a copilot.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.640]   Captain does the lecture over the PA.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.760]   Not one minute later, a flight attendant pushes the button.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.760]   Boom.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.920]   Captain, some guy with an iPhone says the weather's good.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.560]   Wants to know what the real reason is for the delay.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.240]   Is something wrong with the plane?
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.400]   I want to tell this clown what he could do with his iPhone.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.560]   The captain doesn't even better.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.040]   He gets on the PA and makes the following announcement.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:34.280]   Oh, if the passenger with the iPhone and be kind enough to use it to check the weather
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:39.400]   at our alternate, calculate our fuel burn doing it, being rerouted around the storms,
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.480]   call the dispatcher to arrange our release and then make a phone call in the nearest air
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.200]   traffic control center to arrange our timely departure amongst the other aircraft carrying
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.320]   passengers with iPhones, they will be more happy than happy to depart.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.320]   Please ring your call button to advise a flight attendant, your fellow passengers when you
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.320]   deem it ready and responsible for this multi-million dollar aircraft and its passengers
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.320]   to safely leave.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.320]   Awesome.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.800]   But my weather widget says it's okay.
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.520]   You didn't tell that one on the Apple phone show.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.000]   I was, I had no one ever pointed that story.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.640]   That's a good story.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.360]   You scoop the Apple phone show with the iPhone info.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.000]   I've been trying for the last six months.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   I finally did.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   So I've got a prediction.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.040]   I think a new iPhone at Macworld with what?
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.040]   Nothing.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.040]   Just another.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.040]   It'll be bigger.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.040]   It'll be square.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.040]   I don't know.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.040]   In pink.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.040]   No, they'll do something.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:38.040]   They'll do a cheaper iPhone, maybe less functionality.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:42.720]   Maybe they got the, I think I think announcement of one, but not not one shipping.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.080]   Maybe you're right because it's tough to do that at FCC approval thing.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.960]   So they can't ship one on in January, but they mean what other consumer announcement
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.840]   are they going to make?
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.000]   The tablet or the tablet?
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.520]   They'll never do a tablet.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.520]   Well, the mini, the mini power book then.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.920]   I think it's an ebook reader.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.920]   You got a wonder.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.920]   Well, I have one.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.720]   Here's what they said in that one's.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.720]   A camera.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.120]   That's what you want them to do.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.120]   That's what I want them to do.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.200]   Make us a real camera.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.280]   Because, you know, they made a digital camera before.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.480]   A lot of people don't know that.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.480]   But for how much?
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.480]   What's the price point?
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.480]   200 bucks.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.480]   Ooh.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.160]   That doesn't seem like Apple's market.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:26.360]   Well, I mean, because once you get into the, I mean, the $200 camera, maybe, but I mean,
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:31.240]   the issue is, is that, you know, for me, right now, they're the best consumer camera, you
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.440]   know, right now is probably the G9, you know, the Canon G9.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.440]   That's a good thing.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.440]   That's $4.99.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.440]   Okay.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.440]   So they make a $300 or $400 one.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.440]   I'm just saying two.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.920]   Well, I, if I say three or 400, I get email from people saying I have too much money.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:50.880]   It's not really believes that the, that Apple's just deciding just to pick the pick and cherry
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.040]   pick the good categories and kind of own them.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.040]   Why not?
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.640]   I mean, they've pretty, we've seen the move.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.960]   Look, when they dropped a computer from their name, we got a little worried.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.600]   We see they're still doing well on computers, but let's face it.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.320]   They're not a computer company anymore.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.320]   What about a TV?
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:13.440]   They were, remember the rumors a couple of years ago they were going to do an Apple TV.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.440]   We got that.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.440]   It didn't work so well.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.440]   I don't know actual television.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.040]   Like take a Sim or display and make a TV out of it.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.160]   I wouldn't not be, I mean, that'd be an interesting product.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:26.720]   I don't think there are a lot of Apple fanboys that would buy a plasma or an LCD TV just
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.440]   because it had that little Apple logo at the bottom.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.240]   I probably would want to.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.240]   I don't buy one.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:37.720]   I do have to admit I just set up my, I literally last night I just finished my, my little living
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.320]   room project, which was, you know, my wife that we probably talked about is about to have
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.320]   a baby.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.360]   And so I've been like, trying to make sure she has things to do, you know, without having
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.360]   to go a lot of places.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.800]   And so we've been getting lots of movies on, on to the Mac, we bought a Mac mini and we
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.960]   put a bunch of movies on to it and we digitized every CD that we own.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:58.960]   And, and I hooked it to, I got one of those cheap, cheap HD monitor, you know, it's like
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.880]   36, 37 inches or whatever, but it's, you know, busy or whatever.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.160]   It's the inexpensive, but fairly reasonable HD monitor and hook that directly.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.440]   I didn't realize until yesterday that it has a PC input.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.840]   So hooked the Mac mini into it.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.960]   And I have to say we have a Bluetooth keyboard, which I didn't really like it first.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.880]   You know, that the, but now you can lie in bed with your keyboard.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.880]   I'm sitting on the couch.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.360]   No, I'm just sitting on the couch and I take, I have a Bluetooth mighty mouse that I'm sitting
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.560]   there on the, and I just said, I just set it on the couch and the couch is kind of like
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.560]   the suede.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.600]   And I can set it on the couch and I can just browse around.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.240]   And it is, it is on, I was like, I can't even believe I didn't do this like two years
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.320]   ago because you're sitting there with your, your TV and then a mood, as soon as you get
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.000]   tired, I want to watch something.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.320]   I just click on, you know, I just, I hit my little controller for the, you know, the little
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.960]   front row controller and boom, I'm in the movies or into, into stuff or whatever, or
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.560]   I hit this, I hit menu menu and I'm back out again.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.560]   Congratulations Alex.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.120]   You've just invented web TV.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.840]   Well, the thing is, is that it's not, I just, you know, I'm surprised I don't see that
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.560]   much people than many people talking about it.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.560]   And it was just one of those.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.360]   You know, who does that is a Darren kitchen from a hack five.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.440]   He's got the whole kind of wired up thing.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.200]   I think some real geeks have done that, but it's a lot of work.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.120]   Yeah, I did it about a year ago.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.120]   That's the thing that surprised me.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.360]   I thought it was going to be really hard, but all it was was hooking the Mac mini up to,
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.360]   to an LCD wonder.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.720]   Chris, I mean, you said you did this a year ago.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.720]   What?
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.920]   Yeah, we did a year ago for Mac world.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.800]   We wanted to, you know, see that it's an alternative because we're talking about Apple
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:28.680]   TV and a lot of people were saying, well, yeah, but I've got this mini and how do I,
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.720]   how do I turn that into a media center?
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.400]   And at that time, you put it enough for the right parts together, an IR blaster being one
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.280]   of the most difficult to, to configure.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.040]   And it really does turn out to be a pretty serviceable thing.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.520]   And now with leopard, the new front row interface is great.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.080]   It looks just like Apple TV.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.080]   So it becomes a very real possibility now, particularly since they've made the hour blasters
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.080]   easier to use.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.080]   What's the IR blaster?
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:59.360]   Well, if you want to use itv, as I said, you want your DVR capability, you can't change
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:04.000]   channels if you're using satellite or, oh, I got it, encrypted cables.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.880]   So with an IR blaster, plug some of the USB port and it will fire signals based on schedules
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.880]   you've created.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.280]   So then it really does start working like a Tivo.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.280]   Right.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.880]   Yeah, we don't have a, we're, you know, we're now thinking about getting cable now without
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.880]   that.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.880]   We don't even have that yet.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.680]   So we just mostly just watch movies.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.440]   And so, but so it hasn't really affected us that much.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.960]   But now that's the one piece.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:32.520]   But for us, there was nothing else to do other than, you know, once you just plugged a mini
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.240]   straight in, I've been putting stuff on it for the last, you know, week.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.240]   And I was just amazed.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.000]   I was expecting it to be harder or something to be to do this.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.480]   And yeah, it was nothing.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.000]   What resolution are you running at?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.200]   Well, I run the, I run the, I run it.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.960]   If you run it at the high, it's designed for 1280 by 720.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.520]   This is like one of the cheaper eight, you know, HD monitors.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.280]   It can go a little higher, but it looks a little beat up.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:59.000]   And so I run it normally at 1280 by 720, but when I'm surfing, I'm across the room.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.920]   So if I want to check CNN or if I want to, you know, surf around, I drop it to 800 by
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:05.920]   600.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.920]   And then I just surf around it.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.640]   I can kind of comfortably without straining my eyes, read everything across the room.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.880]   You have invented web TV.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.760]   That's what you mean.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.760]   That's web TV.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.520]   And it's amazing that I sit there and I just go and I check my email and I do my thing.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.520]   And I'm good.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.520]   It's just a Mac.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.520]   It's, you know, it's just sitting there.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.520]   I mean, I have my Mac and then I just switch back to it and boom, I'm watching TV again.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:29.520]   And it's, I mean, it was, and I, it was just amazing.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.480]   I'm afraid that Apple TV is going to get killed any minute.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.520]   Well, I don't, I have an Apple TV.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.560]   We have one at the office and I was going to take it up and test it.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.560]   You don't need it now.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.800]   They're going to have to use some kind of interface between the Apple TV and the Mac
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.800]   Mini.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.800]   I would never want to do that.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.160]   I'm much happier with just having the Mac Mini directly hooked up to my monitor.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.360]   I guess I could use the Mini instead of an Apple TV.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:53.160]   You literally, it's a, this, this monitor has a art, you know, BGA and so I just do DBI
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.240]   convertor to BGA in and boom, it's there.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.200]   You know, and there's, and there's nothing to it.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:03.880]   And, you know, and so it's just, it's a great, great interface.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.880]   Interesting.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:11.280]   And of course, he's got a, just got a chat from our friend at across the pond.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.480]   And he mentioned he's listening to the live stream.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:18.560]   We only, he pointed out that the 640 by 40 resolution of the iPhone is the exact same
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.240]   resolution of the famed Apple Quick Take.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.360]   Ah, so you already have a Quick Take camera.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.360]   I'm very sorry.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.360]   It's an iPhone.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.360]   Who is our friend across the pond?
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.360]   Will Harris?
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.360]   Um, isn't that Sasha?
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.360]   Oh, Sasha.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.360]   Oh, okay.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.200]   I have many friends across the pond.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.200]   That's his, no, that's his Skype handle.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.800]   He's going to have to, he's going to have to limit it down to some people.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   Hey, here's a story that you will really like, Mr. Alex Lindsay, the very first feature length
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.600]   film direct to iTunes release is tonight.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.600]   Right.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.600]   Ed Burns movie.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   I purchased that this morning.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.600]   Really?
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.600]   Yes.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.320]   I like, I actually like it because I like his distribution model.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.080]   I'm like, I'll go for it.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.520]   I don't, I don't, this is something, is this, isn't it?
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.520]   Is this purple violence?
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.520]   This is something different.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.520]   It is.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.520]   No, it's purple violence.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.520]   Oh, it is purple.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.520]   So Ed Burns made this.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.520]   Correct.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.520]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:14.400]   Deborah Messings in it, who is an actual TV star.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.040]   So this is like a major motion picture.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.440]   11, it was 1299.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.440]   1299.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.040]   And how do you like it?
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.040]   Does it look good?
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.320]   I haven't had a chance to watch it yet.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.720]   So well, let's watch it right now.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:24.920]   We can just all watch it together.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.960]   It's here we go.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.080]   Wild Ocean films.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.160]   They want to take this trailer.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.160]   Big Apple.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.160]   I like him.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.080]   Big Apple.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.600]   This is Patty.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.800]   Deborah Messings with straight hair.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.040]   It's time to go back to writing a poem and put it in.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.000]   This looks like a real movie with like a real trailer and everything.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Wow.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.360]   Basie, isn't it?
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.360]   So what do you think, Alex?
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.760]   I mean, is this a breakthrough?
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:54.920]   Well, I mean, we're going to definitely look at this as the first of, I think, something
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.720]   that we're probably going to see a lot more of.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:04.960]   I mean, it's a, it is the artists are starting to figure out or at least producers, some
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.520]   producers are figuring out they don't need to go through the typical distribution.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.280]   It depends on what kind of, it depends on how much draw you can get on the internet.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.680]   I think some things will work quickly in the early days, much faster than other things.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.600]   So if you have a big name that people are willing to go see, let's say you have a $2
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.600]   million budget.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:27.360]   That means if you can get at $12.99, I mean, you get 50,000 people to go and take a look
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.360]   at it.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.880]   Well, not 50,000, but let's say 100,000 or 200,000 people to come up and take a look
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.880]   at it.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.120]   You know, you're starting to get pretty close to breaking even with just a direct, direct
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.120]   download.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.640]   You just got to make sure you have the kind of, the kind of audience online that's going
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.720]   to actually go get that.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.640]   Now, if it continues to pick up, I mean, this is what, this is the, this is the, the
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:50.280]   in my opinion, the studio is worst nightmare, which is that, that, you know, we don't, they
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.640]   don't, they're not needed, you know, for this in this process.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.480]   Well, it does look like a studio flick.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.480]   I mean, this is not right.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.960]   You know, it may look like a studio flick and I'm not sure.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.560]   I don't know what the history of it is right now.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.400]   Do you know, Leanna, is it, is it an independent production or?
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.000]   Yeah, he, he pretty independently.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.520]   If I'm remember correctly, because I remember seeing him actually at an Apple store and
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:13.480]   he was talking about using final cut to cut everything as well.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.480]   Wow.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:22.240]   He did the brothers McMullen and he did a few, he's done a few things and he's been an actor.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.920]   He's, but he's also a director and a writer.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.720]   He wrote and directed this as well as a.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.800]   He wasn't saving pride Ryan.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.800]   That was probably the biggest.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:28.800]   Private Ryan.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.800]   That's right.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   But he did, he was an actor in that.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   Wow.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.800]   That's very interesting.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:40.240]   By the way, I apologize to, to Shosh, S-H-A-S-H, not Sasha.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.840]   Oh, Shosh is our, is the show notes writer.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:45.840]   Well, that, that was who it was.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.840]   I, I keep calling Sasha when I don't watch it.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.840]   Well, I have a bunch of teenagers working for me and they all have similar names.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.240]   It's Shubi, Shosh and Sasha.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.440]   It's very confusing after what.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.000]   There was a, there are particular reason they all begin with it.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Nice.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Is this a coincidence?
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   I don't understand.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.040]   Is this information being sent from your iPhone?
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.760]   It's very hot, isn't it?
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.760]   What's my IMEI?
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.760]   Do you know that?
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.760]   Riddle me that.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:09.760]   Sasha.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.400]   So, so how many people have installed the opaque leopard menu bar?
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.400]   Two of hands.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.600]   Y'all happy about that?
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.960]   Oh, that's getting me one step closer to installing leopard itself, but I haven't actually, we,
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.520]   we put it on one machine here at the office so far.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.680]   I don't hear any, let me look into my control room and wave at engineer Greg.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:33.200]   Greg, do we have any problems with our one leopard installation?
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.260]   He's coming in to tell me.
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:39.200]   The guy, the guy who wrote Butler did a program called menu bar tent.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.200]   No problems?
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.200]   No problems so far.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.960]   Chris Green, were you one of the people complaining about the transparent menu bar?
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.400]   Oh, I, I, carved about it a little bit, but not, I'm pretty careful.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.400]   Andy, Andy.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.400]   Andy hated it.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.400]   I remember Andy.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.000]   Yeah, I mean, it's a, it's a silly idea that you can't turn that thing on.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Hey, I like this.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.120]   But I just was careful about the back, background I chose and I have no problem with it.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:05.000]   I have a variety of, uh, kind of natural, you know, scenes backgrounds and then some
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.200]   of them work better than us, but I can still, I can always read the menu bar.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.080]   Now you can, we still have a figure out how to turn off the transparency in the menus
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.080]   itself.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.080]   Menus themselves.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.440]   No, that still remains to be done.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:18.600]   But the fact that somebody finally dug this out is, is heartening indicating that somebody
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:23.960]   can probably get to the menus to it's there somewhere, some setting somewhere.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:33.280]   Apparently, though you have to keep the program running, which means it's kind of constantly
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.280]   changing it back.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.280]   I always bugs me when I see that.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.280]   I don't know if I'll.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:42.560]   Yeah, I'm always afraid of, I'm, we, you know, I got into a zone for a while of, of starting
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.600]   to really, uh, edit some of the stuff.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:48.000]   So we had an Apple script that would, that would remove the dock, you know, cause I really
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   hate it.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Yes, yes.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   And I, but it started creating all kinds of stuff.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Great.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.120]   And they'd, and I, maybe kind of scared.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.520]   So then I stopped doing all of it.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.640]   You know, I just kind of, I'll just leave the, I'll leave it the way half wants it.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.280]   The only thing that I do want to do is play, play, I haven't started playing with the
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.840]   dock yet because we have, I have leopard running on the, on the machine at home.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.120]   And that, which I love.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.800]   And, uh, but the, uh, I haven't started playing with the color or the different designs.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.600]   I really love all the designs that are coming out from the dock.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.880]   I thought the dock was kind of silly at first and I, and, uh, but I really enjoy looking
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.880]   at all these designs.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:26.000]   People have gotten incredibly creative with all the different ways that you can, you know,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.080]   lay out the dock now, um, that I, you know, I'll play with it for a couple of weeks and
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.720]   then I'll probably get bored.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.280]   But, uh, maybe see this video Phil Schiller.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.180]   Oh, that's great.
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.180]   Should I play that?
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:41.840]   So he's being interviewed by, uh, channel four of about the iPhone.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.800]   Is that the one you're, you're thinking of Chris?
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.120]   The one where he's sort of looking off and silently saying hell.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.920]   The PR people come to his rescue.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.920]   He's being interviewed here.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.120]   Let me turn it up so you can, you can hear what he's saying.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:57.120]   He's, then you have to really use iTunes to get the best out of an iPhone.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.120]   What?
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.840]   Can we, can we finish this question?
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.440]   Oh, here comes the PR lady.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.440]   He answered it.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.440]   You can hear the clicking of heels.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.780]   Oh, she stands in front of the camera.
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.300]   This is whether you're, this is whether you're passing it.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.340]   She's actually getting in front of the camera.
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:17.180]   This is, this is what I, uh, yeah, but the, I, my, no, I, no, I, no, no, no.
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.860]   You're, you're focusing on a different agenda with.
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:19.860]   Oh my goodness.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.580]   Have you ever had that happen to you, Chris?
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:25.140]   Where you're interviewing somebody from Apple and the PR people say, no, you may not ask
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.140]   that question.
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.940]   Uh, no, but I have heard that spin before.
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.780]   I'd be highly offended by that.
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.600]   I've heard a lot of people say, I don't know if it's on this and we're so excited about
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.600]   this.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:39.400]   And, uh, but in this case they were dealing with a British press, you know, who were accustomed
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:43.360]   to actually answering, having questions answered and poor Phil.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:47.040]   And you can't, you know, I, I urge people to take a look at this because there's Phil
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.540]   looking, you know, very comfortable.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:55.000]   And then this guy is asking this question about perhaps there's a monopolistic, uh, relationship
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.240]   here and poor Phil just kind of looks like, you know, somebody stepped on his foot and
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:04.540]   said, hoping that the PR people step in and indeed they did and they started their little
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:05.820]   spiel to stop.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.820]   I do.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.400]   Now I hope they, I hope they aired this.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.400]   At least it's on YouTube.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:14.220]   I do have to say knowing, knowing Apple, that'll be the last time that it'll be, it'll be
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.420]   a year or two before whoever was doing that interview.
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.420]   It's a channel for them.
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:22.260]   I mean, that's a pretty big, uh, as they won't get any shasha, shash, shubie would tell you.
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:26.040]   Apple Apple just, I think Apple tends to shut people down pretty quickly if they go
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   off the reservation.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.640]   Well, then we all have a should go off the reservation.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.640]   I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:34.800]   The PR guy gets right up to the camera, so hoping that they'll stop shooting, but they
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.800]   didn't.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.840]   And that, that, that those Apple folks would be prime candidates to be the White House
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.840]   press corps.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.840]   I mean, the White House press, uh, spoke to people.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.840]   Yeah, that couldn't.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:46.840]   Wow.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.360]   I guess there are just some things one can't ask Mr. Shiller.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.480]   That's why, you know, I've never done the answer with questions of jobs.
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:56.520]   When they ask those questions of job Leo, he just shuts him right down himself.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.520]   He's adept enough.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.520]   Apple couldn't figure it out.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:04.400]   Jobs is adept enough just to, just to answer a different question as a politician would.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.080]   Well, I think I've heard that Steve will say the same thing.
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.840]   You know, so, you know, we're not here to talk about that.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.440]   We're here to talk about this.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.640]   This is why we have this particular event.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.640]   Right.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.640]   Exactly.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.640]   And just keep going.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.200]   Although Phil just looked very handle it.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:24.200]   The reason I, I, I've turned down a couple of interviews with Bill Gates because you, at
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.600]   least in the past, you had to submit questions and I just don't do that.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.240]   And of course they won't let you do the interview if you have a tough question.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.200]   So all you get is softball question.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.200]   And that's too bad.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.440]   But I guess, you know, I guess, you know, it's up to Apple.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:41.640]   They don't have to let their honchos talk to the press.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.360]   They want all the good press though.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.520]   Just none of the bad breath.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.800]   Well, they get good press too.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.280]   I mean, I think that if they need press, they'd be much more open to it, but they, you
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.560]   know, they get as much press as they, you know, I think most of the time as they need,
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.560]   you know, so they're, they're kind of the, you know, in the rules of supply and demand
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:02.120]   and I look at it if I'm talking to someone, you know, in a, in the public arena with Apple,
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.640]   you know, I'll ask pretty, pretty basic questions.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.240]   If I want to make commentary later, I will, but I know that that's not going to be the
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.240]   best point.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.240]   I'm going to do it.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.240]   That's why you don't hear PR people or executives on this, on any of my shows because
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.840]   they never tell you anything important.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.480]   It's always, you know, hype and flack.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.040]   That was their job.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.040]   It's their job.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.800]   And, and they, they have a fiduciary responsibility as public company.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.960]   They're not going to say anything that's, they, or they're not going to keep their job
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.360]   long if they do, if that's, that's bad deleterious to the company's reputation.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.000]   So it is something to some degree.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.440]   I mean, I know with, you know, we develop products and I'll get up there and I'll, you
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.160]   know, I have to admit, when I'm doing doing stuff, I'll tell people, I don't like this
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.160]   part of the product yet.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.160]   Right.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.720]   You know, we're kind of working on it and I'm still unhappy with, you know, whatever.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.720]   You're not typical.
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.760]   But, and you're also not a company.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.760]   No, yeah, not currently.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.560]   So, so the, so the, so the, so the, so the, so you have stockholders, then you won't
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.720]   be saying that stuff.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:58.400]   Well, I mean, and I think that it's a, yeah, I guess the thing that would, I think that
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:03.720]   that definitely generates a certain relationship with your customers that, you know, it's, it's
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.520]   not that you're saying it's not a great product or you're saying that these are still things
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.520]   you're working out.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.520]   Right.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.600]   So I think on it, I think you're exactly right.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:15.960]   I mean, I think more and more customers are going to demand honesty from companies and
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.760]   journalists should do the same, but then traditionally these guys have, I mean, remember computer
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:27.040]   chronicles, I, when we started to pay, yeah, when we started doing TV, I respect him and
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.440]   he certainly was a pioneer in this, but he would always have the executives on.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:34.200]   And when I started doing computer TV, I said, this is what we do not want to do.
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:38.600]   We don't want to have some guy come on with this essentially commercial for their product.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.840]   And so we've always had journalists come on and talk about products, not the company
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.240]   that makes the product.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:49.920]   I will say in Stuart's defense, I actually was on computer chronicles when I launched
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.920]   net radio.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.360]   And I bet you said only good things about net radio.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:57.920]   Well, I did, but the point is is that Stuart, you know, he was very skeptical.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.080]   I mean, the interview was extraordinarily skeptical.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.800]   And same, he had me back on when I launched first TV.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.920]   Same thing, extraordinarily skeptical.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.880]   I basically had to prove my case on the show.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.880]   That's good.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.800]   So, you know, he did have, he did have, you know, in my case, I didn't use a PR person.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   I was the CEO.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.800]   I went right to the mic.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.560]   But nevertheless, he wouldn't let me get away with anything.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.560]   So that's good.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:27.000]   I still, I mean, maybe I'm just not good enough to challenge these guys to this successfully.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   They're so good enough.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   You're just too nice.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   They're there.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.640]   People are pretty well groomed nowadays.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:36.160]   That's why it's kind of strange to see Schiller lose it like that.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.880]   They're usually so well groomed that they handle.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.840]   I mean, you know, they just could deflect any question.
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:43.320]   Well, the only reason that I think that that may have been a surprise form was if they
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:46.040]   told them they were going to ask one thing and then they came in and asked a bunch of
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.040]   stuff.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.040]   Right.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.600]   And I guess if you agreed to ask a series of questions, well, I don't know.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.200]   That's an interesting ethical conundrum.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.400]   Is that usually at the interview?
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:01.400]   I'm very, I'd be very surprised if if Schiller was going to give a video interview without
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.200]   knowing what the, what the, what the, the interview is going to be.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.600]   So that they, what they probably did, what you're probably looking at as a curve, you
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:13.440]   know, they, they, I mean, whether you think that they should or not, I'm, I'm fairly certain
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:18.760]   they probably threw them a, you know, gave them questions that were not agreed to.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.040]   You know, they wanted to get them in front of a camera and then do it.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.040]   You know, it's good for them.
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:26.120]   I mean, but it's apples plain rough and so are they, you know, so what we're just seeing
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:30.560]   is both both sides, you know, playing the game to the full extent.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.080]   That's a good point.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:37.240]   Any other stories anybody wants to talk about before we, there's a great, I'll put a, somebody
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:40.440]   put this in our Mac break weekly ideas.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.800]   By the way, if you have something you'd like us to cover on the show and especially in
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:49.160]   these dim dark days before Christmas, when there is no news, well, he's bookmarked those
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.080]   stories on delicious and tag him with MBW ideas.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.080]   And that way we'll see him.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:59.000]   And I do want to thank to find the line who sent us a link to the top 15 hidden leopard
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.520]   hints from apple tell.com.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.040]   And if you haven't seen these guys, these are good hints.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.800]   You probably, I know Chris Breen, you know all of these, but I, yeah, that was good stuff
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   though.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:12.840]   I was just to sing the same kind of stuff time and time again, but they, you know, about
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:16.400]   half of them I was well familiar with, but there were a couple in there.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:21.000]   I don't know you could press C for instance, when you're in spaces and you press F8 to
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.800]   see all the windows, if you press C, it collects them all into the first window.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.800]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.440]   And also the idea of you can take a window and bump it into another space just by dragging
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.720]   it over and leaving it there for a second.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.080]   That's a nice thing too.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.000]   I needed some help with spaces.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.400]   I like spaces, but I had trouble with stuff kind of disappearing into other spaces.
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.400]   There's more stuff in spaces than is apparent.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.440]   So it was nice to see a couple of those hints in there.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.840]   Is there somewhere you can, is there a book?
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.600]   You could, I mean, Apple doesn't, I'm sure somewhere Apple documented this.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.400]   And is it in the help file?
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.400]   About the space of stuff?
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.840]   If you dig through the help file, there's some of that stuff on there.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.480]   But I guess that's what you have to do is just read all these help files stuff.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.040]   And if it's not on the onboard one, then they've updated online.
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.040]   And so you can search for it there.
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:17.200]   I don't see, I'm looking at the spaces help and I don't see that C key thing here.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.560]   To switch between spaces, pressing the control key, yeah, see, it's all the stuff everybody
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.560]   knows.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.560]   Right.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:23.720]   Control one, two, three, and that stuff.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:25.800]   To add an application, click the ad.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.800]   They don't have the C thing.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.600]   That's the one I like.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.600]   That's, they hit that away.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.360]   Anyway, apple tell dot com.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.000]   We'll put a link in the shush.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Shash, we'll put a link in the show.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.040]   Shash, I want to paste that into the, into the chat room right now so you can, you can
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.560]   get that one.
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:46.720]   We're ready for our picks.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.760]   Did you bring a pick today, Leon Alahua?
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.040]   I did bring a pick.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.520]   Ladies, well, thank you.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:58.760]   I am trying to help a couple of my friends who have recently switched to Max Yay to do,
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.600]   to learn how to maintain their max.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:04.640]   And one of the things that it's easier for me to show them than to explain to them a
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:09.040]   lot of different things, especially about the hard drive and how to maintain their files.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:13.800]   So there's a, a, a, a disk utility called disk inventory X.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:19.200]   And it's a free application for the Mac and it visually shows it's a, it has a gooey interface
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:23.840]   that shows you where, which files are taking up, how much space on your hard drive.
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.840]   So you can go through and delete things that you need to and you can delete the blocks
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:30.760]   of the visual blocks that you see, or you can delete, go your finder and delete the
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.760]   individual files.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:35.480]   And it's been really helpful in my explaining to my friends what they need to be looking
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.680]   for as they start on their max journey.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.480]   So we really like this one.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.480]   Yes.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.480]   Haven't tried it with leopard.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.600]   I'm actually going to start playing with leopard this week now.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.280]   I feel bad that I haven't played with it at all.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.600]   I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.240]   I mean, it's, I mean, that's a great, that's such a useful program.
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.240]   I really love that.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.240]   Yes.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.240]   And it's free.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.240]   Yes, it's free.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.240]   Zero Alex's.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.240]   Zero Alex's.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.240]   Disk inventory.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.440]   Or it's disk inventory X, right?
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.440]   Correct.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:04.360]   The website's derlion.com D E R L I E N dot com.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.360]   Excellent.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.360]   Yes.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.360]   Excellent.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:08.360]   Mr. Scott born.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:10.360]   Do you have a pick for us today, my friend?
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.360]   I do.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.600]   I actually have one and a half picks.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.600]   Oh my.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:17.080]   Because the half pick isn't really a pick, but I have to brag.
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:22.280]   I have a giant box containing the entire special edition of rock band sitting right next
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.000]   to me here in the control booth.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   What is it?
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   Rock band.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.640]   Oh, it's rock band.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:29.640]   I'll be right there.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:30.640]   What's rock band?
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:31.640]   What do you tell?
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.640]   It's like guitar here.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.440]   Only it's got drums, a guitar, a microphone.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.000]   Oh, it was like the hottest thing going.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   And I got it.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.920]   They just started opening up the lines today to sell them.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.520]   And we sent out a special program.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.520]   Is it a math program?
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.480]   No, that's why it's only a half pick.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.480]   So here's my real pick.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.480]   What's it?
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.480]   Well, actually, just wait a minute.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.480]   What's it wrong?
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.480]   It's an Xbox 360.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.480]   Oh, okay.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.480]   I'm just, you know, I'm just right.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.680]   So if you're not going to play the drums.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.160]   They can actually do a band together.
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.700]   We should do the Mac
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:45:59.700]   Ring, we should be playing.
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.360]   Do you have to have four controllers?
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:05.040]   You know, you can have guitar, as many guitar controllers I think as you have USB ports for
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.880]   them, but you have a mic and you have a drum controller as well.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:08.880]   Oh, it's pretty good.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:13.120]   You actually have a singer, which we're really trying to carefully screen.
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.960]   But the drummer is, you know, come on, Leona sounds like she can sing.
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.120]   Well, we've got five people now.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:22.160]   So you, each of you can play the four instruments because there are only four and you can fight
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.160]   it out of much yourself.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.160]   So who wants to sing?
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.240]   But I'll be the obligatory cage dancer.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.240]   We'll do that.
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.240]   Oh, wow.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.240]   I'll be right over.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.160]   No, you can sing.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:32.160]   You can sing.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.960]   I could tell you could sing.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:34.960]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:35.960]   Come on.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:36.960]   I'm good at karaoke.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.960]   Tiny bubbles.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:38.960]   Come on.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:39.960]   Try it.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:44.440]   In the one tiny, yeah, I don't know all the words.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:45.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.280]   What kind of Hawaiian are you anyway?
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:52.600]   The real pick, the real pick is actually not Mac specific, but people who use iPhones
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.280]   and iPods might be interested in it.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:59.920]   It's a pair of headphones and it's a pair of noise canceling headphones that I happen
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.960]   to think are equal to.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:07.800]   And maybe in some cases slightly better than the famed Bose noise canceling headphones.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:12.200]   These are the creative Arvana X5 headphones.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.200]   Creative Arvana XVah.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.200]   X5.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.200]   X-Fi.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.200]   Oh, this is creative.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.200]   Has an X5.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.560]   And these, these are noise canceling.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:26.960]   They're about the same price as the Bose, about 330 bucks, 320 bucks, less than half
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.520]   an Alex.
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:33.920]   And they have, the one thing they have going for them is they have very good all response
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.040]   in the higher range.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:41.560]   And you can actually set up, you know, different formats for them because they have some special
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:45.800]   little processing that's right on side of the headphone that you can push.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:50.880]   And since my Bose headphones were donated to a worthy cause recently, I picked these
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:56.200]   up and I have to say that I'm very impressed with them upon testing them this morning.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:00.800]   So I decided to make them my pick and you can use them with the iPhone if you get the
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.360]   iPhone adapter.
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:04.760]   Oh, the sure.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.720]   That's the one you, that was another pick at another time.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.680]   Well, yeah, you can use the Shuri.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.240]   You can use the standard Belkin headphone adapter.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:16.000]   Any of those adapters that will let you get a standard headphone into the iPhone.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   So they work on the iPhone.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.800]   They work on the iPods.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.320]   And they're really quite astoundingly good.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:27.040]   You know, Bose has sort of dominated that market for a long time, but the creatives are
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.720]   definitely worth a listen.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:32.160]   I have two programs for you.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:38.000]   One is $10 and one is apparently free.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.480]   And these are programs.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:45.720]   We kind of talked about these to help you make your leopard look less leonine.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:46.720]   I actually don't use them.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.440]   I'm very happy with the leopard dock and the leopard menu bar.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:54.320]   But if you're tired of the dock, you might want to take a look at Dockchanger from whimsically
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.160]   plucky software.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:01.800]   DJ McIntosh sent me the, he's actually the guy wrote it sent me the link to this.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:08.160]   And Dockchanger allows you to put leopard spots on your dock or wood or change the, change
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:11.840]   that little highway stripe to all sorts of different kinds of looks.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.280]   90 different backgrounds and themes.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:18.280]   You can actually try it free.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:22.720]   I can't remember a certain number of times and then $10 if you want to buy it.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.800]   It's called Dockchanger.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.680]   Change your dock back to something more legible.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:33.040]   In fact, who was it was telling me that his mom couldn't read the dots at all, you know,
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.560]   that indicate which the active application is this would solve that.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.840]   You could change those dots too.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:43.520]   Actually plucky is whimsplucky.com WHIMS plucky.com.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:52.920]   And then from Mac Park, Leo, Pake actually Stefan Klim and Mac Parker, the developers
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:58.240]   and Leo, Pake, of course, enables the opacity in your menu bar.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.240]   And that's absolutely free.
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:01.760]   Leo, Pake 2.01.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.800]   Both of these will be on the show notes.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:08.640]   I'm going to get sash the links so that you can download those.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:15.280]   Those are your two programs from me, a total two programs for one 70th of an Alex.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.280]   There you go.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.240]   And now it's time for Mr. Chris Breen.
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:24.200]   Yes, I've got one and a quarter picks because my quarter pick is a book.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.200]   Okay.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.200]   We, this is good.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.240]   We're getting a lot of for our pick dollar today.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.240]   Yes, we certainly are.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:35.680]   The fact of graphics is releasing the Crazy Cat Sunday strips.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.680]   Really?
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:37.680]   They are.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.960]   And they, so they've started back in 1925.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:41.960]   Wow.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.560]   They haven't gone all the way back to the teens because another company had been doing
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.560]   that.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.320]   But all that stuff is out of print now.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:52.120]   And those of you who are not familiar with Crazy Cat, it is one of the most surrealistic
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.560]   comic strips ever created.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:59.440]   And the only reason it survived is because Hearst loved it and readers universally hated
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.440]   it.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.440]   Oh, is that true?
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.440]   Oh, but I love it now.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.440]   I mean, it's loved now.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.600]   Oh, yeah, it's wonderful.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.320]   So they're reprinting a bunch of this stuff.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:15.640]   And there was a 600 page hardcover $75 version of the 1925 through 1934 limited edition of
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.640]   thousand copies sold out.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:18.640]   Sorry.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:24.120]   But you can, you can get the collections that run for two years through fanographics and
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:26.000]   absolutely worth doing.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   The color collections are wonderful.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.760]   The recreation of the color is great.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.800]   And even the black and white strips are worth having.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:37.040]   That's the one where the mouse is always throwing a brick at the cat.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.040]   Always yeah.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.240]   And the cat was sometimes male, sometimes female.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:44.480]   And then there's Office of Pub, this sheriff who's a dog and he loves the cat.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.360]   Oh, it's just a wonderful.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.760]   And that's my quarter pick.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:49.920]   So worth looking at.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:50.920]   And that's fantastic.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:51.920]   And that's fantastic.
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:52.920]   One word, fantastic.
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:56.960]   Antigraphic.com, they're also the company that's reprinting all the peanut strips.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:59.560]   So if you want that stuff, they do a lot.
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:00.560]   I'm looking at their site.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.320]   They do a lot of classic old stuff.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.520]   And they're probably doing Pogo too from beginning.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:07.680]   Oh, I'd love a complete Pogo.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:09.680]   Really good stuff.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:10.680]   All right.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.360]   And back to the Mac stuff.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:15.440]   I'm surprised nobody has mentioned this in the pics before.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:21.240]   So I'm going to and that's Harro sauce Amadeus Pro, which $40.
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:26.080]   Pogo editor, largely you work in two tracks, but it supports multiple tracks.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:28.440]   Does batch processing.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:34.800]   If you're looking at an open and edit odd kind of audio files, it's just ag-vorbis.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:35.800]   It will do that.
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.520]   It will do flak files that other programs won't touch.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.960]   It's a nice audio editor.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:47.160]   You know, it works very much the same way as traditional is do that you're using waveform
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.160]   editing.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.160]   It will also do analysis.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.160]   It will take out noise.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:52.560]   It will repair clicks and pops.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:55.080]   And there are other applications to do this, but they cost a lot more.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:58.080]   This again is $40 and absolutely worth looking at.
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:00.240]   Wow, that's great.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.400]   I use it all the time.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.280]   I can't believe we've never mentioned it.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.920]   I went to the pics side and it was not listed.
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:08.160]   I said, well, somebody's got to mention this now.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.640]   No, it's amazing.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:15.600]   You know, with programs like Audacity and Apple's own soundtrack pro crashing left and right,
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:18.160]   the stability of Amadeus, they just did the leopard update.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.160]   It's fantastic.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.360]   Yeah, and a very nice interface to it.
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:27.480]   Previous version of Amadeus was a very capable program, but the interface was kind of ugly.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.760]   It looked like it was nine, but they've updated that as well.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.680]   So it's a very pretty looking program.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:35.320]   And it really is one of the most versatile sound applications I've used for under 50
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.320]   bucks.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:40.520]   I use it on the road to do all when I'm recording commercials under my quilt in my hotel room.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:43.280]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.160]   I have to record commercials when I'm in Vancouver.
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.480]   And that's how I do it under your quilt.
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.880]   Well, I do it too.
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:53.640]   I always think when I'm sitting there doing some kind of voiceover or something that I
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:57.040]   have to put together for here, I think, you know, I've spent a lot of money on my office
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:02.360]   and here I am sitting under a comforter.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:03.360]   It gets sweaty out of there.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:04.360]   You can't stay tuned.
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:06.640]   You can only, you can't really do a whole show.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.200]   You can only do a commercial.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.720]   No, only one commercial at a time.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.720]   By the way, good news.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.640]   Andy Anako has just twitted that his mom is out of surgery.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.640]   It went very well.
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:21.800]   So, good to hear that and our best wishes to Andy and his mom.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:25.200]   So we miss him.
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:30.880]   Before we wrap up, I think a good time to take a break and tell you about audible.com.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.560]   And yes, I see you, Alex.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:36.360]   I know we have a pick for you still to come.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.040]   Audible.com is our sponsor.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:40.640]   They have been for some time really great supporters of Mac break weekly.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:45.620]   And that makes sense because audible goes so well with your iPod, your iPhone, your
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:52.680]   Mac, it's audio books, 45,000 plus titles, some of the best titles out there.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:56.520]   Great stuff that you can listen to and enjoy.
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:00.540]   I put them all on my iPhone, but they go, you know, as I said, on any device, almost
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.960]   any device, they have a list of devices supported.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:07.680]   Also you can burn them to CD.
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:12.560]   So you don't have to, you know, you don't have to, you can listen to them anywhere pretty
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.980]   much that you can listen to a CD.

[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:43.560]   This week we'll do a quick pick, actually a section on Audible that's new on the front
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:47.020]   page that I love, books that change the world.
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:48.780]   I listen to audible because I learn.
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:54.540]   You know, for me, it's the time I spend commuting or working out or walking or, you know, it's
[00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:56.500]   not time wasted.
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.140]   It's because of audible.
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:02.220]   It's I'm learning all the time.
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:04.660]   And they have a series called books that change the world.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:07.620]   It's a collection of seven very important books.
[00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:10.740]   The Bible, a biography about it.
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:13.340]   These are books about books.
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:20.620]   Thomas Paine's Rights of Man, Christopher Hitchens writing about that one.
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:24.220]   Hugh Strand writing about Closvitz on war.
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:29.120]   Janet Brown writing about Darwin's origin of species, a really interesting series.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:37.080]   Books about famous books, Wealth of Nations, the Coron, Plato's Republic.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:40.380]   And I think this is an example of where you can really just take that time that you're
[00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:44.020]   stuck in the car, nothing to do.
[00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:47.140]   Of course, you want to listen to Mac Break Weekly, but then when that's done, what do
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:48.620]   you do?
[00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:52.580]   These are some great books books that changed the world, a series from Audible.
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:54.300]   Could be one of your free books.
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:57.180]   Half Price Sale continues through November 27th.
[00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:02.300]   So a thousand unabridged titles had a half price to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:07.140]   We do think of so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:09.900]   Well I think this has been a great show given that it was a half.
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:10.900]   Oh wait a minute.
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:11.900]   Alex Lindsay.
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:12.900]   Alex Lindsay.
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.940]   I had so many picks today.
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:16.700]   Well, go ahead.
[00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:18.900]   I almost forgot you.
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:22.540]   And I have, and you know, not to be competitive or anything, but I have three picks and they're
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:23.540]   all the old humanities.
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:26.900]   And you just have to say them all because otherwise I'll forget about it.
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:29.100]   You know, and so, so anyway, I'll do it really quickly.
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:32.580]   The first one, just to build on Leona, as if you're doing the disk inventory.
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:35.620]   The other one that we use heavily in the office is Distracker.
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:36.620]   You guys use Distracker?
[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:37.780]   Is it the same as it?
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:39.780]   Do the color blobs?
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:43.460]   Well what it does is we have, we back up, we don't back up to tape.
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:48.780]   You know, we go through about anywhere from one to ten terabytes a week.
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:51.300]   And so we have lots of drives floating around.
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:56.980]   And if you have a lot of drives that are floating around, whether it's that or just
[00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:00.700]   lots of little things, what this that lets you do is basically you have Distracker and
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:04.620]   you just put a drive in and you say, and it just tracks the whole drive, you know, grabs
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:06.820]   everything and keeps it in the database.
[00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:09.420]   And then you just put the next drive in and you do the same thing and the next drive in
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:10.420]   and do the same thing.
[00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:13.580]   And now we have a database that I can figure out, where did I put that file and I search
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:14.580]   it?
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:19.980]   Because, you know, we have literally over 200 drives that have, you know, little labels
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:22.660]   on them and then they have, and then they've all been disstracked.
[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:27.180]   And so there's this one database that I can figure out where a certain file is on, you
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:28.820]   know, say, you know, go get this drive.
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:30.900]   It's in this directory.
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:35.280]   As for some of us who go through a lot of space, I know most people go through this much
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:40.420]   space, but a lot of us have five or six drives around or we have, you know, some portable
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.860]   drives and some drives that we're backing up.
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:45.800]   This is a great way, especially if the drives aren't online all the time.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:48.400]   If you don't have them always plugged in and you're trying to figure out which drive has
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:55.040]   what, it's a $30 application and it is for us, it's gold, you know, so we're, you know,
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:56.040]   we really like it.
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:59.360]   Anyway, I was just thinking about it with when Liana was talking about what she was talking
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:02.760]   about, the other two things real quickly and I'll go over them fast.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:09.160]   Then on the geeky end is red has released the new, what's called red code, red alert
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.760]   and red sitting, which lets you open red files directly.
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.880]   This is the new high end camera that they're putting down and it's really a company.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:19.520]   You should go to red.com just to look at a company that's doing a lot of things the
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:20.520]   right way.
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:23.360]   You know, the amount of support that they provide for people and everything else is really
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.360]   amazing.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:25.360]   A lot of this is Mac only.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:28.040]   So like red alert and red sitting are actually Intel Mac only.
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:32.160]   They're really front end things, but these, the files, they, I think there's some sample
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:34.120]   files up there that you can now download and open.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:37.000]   And if there isn't, we're going to post some soon from some of the red stuff that we've
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.400]   been shooting.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:42.200]   And it's, I mean, this is as close to digital film.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:47.440]   I mean, you know, Steven Soderbergh is shooting his new films about Che in, you know, on
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.520]   reds and you really just want to see this.
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.800]   This is like a real revolution from the film side.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:55.720]   And finally, the last thing, just because it was released this week and I started playing
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:59.760]   with it and I'm kind of channeling, murdling on this one.
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:04.560]   Have you guys seen Omni, Omni groups new Omni focus bought it?
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.560]   You bought it?
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.960]   And that's an app I should have been half price, half price right now 30 bucks.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.400]   I watched the video and then I was like, okay, I'm done.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.840]   You know, I have some concerns.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.040]   It's a little over complicated.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.640]   I mean, a GTD application should be simple.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.640]   I don't know.
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:24.840]   I mean, I think that it's, I find that all the Omni tools from my, they're so good.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.840]   And Merlin helped them with this.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:28.520]   And there, and there, it looked like it was designed by Merlin.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.680]   No, he was, he kept going up to a Omni group and working with him on it.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:35.160]   It looked like it was really, like it was channeling Merlin.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:40.920]   So if you're, the biggest problem with the, a lot of the getting things done type style
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:44.200]   is that there was never really a great infrastructure to support it.
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:48.640]   You know, I mean, you know, something that really supports all the techniques and the
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.960]   processes and everything else.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:55.000]   And that's something that really, it's hard to keep up with the, the tasks and, you know,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.520]   how you're supposed to do it.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.720]   Because there's nothing that really builds the shelves, the way that you want to have
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.720]   them built.
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.720]   Right.
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:07.280]   And, and this is just a really, you know, a fantastic first version, you know, to do
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.280]   this.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.960]   And right now, the reason it's important to say sooner than later is because it's 50%
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.480]   off now before January 8th.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.040]   I guess that's what it comes out.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.040]   Yeah.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.480]   It comes out right in time for Macworld, but it just came out over the last week.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.800]   And I mean, it's been out of out.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.800]   So how long have you been using it, Leanna?
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.480]   I've been using actually now for maybe two and a half, three months.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.480]   A long time.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.480]   So yeah.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.560]   I'm sure you felt the same way when you first looked at it.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.400]   This is complex, but you've adjusted to that.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.400]   I did.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:38.520]   I actually came from Microsoft Outlook from a Windows machine and was prior to that using
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.520]   a Franklin Covey system.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.520]   I don't know if you're familiar with that.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.520]   I am.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.520]   I've taken the class and everything.
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.520]   I'm very familiar with that.
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.520]   Yeah.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.520]   And so I was used to that.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.080]   So it didn't take me too long to adjust because I was already using the GTD things with the
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.240]   context and everything.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.440]   So it wasn't too bad.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.000]   It was a little, it looked a little bit more simple for the things that I wanted to do
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.360]   and then when I realized I started playing with it a little bit, it was actually a really
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.600]   great interface for all the things that I want to do.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.320]   But it doesn't force you to use anything you don't want to use.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.320]   Right.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.560]   And it syncs up, which is nice.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:10.680]   I mean, it handles the Apple mail to do's and it syncs with your iCal.
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:16.200]   That's what I like is there's been a lot of these that I've seen that have been, then
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.200]   you don't get to use iCal.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.160]   And I really wanted to have it be something that will integrate with iCal, not be something
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:25.200]   that's running in parallel because that kind of cripples my whole system.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.200]   So yeah.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.200]   Right.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.840]   I mean, I bought it because I didn't want to pay the 70 bucks it's going to be in January
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.920]   and I know I'll get it then anyway because I'm a fanatic for these things.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:40.440]   There's a new version of iGTD in progress too, which is the program I have been using.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:45.640]   And iGTD too will probably not be free and that will have a lot of new features.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.640]   But I think you're right.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:50.640]   I think OmniFocas right now is the GTD app.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:58.600]   And we're testing this, Leo, but OmniFocas will sync to iPhone via Leopard Mail and iCal.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.000]   And we've been getting reports of that for about a week.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.240]   So I am going to test that on our one leopard machine.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.640]   And I think that's a precursor to an app you're going to see from Apple next year.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:11.720]   But I think that that's something to note here with regard to that problem.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:15.000]   Yeah, we thought they'd have to do this with when leopard came out and they still haven't
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   done that.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   Well, I think you'll see that.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   That's a Mac, maybe Mac world.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.240]   The neat thing that you can do with OmniFocas is you can email yourself to do's if you mail
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:31.080]   it to yourself with a keyword in the address, such as plus OmniFocas.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:35.720]   I thought you said we could email ourselves in which case I was going to go to Hawaii.
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.560]   Excuse me, I'm going to email myself.
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.560]   Only email your tasks to Hawaii.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.040]   The rest of you have to stay here.
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.920]   Although that's not so bad, really.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:45.920]   That's so bad.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.280]   Yeah, I'll be curious.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.280]   You're right.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.320]   I agree with you.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.000]   This is absolutely a pick, Alex.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.840]   I always get worried when it's so complicated.
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:58.080]   What it reminds me a lot of is Kinkless, which was based on OmniOutliner Pro.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.760]   I think that's what happened is the OmniFocas.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.760]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.120]   Here's this great application based on OmniOutliner Pro.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.400]   Let's make something that's purpose-built for that.
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.280]   Sometimes it comes once again to training.
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.000]   I first opened it and I was like, "Oh, I don't know."
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.560]   This is a bad idea.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.440]   Then I actually sat and watched the little 15-minute video.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.440]   Great video.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.400]   Then I became much clearer about how I was going to use this.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.240]   If you just open it up, it's too much.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.680]   Which is unlike a lot of the other Omni.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.480]   The Omni Group stuff is just so good in general.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:33.680]   But with OmniGraftful, I just opened it and started wacking through it.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.480]   Every once in a while, I realized, "Oh, I can really do this."
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.800]   I really wish I'd watched the training.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.360]   Yeah, I think I bought every one of their programs.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:43.160]   They really should have a deal where you just get everything with one lumped sum up.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:48.760]   You're here by the way, besides the half off, if you do own OmniOutliner Pro as I do, which
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:53.000]   is another great program, you get an additional 25% off.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.720]   That's really the time to buy it if you think you're going to use it.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:01.560]   In general, that's the thing about Omni Group in general, is that you get great applications
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:05.800]   that are well-priced and they're always doing something that makes you feel like you're
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.600]   part of it.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.600]   So it's a good tip.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.600]   Check it out.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.600]   Glad we didn't forget you.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.600]   Oops.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.600]   Oh, god.
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:18.440]   Hey, everybody, that's it for Mac Break Weekly.
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:19.840]   We thank you so much for joining us.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:22.120]   Leanna Lohua, thank you for being here.
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.120]   She's one of the Girls Gone Geek at Girls Gone Geek TV.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.120]   Thank you.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.120]   They're having me.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.120]   It's great to be here.
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.800]   We're all going to be at Macworld, by the way, which is going to be a lot of fun.
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.960]   Can we talk about that yet, Alex?
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:33.960]   We can't.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.960]   We can.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.960]   Tell us that.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.360]   Well, we're going to...
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:44.040]   It looks like we're doing the podcast studio at Macworld.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:47.160]   And really, it's in the back of the West Hall.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:52.000]   So this is the first time I think Macworld has had actual booths in the West Hall.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.120]   So the West Hall is above the ground and it's closer to our office, which I like.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.360]   But we're going to have a theater in the back.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:02.640]   I think it has something like three or 400 seats.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.840]   And so we're going to be in the back running podcast studio.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:10.120]   This is going to be a mixture of a bunch of the podcasts that we already do.
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:16.680]   And as well as, I mean, we Macbreak weekly at least once, probably twice.
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:17.680]   And then a lot of the other stuff.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.760]   We're going to just put it there on Friday.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.760]   Exactly.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:21.760]   We're doing Girls Gone Geek there.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:23.760]   I mean, it's true.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.760]   Yes.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:25.760]   And so, yeah.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.760]   So we'll have a ton of these great podcasts.
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:29.360]   Callie Lewis is going to join us, which will be great.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.360]   Yes.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.360]   Callie Lewis is going to be there.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.360]   I think we've got...
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.280]   We're going to be out covering stuff.
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:39.480]   We're going to have a lot of people there talking about.
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:41.040]   So Craig Seaberson, if you've ever seen...
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.080]   I don't know if you've ever seen Craig's presentations.
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.960]   But the end of Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Craig doing one of his...
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:51.840]   Each night, each afternoon, we have him talking about general techniques around...
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.840]   Oh, great.
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:53.840]   ...the Russian or...
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.640]   He's like the keynote master.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.760]   And so it really makes it clear.
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.400]   And then we're going to be running training all the way through.
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.840]   So most of the mornings we're going to be doing, except for the very further Tuesday morning,
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:08.320]   there's going to be tons of training in audio, in video, in...
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:14.080]   It'll be little 20-minute talks about really what you need to know about compression or
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.200]   recording or all these other things.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.960]   So it's going to be really a seminar on it.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:22.080]   I mean, a lot of what we talked about at Gear Media Tech and other things.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:27.080]   I mean, a lot of that kind of content really distilled down over those three or four days
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:30.920]   of talking about how to make your podcast as well as showing some really, really great
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.200]   podcast. And we're still working on a couple of the podcasts that we think are going to
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.200]   come through that will be also really exciting.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.200]   And if...
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.400]   I mean, it is...
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:42.680]   It's really going to be an event to definitely check out.
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:43.680]   It's worth coming.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:46.720]   I think we're working really hard on it right now.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:52.680]   So I think that it's worth coming to Macworld just for that and for what Pod Dango's doing
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:53.680]   as well.
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.080]   So Scott, you guys are...
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.240]   Can you talk about that yet?
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:02.640]   Yeah, we have the podcasting symposium, which is part of the faculty conference track.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:07.320]   And if you're signed up for any of the conference sessions that gets you into that.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:11.000]   So that is something you have to pay for, but it's like, you pay to get in all those
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   sessions.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.960]   So it's not like you have to pay just to see ours.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:18.840]   And we're counting on Leo and Alex and Craig and everybody to stop in in our deal too.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:21.840]   And we're going to do some cross promotion between the two places.
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:26.120]   And our sessions will be strictly educational.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:32.560]   And then we'll all be going out to the floor with you, Alex, to do the actual shows.
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:36.240]   Right, so there'll be education on both ends, there'll be shows.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.760]   It's going to be, I mean, especially for podcasting, it's going to be an incredibly
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:40.760]   dense Macworld.
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.880]   It'll be the most coverage that Macworld's ever given to our industry.
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.880]   That's great.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:46.880]   I think it's...
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:50.280]   In some ways, I think it might be some of the deepest coverage that anybody's done.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:51.280]   Yeah, that's exciting.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.280]   It's exciting.
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.760]   If you're planning to go to Macworld, make sure you look for us.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.640]   We'll be there in the West Hall.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.880]   And we should have the schedule up in the next two weeks.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:58.880]   Good.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.880]   I'll make sure...
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:00.880]   So, online, people can cross...
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.080]   Take a look at it, plan stuff out, and so on and so forth.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:06.800]   Alex Lindsey is with the Pixelcore, of course, Pixelcore.com, a great group of people who
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:13.240]   help you learn about all of these technologies, these media technologies, and then get work
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.560]   in the field, which is even better.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:19.360]   Pixelcore.com, Pixelcore.tv for their podcasts.
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:25.760]   Scott Morn is with the Apple Phone Show, and a bunch of other stuff at Padango.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.440]   ApplephoneShow.com, anything else I should mention, Scott?
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:30.880]   I think we've covered it and I appreciate you being on the show.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.880]   I love how you love it.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:35.040]   My life zone is still going, and Leona is in charge of that now, by the way.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.040]   Congratulations, Leona.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.040]   What are you doing?
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.040]   Screen casting.
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.040]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.040]   Oh, that's really neat.
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.120]   That's how-to screen casting.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:46.080]   Chris Breen is a regular, was on the iLife Zone, and of course, on the Apple Phone Show,
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:54.240]   and he is a regular here, and he is the Mac Daddy, Mr. Mac 911 for a Macworld magazine.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.240]   Right.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:57.240]   And he's right now with his mommy.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.000]   I am enjoying this.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.680]   And she makes my breakfast.
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:02.680]   Oh, man.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:05.440]   I know it's my mommy to make me breakfast.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.840]   Can we come over, Chris?
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.840]   I'm going to be-
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:08.840]   Yeah, come on down.
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:09.840]   She'll make breakfast for you, too.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.720]   I'll be with my mommy after for Christmas, so that's good.
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:13.720]   Alright.
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:14.720]   That's really.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.600]   This week for Thanksgiving, so it all works out.
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:21.920]   We hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving, and we all have very many things to be thankful
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.520]   for, but especially for our wonderful listeners.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:28.760]   We thank you so much for all the love and support you've given us.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.880]   This is our 66th episode, so it's been a year and a half that we've been doing this
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.080]   show, and we just love doing it.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.240]   Thanks also to John Hoffman.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.000]   We didn't give him credit of Kalamazoo, Michigan.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.800]   He's the guy who did Merlin's mannerisms.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:46.320]   That book with a page a day with Merlin's quotes at the top, I haven't been able to talk
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.480]   to Merlin.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.520]   What I'd like to do, he sent us the PDF.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.200]   I guess he's selling it on Lulu, but I'd like to give it away.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:55.560]   I'm going to make sure I can get permission from Merlin and from John, but I would love
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:59.200]   just to offer that PDF to anybody who wants to print out their own copy.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.720]   So we'll let you know if and when that becomes possible.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.400]   That might be our Christmas gift to all our Mac Break Weekly listeners.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.800]   Thanks to John Hoffman for putting that together.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:10.800]   Have I covered everybody?
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.560]   Yes, I have.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.920]   I guess there's nothing left to say, but another Mac Break is broke.
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:16.920]   Have a great Thanksgiving.
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:17.240]   Bye bye.
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.820]   (upbeat music)
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:22.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.000]   (upbeat music)
