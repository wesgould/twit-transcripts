[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.360]   stick it in the wrong way? I'll find out later on Mac Break Weekly is next.

[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.860]   Let's welcome once again back to our shores. I don't know where she's been.
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.480]   Kelly Guimant. Hello Kelly. Hi. Welcome back to our shores. I didn't realize I've
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.680]   been anywhere interesting that required navigation of shores. Yes. Well if you
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.160]   haven't been anywhere we're glad to have you back to the studio. You were
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.560]   that's right. How'd that go? It was phenomenal. We did it two sessions here
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.660]   one in July and one in August and they were both really great. The teams were
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.860]   super creative. The apps are awesome. Having switched everything to Swift is
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.940]   stupid. Oh nice. Yeah this year we finally converted everything over and it
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.340]   basically gives us like an extra day of camp because there's so much less
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.060]   stuff we have to explain and it's so much more human readable. Wow. So yeah it's
[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.500]   it's really great. So they get more time to work on their pitches. They get more
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.120]   time to work on their buttons because button making is an important piece and
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.140]   it is it was great. I used to go to camp to make buttons but it was a different
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.940]   kind of button. Kelly was the last time you were here you talked about Appcamp
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.240]   for girls and we're so glad that it went well this year. That's great. Which one
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.700]   are you at? Portland. I help out with the two sessions in Portland and then this
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.880]   year we were in Vancouver for the first time. We are officially the Appcamp for
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.880]   Girls Society of Canada. We're an actual nonprofit there and we so we did the
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.880]   first year this summer in Vancouver and then we had our second camp. We did one
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.400]   last year and we did one that we did one this year in Seattle and we've got the
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.080]   two here in Portland and we're looking to expand. Nice. What's the URL? It is Appcamp
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:57.840]   number four girls.com. Easy. Yeah. Easy peasy. From Morale. It's Rene Rache from
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.360]   Amal.com. Hello Morale. Hello Leo. How are you doing today? I'm going to say
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:15.520]   magnify. And from Baston and Inacco. Sorry about that Mike. My camera seems to
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.280]   have frozen at this end. I can still see you guys. I might have to unplug the
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.120]   camera and plug it back in again until then. You can just assume that the force
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.160]   wave of the nuclear attack from North Korea started in Boston. It's on your way
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.440]   there. Got just a few more seconds to say I regret nothing. And he is a tiny
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.480]   little piece of gray goo now. This way. I'm just gonna go do that unplug and
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.760]   plug it. Why don't you go ahead and do that? That might be for the best. Yeah.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.360]   So all right. While Andy's doing that because I know he uses an Android phone.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:54.840]   Of course we believe coming soon to a pocket near you the new iPhone. I think
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.920]   because they do it every year at this time it's pretty credible. They would do
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.440]   it Wednesday September 9th not Tuesday because of Labor Day. They like to give
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.760]   the. I mean they work Labor Day but I mean whether the venue has access and
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.120]   whether media can get there on Labor Day. Yeah it's better to do it the day after.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.480]   And of course people publish this as if breaking news iPhone will be up for
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.120]   pre-order on the 11th the following Friday as always iPhone will delivered
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.240]   the following Friday the 18th. Anything to contradict those numbers those dates.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.600]   No I mean as far as I know it's it's almost like WWZ now where it's going to
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.760]   be that week every year unless there's a significant reason to change it and
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.280]   Apple can always change it but looking back three four years now they've done
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.360]   the event the same week they've done the release of iOS the same day the release
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.400]   of the phone the same day. Do you use a six or six plus? I have both I'm 99% of
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.360]   the time I use a six plus. Okay Kelly. I rocked the five S. Five S. She's living
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.920]   in the past. So I'm gonna obviously get the new iPhone and I this time around
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.480]   decided to get the six not the six plus because it looked like the six plus
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.200]   increased resolution but didn't increase the amount of data in other words
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.400]   applications just blew things up instead of taking advantage of more dots. But I
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.920]   think there's over time over time that will that change that I presume so
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.320]   that's my question for you because you know I like a big phone I cannot lie but
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:35.360]   I'm wondering if I should get a six or six plus or six plus. Both the six and
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.240]   the six S can run in in an accessibility mode that takes the amount of pixels
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.800]   from the previous size phone and just blows them up. That I don't want. Yeah so
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.800]   that that is just because some people you know they do want that. So you can
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.640]   just say everything. Yeah. Yeah absolutely. But the iPhone 6 added a bunch of
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.520]   pixels and the iPhone 6 plus added even more the iPhone 6 plus is 1080p. Apps had
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.880]   to update to support that Apple made this thing called adaptive adaptivity
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.640]   last year which basically is it's almost like adaptive design or scalable web
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.440]   content design where you can pin things to locations and not be pixel perfect
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.680]   anymore but apps had to update to support it as a benefit with iOS 9 now if you
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.000]   did do the adaptive design and you use size classes and you used auto layout
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.080]   you get all the multitasking stuff as well. So they're really trying to push
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.640]   this idea of making your apps disconnect from the device so that they're sort
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.480]   of a more of a logical framework and less of a pixel painting. Has that
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.640]   resulted in apps that have that use the real estate intelligently in other words
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.400]   I don't want something blown up like that the accessibility case I want to see
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.360]   more stuff on the screen because I got more dots. It's something that seemed to
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.200]   me initially that that wasn't really the case it was just everything was bigger.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.560]   Yeah I mean and they're apps usually it's the same suspects it's the banking
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.560]   apps it's apps that go to a web end that requires some sort of right secure
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.120]   infrastructure they probably built in cobalt and have no intention of ever
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.600]   updating. So Safari for instance probably gets more text on the screen right. Yeah
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.960]   Safari doesn't turn it sideways on iPhone 6. The biggest thing about the iPhone 6
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.640]   plus is if you turn it sideways it switches to an iPad view so you have
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.600]   multi-column layouts so you get the split view controller you have the table on
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.880]   one side and the content on the other. Does it seem unlikely that they would
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.520]   change the screen resolution for this iteration? They've never done it for an
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.880]   S-class device before both the iPhone 3GS the 4s and the 5s were all the same
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.840]   screens as the previous screens from resolutions as the previous generation.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.080]   But as we've said many times before better camera everybody's kind of getting
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.520]   excited about the camera like it. Oh it should point out Leo the internally the
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.080]   iPhone 6 plus is a 3x display it scales down to 1080p because that's what the
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.560]   screen is but with very with almost no effort Apple could put a 3x display in
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:47.040]   there. Interesting. Okay yeah so it's just because they've never done it before
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.240]   doesn't mean they won't do it this time generally though you don't see. Well
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.040]   but actually you do see changes in hardware because we're gonna see a new
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.520]   camera a new A9 chip probably so it wouldn't be inconceivable that you put a
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.720]   higher risk screen in there. No I mean as far as I know it was because there are
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.280]   larger screens there are the 4k or the 2k displays already kill the battery. They
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.920]   kill the freaking battery. They do and the when you make when you make devices
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.720]   that aren't that you don't make that many devices it's easy when you want to
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.240]   use specific technologies it's easy Apple couldn't get yield for larger
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.480]   screens so they went with 1080p so if they can do that for a higher screen we'll
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:26.680]   see that as soon as it's possible. Force touch of course. I'm most interested in
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.080]   the bigger camera and OIS right now is only in the 6+ do you think that'll
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.200]   migrate down to the 6 or is that that bump gonna be the issue? They both have
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.680]   the bump and I mean like if we don't like it you can imagine what Johnny I
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.360]   think every time he looks at that thing so if they could have done anything
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.480]   else they would have but cameras like Z-index they really want to have depth
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.440]   to them in order to produce good pictures. Right. So it's why a lot of phones now
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.960]   have bumps on the back. Right. Yeah. Almost all of them do. Yeah. I'm glad to see
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:57.480]   that change too. You hate to see them killings make a choice for style and
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.360]   sacrificing a great feature and optical image stabilization is just such a
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.720]   killer solution for a lot of problems. I'd love to see it migrate down to the 6.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.320]   All right. I think you've pushed me I'm gonna go with the whatever they
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:16.760]   designated the 6s plus the bigger of the 2 and and do we know anything about
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.200]   ordering is it gonna be a constrained supply they say I thought I saw and
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.280]   one analyst say they're making 25 to 40 million of these now. It's so funny
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.200]   though every year is delayed but it's gonna it's not gonna affect release date.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.800]   Well then why do I care? I mean like that makes they're making but but this
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:39.880]   time they're gonna make a lot of them. Yes. I mean every time. Every time but
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.200]   they're making a bunch. They make a ton and then they run out immediately and
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:50.840]   then they make a ton more and that's see also money and that's always how it's
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.600]   been. It's just whatever the number is it's never enough for all the people who
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:02.080]   are waiting in line but I think that this may be nearing the end of that sort
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.760]   of in that a lot of mobile providers are getting rid of the two-year subsidy
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.520]   situation where you could maybe pay it off sooner and then a lot of people who
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:19.720]   are on two-year contracts and subsidizing their phones won't be won't be doing it
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.240]   every year. I think maybe it'll even out a little bit and there will be
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.240]   slightly different demand once anybody that wants to can get one every year as
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.680]   they move to more like lease programs and things like that with is I think it's
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.680]   jump and like new phone forever or whatever it is the T-Mobile. Everybody's
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.920]   doing it now. Sprint's doing it. Verizon T-Mobile AT&T we're still waiting to see
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:46.400]   them drop the contract in the two-year extension but all of them AT&T have
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:52.800]   this you know pay us a little more you get a new phone whenever. So I think I
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:58.360]   think that might change the the initial demand because people will sort of get
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.280]   them whenever they're whenever they can walk in and get one and then it will
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.800]   just sort of be divided up into the people who feel like they have to have
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:11.280]   one zero day and then the people who are waiting you know like I can you know I
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.120]   can wait a month or two till I can just walk in and buy exactly the one that I
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:20.520]   want. It'd be really interesting to see if this new plan T-Mobile and Verizon have
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:25.240]   which is you just pay a flat $15 a month and you'll and then get the new phone if
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:32.200]   this will spur sales of the 6s because I somebody in the chat room
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.600]   positive and I think this might be true that maybe we're entering that iPad
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.280]   phase where people like you Kelly go I don't really need the new phone. I'll
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.480]   kind of keep it as long as I can. On the other hand if it doesn't cost you
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.640]   anything more if you're paying 15 bucks a month anyway maybe you will just always
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.320]   get the new phone. What do you think Renee? I think that's why we're seeing all the
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.760]   carriers say I think Sprint is doing this as well. I'm not sure how to play
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.120]   internationally because they didn't have the contracts to begin with but
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.320]   people like people need phones phones is almost like the one excuse you give
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.200]   yourself to splurge on consumer electronics and it's not just iPhones
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.920]   people want the latest Galaxy phones sometimes to where they want you know
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.400]   some people want the new Nexus it depends on whatever whatever you're
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.840]   like most and I think it skews towards those early adopter those early
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.040]   adopter type personalities Apple's done a lot to kind of discourage that they've
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.160]   made appointments last years you didn't have to wait in line overnight and they've
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.840]   done a lot of things to sort of lessen the hype surrounding it which is kind
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.400]   of odd because you think the hype was beneficial to them in terms of marketing
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.480]   but it turned out not to be a great user experience and with the watches they
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.000]   did that entire sort of try-on period so they're experimenting more but I think
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.280]   they will always be traditional demand and the thing that we pay a lot of
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.120]   attention to getting the new phone but some people like Kelly are on 5s is some
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.240]   were on 5s for us as they've been waiting till now to do the update they're
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.360]   on that two-year or three-year contract or they wanted to make sure they got a
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.360]   lot of years after their phone and they're ready for this one I think Tim
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.960]   cooks at 27 or 22 or 27 percent of people had upgraded already and that's
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.400]   still a massive amount of people left to upgrade this year mm-hmm
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.520]   yeah this also quit you can also ask the question if it's in Apple's best
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.800]   interest to have everybody wanting to buy the phone at the exact same time that
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.480]   if they there was a time when really getting people just super super keyed up
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:18.960]   to be there on the first day to buy the phone that was when when the iPhone
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.640]   before was a really really really huge success now maybe it makes sense for
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.760]   them to say it's not there's no longer our best interest to have most of this so
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.000]   many of the sales we're gonna make made in the first couple weeks if we can get
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.760]   people simply to be think it's okay to wait a month or two or three or four
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.760]   and spread things out so that we don't have to have this you know eight
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:42.160]   container ships where the phones hitting the shores of the exact same week and
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.840]   also make sure that we'll basically be making money off of more money off the
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.960]   phones from quarter to quarter to quarter instead of having a spike and
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.120]   then I haven't explained why we didn't sell quite so many in the first quarter
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.400]   we look at punish for it though they'll be have Apple didn't sell that many on
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.160]   opening week all there weren't line-ups there wasn't a minute they didn't sell
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:05.960]   out whoa just this it's best just to put the dull banana idiot sticker on those
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.960]   four heads then just stop talking to them so we'll do what we're gonna do
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.480]   next week and I should clear this with those of you who'll be around which I
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.960]   don't think Andy you will be is move in fact now you won't be I know Andy move
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:23.440]   via Mac break weekly from its normal slot Tuesday to Wednesday right after the
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.680]   Apple event and then move Windows weekly back to Tuesday not next week but the
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:34.560]   week after right now two weeks hence so we will do live coverage I mean I'm
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:39.480]   just making this up since we haven't seen invites yet 10 a.m. Pacific 1 p.m.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:45.960]   Eastern time at on the ninth of September which is a Wednesday and then
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.560]   immediately after that will do a special Mac break weekly you can help me out a
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:54.120]   lot by committing like the reservation money for like an actual suite for you
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.960]   for Wednesday because that would make sure it would not happen on Wednesday
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:03.760]   and I can still tell yeah right I actually will not be there I mean we were
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:09.880]   going to New York for the IAB up front I think which are some crazy ad thing so
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:14.960]   I won't I this is the first time I've missed an Apple event ever in my whole
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:22.960]   life no wait a minute since the in 2001 iPod announcement I missed that one so
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:28.040]   14 years so I'm sad about that but I'll be listening in while we're we I think
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.640]   we're meeting with Squarespace right about that time so I'll be that kid with
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.880]   the transistor radio and the headphone and going what yeah oh my wow it will
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:41.040]   make a video they're not going out of business not gonna switch to hot tubs
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.640]   they will make another phone I think that's the case I think that's the case I
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.280]   think we can count on it iOS 9 will come out we'll watch OS also come out then
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.960]   yeah they work together so I mean the Apple hasn't said anything but they're
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.200]   so tightly entwined you basically run the watch off the phone so makes a lot
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.080]   of sense and of course we're expecting unusually this time perhaps new iPads
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.480]   I think not not you think not now no not until October I don't think so
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.960]   Petchkowski got it wrong it's hard I mean it's a moving target I know yeah I
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.560]   mean never never predict anything Apple may not know at this point yeah
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:20.560]   I mean to to to the you already have a really heavily packed September event as
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.200]   it is if we just talking about new iPhones and we're just talking about
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:28.000]   watch OS it feels like if they're gonna make a big move with the iPad they're
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.160]   gonna want an entire and an entire event around it maybe not something as big as
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.560]   big as your bibweina but maybe something like town hall size but enough time
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.640]   that they can really unpack this and should and I'm hoping that it will be a
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:46.600]   larger larger iPad I'm hoping that it will be not just here is the new this
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.800]   year's iPad but here is our plan for the next two three or four years of iPad
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.320]   even if they're not explicitly saying that right you should have Apple TV though
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.640]   I mean so that'll be a chocolate that's right that'll be part of it yeah it makes
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.920]   sense that's plenty I really want that to be the one more thing I want it so so
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:08.280]   so badly like gene Munster levels of badly I keep banging the Apple TV drum and
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.240]   and I seem to be but now Jean just you want an Apple television set you're not
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.040]   asking for that yeah no no no no but I feel like I feel like him because I
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.720]   keep going this one's gonna be the one you guys are really really mean at this
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:25.840]   time and then no so I've been waiting like a year and a half to get that to get
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:31.400]   a new Apple TV and I've been waiting since the dub dub keynote last year to
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.400]   get the new Apple TV that will do all of the home kit stuff because I'm a home
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.040]   automation person and I can do all that stuff with my phone and I would really
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.720]   rather be able to do it with an Apple TV because then it might be something I
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.120]   could actually recommend to other people whose idea of a good time is not
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.240]   mucking around with configuration files so that you can unlock things with your
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.320]   phone and make the sprinklers go on at a specific time every day I think it's
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.520]   kind of intriguing that as the Apple TV has been delayed it's given Google an
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:05.800]   opportunity to put out a router that really is gonna be the hub for their
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:12.120]   home automation efforts the on hub router which immediately sold out almost
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:19.800]   instantly sold out for 200 bucks so twice as much as an Apple TV this router is
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:25.720]   ostensibly just a wife it's a very nice Wi-Fi router but in fact has Zigbee built
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:32.960]   into it 802.15.4 has Weave which is Google's Internet of Things networking
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:39.160]   system and Brillo Google's operating system for home automation all built
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.400]   into it so it's kind of a stealth device. Microsoft too is kind of adding I think
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:48.240]   those kinds of features to Xbox but hasn't really hasn't really got there
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.520]   and of course Amazon with the Echo is clearly making a move in that direction
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.680]   they just added smart things integration so it's really interesting to watch as
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:01.520]   the Giants yeah home in on this I was I was disappointed right I saw the
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.880]   picture in the press release before actually started reading about it and I
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.880]   thought I saw what looked to be a speaker grill at the top of it which is
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:13.680]   which is which is actually for their their ultrasonic right I did I had the
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.240]   same reaction which is and I was thinking oh man if I can get Google now
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.380]   like I can get access to Alexa that is the that is the fastest 200 bucks
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:26.800]   that ever spent I have a lot of core 10 on it's so it's so cool everybody's
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.500]   building these little tiny little towers that are always on network
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.400]   computers that will just be standing someplace pretty in your living room
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:38.000]   doing awesome things for you and both Amazon and Google and I guess you could
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.480]   even make this case for Apple are making these devices do something else
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:46.000]   because home automation isn't there yet yeah so it's an excuse to you know oh
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.480]   well I need it I would like a Wi-Fi router that worked so they're really
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.700]   focusing on that but really that's what's I have the Apple tower and I thought I
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.980]   could just leave it out like all those pictures but then you start plugging
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.920]   everything into it yeah it's like that picture of the Mac Pro with 30 things
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:06.740]   attached to it yeah yeah but I've got you know even here as as I scramble to
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:11.420]   unplug and replug back in my my camera I had I had to go and plug my ethernet
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:16.380]   into my Macbook here for my notes on and I just was reminding myself that as
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:22.540]   soon as this this this new Google router comes in I'm going to run I've got
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.680]   copper running through the house but I'm going to use this as an extender Wi-Fi
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.660]   base station from someplace else maybe that's the reason why it doesn't have
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.720]   all the ports of an airport extreme it really is just one use an airport one
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:38.400]   USB port you can run a lot of people will run copper to the living room because
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.140]   they've already got a Roku and they've already got boxes maybe they've done
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:45.880]   that already and if they just use it as an extender for a larger house or even
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.720]   as the primary contact for a small house the fact that you've got this thing that
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.040]   isn't tucked away it's not it's not on a shelf and the least used room of the
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.360]   house it is something you're actually looking at it interacting with that it's
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.040]   it's the ability to have a presence in the house as opposed to simply projecting
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.640]   features into the house that will get people to think hey I've got a lot of
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.880]   Google stuff that I use I've got a lot of Apple stuff and I've got a lot of
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:14.440]   Amazon stuff I would hope unfortunately of course these will all be certainly
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.600]   apples will be proprietary I would guess Amazon's will be too Google's maybe not
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:23.560]   right tree-hull well in the sense that what you really want is what is a hub
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:27.760]   that speaks to all what I would love it to work with home kit as well as I mean
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.800]   you know what I mean like in Android Auto where as long as they support many
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.760]   different protocols you don't care if the device it's if the protocols but you
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.000]   think Apple will do that you think Apple or will Apple create its own
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.160]   protocol but it won't matter because Apple doesn't make accessories all Apple's
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.560]   gonna do is provide home kit so that any provider who wants to like like Elgato
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.960]   can make home kit compatible but they can add Android compatibility to right so
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.000]   it'll be literally like getting the car where Android Auto and CarPlay are just
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.160]   both on it okay that that's reassuring but let me tell you about it yeah I'm
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.440]   sorry go ahead let me tell you about an idea I had that I want to because you
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:05.120]   can write apps for Alexa I want them to add just sort of like a feature called
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.480]   concierge where you can say I will not I will not speak the command because a
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.720]   lot of people are get annoyed when you speak voice commands so I'm gonna say
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:20.280]   hey hey Adrian turn on the turn on the lights in the kitchen or and it will
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:25.080]   come back I'm sorry I don't know how to do that but your Apple TV does and then
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.400]   then Alexa says hey slow-mo turn on the lights upstairs well Navi awesome and it
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.120]   happens that's what I would love to it would be so cool in there now that's
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.880]   the only one need us anymore Andy they'll just be able to get rid of us they can
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:43.960]   just talk amongst themselves on a Tuesday what's all this chatter going on
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:49.800]   downstairs it's a waste of resources eliminate Andy unit what I found out
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.520]   of course was that Google's not making this on hub but a company a Chinese
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.120]   company called TP link is and they're not hiding it there is their front page
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.840]   meet on hub from Google TP link so what I immediately did because I'm in
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.880]   habit I use an airport extreme and what I did is I took the new airport extreme
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.560]   and then tried to extend it with an airport express in the gym and an
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.360]   airport old airport extreme in my office and it's it's a it's it's it worked when
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:18.480]   it works is works great but then it but it but it but it walks out fairly
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.320]   frequently after reboot everything and it's a real pain in the button well
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:28.160]   frankly my wife's killing me over this so I thought well if I'm gonna get the
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.200]   on hub why don't I get some TP link extenders and then I saw that they have
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:39.360]   power line adapters the plug into the wall and then use your grid inside the
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:44.720]   house as Ethernet wiring so I I don't know I'm I'm kind of preparing for
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:51.280]   something that doesn't exist yet my the on hub is like delayed forever but so I
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:56.200]   put I have now an airport extreme in the living room and plugged into it and
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:03.320]   then into the wall is a TP link a power line adapter and then in the gym which
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:08.840]   is maybe a hundred feet away I have the other end of that with its own air with
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.080]   its own Wi-Fi so I have different now I know now I don't have an extra one
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.080]   network all over the place I have three different networks one of my office one
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.680]   in the gym and one in the living room but it does work but boy I feel like it's
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:27.000]   a massive cluge but power line does work not as fast as Ethernet yeah but I'm
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:34.160]   getting 20 megabits up and down and no holes in the wall yeah so you know I was
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.440]   really reluctant to try this stuff and when it first came out years ago I did
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.920]   and it was terrible so I've been kind of reluctant to do it since then but it
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.520]   works fine and it's it boy it was easy couldn't be easy plugging into the wall
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.640]   so anyway I don't know why I brought that I think that things simpler than just
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.120]   running by the bullet and running some copper well that's what I should do is
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:58.000]   put ethernet in every room and it's and it's like if you if if you want to be
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.600]   fancy schmancy about it you can just tack it against the wall and it won't
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.680]   get in the way if you want to do a cable drop assuming you own your own house
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.800]   that's one of the easiest things the world to do because unlike putting an
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.520]   electrical box you don't need a license to do it you just literally just drop
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:18.360]   cable and it works and you can get really nice cover outlets for it it's a it is
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.400]   a massive pain in the butt it's a it's a Saturday afternoon project but once you
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.720]   are in a position where every place you're likely to benefit from high speed
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.720]   internet you can actually just plug into a wall and get it there every time I
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.640]   add new switch to my network it's like why it's like this it's like this
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.720]   situation over here for some reason I used to be able to get good Wi-Fi for
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.720]   the laptops I've always had copper for the for the podcasting gear but for some
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:47.800]   reason now Wi-Fi just will not work and I've had to like sort of steal ethernet
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:52.280]   from another computer I've got over there to run to the table and just like
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.560]   every other room I've ever done that before it's like if I just spend three
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:00.120]   hours solving this problem by putting more copper into this room that problem
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:05.400]   goes away forever and so I think that a lot of people especially as more people
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.480]   who are renting in their 20s become people who own houses in their late 20s
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.200]   and early 30s I think we're gonna see a lot more people just saying screw it we're
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.600]   gonna have cat six everywhere yes certainly if you're building or you're
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.720]   renovating the smart thing to do be put conduit in the wall and one of the
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.340]   wires and they should certainly be cat six what I'd love to see is if you
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:29.240]   they're in an Apple TV or in a future airport extreme update is some sort of
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.720]   near line because Apple's doing a lot of near line stuff now it'd be super great
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.040]   if they made as part of their router system something that allowed you to
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.880]   stage your iCloud backups locally even keeping cryptid copies locally something
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.520]   that pulls down iOS updates watch updates OS 10 updates and make some
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.200]   available to all the machines they don't have to update all of them
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.480]   separately anymore there's just so many interesting things they can do once
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.080]   they have if they're not afraid to make these devices real devices and have that
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.720]   sort of point I don't know if you want to put every one of them into an Apple TV
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.120]   because maybe that's a $300 Apple TV box but to at least have some boxes
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.600]   available that would do that kind of stuff I think it'd be great yeah and also
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:06.160]   it's the airport extreme is still when the easier routers to set up and configure
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:11.160]   and administrate but it's still easy compared to networking gear it's it's
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.880]   not really easy compared to like consumer gear so I'm really looking forward to
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.200]   an update to the software or to the hardware itself in which it really
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.280]   becomes one of these things where you open an app and I love I love the the
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:28.120]   screenshots you see of the phone apps for on hub somebody says the network
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.720]   looks good you've got six six devices connected and here's what they look like
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:37.600]   you there's still if if and if you have a company with the resources of Apple or
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.240]   Google saying that okay I see you've got an Xbox do you want this Xbox to be
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.400]   accessible from outside the network okay I know I've also I also know what kind
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.840]   of firehouse router you have right now I know how to configure this give me 10
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.720]   seconds I'll have it going for you which is not something that anything can do
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.640]   right now that would be beautiful it's the kind of thing you expect Apple to do
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:02.240]   although it's kind of hard for Apple there's so many ways they could improve
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.840]   life to pick one it's not it's not something it's not something you can have
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.760]   people dancing to in a commercial but it's it's definitely within their their
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:16.520]   daily wick of let's just make life suck suck not so much for people who use our
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:21.800]   products yeah that's the thing that is making me so excited about the automation
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:27.360]   piece of an Apple TV is because I really want to be able to extend this to other
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.880]   people who are not people who like to spend all their time rejigging stuff on
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.280]   a network so that's why I keep waiting is because I want there to be a good
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.480]   customer experience so if Google can take a crack at it with on hub and get
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.000]   something decent going that's great because then it means Apple has to try
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.360]   and compete with an existing decent user experience that's already out there
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:53.200]   like individually you can do good if you only want hu lights you can do pretty
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.560]   well with automation if you only want we most which is but as soon as you want
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.000]   to have lights and things that are plugged in you're kind of out of luck
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.800]   because you want everything to communicate in one place and that's just
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:07.680]   not gonna happen at least not anytime soon so that's why I'm super excited
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.920]   about having all this happen is because I really want to be able to offer that
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.400]   good experience to other people because now that my stuff is working I really
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.360]   enjoy it I like that when I come home a light comes on if it's dark no matter
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.560]   how long I've been gone I come home and and and when I walk into the door from
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:28.680]   the garage there's lights on for me and I like that I don't have to worry about
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.760]   the sprinklers and that the sprinkler brain is smart enough to know if it
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.920]   rained yesterday that it doesn't have to run the sprinklers today and I can check
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.080]   at any point and find out if the sprinklers are running and I like that I
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.760]   have the alarm system all set up and it you know it's automating notifications
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.920]   to my phone these are all wonderful things but I don't have the patience to
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:53.520]   do tech support for any member of my family to help them get set up with this
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:59.360]   sort of situation and once it's working it's really awesome but I don't have the
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:04.480]   resources to help anybody else do this until something happens on the
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.000]   administration end of it so that's the thing that I've been waiting for that's
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.240]   why I was so excited to see HomeKit and then nothing so I really hope that
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.080]   I'm super excited about the security because like the idea of putting after
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.840]   the Chrysler hack and all these other hacks the idea of just having all these
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.760]   open access points in my house is chilling but yesterday there was a story
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.320]   about a refrigerator that got hacked for Gmail credentials and I almost decided
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:31.120]   to go battle a minute a refrigerator got hacked for gmail
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.360]   refrigerators were hacked and people were managed to retrieve the email
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.480]   credentials from them I guess they would email you if your milk was low or
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.120]   something holy let you take it would let you journal from your refrigerator so
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.840]   you needed your but I want my kitchen to be battle star like I just one note
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.760]   my kitchen's gonna be totally air gapped but I like that all these new
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.640]   Wi-Fi chips are becoming secure and they they're gonna transit your
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.640]   credentials securely and that that's gonna be more important when like your
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:32:00.360]   door locks are online Wow that's probably I don't have one it's a sad
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.480]   story I was gonna say it's a funny story but I don't have lost in your belly I'm
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.520]   very concerned no no I don't have I don't have smart locks I don't have
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.880]   anything you can run with your phone because I've seen just enough stuff about
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:21.200]   how someone with less than than pure intentions could possibly gain access to
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.440]   my house if I'm not around or even if I am which is kind of worse and I don't
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.840]   want that to happen so that's why I don't have that's why I don't have those
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.760]   is because I'm not I don't feel like I'm at the point where those are secure
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:41.000]   enough that they are actually security and not just granting someone access it
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.360]   feels like there's kind of a natural evolution of things like these because
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:49.360]   first you don't use it because you use to you so you so or surmise correctly
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:53.280]   that this is still very very new and it hasn't been really fail failure proof
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:58.240]   yet for all kinds of definitions of failure proof then you use it because
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.320]   you have been judicious and you understand how it works and you believe
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.840]   in how it works but then you get to the dangerous phase three in which you
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:08.920]   simply trust it to work and that's when things start to fail when you decide
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:12.720]   that yeah I finally I'm glad I waited five years to get this smart lock and
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.680]   then one year after that suddenly everything there there there there
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.920]   are raccoons inside your house because they figured out there's a car fob you
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.400]   can get on Alibaba that is tuned to the wrong frequency and you didn't turn
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.840]   off something you're supposed to turn off when you configured it because you
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:34.440]   simply trusted it to work right let's take a break come back talk some more
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:40.240]   with this fabulous group Kelly Guimant from Mac Observer she is the Mac
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:45.440]   Observer observing a Mac right now I bet she's forbidden to interfere she is
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:53.120]   only an observer are you wearing you and blue also from imore.com he's not an
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.360]   observer he's got his hands right in it by the way congratulations on the new
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:01.440]   book oh thank you Apple music so any call well a lot of it but it's by the
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.800]   editors of imore and you could find it on his books really nice beautiful well
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:12.740]   thank you and mr. Andy Naco from the Chicago Sun Times who you didn't think I
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:20.480]   noticed but moments ago briefly held up a brand new camera that I don't know if
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:26.920]   you want to talk about or not I'm under review embargo this is that I I cannot
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:32.080]   say anything about how well it works but this is they really good image excuse
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.980]   me well engineer supposedly upgrade where this pops out and you can put this
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:42.020]   on your phone and now it becomes a really good image sensor much higher
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:46.240]   quality image sensor than what's on the camera and an application is supposed to
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:51.160]   activate and stuff like that so my the embargo lifts in about a week so I can
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:57.680]   if Alex Alex is on the show next week we can both race to get this as as the
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:02.200]   things that we get to talk about it's pretty interesting and I think they'll be
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:07.760]   getting one to go with my new iPhone they say the box the box says I still
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:12.200]   unpacked it here now that the again I'm not making any comments whatsoever but
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:17.940]   the box right on the box it says professional quality connected camera so
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:23.140]   I'm going I'm going to the Boston Public Library this week I'm going to be taking
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:27.940]   pictures of squirrels with it we'll see how professional it is it's it's a it's
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:31.700]   a cool lot and it's a nice item it's it also makes you feel like a spy because
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:35.580]   you've got I know it's cool inside your house let me play with it a little bit
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:41.640]   I was I am not with the NBA I was duly impressed and I can say that I don't
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:47.040]   think that's a bad thing to say but more to come next week perhaps our show
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:54.840]   today brought to you by my drinking horn this episode of Mac Rakes brought to
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:00.480]   you by Jack threads calm stop dealing with the hassle of crowds and malls Jack
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.400]   threads offer stylish clothing without being intimidating and a stress-free
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:09.040]   online shopping experience for men I got some I forgot to wear my Jack threads
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:14.360]   today got some really great Jack threads though stuff that's on the site
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:19.700]   favorite brands you know vans and under armor and Levi's and more also new
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:24.740]   brands you might never have heard of they're all curated by a really talented
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:30.440]   editorial team looking for classics like a denim shirt to edgy graphic tees you
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.000]   you can get some information if you look at the website about why you might
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.720]   want to buy an item and what you might want to wear with it they even have
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:41.720]   style tips from Jill and Jill's a sweetheart she she steered me away from some
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.960]   of those skinny jeans which I appreciate Jill thank you and towards
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:50.160]   something with a little bit looser fit you can also cross-reference items based
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.480]   on other shop reviews it's really social it's fun purchases and saves you know

[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:55.040]   impression when he has never had a beer before ever ever ever it's been all
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.960]   hard liquor of course you know he's in Boulder so he's probably yeah okay well

[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:55.440]   don't know it was because you were it was a safety thing you know when I went I
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:01.600]   went out to visit Henry last year he is the frat he's in has a father's Sunday
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:10.080]   which was quite quite an eye opener and among the other activities planned for
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:17.120]   the father's Sunday was a visit to the Coors brewery we did have a good time
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:21.120]   there but they were very careful to keep the younger members of the frat from
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:25.400]   partaking mother daughter Diego's to Budweiser it's probably very healthy for
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:29.600]   both the father and the son to have reciprocal incriminating Instagram
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:36.440]   pictures okay we're not gonna tell anybody about this now remember this
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:44.960]   we took a tour of historic public libraries in the Boulder Denver area
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:50.240]   yes oh look the flat irons let's take a look at the geology of the red rocks
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:55.000]   aren't those flat iron scourges by the way in oh man it's like it's it's like
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   painted backdrop so those those PBS like painting tour chorels they had it
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.320]   exactly right just and one stripe and it's yeah after going there every
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:09.720]   year it's like I keep meeting to get hike a little closer but I never get
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.560]   there because they are of course way up there and you need to be in shape but
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:17.680]   yeah what a backdrop for what what a backdrop for having coffee and pastry on
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:22.560]   a rooftop building with your computer he's he's loving it by the way but I
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.520]   think he's gonna I'm hoping he's gonna come back to California but he is really
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:29.800]   loving junior year at CU Boulder
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:37.880]   technology stocks stocks in general not so happy yesterday I guess fallout from
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:44.160]   the Chinese collab size that maybe that's too strong a word bump bumpy road
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:50.520]   kerfuffle uncertainty but boy buying Apple came back pretty fast although
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:55.880]   still not back to the levels it was at before it didn't sell as many iPhones as
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:03.200]   it should have or something some insane thing Jim Tim Cook sent an email to Jim
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:09.440]   Kramer and and people are widely crediting this email with the bounce back
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:16.280]   Apple regained eighty billion dollars in market value the stock was down 10%
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:25.160]   following the black Monday so Tim sent a note along to Jim Kramer now let me
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:35.400]   think if you want to get the hey jam not just what war Eagle and by the way he
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:40.600]   wrote I get updates on our performance in China every wait wait I get updates on
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:45.360]   our performance in China every day including this morning and I could tell
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.800]   you we've continued to experience strong growth for our business in China
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:54.120]   through July and August growth in iPhone this is basically a pitch to why you
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.660]   know you shouldn't punish Apple for China's failings growth in iPhone
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:01.000]   activations have actually accelerated over the past few weeks and we had the
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.720]   best performance of the year for the App Store in China during the last two
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:10.440]   weeks Apple's share price which had opened below 100 bucks for the first time
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:18.120]   since October back up to 106 bucks yeah I guess Jim Kramer must have mentioned
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:22.040]   it I don't know when it showed mad money perhaps and it got a lot of play around
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:26.720]   the Internet yeah he was on the today show yesterday morning and read the email
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.920]   said I've spoken with Tim Kirk and Tim Cook told me blah blah blah blah
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:36.600]   little bit of publicity Tim's chill Jim that's it that's exactly that's exactly
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:40.960]   why you do that no if you if you if you have anything to say the starts as well
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:45.360]   like talk to Tim cook Tim Cook reached out to me today and said this to me
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:48.800]   guess what you're gonna you don't you don't have to go on after the cooking
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.800]   segment you will go on like in the first half hour yeah and so it's yeah it's
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:56.960]   worked out well for Apple well that well for Jim and it was so bananas yesterday
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:02.600]   that the today show so on the on the west coast we usually just get a
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.920]   rebroadcast of whatever they did in the morning on the east coast so it's not
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:13.000]   really live but sometimes was that a cat a dog a small rodent a ferret what
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.560]   was that it was something something I'm not sure what jump off my desk do you have
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:26.200]   cats no oh dear I'm doing it it's the raccoons buying keyless car fobs on
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:31.080]   Alibaba they get into places you got snacks they're gonna find him
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:36.560]   you should walk on that door I'll help you install it okay you're in on the
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:40.280]   today show yesterday when when it was broadcast here if something is happening
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:44.480]   they make them stay in the studio and do it again that you know it's 7 a.m. on the
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:48.320]   west coast interesting is what you hear and so that means that they're doing
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.840]   live again now they we usually like flip back and forth between like the the
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:55.360]   stuff they already had scheduled and and something new but yeah yesterday
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:00.200]   morning we got a second broadcast we got we got a live broadcast as well
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.920]   talking about what was going on with the stock market what it was crazy and
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:09.840]   yet and Jim Kramer was like within the first five minutes of the show no it's
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:15.080]   okay on so like five or ten minutes after seven yesterday morning was yeah
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:21.320]   was him on NBC going yeah so it turns out you know I chatted with Tim Cook
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.360]   my close personal friend
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:28.440]   apparently he may he may have him cook and said look I'm covering this I have
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.960]   anything to weigh in I need to be on the air by nine and then Tim cook up back
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.840]   to him around 8 a.m. which probably means like three or four hours after he woke
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:39.320]   up that morning right and sent him that statement yeah
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:45.560]   I'm not being not me isn't really isn't really riser this is I'm not even
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:48.360]   joking this this is not the first time that he's been on top of something like
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:52.960]   he must have been up since four in the morning his time are there SEC regulations
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.440]   about what a CEO of a company can say apparently this fall this is within the
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:01.320]   this is an issue he was reiterating the guidance that they provided like nothing
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.760]   he said deviated in the guidance that they provided previously for the
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:10.960]   quarter yeah because otherwise it would be you could charge him with insider
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:17.120]   training because he's telling a stock broker Jim Kramer some inside information
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.560]   about the company but because it's only and he obviously got legal counsel
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.880]   before he emailed them but I don't know I stay I stay out of this because I don't
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:28.360]   understand I don't understand a lot I don't understand business all even
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:33.440]   last but right I'm just just as an idiot I'm asking but if he is talking to a
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:37.160]   member of the press isn't he - isn't he making that outside information available
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:41.960]   to everybody that's an interesting question it was a private communication
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:46.280]   so it was up to Kramer to make it public please listen at it for this show like
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:50.000]   he asked for a comment for the show Kramer could have acted upon it privately
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.160]   right that that would ride it I got I got legal advice about 15 or 20 years ago
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:59.400]   about like what I can what I can and cannot should or should not do and one of
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:03.520]   the things was simply that if you can provide a piece of a link or piece of
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:07.960]   paper for the decision that you made that says was available to everybody
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:12.200]   right maybe it won't be a big problem but it will still be a problem but I
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:16.600]   can't imagine that being provided as a as a newsman a piece of information to
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:21.120]   share to the world that's inside yeah as I as I well he's a traitor to and that but
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.920]   as I okay I would agree with I don't understand how that works I would hasten
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:31.400]   I know well he's had some problems in the past as a I agree with you Andy I know
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.640]   nothing about this stuff I'm just thinking foolishly perhaps applying
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:43.400]   common sense to so if there's if there are common sense in the market we
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:48.000]   wouldn't see we wouldn't see Apple like stock stock dipping at any reason for a
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   lot of reasons why Dwight ever dips that's that's the reason why I realized
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.880]   that I don't understand anything that's why I know my text I don't want to go
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:48:00.800]   anywhere near this stuff Apple's going to perhaps be going to the Supreme Court
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.320]   Samsung says we don't like this billion-dollar judgment a judge of which later
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:09.280]   was reduced of course to just a just a few hundred million dollars Samsung
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.760]   still doesn't want to pay it that's that verdict that says that Samsung
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:18.400]   violated Apple's iPhone patents of the jury verdict so in court papers filed
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:25.000]   this week Samsung agreed or not agreed said they would fight it to the Supreme
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:31.360]   Court the questions present issues of enormous importance to patent litigation
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:36.840]   in the scope of innovation especially in high-tech industries the reason they
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:41.200]   wrote this letters to say hey judge can we hold off on paying you the hundreds
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:45.920]   of millions of dollars until after we appeal to the Supreme Court it was last
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:50.540]   week the US federal circuit court of appeals rejected Samsung's request to
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:54.440]   reconsider the ruling I pay for all these new galaxy note five stylists is
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:49:01.120]   come on we got some expenses coming up we're gonna have to fix a lot of phones
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:06.520]   you tried talking about that ours Technica I think it was an article that was
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:09.760]   who wrote it I think it was ours I can't remember that said that you can jam
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:15.520]   this stylus back in and you can it goes in very this is backwards goes in
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:18.640]   like a different address that I had like a couple days ago he told people not to
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:22.240]   do this but they didn't yeah they didn't but Samsung issued a statement now which
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:26.980]   is what they say people they should read the manual you're holding it wrong
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:30.720]   you're inserting it wrong we highly recommend our galaxy note five users
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.360]   follow the instructions in the user's guide to ensure they do not experience
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:36.960]   such an unexpected scenario caused by reinserting the S pin in the other way
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:43.240]   around you're inserting it wrong yes so what happens but the truth is very easy
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:48.640]   to do that oh I just did it oh crap Leo and that's their official stances
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:55.120]   RTFM it's not it does you seriously oh did you just do it you wrote
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:59.480]   withdrawal this dial it it it I thought because it went in so easily I thought
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:03.040]   oh this isn't gonna be a problem to get it out like the clippers closed down on
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:07.480]   it apparently they did and now you're not supposed to rip it out you're
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:11.360]   supposed to gently yes no no I can do that don't get those players anywhere
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:16.480]   near it oh my god I believe I just did that you answered this is a hammer I
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:22.360]   pushed in the whole rest of the way no I haven't damaged the thing yet the
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.760]   damage occurs because it's still loosely in there the damage occurs when
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.760]   you so something closed on it right yeah apparently there's some sort of
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:32.600]   gripper inside at least that's from the story is there is I feel like it's
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:36.720]   gripped it and that and the and the problem is that if you take if you if you
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:40.720]   pull it out in an in judicious fashion that way then it will it won't break
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:45.480]   the phone it will just damage the sensor that the thing uses to just detect
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:49.240]   whether this the stylus is inside the holder or not so that you'll lose that
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:53.080]   you will lose that cool feature where it's you dislodge it you pull it out it's
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:56.760]   ready to take don't come at me with tools please I think this what I was
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.320]   anyway what it was like black rubber and you tell people today and it's a
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:05.220]   silly or antenna yeah just hold the phone upside down it'll look like
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:14.980]   that's the galaxy the old school I thought that it would be harder to do I
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:21.300]   thought I should have read that it's the manual I thought that oh at some point
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:25.020]   it will give me some resistance then I'll push on it and that's when I'll be in
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:29.580]   trouble but in fact it just loosely slid in and then I tried to retract it
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:33.420]   illustrates a lot though so it is a problem you know what it is a
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:38.100]   Samsung claiming that read the manual otherwise you know this is gonna happen
[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.320]   you like if there's no resistance whatsoever it just seems like it would
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:45.300]   be very easy to make that mistake yeah cuz you're not even looking gosh darn
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:50.180]   it Leo it's gonna be okay right because you can take it to the genius bar oh
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:56.940]   the smarty pants bar smarty pants bar yeah I'm always pleased when like
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:00.780]   Samsung seems to be learning stuff like the galaxy s6 it's with nice is
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:04.220]   only made in a while but it's like I wish that you would there's somebody you
[00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:08.460]   need to hire or fire at that company that says well that was really too easy
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:12.700]   it's that's that's that's the sort of thing that a higher life form would not
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:16.980]   design a phone that way that's what I'm saying somebody just like tested first
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:20.220]   put a twizzler in see what happened somebody didn't really think about it
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:26.140]   so what's happened is the top is is is now trapped inside a some sort and it's
[00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:30.540]   still you can see it's still loose in fact every time I do this the buzzer goes
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:34.300]   off that I've removed the pen so it's it's it's on the sensor there
[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:39.580]   something oh my gosh I'm sure I'm sure that if you've got an appropriate
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:42.460]   spudger you could easily you could you could slide it out yeah I need a
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:46.380]   spudger so definitely so I was poo-pooing this story because I thought well
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:51.380]   you'd have to be a moron
[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:58.860]   sorry the joke the joke was right there I had to do it
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:04.380]   they're not a moron this is a badly designed properly you don't I was I was
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:07.940]   I was because I love this I love this phone but boy I guess I won't be using
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:12.380]   it much anymore I guess I could pull it out I could pull it out really hard but
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:18.140]   it will just it will break the sensor yeah and the sensors not super important
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:22.220]   but it's kind of important like you want the sensor because that's the thing
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:25.820]   that first lets you draw on it when it phones off and you knew what you were
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:28.500]   doing Leo and you got stuck I mean imagine just someone not paying attention
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:33.420]   what if you like uns like sort of like unscrew it as you take it out if you
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:37.180]   rotate it does not make it less bad is there is there a narrow wound right now
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:42.180]   where's the manual there's no manual this didn't come with a manual there's
[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:46.780]   like a booklet Samsung said to read it you don't you don't have to fix it right
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:52.100]   now Leo get get get get one good drinking you get nice and mellow and
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:56.620]   relaxed this is great I need to do is get maybe some KY jelly or something and
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:54:04.620]   also show title I think the title I didn't believe I did that I even knew you
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:08.860]   knew but I didn't know but I thought that they will be harder that was very
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:14.020]   loosely going in there was nothing I thought it would be harder all I need
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:20.460]   some KY jelly I put it I inserted it wrong yeah you insert it wrong right now
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:30.060]   I'm sorry this is so so so Renee are you just are you just like with your free
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:33.980]   hand like writing an I'm more calm about this as well this is still Nick
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:38.500]   is a pro-man to my central I have to deal with this I can't I'll just want to
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:44.740]   actually actively sad because I like this fun all right I know and it's a
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:49.580]   stupid and by the way it cost me almost $900 but can you imagine Apple if they
[00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:52.900]   made the Apple watch and you slid one of the the buckles in wrong if it just got
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:55.460]   stuck halfway there and you can never get it out again like they've got it just
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:59.460]   got to just test these things they had is this capacity way that that I mean
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:03.620]   that is a good comparison because you know the styluses on the iPhone are oh
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:07.700]   wait a minute they don't have the problem Andy they didn't stop the
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:12.420]   problem at the end of the cycle this is not the typical I guess I guess what I
[00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:16.580]   should do now is figure out how to take the whole thing apart yeah because I
[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:21.420]   damaged anything yet the answer said posted a is there a fix I don't know I
[00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:25.820]   don't know is maybe I fix it has a later tonight on all and all about Andrew
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:33.180]   we'll use your phone as a cautionary tale I am so bummed out I'm so sorry
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:38.020]   is it within 14 days can you just exchange it it is oh hey hey I just
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:44.300]   bring it back to 18 I got a problem hates with the 14 day with my life was
[00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.980]   I all right I'll go into the 18 yeah I would I would definitely I would
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:53.300]   definitely say dude yes dude I can't what happened can't stylus and you'll say
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:57.220]   oh yeah we heard about that on Android Central you put it in wrong did you read
[00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:04.700]   the manual sir what manual I have to bring this to 18 to after the show and
[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:09.700]   you're gonna wait well I'll be standing there like this with a stylus coming out
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:13.980]   of you want to work out to write on another galaxy note that's the brilliant
[00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:21.780]   plan you end up with a really big stylus plus stylus does this count as
[00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:27.660]   intentional like damage like I broke like I broke it no this is accident you
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:32.860]   but they're watching YouTube you're right this should not happen I we the three
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:37.260]   of us are willing to swear you were taking great care of that style I didn't
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:44.060]   I just was putting it I not this is not your fault there there are people to
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:48.820]   blame for that none of them are at this table Leo just tell them that tell them
[00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:56.860]   the antenna is falling out you know the antenna is falling out I don't know and
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:08.020]   it doesn't seem to stay in when I was a million to one shot doc yes this is the
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:12.380]   answer we have a good we have a good plan for you I wonder okay I'll report
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:16.340]   back with it no don't come at me with tools I'm telling you I'm going to AT&T
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:21.620]   unless you're willing to take this to AT&T it's staying right there and I'm
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:26.540]   not touching it with no I fix it's but your kid it doesn't really seriously
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:30.740]   Jason this is not put it's gonna be a natural here you Leo and right now
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:36.780]   they're settling on Penn Gazzi yes after stylus gate Penn gate and now it's on
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:41.700]   Penn Gazzi and Brad Mullen has admitted defeat with me we wipe it with a cloth
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:49.740]   holy cow mankind is born to trouble just as surely as a spark why isn't this
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:55.940]   class action like well does it happen to a lot of people I don't know it will
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:58:00.220]   be a battery was it the iPod battery was a class action thing because I got a new
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:04.580]   iPod out of it Apple's doing a Apple bringing back phones that have a camera
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:07.940]   problem so hopefully Samsung brings back phones that have a stuck style or I
[00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:11.660]   guess all of them have this number don't look at this and say I can fix it you
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:15.940]   can't I'm so come here come here Burke is Burke is our repair guy can fix
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:19.900]   anything but you see how loose it is and then when it comes right there it's
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:24.940]   there's something it's no no I'm taking it AT&T I don't want to yeah he's gonna
[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:28.820]   take the AT&T guys is what it looks like you slid something in there sir and I
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:32.700]   ventured against that you aren't the only person that's gonna be taking the
[00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:36.900]   note five back for this very I swear to God I thought this story was link bait
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:41.460]   was spurious come on who's gonna put it in backwards you'd have to force it and
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:45.060]   then of course it would be stuck no it slides in really I mean there's no
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:51.260]   resistance until there is when you try to remove it design should have caught
[00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:54.460]   this in some way they should have built in some sort of mechanism that
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:58.620]   prevents it from sliding in backwards especially results in such an easy
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:02.100]   locking in this way it would have been easy that's it that's a design issue
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:06.540]   well you can't do it twice Jason I mean we'll never can withdraw this pen show
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:14.660]   this fall be seen by divine providence
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:22.340]   but a lowly stable boy surely he cannot agree with you ever was Leo was the note
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:29.780]   five-year pick for today home award I'm supposed to review it for you by oh it was
[00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:33.620]   gonna be a well you know wait a minute
[00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:41.940]   okay if AT&T will not exchange it then Burke I will give you an opportunity to
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:47.820]   attempt to work your wily ways upon it I like somebody in the chat room said put
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:52.020]   a straw although I mean there's a little air gap you could put a little straw
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:56.660]   around that you found something small enough oh and and then she has a she's
[00:59:56.660 --> 01:00:01.460]   can I but can I tell you that's not a bad idea Jason why do you keep coming at
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:07.700]   me with crap you know when I when I broke my iPhone 5 in the first week it was
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:12.460]   also I hated that I broke it but was also an opportunity to say okay let's see
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:16.980]   how good customer service is no I always this is a great opportunity for you to
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:21.740]   bring it in explain what happened honestly and then to see if AT&T/Samsung
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:26.260]   besides be awesome yeah well or at least acknowledge that okay yeah we kind of
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:31.660]   we could they they filled it to his review unit I did it to the phone that I
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:37.580]   spent 850 bucks on from AT&T and extend my contract for two years we had a
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.780]   bunch of people in the forum we had a bunch of people in forums we had it done
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:44.020]   that's how we found out about it so it's not unusual no they weren't paying
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:48.100]   attention this would be easy to do like it works yeah it would be easy to do
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:52.900]   yeah Jim in the chat room has a good idea which is pull the stylus out and let
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:57.380]   it be broken yeah and then go to AT&T and just it's not recognizing I'll wait
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:01.140]   till they refuse me for this one I guarantee you when I go to the AT&T
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:04.740]   they know me at the AT&T I spent a little bit of time there watching us now
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:08.300]   they're probably watching that that was true when I dunked my iPhone in the
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:16.220]   water and brought it to the Apple Store up here in Santa Rosa I was I'm glad to
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:20.700]   I was honest I said yeah you know I dunked it in a glass of water and he said
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:25.860]   yeah I know I saw you do it so it's good I was honest because I if I'd said I
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:29.300]   don't know what happened he was said come on Leah
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:36.380]   oh my gosh hmm this is a problem this is not an insignificant problem I now
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:40.980]   acknowledge this is not link bait this is it this is not an insignificant problem
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:46.940]   kind of a big issue all right let's say let's take a break stop laughing at me
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:52.580]   Kelly Leo report the struggle is real the struggle really is it's not easy being
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:58.180]   geek I must leo always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:03.700]   what do you think Sam's a shot well Samsung issue special removal tools for
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:08.020]   this how are they gonna fix this send someone to every how they've got to do
[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:13.180]   something about this software enhancement not an easy thing they'll just able to
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:18.380]   let me look like on all right let us take a break we're gonna come back with
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:25.100]   more Renee and Andy and Kelly and me and I'm the moron in the group our show
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:29.540]   today brought to you by wealth front you kind of this is an interesting time to
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:34.700]   talk about the stock market right investments however regardless in fact
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.420]   that you see I see a lot of articles now saying hey don't freak out don't
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:41.060]   panic remember you're in the stock market for the long haul and there is no
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:45.680]   better place historically year over year for the last hundred years to put your
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.060]   money then the stock market you're certainly not gonna put it in a savings
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:53.300]   account and in fact I think you know what is it what is the current interest
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:57.620]   rate a savings account I think I saw a quarter of one percent I think you can do
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:02.060]   better you should be investing your money for your families financial health
[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:06.020]   for your retirement or just you know maybe to buy a house but you're wondering
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:10.580]   how do I do it especially in this tough environment well I could tell you
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:14.540]   wealth front now there are a few reasons why you want to go with wealth front

[01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:27.340]   time to start when the markets down is when you want to start putting money

[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.620]   about your risk tolerance your time frame and all of that and then they will
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:42.100]   generate a portfolio for you. Now here's the cool thing about wealth front this
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:48.100]   is not a human this is this is a computer trading program that is very well
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:52.140]   designed to optimize your investment for the best risk adjusted return
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:58.460]   customizing it specifically for your needs your your desires and they do
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:02.140]   things that really humans can't do very well like tax loss harvesting and
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:07.460]   direct indexing so you'll optimize your after tax returns lower your tax bill
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:12.100]   whether this is for a personal or a joint account or a retirement account

[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:20.500]   talking day trading this is long-term holds you know exactly what they're
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.660]   doing they're transparent they're accessible and this is what I love about
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:29.580]   it the fees are really low you know a human advisor will charge between one
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:33.180]   and three percent of what you have under management that doesn't include hidden
[01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:38.020]   fees for transactions and charges wealth front by the way the investors at
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:42.420]   wealth front are the investments are based on these two of these books one of
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:46.220]   which I read a few years ago and blew me away a random walk down Wall Street I
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:50.220]   don't know how you pronounce Burton's last name Burton Melon keel but he's
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:55.340]   one of the principles at wealth front the other winning the losers game by
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:05:00.820]   Charles Ellis these these guys are really smart and they have crafted a very
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:05.260]   sophisticated way to do it at a ridiculously low price and that's very
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:08.740]   important in your investment you're you can you know if you're talking one to
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:11.180]   three percent of what you have under management that could eat all your
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:17.420]   returns at wealth front you pay one quarter of one percent a year 25 basis

[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:07.700]   stock it's good it does come with the stylist how you use logic pro X yes yes
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:15.100]   who doesn't me me neither my son is a like massive logic pro fan and this is
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:19.060]   one of the really premier programs in the world for a very affordable price what
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:22.660]   is it 200 bucks yeah and you keep getting free updates which is amazing and the
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:31.220]   new update allows alchemy integration so Apple acquired camel audio very popular
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:35.860]   effect and plug-in maker they do the alchemy software alchemy is I actually
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:43.260]   bought Henry alchemy some years ago but now you'll get it automatically if you
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:48.580]   use logic pro X or main stage I don't know what main stages isn't main stage
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:52.900]   this like the audio component I'm a I'm totally making performance oh you know
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:56.620]   what it's the performance component of logic that's what it is it's an interface
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:02.140]   for performance right so anyway I don't know what this means but I do know that
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:08.380]   it Henry is excited anybody uses logic pro should be alchemy is awesome it's
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:17.460]   very sophisticated since with over 3,000 presets great performance controls
[01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:21.500]   pretty nice stuff waiting for Jason Snell tell me how to use it to make the
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:26.780]   podcast better does he use logic for the podcast yeah he converted me he and
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:30.100]   Dave whiskers converted me to using logic for different reasons Jason does
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:32.900]   strip silence so he takes out all the unnecessary stuff just see the bits of
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:38.420]   dialogue and it makes it easy to align multiple track editing very nice one
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:42.380]   ninety nine ninety nine for logic pro X another 30 bucks for main stage three
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:49.260]   logic remote is free and if you have any of those you will get the update pretty
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:53.060]   sweet that really makes it a good deal did you see the New York Times had an
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:09:00.740]   incredible piece of video now don't get it don't don't don't give me a hard time
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:09.020]   on this Justin Bieber and Diplo and Skrillex apparently Canadian they're
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:17.780]   all Canadian that's neat collaborated on Justin's big hit Justin and and the
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:21.260]   New York Times have made a incredible I would say this is one of the best
[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:27.900]   videos I've ever seen about creating a song call Justin Bieber to be able to
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:32.180]   be able to blow and Skrillex make a hit but they interview Bieber Diplo and
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:37.180]   Skrillex and they show them working and I know I'm not sure I can't really tell
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:40.740]   but Skrillex is clearly using a Mac and I don't know what the is that logic it
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:47.100]   might be that he's playing live Ableton live for Ableton yeah that just
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:50.940]   glancing out Jason how of course what do you use just glancing at it it looked
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:55.140]   like Ableton live that I could be wrong I use Pro Tools primarily but I've
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:59.660]   used crazy talk I've used logic plenty no though not in the past few years I've
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:07.020]   used Ableton live listen to a Skrillex he's so there's a sound in this song
[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:12.580]   listen to this this is amazing how he made it
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:19.060]   it's Bieber's voice I think maybe it's a little bit here yeah here's a little
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:22.620]   bit what is that is that able to
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:28.980]   to quickly flash it's said live next to the Apple menu yeah it's live able to
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:35.700]   do the most so we took this distorted sounds rebalance again so it sounds
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:42.220]   worse almost and then what they've done on the side of the video which I love
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:47.060]   is kind of a guitar hero style yeah waveform rolling wave like a simplified
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:50.700]   waveform yeah well on the actually that's like a pitched yeah almost
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:55.380]   destroy a sound so many was this posted to connect lose it find it is New York
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:59.900]   Times art section just get went up this morning it's amazing I watched the
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:03.660]   whole eight-minute video it's a thread it's a story of how a song got made in
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:07.420]   the times is I need to watch this I love this kind of stuff I can watch this
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:11.380]   together for seven yeah yeah but it still has the elements of some and that
[01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:14.940]   courses of the Mac it plays quite a featured role in it's the only computer
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:19.620]   they show and they talk a lot about how they did it even even if it is Justin
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:27.500]   you know welcome I'm not a fan but it's a great song yeah and look what they're
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:32.500]   doing here with a video though the way they're showing the music on screen and
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:38.180]   this kind of great visualization there have been a clubs like a real kind of
[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:44.340]   say it's I admire the fact that it's so weird it's a well I kind of did a thought
[01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:48.460]   experiment where I took those out and it would be a less much less interesting
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:52.700]   video it would just it's them sitting against the black strip but it really
[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:55.420]   brings it to life because that's this is matching the music as they talk about
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:58.340]   screaming for him because like a lot of time it's like the 16 year olds and it
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:03.740]   looks very visually interesting I think it's really and it's a the
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:09.020]   performers are black and white demonic from but the music is in color anyway
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:13.500]   well well worth looking at it's in the New York Times art section it's called
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:20.860]   Justin Bieber Diplo and Skrilix make a hit song and and yeah okay so it's
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:26.380]   Ableton yeah Ableton live is about performance isn't it that's kind of
[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:30.220]   the basis for it is about live performance but you know it's it's kind
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:37.140]   of integrated a lot of traditional DAW kind of functionality as well DAW
[01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:43.700]   yes DAW audio workstation yeah speaking of music only one in five people have
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:49.660]   quit Apple music Apple was quick to point out we talked about last week I think
[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:54.360]   the music watch study that found that for a survey of 5,000 people it said that
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:59.500]   almost half who had tried Apple music had stopped using it Apple says that number
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:05.740]   is much lower 79% of people who sign up for a trial are using the service in the
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:09.420]   music watch survey 28% of respondents who are trying out Apple music said they
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:14.980]   also had Spotify premium subscriptions only 11% were users of the free version
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:19.580]   of Spotify 6% use the free version of the internet radio I asked our news team
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:23.380]   why they didn't post that no the news guy Joe said it seemed fishy so he asked
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:28.180]   before posting and turned out it was wrong well I think they may both be right I
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:35.140]   think it's kind of how you define use right so it's I had trouble understanding
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:38.500]   exactly what kind of point of their that they're trying to make there because
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:42.500]   part of it is are they using it meaning that has their usage of Spotify and other
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:47.260]   apps gone down has Apple music supplanted it or is it an app that is
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:52.180]   somewhat in the mix of where they get their music from and furthermore how
[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:57.180]   significant is it's the first significant metric is going to be at the end of
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:00.180]   September which is I think is the end of the 90 days where everybody signed up
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:05.020]   immediately start to say yeah yeah I mean it's it's it's one thing for people
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:10.300]   to see that that 10 bucks on their credit card statement say okay whatever
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:13.500]   we'll keep we'll keep going at and another thing if we just see people just
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:18.420]   go boom drop I've got I've got a calendar reminder reminding me to make
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:22.140]   sure that I don't keep paying for this after the free period or did they did
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:26.180]   people already go into their account simply say do not auto renew the service
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:31.260]   so that's I'll add one more to the 5,000 people in the survey I am a Spotify
[01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:36.340]   premium subscriber also a Google all access premium subscriber and naturally
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:40.220]   I'm gonna do the three-day trial of a three month trial of Apple music any day
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:43.020]   although I would have loved it if the 90-day trial were available on the
[01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:49.020]   Android and it isn't I find myself having a weird reaction I think that and
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:54.140]   this is I don't think I'm gonna renew and I'm gonna start paying for it and it's
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:58.980]   not because I don't think it's worth the 10 bucks a month it's because and I'm
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:03.700]   not trying to be sarcastic here I think Apple music for me will be a lot
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:08.860]   easier to understand when it's only an app that plays music that I own locally
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:13.300]   on the device because every time I get really confused or surprised by doing
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:18.900]   something it's because oh you assumed that just because you ripped this 2cd set
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:23.380]   last night and added it to the library and then sync your phone to it that it
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:26.940]   was going to be files oh no no no no where we we assumed that you wanted this
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:29.500]   when you added this to the library that you wanted it from the Apple music
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:35.140]   version of it and it's like oh please just do what I ask you to do don't do what
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:37.780]   I don't ask you to do and if you think that I'm asking you to do something
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:41.140]   that silly you remind me I'm about to do something silly and make sure I want to
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:44.580]   do the thing I'm asking you to do I'm wondering where I would fall in these
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:50.740]   statistics because I like the 4U screen in Apple music I do not use the cloud
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:56.060]   library I never used iTunes match I wasn't in any of that what I use is the
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:16:00.500]   the 4U and I will flip through those playlists like the intro to Van Halen
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:05.340]   list was really nice for a road trip I took recently to see my family and like
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:11.260]   some of the other intro stuff or like new order deep cuts and I'm totally how
[01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:16.780]   much of this for you is like the genius and how much of it is what what I wasn't
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:21.300]   clear I look at and I see a lot of hip hop on mine it's biased genius so it
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:24.420]   ties it it determines what your what it thinks it gives you what you think it
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:27.260]   thinks you want but then it biases it based on your likes and dislikes as you
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:31.380]   go okay and the stuff that you play in Apple music so I have occasionally used
[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:37.900]   the 4U and I use the radio stations but I don't do either of those things
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:43.300]   regularly and so am I a person who has given up on Apple music because I am
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:46.940]   not gonna pay for it I don't pay for any service now though so I'm not a person
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:52.620]   who would be sacrificing my Spotify account in favor of this because I don't
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:56.620]   have the the paid Spotify account either I don't I don't pay for any sort of
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:17:02.620]   streaming apparently I'm the exception so for me this seems you know I'm
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:06.740]   wondering like which of those statistics would be where I would fall
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:11.780]   because I haven't given it up but I was never a heavy user of it in the first
[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:15.940]   place and I would continue not to be I would be completely content now that the
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:20.940]   radio stations the ones that you can build yourself in iTunes radio now that
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:25.460]   those actually work the way I want them to and the way I set them up I feel like
[01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:29.900]   those are of much more value to me than any of the stuff that was in Apple
[01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:33.660]   music that it was giving me like it's nice to see some of those playlists but
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:39.340]   for the most part I'm more looking at just using the radio stations occasionally
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:43.740]   and that's it so it happens to this for you at the end of the three months if
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:49.740]   you don't pay does this section go away no I think that's days and it just it'll
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:54.220]   direct you either to music and offer you get or to iTunes if you don't have it
[01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:58.380]   like for me Apple's gonna lose money on me because I just used iTunes match
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:01.660]   because I only wanted I didn't want to have to sync with iTunes again so when I
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:04.740]   wanted something I would just buy it it would be on all my devices and I'd play
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:08.660]   it when I wanted to hear it but now with Apple music my use case is always just
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:12.820]   hey Siri play sorry I keep saying that and drives people nuts yo your
[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:18.180]   blood oh play whatever I want at any time any cover of anything I want it's
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:21.900]   total music on demand I don't have to buy stuff anymore if I hear a song in my
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:25.300]   head if I hear it somewhere else if I just feel like playing it I'm just three
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:28.540]   or four words away from getting it and that to me is just living in the future
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:33.740]   it's this the I have to say the okay a couple of things first of all at some
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:37.340]   point I'm have to decide which one would have paid ten bucks a month for I
[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:43.740]   probably will be Spotify but part of that is because I I all this is
[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:47.780]   recommending is hip I never I don't like hip-hop music and I also reuse your
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:51.420]   account Leo well my son has a lot there's a lot but this is not music I've been
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:55.580]   listening to this is music that is in the that I bought it one time which is not
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:19:00.140]   my current iTunes list because you know Henry bought it and I got rid of it I
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:05.380]   have to say I'm not this is not useful to me because I all I would get on this
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:09.620]   is is a lot of music I don't like if the stuff you got does not represent your
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:15.460]   personal taste and for you are Kelly the zero zeros getting ready for date night
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:22.500]   Bobby I don't even know if Henry would listen this crap because this is a lot
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:27.180]   of this is commercial hip-hop you know it's not it's not the stuff he likes you
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:30.500]   can go in and redo those red dots Leo and just tell it what bands you want and
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:33.300]   that'll great you might have to do that for you I don't know why I'm getting
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:37.740]   vampire weekend I don't even know who that you know I just feels like this is
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:42.780]   not this is for somebody not me so that's that's a fail yeah go in and redo
[01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:47.700]   those red oh thank God Sunday morning classic rock Van Morrison Elton John
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:52.580]   dire straits there we go now where I had to scroll all the way down to get the
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:57.220]   beyond that list play that list or click the little heart for it and then if you
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:20:01.740]   favorite some things like that it should help adjust those you know I know also
[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:07.020]   okay now I'm really be whiny I don't want to be ghettoized I'm afraid this other
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:10.420]   people must have this experience that if I do heart this and start listening to
[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:14.340]   this then they'll go oh we get it and then then it's gonna be instead of all
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:18.740]   hip-hop it's gonna be all classic rock I don't want that either I don't know I
[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:22.300]   guess maybe this is less useful to me do you do you listen to a broad variety of
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:28.660]   music Kelly or I do and so well the two I named dropped in the that I was talking
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:33.860]   about earlier were Van Halen in new order and and so I get I get some of the
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:38.740]   rock stuff that I like to listen to and I get some of the 80s new waiver stuff I
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:42.620]   like to listen to and some of the current electronic music which is also what I
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:46.900]   enjoy so the list can be diverse but I think it's one of those things like
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:51.580]   Netflix where it's one thing if you like it but the things that you actually play
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:55.860]   are gonna be what give you what are more weighted recommendations so it gets
[01:20:55.860 --> 01:21:00.820]   better the more you yeah if you heart that playlist that might be okay but if
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:04.500]   you start actually playing some other stuff through Apple music I think it
[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:09.060]   would be more tuned to you and for whoever it was the asked in the chat room
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:11.780]   it is always Van Halen it is never Van Hagar
[01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:20.860]   who ever heard of that is that like a Star Wars people Sammy shot first I
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:26.740]   think that this is this is typical though because I this is because I
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:30.660]   haven't listened to it and it's a it's a tough hump for Apple to get over that
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:35.620]   oh it'll get better if you listen to it but you're but right but I heard that a
[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:38.580]   lot because a lot of people do those red dots may seem to get something that is
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:41.780]   acceptable that it's just me then all right yeah that helped me a lot I think
[01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:46.980]   with mine was tuning those yeah I mean I really would much rather don't make
[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:51.860]   guesses about me if you ask me explicitly what I like what I don't like even if
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:55.340]   it's just like an eye exam sort of thing do you like more like this or more like
[01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:59.180]   this well I did the red dots and I can guarantee you there was no hip hop in my
[01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:04.140]   red dots yeah that was that was pointing for me too I haven't redone it
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:08.300]   and I should but the the couple times I did it it's like it's like it's like it
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:15.700]   it knows about a thousand shades of gray when it comes to certain types of
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:21.020]   music but it's like you know an IBM PC AT graphics car when it comes to other
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:26.580]   categories of music saying do you like Leonard Bernstein right or Shasta COVID
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:30.260]   but contrast this to the most used subscription service which is Pandora
[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:34.020]   where what you do is you say I want this artist it makes a list of that artist
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:38.540]   and then similar artist does a very kind of credible job and now you have that
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:42.620]   radio and you can just go to that you've got even I've got 40 stations in there
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:46.900]   that is much a much more intuitive much easier and I think for most people much
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:51.780]   more satisfying experience that's the competition yeah you can do right that's
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:54.580]   one of the interesting things about the new Apple Music Services that you can
[01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:58.300]   make playlists you can make up next cues and you can make radio stations and for
[01:22:58.300 --> 01:23:01.740]   some people that's a ton of complex of complexity and it makes a lot of UI
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:04.700]   overhead but some people really only want to make radio stations and people
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:08.060]   really only want their playlist and it's hard it's hard to serve that big an
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:11.620]   audience to be all things to all people yeah absolutely it's such a big challenge
[01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:14.060]   for Apple for all the flack they're getting about the launch of Apple Music
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:17.700]   I don't think it's even practical for them to say that we're gonna develop a
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:21.300]   music service that everybody's gonna want to use because there's you talk to
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:24.700]   ten people you have ten different styles of wanted to have how they what the
[01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:28.540]   relationship with music is but if there's one thing wrong with iTunes it tries to
[01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:34.660]   do too much right yeah I still wish there were a separate app that said here
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:38.780]   is all here is an app for managing music that is on your device there is no
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:42.260]   question about it this is all for on device music and I don't think that there
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:46.180]   are enough third-party apps that settle that either I'm probably an outlier
[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:50.580]   because I probably don't listen to enough me I don't use it enough I don't
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:55.220]   listen to enough music through it when I listen to music I listen in kind of a
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:59.740]   different way for instance it's not on my sonos and you so if I'm gonna listen
[01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:04.060]   to music a lot of the times it's on sonos so if I get any signals from that
[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:09.660]   it is coming it is coming good into the year they said that's huge I'm surprised
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:13.980]   that that because beats was on sonos I'm surprised that they didn't get that
[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:19.020]   right up front but sonos is probably a tiny fraction of the overall audience
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.820]   so maybe it's not that important that does exactly the sort of stuff we're
[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:25.980]   talking about though if I don't care what fraction the audience are listening
[01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:29.220]   to music through sonos if the way over the past two or three years I've been
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:32.180]   listening to my music are these wonderful sonos speakers in my in my
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:36.340]   living room I'm gonna reject an entire multi-billion dollar music
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:39.900]   initiative because it simply doesn't work through my little $200 speakers
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:44.900]   yeah that's how that's how hard is to build a lot of like yeah hundred
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:51.120]   countries though at launch I'm not sure I mean you want to talk about
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:56.300]   sonos I will listen to music through my Amazon Echo even though it's one speaker
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:59.860]   even though it's little it's little and it's tiny as not as a whole much a
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:03.740]   throw simply because it's the one thing where I can just simply sponsor you say
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:09.340]   like you know hey Alex say I want to play play me the Diana Daimra opera I was
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:13.340]   listening to yesterday and we'll say playing Diana Daimra I have to say
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:18.380]   that's another one if it doesn't work with echo okay echoes a big one too isn't it
[01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:22.100]   I don't know how many people so one of the big problems here is that I don't
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:25.060]   know what apples numbers tell him in terms of how people by people I mean
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:28.020]   young people who are listening to a lot of music how they're consuming it now
[01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:30.460]   and they might it might be something similar where they don't want to own
[01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:33.700]   cars and they don't want to buy things anymore they only want to stream stuff
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:37.020]   and this might be the patterns of behavior they have so I'm super interested
[01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:40.060]   in finding out how not our generation specifically but new generation people
[01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:43.380]   actually think of the music and whether they care about half the things that
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:50.060]   we're upset about sure they do or even if they care about having another having
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:53.860]   a company curate playlist for them it's like no no I just I get all my music
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:56.740]   from friends of mine they're giving me giving me links on Spotify giving me
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:01.720]   lense links on on other on YouTube and other apps so you're not required here
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:05.540]   all you're required is getting is making sure the speaker on my phone is
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:11.780]   disabled so that comes to my headphones well and I think for me one of the
[01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:16.180]   things in my relationship with music I listen to music all the time I sing along
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:21.260]   all the time there's loads of music basically like for me it's a very
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:26.020]   important thing and one of the things that I noticed with the advent of Apple
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:30.380]   music is that the radio stations in iTunes radio that no one ever used actually
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:34.980]   got better because I had a couple that I used very much I like to listen during
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:39.300]   the day when I'm trying to work I like to listen to instrumental music so I
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:43.460]   like a lot of movie soundtracks so I put together this iTunes radio station
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:46.700]   that was mostly John Williams and then a few other composers and it would
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:50.060]   basically play everything equally and then after Apple music it did what I
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:53.580]   wanted which is lots of John Williams and a good amount of this other stuff too
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:58.580]   and it sort of figured out that I was trying to wait it by adding more John
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:04.020]   Williams albums than other albums so for me if the iTunes radio stations got
[01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:07.500]   better so I don't really have a desire to pay ten dollars a month for Apple
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:10.580]   music I'm really sort of hoping that the radio stations will continue to be
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:15.060]   free like they were before and just suck a lot less and then maybe more people
[01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:19.140]   will get into that and once they and it'll be the same sort of halo effect that
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:21.900]   Apple counts on for everything else like if you really like the radio stations
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:25.900]   what if you could customize them even better and you could do so if you just
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:28.580]   paid ten dollars a month for Apple music like that might be a thing that might
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:32.900]   actually work and for me it would certainly be something I would be very
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:39.980]   tempted by. Let's see we've got so much more and we're running at a time I want
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:44.020]   to move fairly quickly through the next bunch of stories Tesla engineer Jones
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:49.860]   joins Apple's growing team of automated car experts this Reuters story
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:55.740]   apparently they were looking at his LinkedIn and noted that Jamie Carlson
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:28:03.260]   has on his LinkedIn profile said left left Tesla for Apple. LinkedIn the boon to
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:08.260]   every journalist. LinkedIn is really apparently great. So of course we've seen
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:11.540]   this Wall Street Journal story and so forth sounds like Apple's working on
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:17.980]   autonomous vehicles although we talked about this on Twitter on Sunday and the
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:22.500]   panel Dwight Silverman and John C. de Vorac and Philip Elmore DeWitt kind of
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.980]   all agreed that it really wasn't Apple doing thinking of autonomous vehicles
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:31.620]   but more like a subsystems for other car manufacturers credible. No I mean I
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:35.460]   mean it's a car with probably some degrees of autonomy I don't know if you
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:41.820]   can launch a phone with a car. I mean they sell phones and they sell. They could
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:45.420]   mean. They could I was talking I was talking to someone the other day and
[01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:48.860]   there's that he he's been in the audio industry long enough and he's like one
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:57.220]   of these historian times historian sort of people and he he gave me a story
[01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:01.460]   about what he thought that wouldn't it be interesting if Apple wanted to go
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:05.420]   back to the original days of car manufacturing where you have one company
[01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:09.220]   that's going to be making everything but the coach work and then you can buy
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:12.860]   this and then have it basically built out in whatever coach work you want so
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:15.660]   if you wanted something to look a little more sippy versus something that had like
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:19.180]   you know sofas front naffed you can have it made that way. I don't know if
[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:21.580]   that's true or I don't know if that's actually happening or not but it made me
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:26.100]   wonder if Apple really wants to do all the all the problems that are involved
[01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:30.140]   in servicing automobiles or if they just simply want to say look the EMW Ford
[01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:33.540]   Chrysler if you want to make something that's built on the Apple car system
[01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:36.780]   here is here is the design that we've come up with here's the licensing we
[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:41.340]   will approve it we will do made for Apple car chassis sort of technology and
[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:44.860]   they'd go off that way. All I know for sure I mean this is this is still like
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:47.940]   everything everything everyone's saying is speculation at this point apart from
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:52.060]   hiring all I know for sure is that they're getting a lot of people to quit
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:58.420]   really great careers at established companies to move to Apple and work on
[01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:03.620]   this unannounced product and so if it weren't something I'm not I don't that's
[01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:06.980]   why I don't believe people who are speculating that oh well they just want
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:09.820]   to they just want to build a car and have a test track so they can build
[01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:14.580]   software for center console dashes or for accident avoidance stuff and stuff
[01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:19.060]   like that. No they wouldn't get these these people across all of these places
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:22.260]   in the industry to leave these gigs if they were simply we're hoping you can
[01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:26.220]   help us work on this button now here's the button for actually forgetting to a
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:30.900]   podcast. It's red right now but should it be a purplish red can you imagine what
[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:35.020]   the Apple dealerships will look like that's the exciting part of all this.
[01:30:35.020 --> 01:30:40.980]   They'll be white big white rooms with lots of light and no features. The
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:46.060]   genius servicemen. Yeah and you know they're cover all the genius bar.
[01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:49.380]   Pardon me. Oh how do you get your car to the genius bar?
[01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:53.260]   Park. Yeah I think the Apple stores will have a ramp and you just drive right in.
[01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:56.620]   We've had people do drive-through service at Apple stores after hours
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:31:00.740]   before. These pressibles. They collected a lot of data. That makes us so cool.
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:03.460]   It's like all these like to Andy's point all those problems that have to be
[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:05.660]   solved regardless of what they ever decide that they're gonna actually go
[01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:08.620]   forward and launch a car and based on the hires look like they're doing a lot
[01:31:08.620 --> 01:31:11.500]   of cool stuff but there's just so many interesting things like what is the
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:14.860]   software on this thing what what sort of a vehicle does it end up being how
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:18.220]   will they service it what what how will you buy and all these things is what
[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:21.060]   makes me excited not so much whether it was gonna be a new iPhone next year
[01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:24.460]   because of course they will but what new problems can be solved and what sort
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:27.220]   of approach does a company like Apple take to solving those and I think that's
[01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:32.140]   endlessly fascinating. The real is like people car companies that are doing
[01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:36.460]   experiments with autonomous vehicles right now are they're they're getting a
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:41.140]   jump start by buying this really big box from NVIDIA that has most of the
[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:44.980]   sensor stuff and the software stuff they need to do this sort of really fast
[01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:50.020]   sensory and image processing to navigate a street and it's interesting and when
[01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:53.100]   you think back on that you realize that well actually I would not have been
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:56.620]   clever enough to figure this out on my own but NVIDIA is well positioned to
[01:31:56.620 --> 01:32:00.740]   build a box like that and so you're kind of encouraged to think about what what
[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:05.300]   is Apple good at and what problems can they solve that very few other companies
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:09.300]   including few others in the auto industry are prepared to fix right now I mean
[01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:12.700]   Google's making a car itself they're they're they're an ad company that does
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:17.300]   search and you know and yet they're doing a kick-ass car it's which working
[01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:23.140]   it's not a theoretical thing it looks kind of like a blister of some material
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:27.900]   that's not recyclable it's like it's like being it's it reminds me of you
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:31.580]   know back in the 70s and 80s the the special like batting helmet side shaped
[01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:35.780]   car that used to ferry pictures from the from the bullpen to the mound on
[01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:40.100]   that's what it looks like and yet they're building it so it's it's it's gonna be
[01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:43.020]   interesting whatever comes out from that I just not gonna predict what it is
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:46.540]   we're gonna take a break and come back with your picks of the week Kelly did you

[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:04.820]   only for that
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:09.220]   what is that it's a little bit so this is a company called human gear
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:11.380]   and they make uh...
[01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:13.500]   these it's this little uh...
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:16.980]   i will tell you as far as size goes
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:21.500]   one of the facts on their website says will it fit a ding dong and in fact
[01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:23.660]   the hostess chocolate covered
[01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:28.580]   c_k_ thing will fit in one of these it's exactly the size just right so
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:32.380]   uh... you can find these at
[01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:35.500]   primarily at at outdoor gear stores which is why i thought this might be a good
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.900]   pick because a lot of people have them
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:40.900]   because they go to places like a re i
[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:44.980]   or uh... here in portland i got my net uh... deacon brine's next adventure
[01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:48.820]   and uh... at all these places it tends to be like a camping thing like you you
[01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:51.260]   want this so that it keeps your
[01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:52.140]   uh...
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:57.420]   your pills or matches or things like that you know type of protected and it's a
[01:35:57.420 --> 01:35:59.540]   hard plastic
[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:02.900]   deal and so what i did with mine here's the thing that i really like about it is
[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:06.740]   that let me line up the camera here it's one-handed so if i just squeeze the
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:09.540]   side i can take the top off
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:12.100]   and so what i put in mind was all the little
[01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:15.060]   and dumped all over my desk all the little bits of stuff
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:18.500]   that uh... accumulate on my desk that i can never find
[01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:20.900]   so i've got my extra camera battery
[01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:24.740]   uh... this is one of those little history and strips because it holds an s_d_ card
[01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:28.740]   i've got my little nifty removal tool in there and like the end for on a couple
[01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:32.580]   of cables that i like to carry around using a list your strips box to hold an s_d_
[01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:33.580]   card
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:36.220]   yeah i totally think that is so crafty
[01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:40.340]   and so uh... and then to to close it
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:43.860]   there's no you don't have to twist anything like that and then
[01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:46.860]   like i said all you have to do is hold it really low
[01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:49.100]   and squeeze and it pops open
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:50.020]   and so
[01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:51.020]   that's my pick
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:55.100]   uh... i got mine they were on sale and so i got mine for two dollars
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:59.180]   so it was like a no-brainer i almost bought a bunch of them
[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:02.900]   but uh... i figured i'd start with one and see how it went and it's so far has been
[01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:06.140]   great for all those little bits of stuff that i accumulate that
[01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:09.420]   end up in the back of a drawer behind something or under something
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:12.260]   or in a giant container where i can't really find them
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:13.500]   that's my pick
[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.220]   nice pick
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:19.100]   thank you kelly and you can get them from the way that their site is well right
[01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:21.340]   uh... yet you can get them from their site there on amazon
[01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:23.660]   oh okay so uh... so uh... yeah you can
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:26.860]   human gear you can prime one let me look here uh...
[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:31.100]   just bought one for three pack of the mediums for seven ninety nine nice
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:33.900]   yeah so and i guess three hohoes
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:35.420]   yeah
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:39.580]   or ding dongs it was ding dong is it ding dong's ring dings or hohoes or all three
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:41.460]   i bet they're all the same size
[01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:45.980]   no because um hohoes are the long ones that are the rolled up with the
[01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:50.220]   i'm sorry in the middle i'm so off i'm so sorry
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:53.700]   how about king king dongs are they king dong compatible
[01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:56.860]   no just that we know
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:59.020]   they're too small for Canadian me west
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:01.420]   you cannot put a Tim Hortons in there
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:04.540]   no way as to a jolly yeah
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:06.140]   ladies and gentlemen
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:09.180]   and the naco has a pick of the week
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:13.020]   uh... two quickies one is a game that is basically everybody is playing right
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:16.140]   now there's a reason my phone calls are going and emails are going unanswered
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:18.500]   uh... pac-man two fifty six
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:23.180]   uh... they've taken the familiar pac-man game and turned it into sort of an
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:28.220]   infinite runner sort of game uh... the same folks who do crossy road
[01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:31.900]   and so there are two things i really love about it first the gameplay is great
[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:33.180]   so you are
[01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:37.740]   uh... it's pac-man but now you're sort of doing a zax on sort of run
[01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:38.620]   here
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:41.340]   it is not possible to do this backwards
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:44.780]   but imagine but now imagine you have to go from bottom to top
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:48.860]   infinitely i like that because at the bottom of the screen you know the the
[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:53.900]   the kill screen glitch that keeps creeping up so if you go too far that way you
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:54.940]   die that way
[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:58.700]   so not only are you being uh... not only are you points for like
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:01.660]   eating pellets and getting and getting other prices
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:04.460]   uh... and and shoot and here you go
[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:07.660]   that looks really fun and the graphics are are really really cool
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:10.380]   but will it will also give you points for it knows that
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:15.100]   you have strategized and you've taken a path so that you never
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:18.780]   uh... go over the same path twice you're just doing nothing but
[01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:23.660]   gobbling pellets you're never going over pre gobbled stretches of of of lane
[01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:26.380]   uh... i also like the way that you pay for this you get
[01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:30.220]   uh... six quick imagine it's an arcade game you get six quarters per day
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:33.820]   so you can basically are the two course three six six lives per day when you
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:35.580]   when you leave when you lose those up
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:38.700]   you don't get any more place till the next day and get you get six more
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:40.020]   uh... six more place
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:43.860]   and yes you can buy some more but number one it keeps you from becoming
[01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:45.180]   obsessed about this
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:46.380]   but also
[01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:49.020]   really nice it's a free to download but if you
[01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:51.820]   give them seven ninety nine you get infinite free play
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:54.180]   which is not a ripoff because
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:56.860]   eight dollars for a game of this high quality
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:40:00.060]   that's a good value so you get to play the hell out of it
[01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:02.580]   uh... before you decide you know what i really like this game
[01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:05.580]   even if i stop playing it tomorrow i want these developers to have eight
[01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:06.300]   dollars
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:08.380]   uh... and so you have the ability to give them eight dollars and then you unlock
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:09.380]   it uh... forever
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:13.460]   that's not at all yeah and the second pick is just another quickie
[01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:18.460]   uh... i have been continuing to try third party uh... watch apps this is a
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:22.420]   stainless steel app from hoco the same company for the with the red leather
[01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:23.340]   band that i
[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:24.900]   that did earlier
[01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:27.060]   uh... yet uh... say stainless steel
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:27.860]   uh...
[01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:31.420]   thirty bucks compared to five hundred bucks for the apple one obviously is
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:33.460]   not the exact it's not the same quality
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:36.900]   it's more of a conventional sort of link together bracelet
[01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:41.860]   uh... to resize it you have to use this cheap plastic tool to wedge apart
[01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:45.860]   links and put them back together and of course it broke after i uh... after i
[01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:49.620]   incorrect after i incorrectly judge the size of a good amazon and
[01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:51.700]   spend seven dollars for another set
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:56.420]   maybe you could use this to like camera the stylus back into your phone
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:41:01.020]   but but it's so ras the the apple band you can actually just remove an ad links
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:03.140]   without any special tools but who cares because
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:06.940]   unless you know i don't i don't hulk out my wrists with either
[01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:10.540]   uh... hoho is or exercise so i if you adjust it once that's pretty much all
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:11.460]   you have to do
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:14.380]   uh... and looks great feels great uh...
[01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:17.820]   the only question is that this is at i don't think apple has actually no one
[01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:21.460]   has actually released any apple watch accessories or bands
[01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:25.500]   under the made for apple watch program apple has a certification program
[01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:27.660]   where they will make sure that you use the right metal source not going to
[01:41:27.660 --> 01:41:30.940]   corrode it's not going to break it's gonna be structurally sounds to be made
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:31.620]   well
[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:35.340]   uh... none of those have been approved yet but certainly still a thing is
[01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:36.420]   certainly going to happen
[01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:41.580]   so maybe until you start to see official made for apple watch bands
[01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:44.340]   these third-party bands are great things to have to
[01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:47.500]   i've got the i've got the official band and wearing every single day but
[01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:50.660]   when i'm going out and i don't want to have this white piece of rubber around
[01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:54.140]   another watch i want i want to have something will nicer to wear for the day
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:57.300]   thirty bucks you can't go wrong and like i said it doesn't feel cheap at all just
[01:41:57.300 --> 01:41:58.000]   feels like
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.540]   a really nice stainless steel band
[01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:00.900]   ways ways of time
[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:03.180]   uh... cost about thirty bucks
[01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:06.660]   nice couple of great pics for an a richy here pick of the week
[01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:10.860]   i am not picking watch bands cuz i have a problem and he is not you have a ball
[01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:11.700]   yeah
[01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:13.860]   all of this stuff
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:16.540]   yeah so i'm not going to have anything to do with watch bands today
[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:20.180]   i instead of a draw your attention you might have heard of this young pizza
[01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:24.340]   artist named gussmueller who has a rocket oven it makes thirty second pizza
[01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:27.060]   which i believe and is busy competing with right now on twitter
[01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:29.300]   but he also does abs in his spare time
[01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:32.060]   and he's just updated his flagship and a mitt is a corn
[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:33.500]   wait a minute
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:37.380]   he has an oven that can make a pizza in thirty seconds it's it's like a jet it's
[01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:40.460]   like a it's called a rocket oven i think i've mentioned it before but it's just
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:43.780]   i i don't know what it is nuclear fission or
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:47.900]   uh... atomic maybe me anti matter but yeah he's got a rocket oven for pizza
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:49.780]   i want a rocket oven
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:51.460]   the crescent ashie
[01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:52.940]   you might have to
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:55.540]   do you have a rocket oven to andy
[01:42:55.540 --> 01:43:00.020]   no i have a pizza stuff i have a baking steel a thirty-pound sheet of half-inch
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:01.100]   thick steel
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:02.500]   and that
[01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:06.140]   makes for really really uh... beautiful cross i bake my first three pizzas over
[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:07.060]   the weekend and
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:10.340]   they were all the yeah now having a pizza stone i'm familiar with
[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:12.180]   the steel is new to me
[01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:14.660]   i'll make maybe i'll make maybe i'll make that a picnic week of the week after
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:19.740]   this rocket oven uh... there it is it's made out of this one is a made out of a
[01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:22.860]   apparently if the do it yourself the camp by a rocket oven
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:25.740]   yeah gusses is a little bit smaller than that but uh... it's it's a
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:26.260]   same-
[01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:29.420]   rocket booster from the shuttle program apparently
[01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:34.060]   and the idea is that you he is it is it like uh... you he did that i don't
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:36.420]   know thousand degrees some crazy
[01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:40.380]   why does it just burn it i don't i don't get it i don't it
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:44.660]   it's one step before burr leo it's like that that that you you ride the wave of
[01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:48.220]   of explosion to get a delicious
[01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:49.860]   thirty seconds
[01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:53.220]   i think it's really a lot more heavily bandaged than that if he's been using
[01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:53.900]   this
[01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:57.420]   i'm very impressed i want one okay nevermind
[01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:01.020]   uh... renee you did have a pick of the week but yes you can't just say the words
[01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:03.420]   rocket oven and move on you've got it really
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:04.980]   i know better yeah
[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:08.020]   so he makes an app in his spare time he's not making pizza makes an app called a
[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:09.580]   corne a corn is one of the big
[01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:12.660]   not a photoshop competitor apple never made a competitor what they did is made
[01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:16.700]   a bunch of frameworks the developers could use to make great uh...
[01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:20.260]   editing apps and his is a corn has been around for years he's just a big
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:24.380]   update a corn five has a lot gusses an incredibly incredibly smart graphics
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:25.180]   engineer
[01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:28.660]   uh... listening to talk about g_l_ and things like that is just mind-boggling
[01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:31.740]   and it takes all of that knowledge and he pours it into a corn and it's got
[01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:35.620]   these great new features uh... shape fills and curves and
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:38.060]   uh... the difference between this and some other approaches that he tries to
[01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:40.540]   have everything integrated into one sort of
[01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:43.260]   of window which some people really prefer they don't like to have bits and
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:45.380]   pieces of the app lying in all different
[01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:46.700]   uh... corns of the screen
[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:49.820]   this is a really good really integrated uh...
[01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:52.660]   after it it's super cheap i think i thought it was twenty dollars i couldn't
[01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:55.460]   believe it because that's way too cheap for an app like this hopefully that's
[01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:56.820]   just a sale price
[01:44:56.820 --> 01:45:00.060]   uh... he could be charging fifty seventy dollars really photoshop i mean it's
[01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:01.420]   everything you need
[01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:05.020]   it's a lot of great i had a corn for so i have to pay the thirty bucks for the
[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:06.140]   new one right
[01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:10.180]   i don't on his if you have a lot of his site and on the mac app store and
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:12.860]   there's an upgrade price uh... so
[01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:16.140]   yeah you can you can't have a little
[01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:18.780]   about the last minute it's so cheap i just keep
[01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:21.980]   i give it uh... to people to try and give him some more money because i want to
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:23.500]   keep making it
[01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:27.540]   it's so it really is that i thought i was trying it out earlier this morning and
[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:30.380]   there used to be a list of things i couldn't do because i grew up i i spent
[01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:33.420]   decades using photoshop it was muscle memory and there used to be things i
[01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:36.580]   just couldn't do in other apps and that list has become
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:39.740]   uh... i would say negligible by now so if you're looking for
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:42.780]   and i know it'll be a subscription plans now but a lot of people just don't need
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:45.180]   photoshop which does eight million different things
[01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:48.100]   they just want an image editor and this is a fantastic one
[01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:49.620]   doesn't really be
[01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:51.980]   official image editor at abcamp for girls
[01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:53.020]   or you
[01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:54.420]   nice
[01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:56.780]   so whenever they we have uh...
[01:45:56.780 --> 01:45:57.940]   scan snap
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:45:58.980]   scanners
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:02.700]   and they can draw whatever they want to draw and then cut it out of their
[01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:04.580]   sketchbooks and scan it
[01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:07.980]   and then uh... they do all of the adjustments in acorn whether they want to
[01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:11.140]   clean it up and turn it into something digital or just
[01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:14.500]   uh... make the hand-drawn version look a little nicer
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:17.500]   then uh... that it's acorn all the way
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:21.140]   i uh... of course i have photoshop because i have that you know ten dollar
[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:23.380]   photographers package from a creative cloud
[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:27.100]   but when i want to quickly edit something for web or you know just this is a
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:29.540]   corns always the one i fire
[01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:32.180]   acorn five just came out
[01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:36.980]   fresh off the pizza of an fresh out of the rocket of the ladies and gentlemen
[01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:37.940]   uh...
[01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:39.480]   i have i have i have i have
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:42.460]   i'm torn well are and i'll do this and then i'll do i'll do lists some other
[01:46:42.460 --> 01:46:43.460]   time
[01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:47.780]   uh... how many of you remember the good old days of lucas arts and little
[01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:50.900]   thing from double fine called the grim
[01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:52.940]   fandango
[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:59.020]   yes one of the great graphic adventures of all time it's available in the app
[01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:00.740]   store
[01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:04.020]   it's gonna bring back memories of your youth
[01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:06.660]   or in my case of my forties
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:08.300]   and uh...
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:13.060]   it is a really really good program you play the grim reaper
[01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:17.060]   and uh... unfortunately uh... times are tough for the grim reaper is got a nasty
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:18.300]   boss
[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:20.060]   got work to do
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:21.700]   stuff to get
[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:24.500]   in you play this all the way through kelly i can tell
[01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:25.580]   all i did
[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:28.900]   yeah you were saying it was it was your youth but it's really my my miss spent
[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:31.860]   youth i spent it on things like this impact man exactly
[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:35.020]   so you have two ways to waste a little
[01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:39.780]   uh... this uh... this is really nicely as you can see remastered is a cutscene
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:43.460]   but uh... they've done a really good job of making a h_c_ so we'll skip the
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:44.940]   cutscene and uh...
[01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:47.860]   will go right there's the game we're in the game
[01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:49.460]   and uh...
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:52.940]   it's easy to use you know you have this specialized mouse
[01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:55.700]   you can look at things let's pick up that
[01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:59.340]   see what's in that uh... matic tube
[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:00.300]   nicely done
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:02.140]   really a lot of fun
[01:48:02.140 --> 01:48:05.820]   remarie brac can't remember what it is that would cost but it's uh... wasn't
[01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:08.340]   i think it was ten bucks it's not enough
[01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:11.700]   uh... fifteen on steam fifteen on steam
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:13.700]   but it's also in the uh...
[01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:14.300]   uh...
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:15.180]   i'd store
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:16.860]   i really like seeing some of these
[01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:20.500]   some of the games like this that that sort of get it a caring restoration and
[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:20.940]   then
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:22.420]   and i think i'm not
[01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:24.780]   for people who who weren't
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:27.140]   or around for the first time so
[01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:28.740]   i really enjoy when they
[01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:32.620]   uh... when that when these come out in the they look really nice like

[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:50.140]   to other people but you could never play it again and that's what it's like
[01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:53.740]   when like gaming is like part of your childhood when you're growing up
[01:48:53.740 --> 01:48:58.100]   it's like but i want my son what make my child at my knee to learn how to get

[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:19.700]   maybe
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:22.060]   but how would i do that because what you would see is
[01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:25.100]   the guy looking at the thing and going like this and
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:28.220]   might well maybe that be kind of fun i don't know i i'd like to wait to put

[01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:54.740]   uh... i discovered that they do bots
[01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:58.060]   and there's a lot of bots there's a trivia bot and i saw you join it rene
[01:50:58.060 --> 01:51:01.740]   but you did never message me back i said no if for some reason i wasn't getting

[01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:20.980]   but i've also created the mechanical leo which is a bot which probably will be
[01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:22.660]   a good place to follow
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:26.500]   uh... my adventures with the stylus in the galaxy note five
