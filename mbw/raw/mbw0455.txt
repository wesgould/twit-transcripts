[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.220]   Joe.
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.820]   Joises via his pixelated studios in beautiful New England.
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.060]   Beautiful downtown New England.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.060]   Beautiful downtown.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.060]   Hi, Ryan.
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.060]   Hi, Ryan.
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.860]   From beautiful downtown Quebec.
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.860]   It's Renee Ritchie.
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.860]   I'm Oila Ocom.
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.540]   Hello Renee.
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.980]   And Jason Sennell came up.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.980]   Thank you.
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.980]   I'm here in person.
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.980]   What do you got?
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.980]   It's a dragon.
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.660]   I specialize in interpreting geek shirts.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.900]   This is the logo of my Dungeons and Dragons podcast.
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.900]   I was going to say it doesn't--
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.900]   It's promoting.
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.900]   Yeah, it doesn't really--
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.900]   Really promoting.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.700]   A lot of times you can say you can look at it and you say, oh, I get it.
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.140]   You're doing a Star Wars--
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.140]   It's a dragon.
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.260]   But this is not Game of Thrones or anything.
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.060]   No, it's Total Party Kill.
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.060]   Total Party Kill, TPK.
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.060]   Yeah.
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.060]   That's right.
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.060]   Where would we find that?
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.060]   On the incomparable.com.
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.980]   How many shows you got now?
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.980]   Who can count?
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.980]   I can't count that.
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.980]   I like 10, something like that.
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.980]   The most recent one, we were talking about it yesterday on iOS today.
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:59.980]   Oh, the David Letterman.
[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.140]   Yeah, I still don't listen to it.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.140]   You know, this is--
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.620]   You're not co-featured prominently in that one.
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.620]   Yeah, I bet.
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.620]   Indeed, yes.
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.620]   I think we probably all-- I don't know about you, Renee.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.100]   Do they hand Letterman in Canada?
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.100]   Probably not.
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.100]   They do?
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.100]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.100]   It's awesome.
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.100]   You have electricity now?
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.100]   We do.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.100]   We generated very-- we have to stay warm, Leo, so you're incentivized to run really fast
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.100]   on the treadmill that generates it.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.580]   Letterman's showing Canada is only about half an hour long because they cut out all
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.580]   the rude parts.
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.580]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.580]   It's a nice cranky man.
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.540]   It's because of the earlier harvest.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.140]   That's a tribute this week that a couple of some really good articles in The New York
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.980]   Times about-- you know, it's interesting about Letterman as many of the staffers have
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.780]   been with him all 33 years.
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.100]   Yeah, there were some clips from The Morning Show from 1980, and it's like Biff Henderson
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.380]   and I mean, it's the same people.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.940]   He's been the only up at like staff-- a lot of staff writers, a lot of staff producers,
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.940]   staff editors.
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.940]   It's like there's-- one of the first friends I met on the internet was Richard Sheckman,
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.460]   a film coordinator on like the late night show, and he's still working there today.
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.460]   It's amazing.
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.820]   It's like a civil service job back when civil service jobs were secure.
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.620]   Well, and they're also, of course, very puzzled about what happens after Wednesday.
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.620]   The last show is tomorrow.
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.860]   Yeah, although at least for the people who've been with him for 33 years, I mean, they've
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.860]   all--
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.860]   Or they were tiring probably.
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.380]   They may all be retiring.
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.380]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.380]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.380]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.700]   Paul Schafer, they had an interview in The Times with Paul Schafer.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.300]   He said, "It was nice to have something to do at 4 o'clock every afternoon."
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.180]   If you're a musician, you've got to figure that's a pretty great gig, right?
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.180]   No kidding.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.620]   I mean, you have some steady income.
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.620]   Right.
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.620]   And you're playing with a band with the same members for all that time.
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.220]   And then, you know, it's not like it's such a long grind that you don't have time to do
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.220]   other stuff, too.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.060]   And you're also living in New York, and you also get to play with pretty much the best
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.500]   musicians in the world that keep coming through.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.500]   And you can still-- you have time off.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.500]   It must be a pretty interesting gig.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.300]   I was thinking about that yesterday, that what is the difference between a musician
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.100]   that has a regular and absolute rock steady regular job day after day versus somebody
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.860]   who their schedule is always completely their own.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.940]   I wonder how that affects their creativity and how that affects their performing.
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.940]   Yeah.
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.580]   Schafer was saying just the other day when he was on as a guest that, you know, that time
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.380]   we played with Bob Dylan and that time we played with James Brown.
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.380]   Yeah, amazing.
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.380]   Yeah.
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.380]   It's amazing.
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.700]   Last night Eddie Vetter did Pearl James Better Man as part of the Back in Towerley by
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.700]   Just the Band.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.700]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.420]   I mean, I did a blog-- actually, sometimes a blog post entertains yourself as much as
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.420]   anybody else.
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.940]   I did a blog post a year ago about just how good the band is.
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.140]   And in doing so, just, I'm going to go to YouTube and start looking for musical performances.
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.580]   And I was reminded of time and time again, you can't lock them down into any one thing
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.340]   that the band does because they have to be able to do everything.
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.060]   And one of the most impressive ones of them all was that they had the opera singer Renee
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.820]   Fleming do a top 10 list where she is singing a different aria with new lyrics to each
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.820]   one.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.300]   And it was backed by the band who had to sing not just a rock and roll version of like
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.980]   Aida, but just the for real version.
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.820]   And they had like the different instruments they needed for the sort of thing.
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.820]   And no problem.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.940]   Just learn 10 different classical aria pieces.
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.940]   Nope.
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.940]   No problem.
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.940]   That's what we do.
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.940]   We are professionals.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.660]   It's making me feel old because one of the things I said in the articles that was 22 years
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.340]   ago that Letterman moved from NPC.
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.340]   Yeah.
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.340]   I want, wait a minute, that 22 years ago.
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.820]   Seriously, yesterday, doesn't it?
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.820]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.420]   All the people I talk to, I mean, a lot of people tend to say there's the first half
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.540]   of his career at NBC and the second half at CBS.
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.820]   It's like, actually it's two thirds at CBS.
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.980]   But we've all kind of compressed it down because all the people who are fans of him
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.060]   back then, you know, we're all getting older too, just like he is.
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.020]   And you lose sight of the fact that, you know, he's been doing it at CBS for 20 years.
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.220]   Well, anyway, listen to the incomparable.
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.540]   I haven't listened yet, but I want to very much hear that.
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.540]   It's a fun one.
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.540]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.980]   Goody not coast stuff in there.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.980]   So I'm old enough.
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.220]   I remember Johnny's last shows.
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.220]   We talk about that.
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.300]   Johnny Carson is hovering over this entire week because he was such an influence on David
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.580]   Letterman and defined what this job is that now David Letterman has also had for three
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.580]   decades.
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.580]   Although Letterman in many ways copied his, the predecessors.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.420]   He brought a lot of Steve Allen and he talks about that specifically in the incomparable
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.100]   that he brought a lot of that stuff.
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.100]   He dusted it off.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.660]   He brought it back to late night TV.
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.420]   Part of the thing I always like to say though, when that comes up is that yes, that's and
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.860]   Letterman and the producers and writers that helped to create the first lemon show.
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.260]   They also acknowledge that.
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.980]   But nonetheless, at the time, like the Steve Allen show, it's not on video.
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.060]   You have to be almost a story and have access to have been exposed to that.
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:44.180]   And you look at the fact that just like I said, I say this on the show, like the it's
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.580]   not as though the Mac was the very first computer to have a mouse or dropped on menus
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.420]   or a graphical user interface.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.540]   But when you take a look at the history of computing, all computers were one way and then
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.300]   the Mac came out and then every computer after that was like the Mac.
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.620]   And so they weren't everyone else wasn't trying to emulate the Xerox star.
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.900]   It was this computer that really put it in a way put it framed in a way that made everyone
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.620]   say, Oh, everything's different after now.
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.620]   So there's that guy.
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.900]   Thank you for doing that.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.140]   Hey, just out now.
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.220]   Watch OS 1.0.1.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.220]   Yep.
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.700]   If you go to your Apple Watch app, go to general and then software update and I'm seeing it
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.420]   right here.
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.380]   It says only this release includes performance improvements and bug fixes.
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.820]   Do we know anything about this update?
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.540]   Yeah, it's roughly analogous to iOS 8.3 in that it also gives you the diversity of
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.820]   emoticon emoji and it gives you additional language support.
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.980]   But mostly it's performance enhancements for a bevy of internal apps and a bunch of
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.980]   bug fixes.
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:49.020]   So performance for Siri, measuring stand activity because that was a joke.
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.460]   You'd be standing for an hour and then at 50 minutes, 10 minutes before the hour, it's
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.700]   a stand up.
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.700]   It was always 10.
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.700]   It's always 10.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.700]   I've been a cat with it.
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:05.780]   Neil stand, Neil calculating calories for indoor cycling and rowing workouts.
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.940]   That has some have complained that they're not very reliable.
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.060]   I didn't mind yesterday and it was I'm going to try and do it after the update because
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.860]   it was off quite a bit yesterday still.
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.780]   Distance and pace during outdoor walk and run workouts, accessibility, third party apps,
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.100]   display to support as you mentioned for the new emoji characters and additional language
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:28.060]   support for Brazilian Portuguese Danish Dutch Swedish Russian Thai and Turkish.
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.060]   There's nobody knows of any reason not to do this.
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.060]   Right?
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.060]   Shall I do it right now?
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.060]   Did mine immediately?
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.620]   Your watch has to be on your charger.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.620]   What?
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.340]   And it has to be more than even if it's on the charger.
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.340]   It has to be more than 50% charged.
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.980]   And you've got to be on Wi-Fi.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:43.980]   So don't do it now.
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.100]   Actually, I'm not sure you have to be on Wi-Fi.
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.540]   You have to be connected.
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.380]   So it's your phone has to be close.
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.380]   I'm not sure.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.380]   It says your iPhone has to be on Wi-Fi.
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.380]   All right.
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.100]   That would make sense because it's not going to use Bluetooth.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.940]   And it's downloading that's a 51 megabit micabyte download.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.940]   Yeah.
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.940]   And then it takes a while.
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:04.940]   Does it?
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.940]   Yeah, it takes a while.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.580]   The install for me took surprisingly long.
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.580]   All right.
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.740]   Well, you hasn't yet told me get your watch on it.
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.740]   Get the to a charger.
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.740]   The watch is fully charged.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:16.100]   So I wonder if the charger thing is because it normally uses Bluetooth and it only escalates
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.460]   to Wi-Fi if it has to.
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.660]   But I'm wondering if to get it faster, they're using Wi-Fi is full on.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.660]   I'm sure you would.
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.660]   Thanks, charger.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.660]   Right.
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.660]   That's that would make perfect sense.
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.300]   When you first set it up, don't you have to put it on the charger?
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.300]   Or no.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.300]   No, that was the LG or Bain watch.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.300]   Never mind.
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.300]   I'm confusing my.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.300]   Your smart watches.
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.300]   Smart watches.
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.300]   It says 7 minutes remaining.
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.900]   Because the 1.0 is not just the OS version that we've had as long as we've had the Apple
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.700]   watch, but it's also, you know, they had to put that on the first model.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:50.140]   It's good that they finally have pushed out a 1.01 because I'm sure they've been collecting
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.180]   a lot of things that they wanted to push out there and they can finally get them out
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.180]   there.
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.900]   But it was the new iPhone weeks ago.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.620]   Like the iPhone, you would send emoji on the iPhone.
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.780]   They wouldn't show up on the Apple watch, including Jason's long and prosper.
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.780]   Yeah.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.780]   Will I get live long?
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:03.780]   Can I be?
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.900]   No, I'll display them, but you can't enter them on iOS yet.
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.460]   But you can display them if you can make a good text shortcut, which I did that.
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.460]   Yeah, we have them.
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.700]   Jason just put live long and prosper in the chat room and it shows up.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.700]   It's blank.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.700]   Nothing.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.700]   How do you do that?
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.700]   I have it.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.700]   I have it as a shortcut.
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.180]   It turns it into the live long and prosper.
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.180]   I love it.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.180]   All right.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.260]   Well, it's five minutes remaining.
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.300]   It went from 14 minutes to seven minutes right away.
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.140]   So maybe it's not going to take that long.
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:34.620]   And it is we should point out it feels like the Apple watch has been out for years.
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.420]   We've been talking about it for years.
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.420]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.420]   But it's only been three weeks.
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.060]   This is a pretty prompt for.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.060]   Yeah.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.860]   And when I say finally out there, I just am envisioning people at Apple being like, oh,
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.140]   finally we get to because they were probably bugs in there that they knew about before
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.140]   it even shipped.
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.220]   They're like, can we fix it?
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.620]   And now they get to fix that stuff.
[00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.620]   Right.
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.620]   Right.
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:55.700]   There's always availability going these days.
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.540]   Are people able to walk in the stores yet?
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.180]   No, it's funny is my black link bracelet finally shipped this week.
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.060]   And I know Mark Gurman's, I think Mark, John Gruber is also just shipped.
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.980]   And my mom who ordered the pink sport bracelet, which hadn't shipped either.
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.420]   It was said June and it just shipped miraculously yesterday as well.
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.700]   So it looks like even the ones that were taking the longest are now finally getting shoved
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.700]   out the door.
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.740]   So they're now there really three levels of Apple fandom.
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.780]   There's the buying the watch level one, but that's, oh, that doesn't get you there.
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:28.140]   I guess if you bought the $17,000 watch, the outer circle.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.140]   That's the outer circle.
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:33.420]   The inner circle is or the middle circle is people who bought the watch and several bands.
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:38.420]   And then the, the really the true fan like John Gruber has several Apple watches, just
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.420]   a few.
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.420]   Well, we're in the business, right?
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.420]   I've got two right now.
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.420]   There's no justification.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.220]   No, no, I've got two right now because there was one that I could get the day of.
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.220]   Right.
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.220]   And it's not the one you wanted.
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.140]   No, and now I've got the one that I ordered.
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.540]   So now I will sell the other one.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.860]   So you were in a sport, a black sport?
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:52.860]   The one I paid for.
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:53.860]   Yeah.
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.940]   And the other one I paid for too, but it was from a friend and I'll turn around and sell
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:57.940]   that one.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.340]   Oh, so this is the new one.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.340]   This is the one I got.
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.340]   I got this last week.
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.900]   And that was going to be my answer is I got this last week and the band that I ordered should
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:04.900]   be arriving today.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.020]   It seems like the products are flowing out a lot better now.
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:13.020]   And for me and John, I think some others, we had the review unit the day before availability
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.900]   and then we were waiting for our ones that we actually paid for to her.
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.900]   Okay.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.100]   So you will not have multiple watches?
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.620]   No, might as well go back and I'll have one goes back to Apple and you've got the
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.620]   key.
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.140]   I wonder what the aftermarket is going to be because there are a lot of people in that
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.700]   position where they ordered the first day because they're developers, they had to get
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:30.700]   it.
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.780]   And then the things loosened up or they some of these orders got overlapped and now they
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:39.700]   find themselves that they've got two watches and one of them is now returnable and you
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.260]   may as well send one back right now.
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:46.820]   I kind of wonder what happens when you finally do manage to what when Apple gets a bunch
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.220]   of watches that have been worn and have been like sweated into and all that sort of stuff.
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.820]   But now you've went.
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.860]   How do they sanitize them so they can resell them?
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:55.860]   They've got those machines.
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.860]   I do I do I do have.
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.860]   Hey, Andy.
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.500]   No more of that crappy Moto 360.
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.500]   And Renee and I have confirmed that the Live Long and Prosper emoji does display on the
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.500]   Apple watch.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.500]   There it is.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.500]   See the tweet or the message.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.500]   Yeah, he just means.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.500]   I messaged the.
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.500]   Wait a minute.
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.460]   He just renamed a longer has to draw it.
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.620]   He did a he did a screen capture.
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.740]   Yeah, it's very sophisticated.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:19.740]   How do you do that again?
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.100]   Push the two buttons simultaneously on the right side there.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.660]   Oh, it did have flash and then it sinks to your iPhone.
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.940]   They call that the David Pogue button on the iPhone because when the first iPhone came
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:35.740]   out, the prototype that Pogue had been reviewing for the New York Times had that feature and
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.220]   then it shipped without it.
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.220]   Yeah.
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.220]   Pogue said, what the hell?
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.220]   I need it.
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.740]   And so they put it they put it in eventually we took a lot of screenshots where you had
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.700]   to you had to like jailbreak the phone and install an FTP server.
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.820]   Tell that into the it was the worst.
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.660]   Well, Android screenshots took us was incredibly painful for the first few years.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.660]   Oh, really?
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.660]   It was the SDK to get them.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.060]   And then you could do it on the screen.
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.180]   Yeah, and it turns out that you know, giving people the occasion to take screenshots means
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.860]   they take a lot of screenshots and advertise your product for you.
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.460]   Well, what also means remember the first year of the iPhone where it was the only way to
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.580]   like save things to a place where you find them again.
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.420]   And it was the only way to do a lot of multitasking that I was using it as my scrapbook just so
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.180]   that here is something I'm looking at on my phone that's important.
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.860]   Oh, no, no, I'm sorry.
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.620]   I'm reminding I'm reminding myself I'm reliving bad experiences where okay, I'm here
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.060]   here's here is the address in the map of the place I want to go to.
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.460]   And now I'm going to screenshot this because I know that if I try to wake if I close the
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.020]   phone and open up again, it will show me this for one half a second and then Safari will
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:39.180]   clear the screen, try to reload the page and then fail.
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.340]   And now I won't know the address of the place I need to go to.
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.220]   So yes, the screenshot feature was incredibly important on the first iPhone.
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.180]   There are a good the number of Apple watches on eBay.
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.540]   I don't know if it says safe to buy there.
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.340]   And some of them are close to the actual price.
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.180]   Here's a 38 millimeter black sport for 375.
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.180]   That's not much more.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.460]   I think for some people, I don't think it's all speculators.
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.540]   I think some people bought a few different models wondering which one they'd get first
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.740]   or what they'd like more, configuring that it was so constrained that they could sell
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.220]   them even if it's not for much of a mark.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.060]   Yeah, a lot of these are sport models.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.700]   In fact, so far, all the ones I'm seeing are sport models, but I guess they're doing sorting
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:14.700]   by price.
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:15.700]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.580]   So yeah, and then you can get a lot higher.
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:22.020]   I mean, they're people selling the one you just got for 600 bucks.
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.380]   That's more you paid the black sport.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.380]   Certainly.
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.380]   Space gray pre-order $500.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.980]   Yeah, there's hundreds of these.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.460]   I do think that this market is going to, I mean, I think you'll still be able to sell
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.660]   them for basically cost, but at some point they'll be freely available.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:38.660]   Yeah.
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.740]   Right now, people are trying to make an extra hundred bucks or whatever, because you can
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:46.220]   get it now from me, or you can get it in, you know, six weeks or eight weeks from out.
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.900]   And again, it's only been three weeks.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:48.900]   I love her as writing.
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.900]   I ordered it in the first 10 minutes and I'm just getting mine today.
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.340]   Well, three weeks is not the end of the world.
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.340]   It depends on the band too.
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.340]   Like the water and buckle, you can't get separately still and the link brace is took
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.460]   for a long time to ship compared to the other ones.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:05.900]   People I worry, I feel bad for people who broke their watch because for you, you're
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.220]   not going to get a replacement for a while, right?
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:13.380]   Yeah, well, I wouldn't be surprised if they have some in stock, some, you know, some replacements
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.740]   in stock at the Apple stores.
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:19.420]   So if you come in with one that's faulty or broken, they might be able to do a swap.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.860]   You have those stories.
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:21.860]   You have two incidents.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.620]   If you get AppleCare Plus, they will replace it for a fee twice just due to accidental
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:26.700]   breakage or other kinds of damage.
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:30.060]   Well, the question is whether you'll get it right away is when will you get it, right?
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.620]   Yeah, and it might depend on the size and popularity.
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.620]   Yeah, which one you're getting.
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.620]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.620]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.940]   What is our general sense of which ones are available now?
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.180]   Is there like a...
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.740]   The thirty-eighths are much more readily available.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:43.740]   It's easy to get the small ones.
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:44.740]   Yeah.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:49.500]   I was surprised when I was looking at the ordering page a couple of weeks ago, I was surprised
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.660]   that all colors have the same level of inavailability.
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:57.940]   I was thinking, okay, is anybody not buying, let's say, the large one with the pink band
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.140]   as nope, it's still as hard as it gets, is anything else?
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.540]   So we have a couple visiting today.
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.580]   I can see you have an Apple Watch 42, right?
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.580]   Stainless steel.
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.260]   Nothing on your wrist, though, young lady.
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.260]   No Apple Watch.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.420]   We're working on her.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.420]   Working on her.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:18.060]   How is he going to send you his heartbeat if he doesn't have an Apple Watch?
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.060]   Stronger.
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.060]   She's pulling up her iPad there.
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.060]   All right, that's fair.
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.140]   You spent enough money with Apple.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.140]   One sport watch.
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:30.100]   I always check now with the audiences in the studio because I don't yet see a majority
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.860]   of Apple watches.
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.580]   Even at Mac Break Weekly, there's only two people right with Apple watches.
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.340]   Nobody else, just the two, out of five.
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.340]   That's 40%.
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.340]   That's 40%.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.820]   That's 100% of the hosts, though, now.
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.740]   Thanks to Andy, finally giving up on Android.
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.220]   It was not thank you very much.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.140]   For Mac Break purposes.
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:55.900]   See, the frightening thing for you, Leo, is that how quickly you flip sometimes, finally
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.900]   giving up on Android.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:01.500]   A couple of weeks ago, didn't you say something about how Android is materially superior
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.500]   in every way?
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.500]   It's objectively superior.
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.380]   And I stand by that.
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:10.340]   However, I have to say, I'm getting used to the iPhone.
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:19.660]   Well, I have to because I have to say the Apple watch as much as I like the Urbain, which
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.980]   is the best Android Wear watch out there.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.260]   It's so butt ugly.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.660]   My wife won't let me wear it.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.660]   It's the best watch this week.
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.380]   We can wait a bit now.
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.260]   So I think it's still close.
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.420]   And you know what I'm actually starting to like is the fitness stuff.
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:34.420]   It's actually--
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.420]   Oh, it's great.
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.220]   I notice I'm working out more because I kind of like want those silver button.
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.220]   You feel bad, right?
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.220]   Like if you don't--
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.220]   It's sort of like circles.
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.220]   Yeah.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.340]   The one thing that I just before we switched, I saw a great comment from Neil Cyber, who
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.900]   was the former sell side analyst, who was talking about Apple.
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:52.940]   And he said that even if 90% of iPhone users actively hate the Apple watch, that's still
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.660]   50 million people who can buy them.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.660]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.900]   So like the size of the market is a good indicator.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:57.900]   It's a good market.
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:04.060]   Apple tends to aim higher than we know you hate it, but enough of you will not hate it.
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.060]   It's interesting.
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.020]   I had a-- so mine arrived on Thursday.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:11.900]   And I was-- I set it up on Friday, was wearing it like all day Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:18.860]   Month yesterday, I had one of those often travel days where-- Amtrak to New York, it had
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:24.540]   a product launch and then an interview with an executive and a whole bunch of the stuff,
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.580]   plus seeing two friends and then getting back on the train at 750.
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.220]   And so I'm packing-- I'm setting up what I want to take on Saturday, on Sunday night.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.300]   And I'm thinking, do I-- I've had three days worth of experience with the Apple watch.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:42.500]   Am I excited enough about it that I'm going to use it as my wearable on this trip tomorrow?
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.020]   And then that's when I took it off and I put my Android Wear watch on.
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.660]   Because it's interesting.
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:53.620]   I mean, I've had a lot of-- I'm not going to review it until I've had it for about a
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.780]   month.
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:21:01.140]   But it's-- I think it was-- one thing that was significant is that I was taking notes
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.060]   on my observations as I go.
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:09.580]   And after trying to do it two or three or four times with the Apple watch, I found myself
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:14.700]   saying, OK, I'm going to now just simply put my Android Wear watch on the other wrist
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.420]   because that lets me take a note and ever note with one tap and then never do anything
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.420]   else.
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:23.620]   And it's too hard to do on the Apple watch for me to do it in such a casual way.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.620]   So it's interesting.
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:30.100]   The other piece of news is that I thought that I could really test it by-- I'll just
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.540]   tether my iPhone to my Android phone and do it that way.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.020]   Then I realized that, no, that's not a fair test.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.340]   So my nano sim is now inside my iPhone 6.
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:43.940]   I am officially switching back to iOS for an entire month because I don't want to-- I
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.380]   don't want this to have like second class settings that--
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.380]   Right.
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.380]   --that's what I'm doing, too.
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.380]   That's what you got here.
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:54.500]   And it'll also be sort of a reality check on my switching to Android to see if-- OK,
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.220]   I have never stopped using iOS.
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.100]   I never even stopped using the iPhone.
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.980]   It certainly stopped being like my primary phone.
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:04.100]   And OK, we'll go back to this and rely on it for everything and we'll see how different
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.100]   that is.
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.140]   There was one thing that was super interesting for us is we had a big network wide meeting
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.140]   last week.
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.940]   And I was there and Trinity was there and a few other people.
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:14.460]   And because we have Android sites and other sites, there was a ton of smart watches there.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.900]   We both had the Apple watch.
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:16.900]   There was the Urbain.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.900]   There was the Moto.
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.260]   There was I think a Samsung watch, but there was just a wide variety.
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.020]   And Trinity Caldwell went and put them all on her arm.
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.020]   And the--
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.020]   Been there, done that.
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.660]   Not even the 42.
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:33.140]   The 38-millimeter Apple watch was the only one that looked even approach her scale.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:37.940]   So some of us have the luxury of thinking and choosing, but I think still not everyone
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:38.940]   is well-served.
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:39.940]   Look how big that Urbain.
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.140]   I think the Urbain is 52 millimeters or 58.
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.140]   It's very, very big.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:48.780]   Also, just that is absolutely true, Nispeak knowledge.
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:55.300]   It also-- Nispeak knowledge that not a whole lot of people will say 350 to 400 to 600
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.860]   hundred dollars for a watch that I don't know if I need or if I can actually use.
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.260]   There's something to be said for 200 and 250 dollars as well.
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.820]   Anybody have an Apple watch charger in the house?
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.100]   Because you're right.
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.020]   It's now paused.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.500]   It says, "Installation Pause to install the update.
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:15.500]   Apple watch must be connected to its charger and charge at least 50 percent.
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.500]   Neen, neen, neen, neen.
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.140]   Now they don't want you to brick your watch, Leo.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.140]   I guess--
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.020]   You hated that so much that you said "charger."
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.500]   And I thought you said "jar-jar."
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.500]   "jar-jar, the Apple watch charger."
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.500]   The Apple watch charger.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.500]   The Apple watch charger.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.500]   The Apple watch charger.
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.700]   Misa Nisa, charge your watcher.
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.180]   No, there's nothing in there.
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.180]   You're going to--
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.660]   Hey, actually, yeah, bring me-- maybe I could do it with one of my Qi chargers.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.660]   No, it's--
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:37.660]   It's one way, right?
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.500]   It's-- yeah, so there's two components in the Apple watch charger.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.180]   It needs the Qi and it needs the magnet.
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.340]   And if you don't have both things, it won't charge.
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.740]   Oh, I should try it.
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:46.740]   Mm.
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:47.740]   So close.
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.740]   Yeah, so close.
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.740]   We tried hacking it with a variety of different--
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:52.740]   Here's--
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.740]   --the car, sir.
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:54.740]   It's OK.
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:55.740]   That's not necessary.
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:56.740]   We've got--
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.300]   But if you decide you want to update your watch and you go to get the charger to do that,
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.020]   at that point I would-- I will borrow, but please don't.
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:08.700]   No, I would be rude and mean.
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.380]   I'll just have to wait until I get home like every other person in the world.
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.540]   Your patience will be rewarding.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.540]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:15.540]   Like it's--
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.820]   Battery, battery, by the way, on the watch.
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.820]   We were all worried.
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.780]   None-- no problems, zero, none at all, right?
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.220]   It looks to me like Apple did some serious work in the last six months after they announced
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.900]   it to beat some sort of internal metric for battery life.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:29.900]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:35.500]   Because I've never-- I've heard from some women who do a lot of fitness stuff that the
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.500]   38 has some--
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.500]   38 is not--
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.140]   --has some issues because it's battery smaller.
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.540]   You used to lose-- used her 38 up yesterday by 6 p.m.
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:44.540]   Because she works out five hours a day.
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.660]   And the fitness stuff takes more battery.
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:47.660]   That's right.
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.900]   You can turn off the heart rate metering, but if you leave that on at full, it will use
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.900]   the battery.
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.380]   But for me, I haven't had a problem.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.380]   I feel like they actually kind of overshot.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:59.460]   But I have heard that with the smaller watch and with a lot of fitness stuff, you can run
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.460]   into trouble.
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.460]   I think we did yesterday, actually.
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.940]   But I'm always 50% when I go to bed.
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:04.940]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:05.940]   It's fine.
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:06.940]   They did a good job for me anyway.
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.060]   That's because I'm pretty sedentary.
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.660]   And I have no heartbeat.
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.660]   I burnt it down twice by just covering it, like literally using it constantly for two
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.660]   days to do coverage.
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.460]   But since I've been using it like a quasi-normal person, it's always between 30 and 40 every
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.460]   night.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.460]   I'm pretty impressed.
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.140]   I mean, I'm getting about the same battery life out of it that I'm getting out of the
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:28.900]   Moto 360, which is about at least count on it a full day and usually a day and then into
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.940]   the next morning as well, which is more important, more impressive because when you consider
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.100]   that it really does seem as though the Apple Watch is doing a lot more and there's a lot
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.100]   more depth to what it's doing.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.180]   I don't know whether that translates.
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:45.500]   And well, it also needs to be stated that the Moto 360 has a really bad processor for
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.300]   the sort of device it is.
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.100]   But they really did get that absolute break.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.420]   You had terrible battery life when it first came out.
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.340]   Yeah, that's the way it was.
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.780]   That's another thing I wanted to put, mention.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.300]   Like any time you read or hear anybody say anything negative about Apple Watch, realize
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.340]   that the thing's been out for about three weeks.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:05.860]   And when the Moto 360, again, I'm a big fan of the 360 as you heard me say all the time,
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.860]   when it was released, Android Wear had been out for several months already.
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:15.220]   And even then, it wasn't until one or two updates that they really got it going the way
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.460]   that I think it needed to be done.
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:22.260]   And even given all of that, when I first started wearing it in September, I really didn't like
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.500]   it the first day.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.900]   I started to like it after a weekend and it took me a couple of weeks when I'd gotten
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:28.900]   it dialed up.
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.660]   When I got it, it settings dialed in the way I wanted it to.
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:35.220]   When I got the applications that I really wanted to use installed on it.
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:39.820]   And more importantly, when I started to figure out features that I can use and features that
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:43.500]   I can disable and not let distract me, that's when I really became a fan of it.
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:47.260]   So that's why anytime you hear somebody try to pronounce something about Apple Watch after
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:51.460]   only a few days with it, definitely take it within the context of this is a brand new
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:52.460]   thing.
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.540]   And maybe this person gave it another few weeks' their opinion might be different.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.660]   Which okay, I'm going to do a little poll here.
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.260]   Which watch face are you using Andy?
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.460]   I don't like any of them.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.460]   I'm just using this is just a.
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.460]   I hate them all.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.460]   It's turned off.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.460]   No, I don't hate them all.
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.460]   It's just like these are all like.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.460]   Press the crown.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:10.460]   There you go.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   That's what I'm using to.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:15.220]   So to me, I don't mean this early as a complaint.
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.340]   They're all like just equally okay, it is a watch face.
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.340]   Got it.
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.140]   So for me it's just choose to be analog or digital.
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.220]   I like utility and my complication.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.140]   This is going to be the new thing everybody talks about.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:31.620]   I like utility and my complications are fitness, weather and calendar.
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.620]   How about you Jason?
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:33.620]   Very nice.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:34.620]   I am also using utility.
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.900]   But you're looking at a guy who's written, I'm writing a series of fast and world reviews
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.700]   of the each individual watch face.
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.700]   Oh Lord.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.700]   I'm using utility.
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.500]   Mickey Mouse is just so.
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.260]   I think that the watch is lacking.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.260]   That's the demo watch face.
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.020]   I think it's lacking in digital faces.
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.420]   There's really only modular.
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.460]   And I think modular is not good enough on its own.
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.020]   It's got some advantages but I don't like it for other reasons.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.300]   I don't like that at the times in the upper right corner.
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.540]   But utility is working for me.
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.540]   I only have one.
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:02.700]   Use day date on the utility.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.620]   Yeah, I've got the day date and I think I've got the fitness rings and that's it right
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.620]   now.
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.140]   I like to sweep second hand as well.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.340]   I have it red.
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.340]   Color is yours.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.340]   Yellow.
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.340]   It was red for a while.
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.340]   You should try yellow.
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.340]   It's interesting.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:20.580]   But it's not too many analog hands, not enough digital faces.
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:26.340]   You can make multiple presets basically of the same face with different complications.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.340]   So that's kind of nice.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.140]   But yeah, I agree with Andy.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.700]   They're okay.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:35.060]   And it feels like there needs to be more work here either from Apple or from third parties
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.180]   if they open it up.
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.540]   But it's just they're all fine or at least well some of them are fine.
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.540]   Some of them are weird and the complications are nice.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:47.540]   But there's more that can be done there and including more digital faces, more ones that
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.460]   actually just show you the time as numbers.
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.300]   I'm really looking forward to third party complications.
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.180]   That's going to be that that to me is going to open up.
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:29:00.340]   I do it's the originally I would have thought that all the space in the corners is wasted
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.340]   space.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.860]   But once you have the ability to say look, there is a certain thing that certain application
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.460]   does that is so important to me that even if all there is is there is a circle in the
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:12.180]   corner that is one of four colors telling me the situation about whether cameras or whatever
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.260]   it turned on.
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:17.140]   And just be able to do that like just be alerted to something when I'm just checking
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.260]   the time would be such a huge thing.
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.260]   Totally.
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.020]   Renee, which face are you using?
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:26.540]   So right now you actually caught me at a weird stage because I was I'm trying all the different
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.540]   I like that one.
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.540]   I like that one.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:29.540]   Is that the jellyfish?
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:30.540]   No, that's solar.
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.540]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:32.540]   Well, I like that one too.
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.540]   But I would never use it.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:37.100]   It's pretty but it's like, well, I don't I'm going to walk.
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:40.020]   I'm done all the fancy ones like that like include it.
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.220]   I demo them and they're fine.
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.540]   And then after eight minutes, it's like, okay, I think I've seen everything I would
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:45.540]   ever like to see.
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.180]   So I have some rationale though.
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.780]   I'm not I'm not just doing this in a vacuum.
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:53.180]   So I usually have modular on because it it lets me have, you know, the activity, the
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:57.420]   battery, the calendar appointments and I had battery for a while before I really trusted
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.420]   it.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.420]   Now I've removed that.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:00.420]   Me too.
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.420]   And I really like to complications.
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.100]   I like them so much to do this experiment this weekend where I took my Apple watch off
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.340]   during the day for the first time since I got it.
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.140]   And I took it left it off for a couple hours.
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:11.380]   And I thought it'd be the notifications that I'd miss and I'd have to go running back to
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.780]   my iPhone like it's 2014 or something.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:17.980]   But then immediately I was glancing at my wrist and all I saw was wrist and I realized
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.020]   I'd become so dependent on just quickly alert like quickly seeing what the temperature was,
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.220]   what the next calendar appointment was, what my activity level was.
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:28.820]   I was used to being able to just get to the stopwatch, get to the timer that not only
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:32.460]   did I really like that they were on my watch, but I really wanted them on my iPhone lock
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:36.100]   screen as well because then it would just turn on and I'd see them and there'd be such
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.740]   a possibility there.
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:42.700]   So I basically have either utility or modular on when I'm working and then when I'm not
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:48.060]   working, I purposely put it on a very minimal watch phase just so that I don't drive myself
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.540]   crazy staying up to date all the time.
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.540]   Yeah, that's absolutely correct.
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.780]   This is going to be such a different device when developed or if and when developers get
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:59.460]   to really go nuts developing not just little apps for it but their own watch faces.
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:04.420]   When one of the most useful watch faces I ever had on the 360 was during that month where
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.580]   it was just snowing every three days.
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.340]   We had that horrible, horrible month in February.
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:13.940]   I switched to my full time watch face was a watch face that has the time and a really
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:19.020]   detailed granulated daily weather map that was done by weather.
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.180]   I think it was done by weather underground it could be wrong.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.740]   But so it wasn't that I would be checking the time all the time but that excuse me,
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:25.740]   checking the weather all the time.
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:29.540]   But every now and then I glance at the watch to see what time it is and say, "Oh, damn it,
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.020]   it's going to be snowing at 2 p.m."
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.900]   I better get to FedEx right now instead of later in the afternoon.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.260]   And so when Renee is absolutely right, once you have the ability to say, "This is what's
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:43.860]   important to me and my life right now," not only here's the face I want to look into
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:47.700]   each of the 40 or 50 times a day that I check the time but also here's the information that
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.260]   I don't even want to have to do anything to get this information.
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.100]   This is how important it is.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:56.300]   Boy, it's going to be almost an entirely new device when that happens.
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.900]   Jason's planning you can set up a couple.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:01.700]   So I have two versions of Modular One that has all the fitness stuff so I can just look
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.180]   new timer, stop watches, activity.
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.940]   And there's one that just has a lot of data stuff.
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:10.220]   And even if you're a businessman, you could have stocks and you could have time zones for
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.220]   your other offices.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.900]   So there's a lot of variety.
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.580]   And it's all running off something called Nano TimeKit and Mark Gurman from N2F5Mac was
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:20.140]   reporting that they're already considering the third-party complications because that
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.860]   framework, like most of Apple's frameworks, can be extended.
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.340]   So it's going to be really interesting to see.
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.420]   He mentioned, for example, you'd see a count of how many tweets you have.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.340]   And I really like that from a security standpoint.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:34.860]   I'm not a huge fan of lock screen notifications or widgets because they leak a lot of information.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:38.900]   No one needs a passcode to see my messages even to see who sent me messages or to pull
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.100]   down my widgets.
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:44.580]   But this, if it just sees the amount of tweets and you have to be either logged in or maintain
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:49.100]   skin contact to get the actual information, that's a huge privacy win as well for me.
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.100]   I tried yellow.
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.100]   I just can't live with it.
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.100]   I've gone back to red.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.100]   All right.
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.100]   All right.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.100]   Special flower.
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.100]   That's fine.
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.100]   Okay.
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.900]   Everybody is too light under a perfectly-
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.140]   I know.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:04.020]   But you saw how I thought was doing it on the video, but you saw it.
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.020]   You save it.
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:08.020]   And I wondered at first when I saw that plus sign at the end of the faces, I thought,
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.260]   oh, I can add other faces.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:10.260]   No.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.100]   All you can do is save existing configurations as a solution.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.100]   And if you delete one by accident, you can get it back.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.100]   Oh, you can.
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.100]   Yeah.
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.100]   Several people deleted some watch faces by accident.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.700]   Ah, interesting.
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.460]   I deleted them on purpose because I didn't like them.
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.460]   What happens?
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.300]   They just come back.
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.300]   They just come back.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.260]   You just wipe up the leaf.
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.660]   You tap the plus and you can pick what face you want.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:32.660]   Oh, I get it.
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.820]   So it comes pre-populated with all the faces, but you can delete them and add it back.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.380]   So if I want to delete the flower face, how do I delete it?
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:39.620]   You slide it up, I think.
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:40.620]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:41.620]   Hold it down for a second.
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.540]   And then when it goes into edit mode, slide it up.
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.540]   All right.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.540]   Slide it up.
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:46.940]   Oh, little red trash can.
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:47.940]   Does it do poof?
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:48.940]   No.
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:49.940]   It just goes away.
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:50.940]   No scuff.
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:51.940]   First all's gone.
[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:52.940]   This is nice.
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.940]   Use it to reorder if there's watch faces.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.940]   There's no fun apples.
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:56.940]   Oh, you could reorder them that way.
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.940]   If you use watch faces a lot, you can delete them and then add them back in the order you
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.940]   want to have them so you can go quickly between two of them.
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:05.820]   I'll keep Mickey and I'll keep utility.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.060]   Maybe I'll keep modular in deference to Renee Richie.
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.220]   You know, one of the funny things about the--
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.860]   I will not keep this one.
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:12.860]   This is dopey.
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.020]   That's the giant number.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.020]   If you have vision problems.
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.620]   It's for-- yeah, people with vision problems, obviously.
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:22.340]   So one of the weird interim places that Apple is right now is they've gotten rid of the
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:26.040]   puff of smoke from various things, including dragging things out of the dock, but on the
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.220]   Mac, the sound effect is still there.
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.540]   So it doesn't poof anymore, but it makes the poof sound.
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.540]   What?
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:32.540]   What?
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:36.220]   So now I have two modulators because I saved one and so I can go--
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.220]   Yeah.
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.220]   And that's kind of handy.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:39.220]   I can be totally different.
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.220]   I can be totally different.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.220]   Mickey modular?
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.220]   Modular?
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:43.220]   Then Mickey then modular.
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:44.220]   Right.
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.220]   But I could reorder them if I wish.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.220]   Yeah.
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.220]   Yeah.
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:48.580]   It's a big deal.
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.540]   I think personalization on this watch is going to be more important than on any other
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:56.220]   product Apple has ever done because you can't get more intimate-- a device that you hold
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:35:00.420]   and you surround with your hands is pretty intimate, but a device that you wear on your
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:04.940]   body that you always have constant skin to contact with, nothing is more personal.
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.100]   And I think there's nothing-- and also text into--
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.100]   The microfiber.
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.100]   Yes.
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.100]   Yeah.
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.620]   It's like nothing's going to-- people are going to want and really appreciate the ability
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:19.860]   to make this really emphatically my watch that not only aesthetically but also it's really
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.900]   suited for this one thing that I'm doing right now today.
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:26.920]   I mean, I would love to-- with a couple of taps, switch it from trying to get to the--
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.740]   trying to get onto my flight mode for my house to I am now home.
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.780]   I don't have to leave for another two weeks mode.
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:37.900]   You're right to, by the way, Andy, at least try it for a month because I find that a lot
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:42.140]   of these customizations don't start occurring to you till you've used it for a while and
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.700]   then you maybe change how you use glances and things like that.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:46.700]   Exactly.
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:50.980]   And so it's one thing that I really wish that Apple changes is the ability to-- all the
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:54.980]   different ways you can respond to a notification, there should be one extra button that says
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:36:01.820]   never accept notifications from this app ever again because right now you can-- if there's--
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:09.260]   I did it-- there was a flicker was one of the first apps that like every time someone
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:12.380]   follows my stream on flicker, I would get a notification on the watch.
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.380]   No thanks.
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.940]   And it's like that's very easy to say, yeah, no, never put that on my watch ever again.
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:20.420]   And it kind of surprised me that I had to actually go to the phone and dig into settings
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.420]   in order to make that happen when really the point of annoyance is the best time and place
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.900]   to deal with that.
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:33.340]   Did you notice with the 1.01 Renee, any other-- like speed?
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.340]   Was it speedier?
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.900]   Did you notice how is Siri better?
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.380]   Have you noticed anything yet?
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:41.580]   Yeah, it's the very-- what's the right word?
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.780]   Amorphous performance enhancement.
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.940]   So everything is supposed to be a little bit cleaner.
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:48.660]   It's going to take you a couple of days though because when you juggle the bits, it's hard
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.460]   to tell exactly what's changed until you've been using it like the way you used the original
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.460]   version.
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:54.460]   Right.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:55.460]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:56.460]   Enough.
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.460]   Oh, one more thing I'll just mention.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:58.460]   Go ahead.
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:59.460]   I wanted to say I said there were no digital faces.
[00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.460]   There are five digital faces.
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:04.020]   I just-- I have a hard time putting the ones that have pictures or animations or things
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:09.940]   in the same category as modular and the extra large because those are about the time and
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.740]   the others I feel like the time is sort of secondary.
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:16.980]   I would like to see more things with complication options and the digital time and we don't
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:17.980]   have a lot of those.
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:18.980]   We really only have the one.
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.620]   I don't really like digital time.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.420]   Isn't that strange that with a watch I actually want a pie face?
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.180]   A lot of people talk about that.
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:28.620]   Oh, it's silly to have analog hands on a digital watch.
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:29.620]   No.
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:33.820]   One of the first watches I ever had was an LCD that did the analog hands.
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.820]   Yeah.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:35.820]   And I thought it was cool.
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.820]   And I kind of like being able to look at my wrist and say, oh, it's about a quarter to
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:38.820]   one.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.580]   Instead of saying, it is 1243, exactly.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.580]   Who cares?
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:47.580]   That's what the younger generation, you kids don't appreciate because we had to learn-- we
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:52.380]   had in kindergarten and first grade they had wooden clocks with movable hands so you could
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.980]   learn the big hand, little hand, all that stuff.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.940]   It was a lot of work to learn it.
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:02.420]   But what it does give you is some sort of relative sense of passing time as opposed to
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:05.220]   with a digital, it's always exactly this minute.
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.380]   When you're looking at a pie face, you kind of know, oh, it's almost-- you know, as we're
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:13.380]   moving up onto this hour, I don't know, I do think that there's something to be said
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.380]   for that.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.780]   The other thing I was going to mention yesterday on iOS today, we talked about calibrating
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:18.780]   the watch.
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:25.220]   So last night, Lisa and I took a walk and recorded it in the workout app so we could
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:26.460]   get the GPS in the steps.
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:29.660]   Like, was it-- you Renee who told me to do this, somebody told me to do this.
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:30.660]   Yeah.
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:31.660]   Now we'll see if it's more accurate.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.300]   Although I guess there are some accuracy issues because that's one of the things this
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.300]   updated addresses.
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:39.180]   It's a smart idea to use your-- if you know the steps you take and you know the distance
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:42.500]   you traveled, you can make some really smart guesses about what your stride length is.
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.140]   So then if you don't have the GPS, some other time, like you leave the phone at home, you
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.140]   can't watch.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.140]   It'll do a better job.
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.620]   It has an idea of how long you travel.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:55.460]   Yeah, we took like a two mile walk and it knows-- except for I rode the segue for a little
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:58.740]   bit, which I think is going to very much confuse it, is to stride.
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.980]   My god, you must be wearing seven league boots.
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:06.940]   But most of it, you could see how many steps-- it knows how many steps you take.
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.500]   And then it knows how far you went.
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.500]   And it can--
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.500]   You can figure it out.
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:14.140]   --to a great degree, much more so than a jawbone or any other device can tell exactly
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.140]   what your stride is.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.860]   They recommend two to three times to take your iPhone for two to three times.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:18.860]   Really?
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:19.860]   Yeah, when you start working out.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.340]   I got to say one thing though.
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.140]   I do like the fitness stuff.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:28.540]   I also-- as a side thing, I also like the fact that when I set up the Microsoft Band, it
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:32.180]   set a step goal that was ambitious and a calorie goal that was ambitious.
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:35.460]   When I set up the watch and I said, OK, how old are you?
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.460]   There you go.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.620]   How much do you weigh?
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.780]   OK, how about if we try to do 400 steps?
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:41.780]   Me too.
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:42.780]   Me too.
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.780]   Like, yay.
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:44.780]   Thank you, watch.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.020]   I love you, watch.
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.860]   It's like, you understand me.
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.380]   You understand that it's going to take some time to change my life, though.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:59.780]   But the thing that I really need to disable is the stand up thing because it's like, I'm
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:00.780]   riding, riding, riding.
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:01.780]   I get a tap say.
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:02.780]   It's time to stand up.
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:03.780]   No, it isn't.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:04.780]   It's time for me to finish this sentence.
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.780]   Watch.
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:08.180]   Stop annoying me with this sort of stuff.
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.340]   I just discovered something kind of cool.
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.460]   See, it does take a while.
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.580]   All devices take a while to learn.
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.580]   That's why I like to review phones for many weeks.
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:19.980]   But boy, there's a lot of stuff hidden here.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:21.700]   So I have the stopwatch.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:23.740]   I just added the stopwatch complication.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:28.780]   When you force touch the stopwatch, you can change from analog to digital to graph to
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:29.780]   hybrid.
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.580]   You can actually change what the stopwatch looks like.
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:33.580]   It's why my Apple that?
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.580]   Jesus, now you did that.
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.580]   I gotcha.
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:36.580]   It's a good tip.
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.580]   Good tip.
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:38.580]   I tipped you yesterday.
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.580]   You took me to the floor.
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.660]   I think the good tip is force touch everything.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.660]   Yes.
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:43.660]   All the things.
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:47.020]   Leo, this is why my Apple Watch review is 20,000 words.
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.020]   Yeah, there's really.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:49.540]   Wow, there's a lot to say.
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:50.540]   All right.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.540]   Hey, Jeff Needles.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.060]   Do you have a watch charger here?
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.060]   He's my Apple guru.
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.340]   Oh, you mean force touch in the stopwatch app?
[00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.900]   Once you're into the stopwatch.
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:00.900]   Oh crap.
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.820]   Oh, no, not in the app.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.020]   I didn't have to do it from the app.
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.180]   I did it from the watch face.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:11.460]   So when I, you know, because I have a stopwatch on my watch face, then you force touch that.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:13.460]   But you're in the app.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:14.460]   Oh crap.
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:15.460]   By touching the complication, you move to the app.
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:16.460]   Oh, shut up.
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:17.460]   That's a good tip.
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.460]   Fast app launch.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.460]   I tipped you again, Leo.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.460]   Oh, shut up.
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:24.060]   Can you say hey, slow mo launch stopwatch?
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.060]   Yeah.
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.060]   Or open stopwatch.
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:27.380]   Can you say start stopwatch?
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:28.380]   Would it like start it?
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.380]   No, I don't think so.
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.980]   Slow mo's not that smart.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.380]   And you know why we use stopwatch.
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:35.300]   I prefer a hoi timepiece.
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.300]   Hoi timepiece.
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.300]   Hoi.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.660]   Hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi timepiece.
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:43.260]   Let's take a, let's take a little tiny break.
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:44.500]   Yeah, you could tell a difference.
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:49.380]   You have force touch and a long press because it go, it vibrates.
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:50.820]   It gives you a little hint.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:54.300]   Like, stop touching me.
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:59.060]   Last quick comment that I really, I'm still trying to suss out what a force touch means.
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.060]   I know.
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.260]   What should I expect to happen when I force touch something?
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:03.260]   You can.
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.540]   And I don't think I've figured that out yet.
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.980]   But again, I'm only four days old with this.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:09.100]   So I don't expect to have figured things out.
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.100]   It does start to stopwatch.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.340]   If you ask it, I just try to.
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:13.340]   Okay.
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:17.700]   But I can't try it on the air because then everybody's watches will start.
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.700]   It's for science.
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:19.700]   Okay, let me do it.
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:20.700]   Okay.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.700]   Okay.
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:22.700]   Hey, Siri.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.540]   Hey, Siri.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:28.220]   That's the second problem.
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.220]   That's another problem.
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.220]   Maybe they fixed that.
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:31.220]   So you double tap, right?
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.220]   No, no, hold it down.
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.220]   I double tap really.
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.460]   Really wish Siri were easy to open.
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.020]   Easier, not just that.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.020]   Start.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.020]   Stopwatch.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.020]   Forget it.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:43.180]   It says, I'm not sure what you said, Leo.
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.180]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:45.180]   Start.
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.180]   Stop watching.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.940]   That studio with nobody talking.
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:48.940]   Yeah.
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:49.940]   Okay.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:50.940]   Start.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:51.940]   Stopwatch.
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:52.940]   No, it didn't.
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:53.940]   It just launched it.
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:54.940]   It just opens the starwatch.
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:55.940]   Stopwatch it.
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:56.940]   Look at that.
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:57.940]   I love that one.
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:59.740]   Look at these three dials and I feel like an air pilot.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:00.740]   Look at that.
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:12.740]   Oh, as things are going fast, it looks like my utility meter when all the chips are on.
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.460]   Our show today brought to you by SmartThings.
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.620]   Actually, this would be a really good use for SmartThings.
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:21.700]   If your power bill is going through the roof, SmartThings will help you keep it under control.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:24.860]   SmartThings is the ultimate way to automate your home.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:28.860]   I know we've all kind of dabbled in home automation.
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:33.140]   It used to be very expensive to get started and of course most companies were using proprietary
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.140]   systems.
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:38.100]   So you had different user experiences, different apps.
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.380]   SmartThings changes all that.
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:43.420]   The SmartThings hub controls so many things.
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:47.620]   In fact, if you go to smartthings.com/twit, you can look at the products and you'll see
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:53.580]   all the different things you can control with a SmartThings hub, lights, locks, security
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:55.580]   and all through a single app.
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:56.580]   That's the beauty of it.
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.020]   You don't have 15 apps for 15 different devices.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:04.420]   You've got one iOS Android or Windows phone app and because it's an open platform, SmartThings
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:09.460]   works just as well with its own sensors as it does with Dropcam and Schlage, locks and
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:15.500]   Honeywell thermostats and your Philips Hue lights, Renee and I are Hue Lights fans.
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.580]   SmartThings won the 2015 Editors Choice Awards CES this year.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.620]   You could turn your lights on and off from your phone.
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.020]   Well, power, let's save power.
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:24.900]   They have a SmartThings plug.
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:29.540]   So you can say, "Hey, let's power down for a bit and save some money."
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:30.540]   Security, you bet.
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:33.300]   Instant alerts if there's unexpected entry or movement.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:37.900]   Set a camera to take a series of photos when unwanted motion or entry is detected.
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.100]   Water detection too.
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.420]   And there's no required monthly fee.
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.780]   Maybe one of the devices does but not for smart things.
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.620]   Kids started at just $189.
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:48.620]   SmartThings is an afford.
[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:50.380]   What is that?
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:51.380]   I've not seen that one.
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.980]   The Smarter Home Security Kit.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.620]   Oh, they know what it doesn't say.
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.620]   Is that a like?
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.420]   It looks like it's probably an alarm or something.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.060]   Yeah, that's the alarm with the light blinking.
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:00.220]   Oh, that was pretty alarm.
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.740]   I got to put that on the refrigerator.
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:06.180]   Maybe it sneaks into the refrigerator in the night.

[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.260]   SmartThings.
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.500]   We're talking Macintosh.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.420]   And actually, there is Macintosh news.
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:27.700]   It's so rare.
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.660]   I should really lead with that.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.540]   Apple didn't make a big deal, a big splash.
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.260]   Did they even put out a press release?
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.660]   They did put a press release out.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:40.660]   New iMac, the 5K iMac has been updated, and there are now--
[00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:42.900]   Yeah, it's not really updated.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.900]   They sort of did a de-specced version for $300.
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:46.900]   Down to--
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:49.660]   So now it starts at $19.99 instead of $22.99.
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:50.660]   You're right, it's not an update.
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.900]   It's 2K for 5K, Jason.
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.780]   Yeah, so it's good.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:57.820]   I mean, starting at $19.99 is good.
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.300]   It'll get people more interested in the product.
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.300]   And then they'll probably-- I would recommend that most people who are thinking about getting
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:05.500]   the 5K iMac not get the low end because it's
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.820]   the non-fusion drive spinning disc model that's $19.99.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:09.820]   Right.
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.020]   I have a hard time recommending to anybody that they--
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:16.940]   I mean, if you really need to spend $200 or $300 less, then I guess you need to do it.
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:21.380]   But even just having the fusion drive to speed things out, the storage speed of a spinning
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.940]   disc is just a major speed concern.
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:26.660]   So for $300, you still get an i5 for $300 less.
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:27.660]   It's a little slower.
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:28.660]   A little slower.
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:34.780]   A little bit, 3.3GHz versus 3.5 with turbo boost to 3.7 versus 3.9.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:36.820]   You still get 8GB of RAM.
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:39.060]   The biggest difference is hard drive versus fusion drive.
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.060]   Not more capacity.
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:41.060]   It's only a terabyte fusion drive.
[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.900]   It's not one of those monster ones.
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:43.900]   And you get--
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.340]   And you get the price of the other one, too.
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:52.220]   And you get the R9 M290 Radeon versus the R9 M290X.
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:54.020]   Is that a big difference?
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.020]   We don't--
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.020]   But the X.
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:58.060]   I did a search and the 290X comes up and the 290 doesn't.
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:00.220]   So I'm really wondering what happens when you lose the X.
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:01.220]   Uh.
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:02.220]   Who's the X Jason?
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:11.020]   That's 300 seems like a fairly hefty difference for the difference really between a hard drive
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:12.020]   and a fusion drive.
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.020]   Now, it was more.
[00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:15.980]   It was $500 until they dropped the price of the higher end one.
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:16.980]   OK.
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:17.980]   So the same day.
[00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:19.700]   It just seemed like a hefty difference.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:23.460]   So the $22.99 is down from $24.99 for $25.99.
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:24.460]   Oh, $24.
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.340]   That's what we bought.
[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:28.140]   The fusion drive is your experience.
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.300]   Guys, the fusion drive makes a big difference.
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:34.180]   It's better than an old slow spinning drive, right?
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.180]   It went all SSD.
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.180]   Yeah.
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:37.180]   Yeah.
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:43.260]   It would be a great solution if SSD prices had not fallen quite so low.
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:47.980]   It makes more sense for me at least to have at least a 256 or 512 gig SSD as a boot drive.
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:53.140]   And then just have a reasonably spiffy external drive for iTunes storage and all that other
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.140]   sort of stuff.
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:55.300]   So you can upgrade all of that.
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.060]   Obviously, you can go up to 32 gigs of RAM.
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:59.140]   And by the way, you should choose the RAM now, right?
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:00.700]   Because there's no slots.
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:04.300]   You can you can you can self install that's the only thing you can self install in the
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.500]   new iMac is right.
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.500]   All right.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.980]   I would go SSD.
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:11.700]   But if you really just need more storage, it is more expensive to do that.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.660]   Fusion drive is not a bad compromise if you're really price sensitive.
[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:19.140]   But I would I would spend $200 to go to fusion drive rather than just have the old spinning
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.140]   desk.
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:21.140]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.140]   It will always be some of the pain.
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:23.140]   Yeah.
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:26.900]   So you can go to a terabyte fusion drive for two if you get the base model terabyte fusion
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:30.940]   drive for 200 bucks or 256 gigs SSD for 200 bucks.
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:32.100]   Are these PCI E?
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.180]   These are the these are probably they are, right?
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.420]   So it's just basically like a laptop inside of monitor.
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:38.420]   Yeah.
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:39.900]   All right.
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:45.260]   So your advice doesn't seem like it's worth the extra 300 bucks.
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:49.340]   But then I bought the top of the line, of course, when I bought it.
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.340]   It's more future proof.
[00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:52.340]   It's Lee.
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:54.780]   I bought it for Lisa because I don't use I still have that Mac Pro, which now I deeply
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:55.780]   regret.
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.140]   I could have had a I could have had a good.
[00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:00.700]   I had a 5k.
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.060]   But I do have three monitors.
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.060]   So that's nice.
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:05.060]   I can't do that with my.
[00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:06.060]   It's crazy.
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:08.780]   Leo that it really is 2k for a 5k and you get the Mac for free.
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:10.700]   I mean, compared to 5k pricing, right?
[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:11.700]   That's the word.
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:12.700]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.380]   Because I got an expensive 4k monitor that I see a monitor.
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:18.140]   So yeah.
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:19.380]   So that's one change.
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:23.060]   And then what else they 15 inch 15 inch is the big one.
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:30.180]   They've updated the Mac book pro 15 to include force it touch force it touch.
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:35.100]   What else faster, faster solid state storage and a better discrete graphics option at
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:36.100]   the top of the chain.
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:40.060]   You got the radio on R9 M370 X.
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:44.500]   The biggest appointment for me better battery life, they said to nine hours.
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:47.620]   The biggest disappointment with both of these is that Intel still has not managed to ship
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:49.060]   Broadwell in any meaningful way.
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:53.020]   So both of these are still has well computers because Broadwell simply they just didn't
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:57.340]   not get their quad core chips out the door and the Mac book was delayed by Intel.
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:00.660]   And now these computers, I guess Apple decided it wasn't worth delaying them anymore.
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:04.860]   So they put them out with has well and Broadwell is not a huge difference, but it is a die
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:05.860]   shrink.
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:10.820]   Sky Lake's going to be the architecture change, but still there's there's benefits to having
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:15.500]   Broadwell and it's I understand 14 nanometers is really, really, really hard, but it just
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.660]   feels like Broadwell is taking forever.
[00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:21.460]   It is such a small process 14 nanometers.
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:22.460]   Yeah.
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:27.060]   So this if you want a 15, obviously this they still offer the old ones.
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.700]   Don't they know they don't.
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:29.940]   This is it.
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.980]   So if you want a 15, this is what you'll be getting.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:32.980]   Yeah, it's the third.
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:33.980]   The third two newches are Broadwell.
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:35.620]   If that's really important to you.
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:36.820]   I did get the 13.
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:41.260]   So I have a Broadwell in the new and the new 13, which is a new Iris graphics as well.
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:44.180]   So I mean, it depends on how much all that stuff is important to you.
[00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:48.060]   And the the another notable thing here is 4k monitor support.
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:49.500]   And this is something I wrote about this today.
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:50.500]   And I got a whole bunch of people.
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.060]   It is a confusing subject.
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:51:03.420]   So what the MacBook Pros from from 2013 late 2013 on can support 4k displays at 60.
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.420]   For instance, 60 Hertz.
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:06.420]   Which is what you want.
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:07.420]   You don't want 30.
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:08.420]   You don't want 30.
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:09.420]   You don't want 30.
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:14.140]   And the and the new MacBook will do that, but only 30 Hertz.
[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:19.220]   This display will do not just the 4k, which which previous MacBook Pros could do, but
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.980]   it will do essentially, it's like a four and a half K.
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:25.820]   It's not a full 5k display, but it can drive a large monitor can drive one of these larger
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:26.820]   kind of ultra wide.
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.780]   Do you have to get the top line 15?
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:30.140]   You need the discrete graphics.
[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.140]   So the the radion.
[00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:33.940]   Oh, that's pretty nice.
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:40.020]   So if you're if you're a pro user, you want the 15 for mobility, but at home, you can
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:41.180]   drive a fairly decent monitor.
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:45.380]   You drive a yeah, even an even bigger monitor than the previous generation.
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:48.420]   It's basically it's good for just good for future stuff.
[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.420]   Yeah.
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:54.340]   It sucks when you have to you there's something you need a year and a half after you buy something
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:57.540]   and you realize that I'm going to have to buy a brand new computer because it's this
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:00.900]   one thing I need, but it can't be supported by this one thing to have.
[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:01.900]   Right.
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:06.020]   So if Apple did come out with a 4k Thunderbolt display or something like that, theoretically,
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:10.780]   I'm not sure whether they will or not, but they would have a pretty decent well of MacBook
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:11.780]   Pros that could drive it.
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:13.460]   Why haven't they come out with a 4k?
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:16.580]   We're still waiting for I mean, like, it's all chips that support.
[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:20.420]   Broadwell was delayed. Skylake is what you need for 5k, which is where Apple pegged themselves
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:21.420]   instead of 4k.
[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:25.820]   And that's going to require Skylake and Thunderbolt 3, which I believe is being shown off at comics
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:27.900]   with the show in Taiwan tomorrow.
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:28.900]   Computex.
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:29.900]   Computex.
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:31.900]   Yeah, that's going to be shown off tomorrow.
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:36.420]   And Skylake because it's not dice rink, it's architecture, it should come out fairly quickly
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:40.340]   after Broadwell finally gets the process sorted out unless Intel decides to delay it so they
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:44.300]   can make more money off of Broadwell, which seems to be an unknown quantity right now.
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:49.540]   I'm sure Ryan Shroud and Patrick Norton will be covering that in detail on this week in
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:50.540]   computer hardware.
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:51.940]   Ryan usually goes to Computex.
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:59.340]   So if you're into chips and what's going on with Broadwell and all of that, and Skylake,
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:00.340]   what is it Skylake?
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:02.300]   Skylake is after Broadwell.
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:03.460]   This is the show to watch.
[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:09.300]   We've moved it by the way to Thursdays at 1230 Pacific 330 Eastern.
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:12.700]   So don't forget the timing this week.
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:13.700]   Yeah.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.500]   I don't know, but usually Ryan goes to Computex.
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.260]   He's a big Computex fan.
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:24.180]   That's really, if you're a chiphead, that is the show to go to, you know, PCs and so
[00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:28.900]   forth.
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:33.780]   Speaking of monitors, I guess the app, okay, so there was going to be an Apple television
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.780]   set according to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.700]   We've known about for five years.
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:44.780]   But Apple shelved it over a year ago, but I, you know, Carl Icahn, you know, says you
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:45.900]   should do it.
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.700]   So I think they should do it.
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:49.700]   What?
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:51.300]   Who the hell is Carl Icahn?
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:52.300]   Why do we care?
[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.260]   Apple is such a simple company.
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:56.860]   They enter into products like they investigate anything.
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:00.940]   If a blogger or an investor has thought of something Apple should explore, chances are Apple
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:02.780]   has been exploring it for a while now.
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:08.380]   I got the activist investor who got Apple to do a buyback and to issue it.
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:11.900]   I think it was a dividends were kind of because of I can as well.
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:15.740]   But I don't think that he's going to really convince them to change their product.
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:18.940]   They enter product categories where they believe they can make a significant difference
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:22.140]   by offering what they call great products at great margins.
[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.820]   I mean, that's the trifecta from, if they can, if they know what the problem is, they
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.940]   figure they can solve it in an interesting way.
[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:29.180]   They're going to make a great product and make a lot of money doing it.
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:32.500]   They'll do that and television has to qualify for those things in order to be a product they
[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:33.500]   want.
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:38.300]   This paragraph, Diasuquillo Waka Bayashi, who's very good at the Wall Street Journal on Apple
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:44.060]   Coverage, writes this paragraph, which is echoes what we've said all along.
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:48.180]   Apple considered an Apple branded television set in addition to an ultra high definition
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:52.820]   display they considered adding sensor equipped cameras so viewers can make video calls through
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:53.820]   the set.
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:58.500]   Ultimately, though, Apple executives didn't consider any of those features compelling enough
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:01.380]   to enter the highly competitive television market.
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:05.060]   Apple typically likes to enter a new product area with innovative technology and easier
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:06.060]   to use software.
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:11.300]   That's exactly what we've been saying all along, unless they can really lick it.
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:17.700]   I just could never figure out why Apple would, what Apple could do that would make a standalone
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:24.620]   TV set, a smart thing, given that they can already make a really nicely made little tiny
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:29.100]   box that is more within their wheelhouse that is so fewer variables where they can control
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:33.220]   almost every aspect of the manufacturing where they wouldn't have to depend on getting panels
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:36.060]   from elsewhere.
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.620]   People don't even care really about TV sets.
[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:40.980]   They care about the interface to TV sets.
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:46.980]   I just could never figure out what Apple would do by making an entire TV that would
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:50.020]   be better than simply doing a much better Apple TV.
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:55.660]   This all kind of makes sense now because jobs passed away almost three years ago, right?
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:59.260]   2012, 2013.
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:03.300]   If this Wall Street Journal report is accurate, Apple was still actively investigating the
[00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:05.260]   idea of a television set.
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:11.060]   It might be that Steve at the time was because we understand that TV interface sucks and we
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:11.900]   think we've licked it.
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:17.260]   That was the line in Walter Isaacson's biography that got everybody thinking Apple was working
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:18.260]   on TV.
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:22.620]   Yeah, although there are also a lot of rumors that this new Apple TV that we might finally
[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:27.860]   actually see at WWDC this year has been sitting for a couple of years.
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:31.380]   October 5th, 2011, I apologize almost four years ago.
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:32.900]   How has it been a long time?
[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:35.180]   So the Apple TV stuff has been out there and they've been waiting.
[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:39.740]   Maybe what they cracked was a bunch of partnership deals and then Hollywood said, "Nope, not going
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:40.740]   to do it."
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:44.620]   That's the problem with it being an eddy QZorg again is that it's constrained by content
[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:48.900]   and not constrained by hardware, which the iPhone, iPad and other devices are.
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:49.900]   Yeah.
[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:51.620]   But they dealt with that with the smartphone, right?
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:55.140]   That was one of the issues about releasing a smartphone is you have to get the carriers.
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:58.980]   Yeah, but they only need to get one carrier and this is very difficult for them to launch
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:02.580]   something and say, "We have the ABC, NESPN, but nothing else because we could only make
[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:04.700]   a deal with Disney because we know those guys."
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:08.380]   They need to have a broader set of options if they're going to launch.
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:11.820]   I think they've decided reading the tea leaves, it seems to me they've decided they're going
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:15.460]   to launch the platform and they're going to figure out the content as they go because
[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:20.820]   it is silly that this stuff has theoretically been sitting in the lab for a couple of years.
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:25.580]   It's worked out really well for Sling so far and that they had a very, very small collection
[00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:29.220]   of channels when they started off their service, but every couple of months they seemed to
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:33.980]   add one or two more and with every one or two more you add you're getting one step closer
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:38.180]   to hitting that one channel that somebody needs.
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:45.500]   For me, if Sling or Apple got access to the Turner Classic movies, that means that I spend
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:52.140]   an entire Saturday afternoon in quiet contemplation with a beverage in my hand wondering why I
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:57.060]   should get, let me walk through the decision about why I'm still subscribing to cable.
[00:57:57.060 --> 00:58:01.340]   If I can get all the TV shows I want via Hulu and the one cable channel that I don't think
[00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:04.620]   I can live without is also available to me as a subscription.
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:07.420]   The biggest trouble with the television is that you make a television set to control
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:11.740]   input zero because you want to be the first interface on that device, but if you can't
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:15.660]   offer compelling content then people are going to have to go to the cable box on two or the
[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:18.540]   Xbox on three or the Roku box on four anyway.
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:22.820]   Any advantage you had about being input zero is just gone and then without that it becomes
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:26.780]   a commodity play and you're competing against Vizio with no clear advantage.
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:30.540]   When you look at it, the Apple TV I think has been around as long as the Apple Watch
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:34.020]   and they made a conscious decision to go ahead with the Apple Watch because that hit all
[00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:37.820]   the criteria they wanted for a new product category and they said year after year this
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:40.980]   is interesting, it's in the labs but we're not going to release it because it doesn't
[00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:46.140]   meet those criteria and now maybe they're going to go ahead with Titan and not and still not
[00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:50.460]   the TV but it's because again the criteria for television just they aren't met and Apple
[00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:53.580]   really that a thousand knows forever yes is really true.
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:57.060]   They don't believe like they have to own everything or be in every space.
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:03.140]   It's hysterical that I, Carl Icahn writes an open letter to Tim Cook yesterday in which
[00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:08.540]   he says I believe you will be entering two new markets, a TV next year and an electric
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:09.540]   car.
[00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:16.460]   And it's like he's informing Tim Cook of what Apple's going to do.
[00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:17.460]   I think Tim knows.
[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:19.500]   I hate to tell you Carl.
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:20.860]   Did you see his response Leo?
[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:21.860]   What did Tim Cook say?
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:26.020]   It wasn't Tim Cook but apparently something got to Icahn and I can say well I'll trust
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:28.460]   Tim Cook to know what's better for his business.
[00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:33.620]   He says in the letter, well I'll be the first to admit you are knowledgeable in these areas.
[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:35.620]   Very panfully conceded.
[00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:36.620]   Thank you.
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:37.620]   Very strange.
[00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:41.100]   And if you feel like there's something else going on I don't know what it is.
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:46.380]   So the Apple TV we think will they announce next month at WWDC the new Apple TV?
[00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:47.380]   Yeah.
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:49.180]   And they'll announce a store, an app store?
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:53.180]   Well yeah maybe in some, but this is an interesting discussion I saw some people having
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:58.260]   today which is it's easy to jump to conclusions and say oh well they'll be games on the Apple
[00:59:58.260 --> 00:59:59.420]   TV and it'll be a console.
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:04.180]   I would not be surprised if the app support that they're talking about unveiling at WWDC
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:11.260]   is like for creating rich content experiences for your TV networks to develop apps for the
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.700]   Apple TV.
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:16.300]   I think it's a lot further on to say we're going to be just letting you make games and
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.300]   stuff that might happen.
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:19.620]   I think games are really likely.
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:23.300]   I think we'll probably have a lot of happy games come down.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:29.380]   I think games are likely but I also think that Jason has spot on that one of the advantages
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:35.700]   that for instance the Roku box has is that no deal had to be put into place for the FX
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:39.020]   network to create a channel for the Roku box.
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:42.820]   And it was just all they had to do was simply write this little very simple streaming app
[01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:43.820]   to make it work.
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.940]   Or even frankly the iPhone.
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:47.580]   Yeah exactly.
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:52.940]   And so long as Apple still has like App Store level control over saying yeah you've got,
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:56.380]   you've submitted an app that's for your brand new porn channel we're not going to let you
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:01:00.220]   have that on our device band or excuse me, you know rejected.
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:04.100]   So long as they have that ability and so long as they can still say look we can give you
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:07.700]   as long as they can still take 30% off of subscription fees.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:10.780]   That's a lot of upside for Apple.
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:14.740]   And it's I mean right now there's an SDK just Apple has to hand it off to a content provider
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:17.980]   that they have an agreement with and then they make these very thin web based, not web
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:20.460]   based but the UI is web based.
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:24.300]   It's surprising how simple these as I'm sorry I'm familiar I'm from very familiar in Roku
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:28.260]   I'm not at all familiar on what it would be like on Apple TV but I was shocked at how
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:33.100]   quick it is that you can even like essentially download a container, spend about an hour changing
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:37.140]   some things around an hour testing it and you could submit as as is evidenced by the
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:42.620]   fact that if you go to if you if you look for unlisted channels on Roku so long as you
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:46.940]   know the URL to something and so long as you type in an authorization code when you use
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:52.740]   the the website of this other channel it will let you install channels that have not been
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:56.380]   certified by Roku is not available in the official directory and you see some of the
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:02:03.260]   most bizarre stuff it's like I I'm Dave and I have a collection of training videos and
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.980]   industrial food preparation for the 1950s.
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:11.020]   So here's Dave's food industrial preparation channel on Roku because it's that simple
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.020]   to build these things.
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:15.180]   Yeah it's not that different on the Apple TV but the new one the one that Mark Herman
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:20.380]   was talking about which I think TV kit if you imagine a modern Apple TV that has a
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.420]   modern a series processor and things like metal on it.
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:24.420]   It's the process.
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:28.460]   Well yeah so the process right now is a single core a5 which is from 2012 which is worse
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:32.940]   than an it's half an iPad too but when they bring this to market with a current generation
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:37.940]   Apple a series processor and metal Andy and I talked previously about how overpowered the
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:42.300]   iPad Air 2 is when you imagine that power in a console box and I don't know how far
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:46.060]   Apple will push it because it changes the price how much you know just how far they
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:49.380]   push the hardware in there but that can run some pretty impressive games and when you
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:52.660]   start coding those games I think it starts to make the living room much more interesting
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:53.660]   for Apple.
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:03:01.620]   Yeah we're gonna take a break come back with the Steve Jobs movie and the panels thoughts.
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:02.620]   Are we gonna act it out?
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:05.140]   Yeah it's not Ashley and Kutcher don't worry.
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:13.060]   What would compel a father to give up his only child?
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:23.060]   Nailed it.
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:27.820]   And you will love to love Linda too if you're curious or if you're a problem solver if you

[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:59.900]   publishers so they get there's a swift essential training app so and they got this out very
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:02.980]   quickly after Apple announced swift and of course they keep it up to date when the new
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:07.260]   version of Swift came out they updated it they just added a course up and running with
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.460]   the Apple Watch.
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:14.420]   There's a new series called with John Kabili which I Jan Kabili which I really like photo
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:17.620]   tools weekly this is Jan.
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:23.700]   Code clinic have you done that oh so cool this is a multi course series Linda.com experts
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:29.580]   take code challenges there's a there's the watch Apple watch see they what's great about
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:33.860]   this they they shoot it so well and the people were teaching not only are great teachers
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:40.700]   they're experts in the field so you're getting such good information the the code clinic offers
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:46.980]   solutions to various code challenges in practically every language C++ C sharp Java PHP Python
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:53.900]   Ruby I'm a big I'm really into a coding so I love that they just added four new languages
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:05:02.680]   JavaScript C the old school C swift there you see the swift code clinic and R which is
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:10.060]   a very popular new functional language used for a lot of interesting stuff code clinic
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:15.880]   and R and for professional training you know if you you're already coding and C sharp but

[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:10.500]   to learn something new L Y N D A Linda.com/Macbreak we've got a special deal 10 days free that's
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:15.980]   enough to take a look at a bunch of courses free 10 day trial awaits the run of the place
[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:24.180]   at Linda.com/Macbreak all right it's really not a trailer it's a teaser not a trailer
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:28.940]   yeah yeah because you can't really tell from this what the hell's going on it is teasing
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:33.140]   so the by the way we should do a little setup Aaron Sorkin's writing it Danny Boyle's directing
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:38.820]   it we already know that the premise of this according to Sorkin is what is it three of
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:44.940]   Steve's great product launches now I don't know if I presume they're gonna flash back
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:50.940]   from those of Sorkin loves the flashback I assume that but who knows in fact the teaser
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:07:01.100]   just shows jobs on stage this they shot at the Flint Center I remember and and there's
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:05.940]   a little you hear a little dialogue you're gonna hear a Seth Rogen as Wozniak in here
[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:12.860]   let me play for you two most significant events in the 20th century allies win the war and
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:19.140]   this that's bizarre by the way to most this a very Sorkin kind of thing to say the two
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:24.740]   most significant events of the 20th century the allies win the war and this what do they
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:33.080]   mean you say what this the iPod release iPod hi what yeah I really see the Beatles the
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:37.060]   actors win the war and the Beatles coming to iTunes that's totally what it is that's totally
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:43.480]   what it is that's got a game right you never mind never mind that if that's one of the
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:48.420]   launches if the Beatles coming to iTunes is one of the launches that's gonna be totally
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:54.260]   worth it just to see like Steve Jobs act like a hand flapping fanboy oh my god oh my god
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:58.740]   god you want to be able to my god I figure I figure you know what a selfie is but we're
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:01.420]   developing this thing that could take this thing called a selfie and I want to take one
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:05.740]   with you right now it's gotta have the iPhone because that's the no iPhone it stops at the
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:10.780]   iMac I believe I think it's the I pod I think it's next maybe it's it's two of the early
[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:15.860]   ones and I think the last one is the iMac so I thought yeah cuz he says 20th century
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:25.780]   the iPod 20th century it would have to be next or the Apple II I mean I think the Mac
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:34.300]   the Mac it could be the iMac yeah the original Mac 1984 yeah all right oh god that's depressing
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:39.700]   who cares I I think the store the okay if I were gonna pick three iPad going backwards
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:45.700]   iPad iPhone iPod it should be iPhone all the movies stop before the iPhone and it's it's
[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:50.780]   appalling it's ridiculous but yeah it should be it should be the Mac the iPod and well because
[01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:54.740]   this is maybe the maybe the Mac iPhone and iPad how about that I would I would I would
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:09:00.900]   raise your iPhone go ahead well I would I would say that definitely has to be if it's
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:05.260]   my choices and I want to as a as a viewer and someone who's been reading about the history
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:08.940]   of Steve Jobs and hearing about it from other people if there are three product launches
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:15.260]   that I would want to see fact based historical storytelling that would explain to me and
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:21.860]   to other people who Steve Jobs was and what he stood for next cube definitely no not not
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:27.780]   an argument we would have to have Rob I want to say iPhone but I don't think you could
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:32.660]   do the iPhone in the iPad and I think I'd want to see the iPad because that was his last major
[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:39.020]   major launch and then for the first one I think it would have to be the first Mac yeah it might
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:42.540]   be a nice back at Flint Center you're right the official list is the Macintosh the next
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:46.900]   and then the I'm back so it's 88 and 98 because we're talking we're talking about three we're
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:50.420]   talking about three very different versions of Steve Jobs we're talking about the guy the
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:55.580]   young guy who is not hasn't been very very worldly in terms of running a technology business
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:59.100]   we've got the guy who said guess what you've been chafing the bit being a vice president
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:04.660]   guess what you get to be CEO whatever you say happens now let's see what happens and I
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:09.380]   wouldn't have tried I wouldn't chosen the I'm act because I'm act is good because now
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:14.340]   I see the per the Steve I'm fascinated by this version of Steve Jobs that had seems as though
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:20.340]   he's been educated by the experience of running next but I would like to see iOS because I
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:25.420]   think that's more of an expression of I know I'm now captaining a successful company I've
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:29.540]   got all the horses running exactly the way I want now here's the way here's what the next
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:34.260]   cube would be like if I had if I knew then what I knew now is it possible this is a trillage
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:39.540]   if it were a trilogy then it would make sense because there really and there's this two
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:47.420]   there probably three really three distinct Steve Jobs there's the young brash I kind of
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:52.980]   wild man of the early years there's the Steve Jobs in the desert the next Steve Jobs there's
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:57.260]   the hurt Steve Jobs the hurt Steve Jobs I don't find that it's the hurt Steve Jobs yeah and
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.420]   then there's the Steve Jobs that comes back to Apple was a very very different person from
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:07.860]   those two so maybe it's a trilogy unfortunately most of these movies show the first one or
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:11.860]   the first and second one and then they sort sort of say and then he came back and you
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:17.660]   know what happens next and the answer is on the screen saying it is I feel like you
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:23.420]   could push it to the launch of the iPhone as and certainly to the iPod and say this is
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:26.980]   the thing and I think the Ashton Kutcher movie starts with the launch of the iPod and then
[01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:32.460]   flashes back and I do feel like they're they're missing a little bit more but it may just
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:36.300]   be that nobody really knows those stories of how that stuff has been created enough to
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:40.140]   not dramatize them but I think going to the launch of the iMac is stopping a little bit
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:46.740]   short I think really Steve Jobs legacy starts with his return to Apple to although you could
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:51.620]   make the case that releasing the Apple to jump started the personal computer revolution
[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:58.420]   so sure I'm I'm I'm surprised you like the next Andy you think that's a must I think
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:02.460]   so because if you're if you're looking at a story with an arc in which we're not going
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:06.940]   to be telling the entire story with one launch we're gonna be we're gonna choose three I
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:12.340]   think that next is important because there's a I do I do believe that the experience of
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:20.860]   running next was incredibly influential because it was his first real chance to say five if
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:25.780]   all the decisions come through me if nothing happens but I will it to happen here's what
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:31.660]   happens and there were I still I still keep in my in my library the product brochure for
[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:36.460]   the original next cube and it's still a fascinating object because it describes every what every
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:41.340]   computer would have built in in about three or four years after the launch of this next
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:45.740]   cube but nonetheless it's been well documented that he made a lot of what to an outsider would
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:50.500]   think is of our very very silly decisions that had nothing to do with launching a successful
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:55.260]   product and had more to do with things like design woo woo and here's how I here's why
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:59.260]   I want to express this thought as opposed to creating something that my customer is
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:03.500]   going to really really like and then when you fast forward to comparing let's say even
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:09.180]   let's say the I'm act to this the I'm act was as freaky in its way as the next cube however
[01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:12.740]   it was a practical computer that was not only going to make that emotional connection
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:16.700]   that emotional appeal to people but once they bought the thing they were going to find
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:21.500]   themselves in the owning a very very cool very very capable very very useful piece of
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:25.980]   hardware after they thought the buy an external floppy drive to make it work but who cares
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:30.180]   it's such a beautiful thing I just think that there are three different expressions of what
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:33.900]   Steve if we're if this is a story about Steve Jobs not about Apple and these are two different
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:38.420]   things I think that this is the best expression of here's who he was what he was here's the
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:43.380]   Steve Jobs I was capable of doing the launch of the first Mac here's the Steve Jobs that
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:48.340]   created the or had a hand in the next cube and here's the Steve Jobs later three very
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:52.500]   very different people so good art if nothing else is a very clear linear narrative and
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:56.980]   a good journey to show like the heights of the Mac and then arguably the lows of next
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:00.540]   and then the heights again when he started to take off all right let's watch this silly
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:07.260]   thing and 941 the planet this was better than you thought it was the oh okay let me rewind
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:12.180]   one more time I gotta hear this I don't understand this this first sentence at all
[01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:20.180]   the 941 the planet's gonna shift on its axis 9 forever two most significant events in the
[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:26.220]   20th century allies win the war and this you can't write code you are not an engineer
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:33.260]   what do you do that's by the way Seth Rogen is was you can't write code you're not an engineer
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:38.060]   I don't think I doubt very much was ever said anything like that yeah what do you do he
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:45.700]   know exactly what Steve did and I'm sure was grateful the musicians play the instruments
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:51.300]   I play the orchestra I sat in the garage and invented the future because artists lead and
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:56.020]   hacks ask for a show of hands I love this you don't care how much money a person makes
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:15:01.780]   you care what they make by the way that is I know that's a person but it's a person not
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:07.740]   commonly talked about in this is Kate Winslet's role as Jo is it Joanna Hoffman is that who
[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:15.300]   she's playing early early Mac team member who really is a footnote at best but for some
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:19.620]   I guess Sorkin wanted a woman in it I don't know but what you make isn't supposed to be
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:26.420]   the best part of you you're the only one who sees the world the same way I do no one sees
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:32.620]   the world the same way you do yeah we argue about that I think we can get it and I have
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:44.540]   to say fast bender I just Jeff Daniels plays John Scully by the way fast bender to me I
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.660]   don't know well he's got a little he was he was he was great and band of brothers I
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:53.140]   also liked him and Prometheus he's a great actor I'm not a knock I like to a lot of people
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:58.900]   have been saying that doesn't sound like Steve Jobs to me I don't you don't really the point
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:03.380]   of the purpose of being an actor is to not look and sound exactly like the person the
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:07.820]   point is to convince you that to accept that same same reason why it doesn't make it doesn't
[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:12.860]   it's not an argument that in the new Fantastic Four movie Johnny Storm the Human Torch is
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:17.300]   an African American play by an African American actor is an actor for African American character
[01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:21.500]   he will convince you of that I what I liked about the those clips is that I really feel
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:27.620]   so he got the cadence he got the music of the way that he spoke in his public speeches down
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:32.540]   so I mean actually could your looked like Steve Jobs was a terrible actor so I think if you
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:37.100]   give the choice the whole I don't even sure how much I blame there's so much blame to go
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:42.380]   around for that movie including the fast forward of then he then he got he tearfully kicked
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:47.100]   out of Apple and then fast forward to a jillion years later when Apple is begging Steve Jobs
[01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:51.300]   to come back oh well there was this thing called the called next between those two that
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:54.940]   you know choosing an actor for their looks is not important but it is important that they
[01:16:54.940 --> 01:17:00.180]   embody the person I mean that they they feel like the person somebody saying is it is the
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:05.140]   is what is this going on with this reducing screen is it is it reducing everything to the
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:10.380]   aspect ratio of the iPhone is that what is that what's going on here vertical video fitting
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:11.820]   it into an eye.
[01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:13.820]   I love that you don't care how much money you can do.
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:15.820]   Oh it's fitting into the eye.
[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:17.820]   Oh I can see what you need to do.
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:20.220]   It's because they don't have any footage.
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:25.220]   And then it turns into the eye and then yeah it's because they have no flashing cursor.
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:26.220]   Oh yeah.
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:30.380]   It's just a teaser it's not a yeah.
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:34.620]   But they did it's a hard to judge based on a few random lines without any context.
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:38.220]   Yeah there were a bunch of journalists in sense that they were showing flash bulbs
[01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:39.220]   during this.
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:40.420]   Yeah there's no flash bulbs.
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:41.420]   Look at them.
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:42.420]   Look at them go.
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:43.420]   What is that?
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:47.460]   Okay but wait but okay but it's is it's I was looking at that too because I was thinking
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:53.260]   I was assuming it was it was a one of the iOS releases and I'm thinking well if this
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:57.940]   was the iMac release the people this is a roomful of people who are just like people
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:02.300]   with their own personal pocket cameras and they have automatic like xenon flashes their
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:03.580]   film cameras.
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:09.300]   So if it's if it didn't happen in the room that way it's okay for them to stage it so
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:14.980]   that people have old fat old timey flashes opposed to glow of white glow of white.
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:19.220]   So first of all this is the Flint Center if you look at what's that's a Mac obviously
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:22.860]   that looks like an iMac except the jobs is wearing jeans and a journal that can of course
[01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:27.700]   quite famously the Mac launches a bow tie that's the iMac launch the iMac also at the
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:32.180]   Flint Center okay was recognizably okay so this would be the iMac all right where's the
[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:36.980]   pruder but did they but did they have back into the left did they have flash balls I
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:41.020]   know threes or nine oh five because they're very very similar but one has an American flag
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:42.540]   on the heel of the other one does not.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:48.100]   I'm completely willing to tear this film from limb the limb I don't I don't have a problem
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:51.820]   with that that's what's that was going through my mind as well as I'm watching this that
[01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:56.540]   I might be like people like us might be the worst people that we are because like I was
[01:18:56.540 --> 01:19:02.580]   I was there and in some cases we were there in all cases we were intimately connected to
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:07.340]   the event either through by very devouring all the details I was happening or knowing
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:12.220]   people who were materially involved in it and so we're the people that are going to say
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:18.140]   the paneling on the floor was was from backstage to the front stage from stage left this I said
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:24.180]   teak fail yeah also the the iMac launch happened when apple was at its low point and you could
[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:28.580]   they were desperately trying to get people to show up if you go if you go definitely
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:33.540]   not a blackened auditorium with flash bulbs right looks like right it is pretty funny
[01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:37.820]   go up here go right here because you could see blue bond I blew iMacs yeah backstage so
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:41.380]   we do know this is in fact the iMac it's just kind of funny that what what's happening
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:44.340]   here and you're absolutely right with the wrong people to to look at this but what's
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:48.780]   happening here is compression dramatic oppression yeah it's taking because we know what happens
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:54.180]   after this point to jobs in apple we're taking all of the excitement of a wwbc keynote or
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:59.460]   i phone launch or something like that and we're rolling it back into this moment so this
[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:04.420]   is the dramatic license of saying you know this event wasn't like this but it led to
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:07.860]   all those events that were like this this is this is accurate but that's what they're
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:11.260]   trying to see his first product after he came back to apple this is an apple that was
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:14.940]   very much struggling maybe somebody pulled a fire alarm and that's what's going off in
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:19.260]   that story here meanwhile pitch perfect two comes out on friday i just want to point
[01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:25.020]   out it's i'm very excited oh that was last week oh my god that's too good a movie yeah
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:28.620]   i'll go back and break down the ant man trailer now i didn't know he was working right
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:35.660]   he was in the show now no no stop stop stop when thomas the tank engine hits yellow jackets
[01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:40.620]   just yeah let's let's let's let's all let's all take a second to reflect upon how
[01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:44.700]   grateful we should be for this movie and what it means to us it means that well we can when we
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:50.460]   need to write a column on a tuesday we can write about here's what the movie doesn't discuss yes
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:56.700]   yeah you've got 30 thousand your heart of friday is 30 000 words no sweat but your
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:21:03.420]   fastbinder coherent navigation what is that apple just bought it the gps company that was
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:09.820]   trying to make gps more accurate down to centimeters instead of feet oh okay it's not indoors it's uh
[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:15.340]   i think that's a wide range of applications often they just surface one to make commercial
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:19.980]   navigation services based on partnerships with companies like bowing and iridium the satellite
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:25.260]   network operator according to the linkedin page of paul lego the company's former chief
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:32.540]   executive was founded 2008 high precision navigation systems technology far stronger than
[01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:39.180]   many consumer grade gps systems they'd also worked on autonomous navigation and robotics
[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:43.980]   projects i think they come less a bunch of low lower level satellite data as well to try and make
[01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:51.580]   it more accurate okay it may just be also they're acquiring the mines the the great brilliant mines
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:57.740]   behind it it's uh there's a ten person team and i believe some of them if not after the sale
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:01.900]   then before the sale there was a lot of migration towards apple already so it does sound almost
[01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:05.340]   like that and for apples part all they would say again is apple acquires companies from
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:09.180]   time to time we don't discuss plans that's the usual which is as good as a confirmation as you can
[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:14.060]   get so remember when that green piece used to be uh every every year they'd be ragging on apple now
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:19.740]   green piece says apples green they're the the greenest company ever the most eco-friendly tech
[01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:27.740]   company in the world but that Netflix and youtube those guys is bad news please print our press release
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:32.780]   please project that's that's that's that's funny i think i think that a few years ago they knew that
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:36.460]   they can get a lot of press by saying that apples specifically apple sucks now they know that they
[01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:42.460]   can get people to retweet if there's no apples doing great it's it's just well whatever you know
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:49.420]   uh look i'm all for keeping the planet green or keeping making because it ain't but um you can't
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:53.100]   now it makes you cynical when you start to see this kind of stuff it's like oh yeah well
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:58.860]   Netflix is hot right now apparently by watching Netflix you're ruining the ecosystem
[01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:03.340]   apple gets a hundred percent on its clean energy index
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:11.900]   google only 46 percent well it is an interesting story that from the day that green piece did that
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:16.940]   and yes they picked apple specifically not because any of its competitors were any better right but
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:21.900]   because apple was high profile but it's interesting i would say almost textbook depending on what
[01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:27.580]   class you're taking anyway that apple immediately said okay tell us what we what you think we should
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:31.980]   be doing and now that's the way to handle it there's a slide in every presentation about the hardware
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:36.300]   and what what you know it's checklists of toxic elements and whether it's recyclable and they
[01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:42.060]   and have invested in solar and and you know they they've they've done it and they it's funny that
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:47.820]   this is like the cap or is them sent is green piece saying yep okay they changed um onto the next
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:53.260]   target right so are they saying that google powers search off of coal is that what it's basically
[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:58.940]   yeah in fact both google and apple or move may and move very aggressively to make their network
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:04.620]   operation centers as green as they can either buying car carbon credits or in some cases using
[01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:10.940]   actual solar power to power them apple speaking of lightning is now making a lightning dock
[01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:15.980]   for your iphone that's a little surprising isn't it how do i want to take them so long
[01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:22.140]   the 30-pin dock is great it's great mister easelio i could put my iphone in there and it and
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:31.580]   it would hold it with the problem is that nobody licenses lightning so you were kind of at a
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:35.260]   luck if you wanted a light you can get there's there's like there's like stuff out there oh yeah
[01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:43.580]   mfi plus plus uh docks that capture the your existing cable is this the best lightning dock apple
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:50.380]   has ever made is the best and worst apple has ever been it's the best worst the worst the average is
[01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:56.460]   we'd like to show you a video explaining why we chose that angle my issue is if you really put
[01:24:56.460 --> 01:25:02.140]   the phone or uh that well it's you notice it doesn't have a slot that's what i was wondering
[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:06.140]   there's no side so i wonder if i could just totally abuse the structural integrity of that kind of
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:11.900]   but but i feel like that would break it off if you put an iPad on it right i think i might even
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:16.860]   iphone six might break it off wasn't it what is it doesn't seem like a very good structurally
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:27.340]   good idea five five s six six plus yeah yeah it's also interesting because i'm certainly wondering
[01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:32.940]   how committed apple is going to be to usbc and if we're going to see that as the one that's what i
[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:36.460]   want you're gonna the only thing you're gonna need for your ipad for your iphone for your
[01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:41.420]   for your laptop so it's interesting that they're debuting a brand new dock connector that clearly
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:45.020]   they didn't they didn't think it was a high priority or else they would have tried to get this out
[01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:50.860]   earlier i mean three years ago not there yeah i mean so it's interesting this has a lightning
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:57.420]   connector in the back so you plug it in and then it has an audio analog audio port so you could put
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:03.340]   your headphones on it i guess or like attach it to a speaker yeah yeah you pop it in you can still
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:07.580]   do way more than usbc i mean there's similar many ways but lightning still has all the intelligence
[01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:12.140]   switching and can carry i believe uh more different types of signals that apple wants but you used to
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:15.740]   take a 30 pin a dock connector and they had to rearrange that thing like they'd go in and
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:21.260]   disconnect uh linear audio and try to reconnect firewire and they would always be structurally
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:25.500]   different inside and the diagrams became more nightmarish as time went on so lightning was really
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:29.900]   designed to be future-proof so they if there was some new uh sort of signal they had to carry they
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:34.220]   would never have to refactor the hardware just uh care just change the kind of signal that was
[01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:38.220]   passing through it and i don't think usbc does all of that and the standardization makes it a
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:41.980]   better choice for the macbook but i think the flexibility makes it a better choice for them
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:45.580]   oh for the most still that that's absolutely true the thing is though
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:51.820]   are uh what can that what can they attach to that dock connector through a phone that people are
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:55.660]   actually going to clamor to use that that would benefit them better than having one standard
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:27:00.940]   connector that they can transfer between multiple devices including their android devices including
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:07.500]   their uh window windows devices i mean it's i had to be i had a remind myself uh while i was on a
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:14.220]   trip that uh the iphone six and the six plus has a lightning connector but you can plug in the
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:18.940]   camera kit but it doesn't do nothing uh and why are they not what why aren't they doing things
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:23.500]   like enabling the camera connection kit let me slurp photos directly from my camera uh directly
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:29.820]   onto the device uh it's it's interesting if there's you you'll go broke trying to predict what apple is
[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:35.820]   has planned or is investigating but hasn't been able to announce yet so who knows like what they
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:41.020]   what they intend to do with lightning in the future but for now i don't i can only think about three or
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:44.780]   four different things that people ever would like to plug into their phone and usb c is more than
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:50.140]   adequate for all of them that color white and that adapter took three years of engineering
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:56.140]   it's not just gold plated i just want to give apple special formula they could easily charge 79
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:28:00.460]   bucks for this they're only charging $39 they're leaving money on the table so you got to give them
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:07.900]   some credit yeah by the way it's sinks and charges okay both they figure we're already charging
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:11.740]   150 dollars for a watch band you probably don't have enough money left for 79 dollars
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:16.140]   i was making fun of the watch bands and then vince nagoyan from flash gear was showing off
[01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:19.820]   some of the panorrhai and other bands that he was putting on his apple watch with third party
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:24.860]   lugs and none of them were under three or four hundred dollars like so i i vastly underestimated
[01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:28.620]   the expense of watch bands in this market no no no you misunderstand it's not the expense it's
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:35.340]   the margin okay well maybe fancy fancy schmancy watch bands i mean it's more about margin i was
[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:39.820]   i was showing my my last morning wearing a motor 360 was this morning and i had breakfast with a
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:45.100]   friend and i was i was showing and i was showing him the here's here's what this the the the magical
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:51.100]   hoorween leather watch band that you get with motor 360 but here's what looks like after like nine
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:55.980]   months of daily wear and it looks beautiful and it's supple and it looks like a very prestigious
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:59.740]   sort of luxury sort of experience and it's the watch brand you get for free
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:06.940]   yep just saying fine karenthian leather i didn't know the word hoorween until apple came along i
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:13.180]   just want to say now i look for her ween everywhere i only wear karenthian leather i'm sorry karenthian
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:19.340]   leather for a kardomantabaa fine karenthian leather i just learned the date of it made from horse butt
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:25.020]   so just you know i'm not a leather expert obviously apparently president obama who
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:31.500]   uh for the first time ever actually has a twizz own twitter account there was a president account
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:34.940]   white house account white house account we got pOTUS but that's wait there was a white house account
[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:39.420]   anabaraka obama account neither of which was his but the one called pOTUS is his yes not his name
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:43.260]   it's his office which is really weird because what is gonna take it with him he should take back
[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:48.780]   barack obama and give pOTUS to the oval office and say whoever's in charge i think that's what
[01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:53.420]   you see bill clinton's tweet leo who's bill clinton he asked if the if the pOTUS account
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:58.460]   would transfer to the new owner and then a brocco and he said asking for a friend and then brocco
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:05.020]   bummer responded he said yes you count those with the house you know yeah the account comes with
[01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:11.020]   a $50 burrito gift card that is an excellent tweet for bill clinton i'm asking for a friend
[01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:15.500]   obama replied that the account goes with the house and did clinton have any ideas on who should
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:22.700]   be a good flotus wow oh that's funny yeah that's funny he wants the flotus account
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:29.020]   yeah mottus he's gonna be a fun what are you gonna call first gentleman first gentleman
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:33.980]   i've already decided the canadian knows and i don't it was a west wing joke at some point first
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:38.860]   gentleman and there was a woman prime minister in canada briefly yeah can camp you guys know
[01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:46.380]   fagotus is not a good that's a sense of skin disease first dude first dude fadotus yeah
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:52.060]   apparently president obama still does use a secure blackberry so in fact he could not tweet
[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:58.940]   from his phone so the white house won't say if it's twitter compatible according to buzzfeed
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:05.660]   he would he tweeted with twitter for iphone so he's probably borrowed some of these iphone they
[01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:09.740]   have a they have a government iphone for that department the department of obama tweeting has
[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:14.140]   a different yeah it's probably got a sticker on the back that says at potus it's the at potus
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:18.700]   phone that's all it does the at potus phone it's all it can do it's probably like one of those
[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:23.180]   one of those development iPhones you hear about where it's actually like inside apples like
[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:27.660]   actually bolted down to a plate of acrylic that's about three feet by four feet with nowhere near
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:32.540]   the barn so that you can't take it out of the office and you can't pretend that oh i i'm sorry i
[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:37.820]   must have switched phones with you accidentally mobama it it sounds like being president
[01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:41.420]   is a good job but it really sucks he cannot for instance have a phone with it he told
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:43.740]   jimmy kimmel i can't have a phone with a recorder in it
[01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:49.740]   no which means no camera yeah well it's but the difference is that like if you're president
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:53.660]   you never have to touch a phone you don't really have to touch a computer yeah the only has a phone
[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:57.980]   that he has a phone that when he says i'm ready the engines on air force one star that's a heck of a
[01:31:57.980 --> 01:32:01.900]   lucky chair i wonder if smart things has an interface to air force one that would be good
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:08.220]   start the jet so someone someone was writing a really thoughtful essay i've read about six or
[01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:12.540]   seven months ago about how being the president especially for two terms changes you and that
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:16.780]   disconnects you from everyday reality and that he said just think about it this way for the past
[01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:22.140]   six years the president has not have not has never had pocket change in his pants that he has never
[01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:28.780]   waited in traffic for even five seconds because everything is held for him and i guess nfc payments
[01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:34.380]   i mean it's a whole new world out there it's going to be tough when uh you know a year from now
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:38.860]   president bomb has to leave office and i started hearing change again there's a straight there's a
[01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:41.900]   strange thing that happens to apple employees when they leave apple some of them don't know how to
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:45.100]   buy phones because they've always just been providing to them and having to deal with at&t
[01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:49.900]   to them is just uh they have no idea how normal people have ever survived like this
[01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:56.460]   this sort of a halfway house program you live you live in san hose not in not in kubercino and
[01:32:56.460 --> 01:33:02.940]   uh let's take a break and we'll come back with your final uh thoughts in your pick of the week
[01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:06.940]   how about that i i mean i guess we could there are a couple things we could mention that there is a
[01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:14.860]   safari address spoofing bug not it's not i don't think hugely significant but it is in uh ios and os
[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:21.100]   ten using a java fairly simple java script a bad guy could take you to one site but report that
[01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:27.180]   you're at another site in the address bar um and that would be bad but i don't i don't know if it
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:31.260]   would fool the certificate system so if you're giving people important information check the
[01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:36.860]   certificate that seems like that would be a good idea at least until uh apple fixeses our show
[01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:44.460]   they brought to you by it pro tv my friends tim and don and i and i i do consider them friends
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:50.460]   because they've come out here a lot and they we we kind of we're there at the beginning uh they've
[01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:56.460]   been not it trainers for a long time and and they came out to an nab uh talk i did about three years
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:34:01.580]   ago and they said you know we should be doing we should get a tricaster we should get some cameras
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:05.740]   we should get a studio do what leo's doing but for it professionals or people who are looking to
[01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:12.620]   get their certifications and they created it pro tv and of course as always the pupil has
[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:20.300]   exceeded the master they have two studios on their way to five they're doing now 50 hours of new

[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:24.780]   they started with us they were just starting out and they have grown like topsy uh all right
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:31.020]   time for picks of the week why don't we start with our in studio guest mr. Jason Snell this is
[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:36.780]   hot off the presses hot from the app store uh p calc the calculator app for your iphone is now
[01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:44.380]   at version 3.4 which features doo doo watch support are you gonna do a calculator calculator i don't
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:49.900]   know i don't know i don't know that is awesome let me hear that yeah do i have p calc on here no i don't
[01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:56.140]   it's a it's a calculator and it works and james tomsen who developed it um waited until he got the
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:38:01.260]   physical you know watch hardware because he was not convinced that it would work and he worked on it
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:06.620]   for a while to get it to work must be hard to do right because you don't get it's not a lot of
[01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:10.060]   space on there but he figured out a way to do it so if you want quick calculations on your apple
[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:15.660]   watch p calc not only being a great calculator app for the iphone but now it has a watch app that
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:19.820]   comes with it so that's a pretty cool thing i think that's pretty useful just like a yeah it's
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:24.060]   it's an app that actually does something it doesn't do a lot but it does you know basic calculations and
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:28.220]   has a tip calculator and uh that's kind of kind of cool that you can even do that on the apple watch
[01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:35.020]   with the the 1.0 version of the app interface so i like the fact that he waited until he had an
[01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:40.940]   apple watch because he was really i i actually got to visit him in scotland a few weeks ago and he
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:45.420]   was not convinced that it would work on the watch he just didn't believe it would be a good experience
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:51.100]   and and i like the fact that he took the time found a way to make it work and now has a version of
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:56.620]   his app that runs on the watch so p calc it's the best calculator from tla systems i see they have
[01:38:56.620 --> 01:39:02.460]   a light version which also offers a watch app so you can if you wanted to see but i bought it it's
[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:07.740]   great and then he was the guy who had trouble with the notifications he is that guy yeah yeah does it
[01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:14.860]   does now uh yeah you can do calculator in the today view and on the mac and on ios thank you this is
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:19.740]   you know what if you had a casio calculator watch you'll feel right he will you probably saved your
[01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:25.420]   stylus and you can actually send your result to your the app on your phone or pull the answer off
[01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:30.780]   of your phone and stuff like that too oh that's cool oh that's cool and this was going to be rene's
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:36.140]   pick so thank you rene for letting me rene i snaked it from him did he steal your tip no adhesion does
[01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:42.300]   this move way better than i do so well you know what uh i while you were talking jason i did install it
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:47.660]   how long does it take for an app once you put it on the phone on the phone to go over to your watch is
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:55.100]   it instant it's few seconds instantish i actually installed uh p-calc myself like just at the start of
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:40:00.620]   the show maybe and it took maybe 20 30 seconds to arrive you see at worst you see the sort of dinner
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:07.100]   uh it hasn't installed yet i guess but maybe because of the space check your phone and should
[01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:12.060]   say installing on your phone and then installed once it's on there uh in the watch app or yeah
[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:16.860]   please stand by it's probably there already by the time you yeah and it's busy now
[01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:21.340]   what installing an update which is not going to install until i get up yeah okay so that's why all
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:25.980]   right did you use the watch app to transfer it over huh did you use the app to watch app to transfer
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:31.740]   it over no what i don't know what are you talking about what are you talking about apple watch app
[01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:39.100]   to transfer it over you got to do it automatically it might depend on your settings oh yeah yeah i
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:45.020]   automatically download apps i have that switch flipped all right when this is on and you have apps
[01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:50.700]   on your iphone that also work with the apple watch these apps will automatically blah blah blah
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:58.140]   and i should if i go down here see p-calc in my list right yeah there it is oh i can have it in
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:41:01.980]   glances yeah the glances and that interesting it sort of just tells you like what your answers
[01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:05.900]   were on your phone and your watch once because you can't yeah you can't do buttons from the
[01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:10.140]   glance if you're if you're a third party developer those of us with no short-term memory appreciate it
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:15.420]   oh i keep pressing the wrong button for the 42 launch p-calc
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:23.100]   i said p-calc fast so there wouldn't put a space in there they did it it just wasn't ready yet
[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:30.300]   mr dude oh look at that you can do some comedy i wish that were my watch face i was about to say
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:36.460]   i want that as a watch face one two and i want skeu morphism i want it to look lcd

[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:52.540]   it's got a backspace and everything very nice i keep it in a few i've ever wanted a calculator
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:59.100]   like you had when you were 14 on your wrist there that down they're not gonna let watches into the
[01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:04.860]   exam room thank you Jason snell you still can't impress boys or girls with it as you try to do
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:11.580]   kennie and i co what do you got for us i'm i'm wearing i'm wearing my pick of the week which is a very
[01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:16.140]   weird one but i think that a part of our audience is going to be very very happy to hear about this
[01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:22.300]   i bought this jacket on ebay a few weeks a few weeks ago i'm a big fan of like what i call cheater
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:27.580]   jackets where you need to sort of look a little bit more dressed up than if you're just wearing like
[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:32.620]   a work shirt or something but you still don't either you'd be overdressed in a suit or you don't
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:37.980]   want to be you know you don't have to walk around the city all day and like an actual like structured
[01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:42.220]   jacket so i like these cheater jackets they're they're almost built like a shirt by their tailored
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:48.700]   like like a sport coat and so this one is uh it's uh it's called the orvis zambisi
[01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:54.780]   safari coat i like orvis stuff actually exactly it's it's really well made it's it's vintage just
[01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:59.180]   maybe about five or six years old they don't make these anymore i got this one on ebay for
[01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:04.780]   fifty dollars but why is it a pick of the week and a u.s because of a feature i was not aware of
[01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:09.900]   until i actually bought it now realize that this is now you think that i'm just like you look like
[01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:15.260]   you're going uh you're going birdie i'm just a man about town arkite oh yes but no no no i am
[01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:21.260]   a slick sophisticated journalist who has ooh his ipad mini with him look at that i'm buying one i
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:26.780]   want one perfect it's the perfect size for an ipad mini and it predates it it's sort of it's not
[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:32.220]   like you can just jam it in there i'm saying it's tailor made for an ipad mini and it has a couple
[01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:39.020]   extra pockets too so hey what's this why i think it's my bluetooth folding ipad keyboard such a nerd
[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:45.500]   nerd i i'm a nerd in a really cool jacket who does not have to carry a bag with him all the time
[01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:50.380]   oh i mean there there are other i mean there are other jackets that are like uh like tech jackets
[01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:55.180]   that are hey we've got a million pockets and you never have to the you never have to like check
[01:43:55.180 --> 01:44:00.780]   carry on baggage but it has enough power it's just a nice coincidence that it's nicely
[01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:06.220]   kitted out for somebody who travels with technology and walking down the street in it unlike some of
[01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:11.820]   these other like tech oriented jackets it just looks like a normal blazer it doesn't look like
[01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:17.900]   hey who's that guy who clearly has a 13 inch ipad air in the small of his back and about 10 miles
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:24.060]   of cable going around uh going around his neck right um so the the only other note that uh
[01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:28.540]   so Orvis made this coat for a number of years they don't make it anymore on the off chance that
[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:33.820]   they change the design from year to year and maybe the the fun pocket isn't the right size
[01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:41.740]   the there's a tag inside the collar that says 70534 on this jacket so that's the if you can see
[01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:46.780]   pictures on ebay and you see that number on the inside of the tag you're probably on the right
[01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:51.580]   track even if it's the wrong one it's still a very nice jacket it's also machine washable you can
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:57.340]   like crumple it up and stick it into a bag i gave and it's nice i one of my trip to New York was for
[01:44:57.340 --> 01:45:02.780]   the aces product launch of the the new zen phone and i was interviewing like the ceo the company for
[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:08.620]   like 45 minutes and i i feel like i got away with it very nicely it's it does you look like an idiot
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:12.940]   if you're in a suit but you want to look like hi i appreciate that your time is valuable and
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:17.900]   you're giving me some of it so hey look i actually decided to button the at least that not the top
[01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:21.740]   button of my shirt but at least like the second so you can't see the logo on my podcast t-shirt
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:26.780]   i actually really like that i'm sad they don't make it as a matter of fact i got
[01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:30.460]   uh i was getting some compliments about it later on in the day when i was hanging out with friends
[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:35.180]   i go where do you get that jacket that fits your personality it really does i think i
[01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:40.220]   will oh the the last the last note is that now obviously my physique doesn't look like i would
[01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:45.020]   fit into a large of anything but this is a large and it's absolutely the perfect size so if you
[01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:49.180]   see one that if you're if you're see one that you want to get like the extra large maybe you
[01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:53.980]   want to get one size smaller i don't know because it's it's not designed to be a really tailored
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:59.660]   structured jacket so it looks like it's kind of roomy but yeah paid 50 or 60 bucks for it and that's
[01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:03.180]   clearly after three weeks it's like one of the favorite things i got oh you didn't tell me it has
[01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:09.580]   leather patches on the elbows it's got leather patches baby but it also it has a has a secret
[01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:13.980]   feature where like you can button it all let's say you get caught and it's a little bit too cold
[01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:19.180]   you can turn up this collar and then this thing on the side it's not just decorative
[01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:23.260]   you can actually unbutton that and like make it into like a clerical collar that will keep
[01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:27.260]   like the top of your top of the thing turned into like sort of a stalker jacket like a
[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:34.860]   neighbor jacket yeah or or or like Luke Skywalker and vesbin cloud city i like to say that's uh i want
[01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:40.620]   this that's true so you they don't sell it but you can maybe find it on ebay i'm looking on
[01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:46.780]   at c to see if that's he has any and it's actually like if you go on ebay ebay like i came up with about
[01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:52.540]   like a half dozen listings and i've got like an ebay search for like travel jacket because i like
[01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:57.580]   these kinds of jackets and i see these coming up all the time okay and what was the what was the
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:05.340]   i got the number but what is the what is the name of it it's called Orvis zambizi z-a-m-e-z-i
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:12.380]   safari coat although if you do if you do just search this for Orvis jacket you'll recognize it
[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:18.700]   here it is it here it is on ebay size xl and you said you have the x win it's in that weird
[01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:23.820]   Luke Skywalker mode exactly or it looks like you know a flasher is not really concerned with
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:27.500]   covering up that yeah that's not the most attractive deployment of that jacket but when you're
[01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:33.820]   is this the same one it looks like the same model you have the leather little tablets on your
[01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:39.260]   that you have on your collars though look doesn't it doesn't or maybe or maybe it's there but
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:44.780]   remember this piping yeah remember that this collar like detaches i'm sorry there is it's actually
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:51.180]   buttoned on so maybe just whoever it is took that off and oh no there isn't another picture see there
[01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:58.540]   it is i see it yeah that's really i want it and it's if you get it used and it really it feels like
[01:47:58.540 --> 01:48:03.020]   you've had it for a long time exactly mean that it's it mine is in good shape and it doesn't look
[01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:06.780]   like it's shiny and brand new yeah it's nice i don't want it it's one of the nicest things i've
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:11.020]   i've bought i don't i i heard i heard someone talking about this and some sort of a men's wear
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:14.780]   forum because i was doing some certain more searches on it before this i said you know it's too bad it's
[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:22.700]   only available in old man color i'm like hey man it's it's tan it's twill it's classic old man color
[01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:31.580]   the hell all right rene richy you're gonna have to top the Orvis zambizi travel jacket no chance
[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:38.460]   absolutely no chance uh so i initially was looking at peak elk for the apple watch and i was looking
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:43.500]   at the new audible app which has carplay support as sort of two sides of a really interesting coin
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:48.700]   because these are established apps and you know you can use them on your iphone but they're also
[01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:52.700]   going other places you can use the you can use peak elk on your watch you can use a variety of
[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:57.020]   things that come from your iphone on your watch and now for example audible on carplay or overcast
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:49:02.380]   on carplay you can use those on your car as well and it's and i think we've spoken about this before
[01:49:02.380 --> 01:49:06.060]   but it's really fascinating to me that what happened with web technologies where originally
[01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:11.020]   you had a web browser but then you just started having little bits of HTTP or internet functionality
[01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:16.380]   uh sort of everywhere in the system and in apps that's now happening with apps as well with UIKit
[01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:21.580]   especially on on apple where the logic of the app is sitting on your phone but the interface can
[01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:26.540]   be on your watch or it can be in your car or conceivably we can be on the apple television and it's sort
[01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:31.260]   of unbundled all these features before you download this this big hunken app and you just use it as
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:35.340]   that app but now all these different features are in different places so i can listen to audible
[01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:41.260]   on carplay i can share something that i'm listening to on our unaudible maybe through pinterest
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:45.900]   all these little things that used to be one giant hole are now just available everywhere that i am
[01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:51.580]   and that to me is is super exciting it's changing the way that i use a ton of applications uh because i
[01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:55.980]   don't have to go and find them anymore they're just wherever i am so the audible app it's a really
[01:49:55.980 --> 01:50:00.780]   good update for a variety of reasons but the fact that audible is now if you have a carplay car it's
[01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:05.820]   just going to be one of those icons on your dashboard i used to commute an hour and a half each way to
[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:11.180]   work in audible and twitch shows where my constant companion and the ability to have it not to have
[01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:16.780]   to use Siri or even look down to my phone in in Montreal now it's illegal to use your phone not
[01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:21.020]   only while driving but even while stopped at a red light will pull off to the side of the road all
[01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:25.660]   of that will get you a ticket so the ability for that functionality to move to a nice legal place
[01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:30.540]   like the dashboard to me is awesome and i really like the sort of potential where all these things
[01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:34.940]   get lined up and and where it's going to go and i think things like audible for carplay are a big
[01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:41.100]   a big example of that does anybody have carplay yet there are some units that are available and
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:47.820]   and projects replacement yeah third party there are some but not uh but not no car yet the auto
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:52.780]   industry is glacial and the update cycle makes the ipad update cycle updates like a look brisk
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:58.380]   if they're beating audibles app uh if ab adable is beating them that that tells you something because
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:02.860]   audible doesn't up like they'll load this update this a lot but boy looks like a lot of new features
[01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:11.500]   in this new version 2.5 i really want chrome cast or some way to throw it to my something it's really
[01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:15.980]   easy to add so it's it's interesting like like sonos doesn't support apple play and there's a lot of
[01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:19.820]   people who haven't supported crumb cast even though everyone who has implemented says it's super easy
[01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:24.300]   to implement so i i think it's just i'm just gonna have to complain about it please addable we love
[01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:29.260]   you but i just want to be able to throw it to my sonos so i can listen i can throw it to my stereo
[01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:37.820]   but i can't throw it to my uh oh well uh cool i don't have anything i'm just gonna uh let you all
[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:45.660]   own this because i am busy buying a zambizy tool cut and canvas jacket is it an old band color
