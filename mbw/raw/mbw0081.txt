[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.160]   >> It's time for Mac Break Weekly later than Nellman.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.000]   And we are all in a little bit of a mirthful mood
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.920]   because we've just been listening to Orson Wells
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.160]   selling canned peas.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.440]   It was all Merlin's idea.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.000]   Hello, Merlin man.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.040]   >> Good morning Leo, how are you today?
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.160]   >> 43 folders.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.360]   There's no way anyone can say 43 folders.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.920]   Show me away.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.040]   >> Bring me a jury.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.960]   Show me out of sentence with emphasis on in and out.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.760]   >> Yeah, never mind.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.560]   Stop doing it though.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.640]   >> Switch to it, Nelles.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.640]   >> Oh, wow.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.240]   And the Enovco is also here from the Chicago sometimes
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.720]   in the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.960]   Hello Andy.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.040]   >> There's so many different ways to respond.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.760]   The direction that I'm being given at this program.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.760]   Now, if you talk, we're all going to talk like that now.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.560]   >> I kind of want to go with your George Harrison
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.880]   and let it be.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.960]   >> If you want me to play loud, oh, play loud.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.040]   If you want me to play soft, oh, play soft,
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.440]   Paul, just tell me how you want me to play and I'll do it.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.640]   >> Pull you up with a bay.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.640]   I won't play at home.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.320]   >> Why don't you feel for George in that moment?
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.640]   >> For George, I was really surprised
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.240]   because I keep reading these interviews with people
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.760]   who knew him well and everyone says it just irked him
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.960]   that the Beatles weren't bigger than they were.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.040]   >> How could you be any bigger?
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.040]   >> That's the sort that you just press pause
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.960]   or whatever you're listening to and just let that sink in
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.200]   for a moment.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.120]   >> Wow, yes.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.080]   >> A fully armed and operational battle station
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.240]   is clearly what he is saying.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.760]   >> I want the Death Star.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.360]   >> Really, yes.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.880]   >> I find your lack of faith and magical mystery
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.120]   to a disturbing.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.520]   >> Also here, Alex Lindsay from the Pixelcoar.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.840]   Hello, Alex.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.680]   >> Hello.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.080]   >> And this week in photography.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.920]   >> Yes.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.400]   >> A featured podcast on my Apple TV, I'm proud to say.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.240]   >> A featured podcast.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.560]   >> A featured podcast.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.080]   >> On your Apple TV, even though there's not much,
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.480]   oh, yeah, I guess every week we put something else.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.280]   >> As long as you do one video.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.120]   >> We do a video every week.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.880]   >> Yeah, they think it's a video podcast.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.960]   >> Scott Borne cannot be with us.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.600]   He is out choosing his new Porsche.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.960]   >> I'm sorry, Mercedes.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:01.120]   I suggested the Blue Tech, what was it, 370?
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.720]   It was only 74.5 Alex's.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.600]   (laughing)
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.840]   I thought that was a deal.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.680]   >> Deal.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.520]   >> Deal.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.640]   >> You asked the important questions though,
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.480]   and though what kind of iPod dock connector does it come with?
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.320]   >> That's the key, isn't it?
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.080]   Don't all of them are saying, I don't know, but I thought,
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.920]   I mean.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.120]   >> I actually understand that's why Scott's buying a new car
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.800]   because the old one gives him that air message
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.560]   when he plugs his iPhone into it.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.800]   So he had to throw out his $53,000 BMW.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   (laughing)
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   >> He needs it.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.280]   He's trading up for an iPod connector.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.760]   >> I think that's fair.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.280]   I think that's completely fair.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.320]   >> Some people have standards of excellence.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.160]   >> I think you just get it.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.000]   >> I think you just get it.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.280]   Go ahead.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.120]   >> Oh, I'm just saying,
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.240]   some people have standards of excellence
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.360]   and this should not be mocked.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.360]   >> I think that a good Dremel tool and a hot iron
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.480]   and you build anything you need into that.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.240]   >> You don't do that to a beamer.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.160]   >> Dude.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.480]   >> You just gotta be creative.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.040]   (laughing)
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.360]   All right, let's talk about Apple
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.840]   because there's a lot of stories in the news today.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.480]   I'm so glad we moved this show to Wednesday.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.240]   And by the way, yes, this is the new day.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.320]   Net at night and Mac Break Weekly have swapped
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.440]   on the Twitter network because Apple kept coming up
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.680]   with announcements on Tuesday.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.240]   And once again, they did it again yesterday
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.120]   with a, they pushing out a few updates.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.560]   Safari 3.1, a security update.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.680]   Was there anything else?
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.720]   Seems like there was a third.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.560]   I don't remember.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.920]   You know, I hadn't checked for a while,
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.760]   so I saw those ones
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.840]   and I saw a whole bunch of other stuff
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.680]   that I had forgotten about.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.520]   >> Right, right.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.360]   >> No one in so.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.560]   >> I did have the big mega upgrade
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.360]   'cause I had too many projects going on
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.400]   in the past two weeks to actually upgrade to point two.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.200]   >> Right, oh, that's a big upgrade, yeah.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.040]   Did you do that?
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.600]   >> I finally did that last night
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.440]   and along with every update to iLife,
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.760]   every update to everything,
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.760]   it was more like, you know what, Mac book?
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.080]   I'm just gonna go away for a while.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.960]   I'm gonna come back.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.960]   If you're here, great.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.560]   If you're not, I understand.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.080]   If you added up, I think it was 100,
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.480]   it was probably 600 megabytes, all that stuff.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.600]   >> Yeah, it was huge.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.720]   >> It was, there was a tectonic shift in understanding.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.640]   >> Is it downloading in the background?
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.480]   >> So now it's downloading all this up in the background.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.480]   When you choose it and say,
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.320]   it's already sitting on your computer
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.080]   and you just, so that random time
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.480]   when you suddenly can't figure out why
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.280]   it's pulling 180 kilobytes.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.840]   >> Maybe that's it, yeah.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.480]   >> It's grabbing all those up there.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.600]   >> Maybe, is this just me?
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.080]   This is something that really bugs me.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.400]   If, you know, then after it does all that,
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.080]   it says, okay, now we have to restart,
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.920]   which is great.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.720]   I think it's good that Apple is,
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.760]   that's a very sensible thing,
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.080]   is to do the installs after, on a restart,
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.160]   so nothing's running.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.520]   And so that, I think that's a big improvement.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.320]   However, if something prevents the restart,
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.960]   my mail, 'cause I'm using iMap, always,
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.720]   mail always stops the restart.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.840]   It takes forever to quit.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.800]   Then when you do it again,
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.320]   it has to download everything all over again.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.720]   It doesn't, it doesn't happen to anybody else,
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.920]   is it just me?
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.800]   It seems like it doesn't remember
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.280]   that it got that stuff.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.640]   Mine gets very confused.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.480]   If I don't stop everything,
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.240]   and concentrate solely on letting that happen,
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.480]   and go through, and sometimes do the boot cache thing,
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.640]   or whatever, it's startup,
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.320]   it seems to go like it's a little autistic
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.600]   about knowing what happened at all,
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.760]   and it seems to want to start everything.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.240]   >> That's what I'm talking about, yes.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.480]   >> Yeah, I totally get that, yeah.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.880]   >> It's kind of annoying.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.960]   >> I've become, you know, I'll say,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.400]   as a very slight rat hole,
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.560]   I've become that guy now,
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.240]   where I, when I get the pop up,
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.320]   even if it's a security thing,
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.840]   I wait a couple days now.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.640]   Just because, like I mentioned to you,
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.200]   I'm not a fan of the software about how, you know,
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   of course, anytime Safari changes,
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.240]   all my plugins get bung for a few days,
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.200]   and now, you know, even with,
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.000]   now people are saying they got SSH crashing,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   have you guys heard this?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.440]   >> Groobers, I've been talking about that
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.840]   in his blog during fireball.net, he says--
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.560]   >> That's an unfortunate one to have crash on you.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.720]   >> Well, if you use it,
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.280]   I mean, I think it's probably a small number
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.640]   of people that use it, I use it all the time.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.200]   >> Well, if you're a command line person,
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.320]   it's arguably the most important command you've got, probably.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.640]   >> Yeah, I haven't read it.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.120]   >> On Apple discussions, 10.5.2 updated this Safari 3.1
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.040]   and security update.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.440]   After I did this update,
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.760]   I can't use the command line SSH client anymore.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.200]   When I start SSH, I immediately get a bus error
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.720]   on the shell, and then a number of people
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.960]   are saying, yes, same here, same here, same here.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.400]   I just tried SSH, I haven't had a problem.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.400]   So I'm not sure what the solution is.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.480]   Let me scroll down through this up very long thread
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.840]   on the Apple discussions.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.280]   >> Because that, I mean, I'm the furthest thing in the world
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.480]   from a Unix person.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.440]   I mean, I know enough to destroy my hard drive,
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.760]   but yeah, that's kind of the beginning
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.560]   of any kind of work you're gonna do for most people.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.280]   I think there are a lot of people who are,
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.800]   I know a lot of people who live their whole life
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.880]   off one box in another state.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.800]   >> Here's the fix.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.440]   >> Here's the fix, instant hijack,
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.240]   which is a part of Audio-Hijack Pro.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.080]   It's causing the problem.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.240]   I'm just scrolling down to the bottom of this.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.360]   >> Oh.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.880]   >> So if you unload instant hijack SSH works,
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.440]   this is why it's so hard to test software.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.640]   It's, I mean, this is what Microsoft's nightmare
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.840]   because there's so many ways a Windows machine
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.960]   could be configured.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.600]   But as the Mac world gets richer
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.840]   and there's a lot more stuff going on in the background,
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.840]   you're gonna see more stuff like this.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.840]   ROGAMIBA has a tech note and a fix at their website.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.560]   It's kind of funny, though, when you get outed
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.200]   as a user of a certain application
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.080]   in a way that you kind of hadn't expected.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.600]   >> Well, who would expect that would ruin SSH?
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.040]   >> Oh, it turns out that it was a BitTorrent client
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.080]   that would only cause problems
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.760]   if you were using copyrighted material.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.520]   >> It's that pouring downloader everybody's using.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.680]   That breaks it.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.040]   >> It's the porn you later fix.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.440]   >> That would be embarrassing, wouldn't it?
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.600]   >> That would be the modern version
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.160]   of the Emperor's new clothes.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.520]   It's the most wonderful, most stable operating system
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.640]   in the planet, as a matter of fact,
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.720]   the only thing that could ever cause a technical problem
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.080]   called technical support would be
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.480]   if you're downloading pornography
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.880]   that your wife doesn't know about.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.560]   >> I think right now your iPhone, Andy,
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.120]   your iPhone is downloading pornography.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.960]   We hear it.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.800]   (laughing)
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.960]   >> It's long because--
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.840]   >> It sounds like that Christian Davis movie.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.240]   >> Oh, no.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.720]   Is Paulie sure?
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.560]   It's hard to tell.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.840]   Sometimes you can't tell.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.680]   >> Uh, do you?
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.120]   >> Yeah, that's Paulie sure.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:04.960]   I recognize it.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.680]   Okay, now it's nice and quiet.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.000]   >> Busted and not 'cause busted.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.120]   >> I'm busted for loving my iPhone.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.960]   >> Oh.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.960]   >> I need to be connected to my loved ones.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.000]   >> He never wants to stop iPhoneing.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.960]   So anyway, I think it's a, you know,
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.160]   three one seems to be a little bit faster.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.240]   Yes, we agree or no.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.880]   I've been using WebKit, so I'm not really,
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.360]   but I went back to three one just to play with it,
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   just to see and it seems faster.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.040]   I can't tell what else has changed.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.200]   >> I would just say that there are a couple
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.080]   of different Web Apps that tend to sort of, you know,
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.600]   to bath up Safari and coincidentally,
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.600]   they're both news readers, Google Reader and Blog Lines.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.320]   I just happen to note, I don't know,
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.160]   this isn't conclusive 'cause I've only had it for a day,
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.800]   but I've noticed that I haven't gotten any of those script errors
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.200]   that I usually get after 20, 24 hours.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.040]   >> Excellent.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.240]   >> Usually I can count on at least once every 20 to 24 hours
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.080]   that hey, sorry, this is running slowly,
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.000]   we'd like me to terminate it.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.720]   They're by wasting me more time by forcing the tab back
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.160]   into the browser to dismiss this thing
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.200]   than it would just as simply as render slowly.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.880]   >> I wish Apple would do a change log or something
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.000]   just so that you understand.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.360]   Well, I mean, actually they do say quite a bit,
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.640]   I had support for CSS3 web fonts.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.040]   >> A lot of standards stuff.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.360]   >> Well, this is stuff that really got me interested
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.600]   because unfortunately, unfortunately or unfortunately,
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.640]   Safari has always been at least two steps ahead
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.480]   of everything else in terms of web design
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.040]   and in terms of new standards.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.160]   There have been people who have asked me,
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.480]   'cause I've got things like nice drop shadows
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.240]   on a lot of my CSS styles and they show up really wonderfully,
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.200]   obviously in Safari, but they don't show up any place else
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.280]   and I've actually gotten tech support on my site saying,
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.840]   "Gee, how come I've got a problem with Firefox
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.080]   or the render properly?"
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.320]   And I have to say, well, unfortunately,
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.360]   it is a standard, but Firefox is too busy doing things
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.640]   that only people who are doing double-stack TCIO
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.840]   in Pakistan would really appreciate the cool stuff
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.520]   for doing CSS and making websites look better.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.240]   So, I mean, is this just part of Apple's master plan
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.880]   to make sure that anything that works on a Macintosh
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.680]   must look four times better than I can
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.240]   on any non-Apple product?
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.000]   'Cause if we have sites that look absolutely stunning,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.400]   an Apple branded browser, but look like crap
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.880]   under Firefox or Explorer, that's interesting.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.720]   >> Well, here's the question.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.600]   Does those features come in as part
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.400]   of the open source web kit development?
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.880]   Or are those features come in as part
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.000]   of something Apple's doing in-house?
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.720]   You know, is it the K-Browser?
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.560]   Is it WebKit?
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.920]   Is it Apple?
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.200]   It's hard to tell who's doing what, I don't know.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.800]   >> Yeah, I did check out WebKit.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.200]   >> I love WebKit.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.760]   >> Yeah, I did check that out, like,
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.120]   as it happened a couple nights before,
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.000]   the update got pushed.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I think I did see those new styles imported.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.320]   >> WebKit is now, it's very stable, by the way,
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.000]   even though it's pre-release.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.120]   WebKit.org, I think we made it pick a couple of shows ago.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.520]   And there are nightly builds,
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.080]   which is a little much of a pain in the butt.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.080]   You have to download it every day
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.080]   when you first turn on your machine, you download a new one.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.920]   I'm looking at these, you know, the change log,
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.760]   and this is probably the part
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.720]   that you got fixed reader, under compatibility,
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.760]   increases site compatibility.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.320]   Under stability, improves application stability.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.520]   That's it.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.080]   >> Yeah, I was really hoping for extra onion compatibility
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.880]   and swing set compatibility.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.000]   What the hell has a site compatibility?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.840]   What?
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.920]   >> You know, they're going on and on
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.320]   about SVG images in the image elements and CSS tags,
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.200]   but then improve site compatibility.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.040]   I don't know.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.640]   I wish they'd be a little more forthcoming.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.640]   Is it a security thing?
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.840]   Maybe they don't want to tell people what they're doing.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   >> I'm just curious as to, you know,
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.840]   I mean, I'm just curious as to, you know,
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.040]   why not just say things like site look pretty, or?
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.360]   >> Mm, er, good computer, go more, good, good.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.480]   Security update fixes, AFP's client server fixes
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.560]   some holes in Apache, an app kit,
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.640]   quite a few holes in app kit,
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.800]   changes the German translation of the application
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.040]   firewall preference pane, which I think--
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.760]   >> Finally. >> Finally, they fixed that.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.040]   >> My hovercraft is fine.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.480]   >> I'm not used to saying that.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.880]   >> It used to say, "Zugriff auf bechstimt die denst
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.840]   und pol gremen feistigen."
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.160]   Now that might lead a user to believe the listed services
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.720]   were the only ones that be permitted,
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.000]   except incoming connections.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   So now it says something different.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.960]   It doesn't give us the translation.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.720]   ClamAV, I didn't know ClamAV.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.080]   Oh, it comes with OS 10 server, okay.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.120]   >> Unfortunately, my clams are analog.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.720]   >> Yeah, I know. >> Maybe it's time for an upgrade.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.480]   >> My clam was in the AV squad.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.040]   Cups, emax is fixed.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.680]   Well, that's good.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.520]   Actually, you know what?
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.800]   I take it back.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.520]   At least on the security fix, there's a lot of fixes.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.760]   >> It's cups in there automatically now,
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.280]   'cause I noticed you don't have to manually load it anymore.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.400]   Do you guys do many reinstalls from nothing
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.800]   or almost nothing on OS 10?
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.560]   >> I just did one on my 17-inch,
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.240]   which was acting very flaky,
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.800]   really beach-balling all the time.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.040]   So I just started over with Leopard.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.080]   >> Did you have SCK?
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.280]   I'm finding actually a lot more--
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.640]   >> Oh, interesting.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.800]   >> Yeah, I always start with--
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.200]   >> Do you force it?
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.840]   >> Mm-hmm, I do single user mode
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.320]   and then come up as FSCK-F-Y.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.920]   >> Tell them it, go step-by-step
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.800]   so people can follow along.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.680]   So you reboot the machine and hold the S key down?
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.520]   Is that how you get similar?
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.200]   >> Well, first of all, just a tiny bit of history.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.920]   I'm sure the days--
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.960]   we all probably remember this,
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.120]   I'm sure Andy in particular does.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.160]   If you remember the days when you--
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.520]   >> 'Cause he's so old.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.240]   >> 'Cause he's really-- he's old
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.040]   and important in the field, but mostly old.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.000]   There were days when you really needed Norton utilities,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.200]   like you needed like your car keys in your wallet.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.040]   >> Oh, yeah, that's good.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.000]   >> There were so many problems before OS 10.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.040]   And over time, just even normal usage
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.400]   of your hard drive would lead to all kinds of problems.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.160]   And a lot of that has gotten fixed to the point
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.200]   where now, I mean, a lot of disk repair stuff
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.760]   short of the disk warrior kind of stuff
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.440]   is really just voodoo.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.480]   But that said, in my experience on OS 10,
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.800]   if you start seeing a lot of beach balls,
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.760]   even with relatively small things going on,
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.080]   like if you notice like slowdowns
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.880]   with your browser in particular
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.040]   and beach balls going and you're kind of locked up
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:17.880]   and you can't change it.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.120]   >> Yeah, that was what was going on, yeah.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.720]   >> I'm gonna say 75 to 92% of the time.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.800]   It's 'cause you have a very small bit of disk damage.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.640]   >> I bet you're right.
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.720]   And of course, what I did is I did a clean install
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.480]   with a format.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.320]   >> Right.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.320]   >> Right, which is, yeah, like putting poop on a cracker.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.040]   You need to kind of fix the basis.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.160]   (laughing)
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.880]   So what I would do is, and this is old stuff
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.680]   to probably almost every single person,
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.840]   but restarting what's called single user mode,
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.440]   which means you tell your computer to restart.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.240]   And after you hear the ding, hold down command S,
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.800]   Apple S, and it'll come up with a command line
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.880]   that'll be very confusing
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.120]   if you've never seen it before.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.320]   But all you need to do is type seven characters,
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.200]   F, S, C, K, space, and then dash, FY.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.360]   >> And what does that do?
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.200]   >> Hit return.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.520]   That is Andy or somebody smarter than me
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.520]   help me with this disk.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.880]   It's a Unix command that you check.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.440]   >> File system check.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.400]   >> Yeah, so basically if you've got a journal disk,
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.280]   which is what OS 10 is, it's gonna run through
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.120]   and look for anything that it thinks looks goofy.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.880]   And then the, I forget whether it's the F
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.520]   or the Y fixes it for you automatically.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.160]   I hope I'm not giving any bad advice here.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.120]   I think this is pretty simple.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.400]   >> No, I think that's absolutely right.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.080]   You know, it's a check disk for Windows users.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.600]   It's something that Windows does all the time.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.640]   >> It's also, if you've ever started up in safe mode
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.680]   where you start up, it's kind of like the old,
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.600]   you know, remember back in the day,
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.960]   we'd start up with the shift down
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.720]   to shut off your extensions.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.600]   I believe I've starting, I don't know if it was with Tiger,
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.720]   but starting a few years ago,
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.880]   if you start up in safe mode,
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.200]   it does this check automatically for you as well.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.520]   >> Oh.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.400]   >> That's why it takes so long to start up in safe mode.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.080]   >> Oh, shit.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.520]   One note though, that sometimes you have,
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.760]   if it will give you like text like error messages,
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.040]   if it tells you that it found some things,
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.720]   found some things that needed to be fixed,
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.240]   if it does fix anything,
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.240]   it's a good idea to start again and run it.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.120]   And basically you need to run,
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.000]   that's, let me, I've never pronounced,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.560]   boy, it's just, you think those birds,
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.480]   and you're thinking, I'm gonna make sure I double check that,
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.360]   and I don't pronounce that the way that I should not pronounce it.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.800]   But run said utility once again,
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.960]   because oftentimes it'll fix something,
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.360]   but the fixes will allow it to see more problems.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.200]   So basically--
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.360]   >> Oh, run it twice.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.960]   >> Right, you just need to keep running it until--
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.000]   >> It's until nothing comes up.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.840]   >> Let me tell you, just--
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.880]   >> Are you wasting my time, sir?
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.280]   This disc is perfectly good.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.000]   >> I've done a man on FSCK,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.560]   and the dash F, it says force FS check,
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.400]   I'm gonna call FSCK FS check.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.440]   >> Force Y is just automatically fix it, I think.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.840]   >> Force F, no, no, no, no, listen carefully
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.240]   what you're telling people to do.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.080]   >> Force.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.760]   >> I is delete, delete, every, no, no, no.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.480]   >> Force, this is what it says, dash F, force FS check
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.640]   to check clean file systems when preening.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.480]   >> Okay.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.320]   >> Preening?
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.160]   >> When it's preening.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.840]   >> When it's preening?
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.920]   >> It says preening.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.440]   FS check preends a standard set of file systems
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.440]   or the specific file system,
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.600]   that's what it's doing, it's preening.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.920]   Now the Y says, I'm quoting,
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.560]   assuming yes response to all questions asked by FS check,
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.040]   this should be used with great caution,
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.120]   as this is a free license to continue
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.080]   after essentially unlimited trouble has been encountered.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.960]   >> Wow.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.840]   >> So you might not wanna use it,
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.800]   except that it's gonna give you a lot of verbose stuff
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.160]   that you probably won't know what to say.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.600]   >> That makes me wonder if there's some kind of built-in
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.600]   no-clobber stuff, because if you start up
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.960]   single user mode, it'll tell you right there,
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.000]   you need, here's how to run from S-bin, run FSCK.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   >> It has to be, because as we were,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   as you were asking me what the proper usage of the thing was,
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.080]   it just did a double check on Apple's support page
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.720]   just to make sure I knew what I was talking about.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.440]   And it actually does tell you to use the FY switches.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.800]   >> I think what the man pages saying is,
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.080]   look, if you really have a food bar drive,
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.800]   saying yes to everything could end up losing all your data,
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.720]   but you're doing this on a fresh drive anyway.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.000]   >> And if it's also--
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.440]   >> Also you have to realize that the Unix man pages,
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.800]   they have one of those chin beards and suspenders,
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.280]   and they start every answer with an anecdote.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.640]   >> Also remember it's called, remember it's called
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.480]   >> Man Page.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.160]   >> I was at the Johnson Space Flight Center,
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.440]   and we had a disc pack that wouldn't mow
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.520]   'cause it was a little Winchester subsystem,
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.800]   where as the, go to Apple's technical docs,
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.120]   and it'll just say, look, here's what to do,
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.960]   here's what it's gonna do, here's what to expect.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.800]   >> Well, on the other side,
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.480]   Apple's technical docs are gonna,
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.760]   they're gonna say whatever they can to limit
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.440]   the number of tech support calls they get.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.840]   So what they don't want you to do is call up and say,
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.520]   well, okay, well now it's asking me this,
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.560]   now it's asking me this,
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.600]   so it's just saying say yes to everything.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.360]   >> Which if you ask most women,
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.880]   they'll tell you that man has a known issue,
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.560]   which is called mail answer syndrome,
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.400]   which is whether it knows the answer or not,
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.400]   it'll pretend that it does.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.600]   >> And we've just demonstrated that right now.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.800]   >> I think the episodes of the show are both familiar with that.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.320]   (laughing)
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.720]   >> Oh yeah, I know how that works.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.880]   >> Sure, you got your journal,
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.280]   "A Good Bunch in Johnson Rod," of course.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.920]   >> There was a paper that was published in 1968,
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.680]   which documented both a test group and a control group,
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.960]   which eight men, I think three of them were Scandinavian,
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.520]   three were Canadians, but it still valid results.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.360]   Your BSN memory.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.200]   >> I don't know, I was talking about,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.400]   you're talking about Pinfield Winchester at all, '68?
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.760]   >> No, no, no, no, 'cause that was invalidated in '73.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.880]   >> That's what I was gonna say.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.920]   >> Unfortunately he falsified,
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.720]   he was using a Randiks type dispersion
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.120]   on the statistical analysis,
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.440]   he should have used a spare type dispersion.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.600]   So basically his scatter vector was totally off.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.600]   >> Well I heard there's some of that.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.440]   >> You know the guy.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.160]   >> If you run that back through
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.720]   and do a little bit of Monte Carlo analysis on it,
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.440]   you'll find the disparate on that
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.240]   is actually perfectly crummingle.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.760]   >> You know, and I like to take the whole thing
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.240]   and just run a Butterworth filter over the--
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.720]   (laughing)
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.840]   >> If you don't get that Johnson Rod fix though,
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.680]   you're gonna run a truck.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.520]   (laughing)
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.840]   >> See the thing is it has sinosoidal replenoration,
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.320]   so if you don't have a freestanding
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.080]   basically that you've reframulated amylite.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.320]   I'm saying, I'm saying, Merlin, Merlin, Merlin,
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.480]   you're gonna wanna cheap out and go with a copper base plate
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.960]   but unless it's been pre-famulated
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.600]   and now it's got an amylite content,
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.040]   you're gonna get screwed, okay?
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:02.880]   You're telling?
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.720]   >> I have one of those.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.720]   >> I will not let you do that Merlin.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.880]   >> You've learned to click a link in on the flaven
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.400]   and I found that you did not fully arrange the flaven.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.160]   >> Hey did you hear that Gary Gygags passed away?
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.600]   (laughing)
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.720]   >> You gotta bring the room out.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.240]   >> That started it, that didn't, that stopped them all.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.160]   >> Ooh, no I don't wanna be a D&D person, I'm sorry.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.760]   >> He's rolling natural 20s in heaven right now.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.120]   >> You'll see, you're pelted,
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.720]   not at the correct level to cast that.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.920]   Actually I believe you'll find that
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.440]   if you've been wearing high-hard boots,
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.640]   this would not have been a problem.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.240]   >> It wasn't a trap, it was a natural weakness
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.080]   in the cave wall, so therefore you still
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.480]   was not gonna have any effect
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.960]   on your party is now dead.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.360]   They'd be now, you would listen to the dungeon master
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.640]   when he says they're a top lift
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.080]   on the top of the cave entrance.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.400]   >> You'd expect carefully, you'll find
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.480]   there's a remainder, but gelatinous cube,
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.680]   that could have been not put into the bag of holding,
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.040]   that would have caused too much heaviness,
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.640]   what not for the carriage of this turn.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.320]   >> I've got your bag of holding right here,
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.440]   I'm holding it right now.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.400]   >> I was a prisoner, no more fist fights
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.560]   in the backs of comic shops.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.480]   >> In my experience, when you run this FSCK,
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.400]   until you're basically, until you pee clear,
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.120]   when you restart, you will find that that problem is gone.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.240]   Now, that said, if you've got really, really, really,
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.240]   like thorny problems, two words,
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.880]   actually one word probably, disc warrior,
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.920]   that's disc warrior is what you need
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.400]   to fix these problems.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.280]   But for the general, like Leo is getting beach balls,
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.960]   and we all know how painful that can be,
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.320]   running FSCK I think fixes.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.600]   >> I passed a beach ball last night,
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.960]   but I think I still got one to go.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.440]   >> Make sure you run, do it so you run clear,
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.880]   that's the only way that this will.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.120]   >> No, I think you're right, I probably should have done that.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.600]   Now, I think having formatted,
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.920]   I don't have to worry because I,
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.800]   formatting preens the file system as well.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.880]   So I think I'm probably,
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.920]   preened enough.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.120]   >> But we'll see, if they come back,
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.760]   then I'm going to bow to your infinite wisdom, Mr. Mann.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.120]   >> But this was all in the service of saying,
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.960]   have you noticed the crazy, huge footprint,
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.360]   if you install all the printer drivers?
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.200]   >> Oh, cups, we started with cups, didn't we?
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.280]   >> Cups, cups, the thing is,
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.560]   as I understand cups, which is the--
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.840]   >> I don't install all those drivers, that's crazy.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.960]   >> I'm not just the one for Epson, which is my printer.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.520]   I think it was the Canon one or the HP one.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.880]   >> And the languages.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.880]   >> It's not just the printer drivers,
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.440]   as the languages are hundreds of megabytes.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.680]   >> Yeah, turn those off.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.560]   >> Can you still do that?
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.200]   Can you do that in the options still?
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.600]   >> It's culturally insensitive, Alex.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.400]   >> It is, what if somebody sends you a Japanese email?
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.280]   >> Well, hi, I'm a Japanese guy,
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.920]   and now I can't use Alex's computer.
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.760]   Thanks.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.920]   >> Ha!
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.520]   >> You know, didn't you listen to Barak's speech yesterday?
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.360]   (laughing)
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.200]   All right, let's move on.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.520]   >> We've covered, we'll say we covered that.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.400]   Has anybody got a new favorite app for trimming that stuff
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.800]   after you've already done an install?
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.360]   >> Yeah, 'cause we don't, we recommended one at one time,
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.160]   which now I'm hearing is not a good choice.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.680]   (laughing)
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.120]   >> We're so great for the advice.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.320]   >> Can cause problems.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.160]   >> I think--
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.080]   >> What's like RM space, Dad?
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:54.000]   >> My suggestion is do it in the installer, don't do it.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.600]   I really think it's risky to,
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.120]   well remember that program that we recommended,
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.080]   I don't remember the name of it,
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.680]   not only removed language resources from the operating system,
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.520]   but from applications as well.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.840]   It was aggressive as heck.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.840]   And I, yeah, it saved a lot of space, but at what price?
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.960]   At the price of everything but English.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:11.920]   >> True.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   No one in German.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.040]   >> If English was good enough for our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.600]   it ought to be good enough for my man.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.600]   >> That's true.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.480]   That's true, Aaron, nobody speaks Aramaic anymore.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.320]   I heard you can remove your library file
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.840]   and the whole folder and nothing goes wrong.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.200]   That's a lot of that is just marketing in the library.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.200]   (laughing)
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.200]   >> And they're not listening to that man!
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.840]   >> Go to the top level slash library.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.440]   >> RM, slash RF, slash library.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.320]   And you'll save lots of space.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.160]   And you can then use your computer as a wonderful doorstop
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.000]   or--
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:42.840]   >> Application support?
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.760]   >> What am I, a child?
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.480]   I don't need applications.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.800]   >> Okay, ladies and gentlemen, everything you've heard
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.040]   on this show up to this point, please fully disregard,
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.320]   we cannot be held responsible for what happens to your Mac
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.800]   after you listen to Mac break weekly.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.280]   >> Listeners, I was gonna say,
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.360]   is usually a good idea to listen to the entire show
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.240]   from start to finish.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.320]   Don't be hitting pause.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.160]   I think you're going to do it.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.600]   >> I totally should have said that.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.000]   >> Oh God, we're in trouble.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.400]   (laughing)
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.400]   >> But if people in this fair show--
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.400]   >> For sure, I did that, there was a hard one.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.280]   >> Something like 75 or 80,000 people listen to this show,
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.440]   what percentage of them paused right after that and did it?
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.880]   >> You should just have an announcement every few seconds
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.720]   in a very calm woman's voice that goes,
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.960]   don't do any of this.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.280]   >> Please, do not listen to these gentlemen.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.160]   They know what-- >> But not of what they speak.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.200]   Put your mouse down.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.840]   >> We'll make it even simpler, folks.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.760]   When we're talking using these voices,
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.720]   we're lying or making stuff up.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.360]   However, when we use a wacky voice like this,
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.320]   that means we tested and tried it out
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.360]   and you can trust it, fair ding them, fair to finish.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.760]   >> Make sure you got lots of backups.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.400]   >> That's how it's true.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.080]   Okay, so other big stories, other big stories
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:54.760]   are of course that Apple is mulling a subscription plan,
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.200]   but better than that, the same kind that Nokia does
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.040]   where they pay a fee to the record companies,
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.160]   Nokia pays $80, Apple says, "We'll pay $20."
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.640]   And then you get lifetime for the lifetime of the device,
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.560]   access to the music libraries,
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.800]   which would be cool, you buy an iPod, pay what?
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.520]   I don't know, 100 bucks extra.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.800]   You know, get the iPod deluxe,
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.040]   and then you can download unlimited music
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.040]   as long as that thing works.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:18.920]   I like that.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.160]   >> I just don't know how it would work.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.400]   Would it work just with this one device?
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.560]   >> So I can purchase stuff that would give me 30 second samples
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.960]   when I'm playing it from my notebook.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:33.160]   It would give me the full thing when I sync it to my iPhone
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.120]   or my iPod.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.280]   >> I think, well, in this case,
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.440]   I think you just be able to download it for free
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.640]   and put it on your on that iPod.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.720]   >> But there would be DRM because what it would do
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.960]   is it would have to check to make sure
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.920]   that you had that subscription and had for that device.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.760]   >> But the model already.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.360]   >> Yes, the iPod touch is the only one
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.640]   that can download stuff directly from the iTunes store.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.800]   So unless we're talking about--
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.840]   >> No, it would have to sync with iTunes.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.840]   >> Well, then, wouldn't that imply that for the 100 bucks
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.440]   or the 20 bucks, I'm getting unlimited access by iTunes?
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.600]   Will it say, when I try to play this thing,
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.440]   will it say, oh, I'm sorry, you only bought that
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.440]   in under the umbrella of your $100 fee for this iPod?
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.960]   So I'll give you the 30 second sample
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.280]   so you can tell what it is,
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.240]   but the only way to play it, start to finish,
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.720]   is when it's been synced and put onto this device.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.160]   >> Let me look, see what Nokya's doing,
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.720]   'cause they're the only ones doing this right now.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.840]   They call it the "Comes with Music."
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.160]   >> I think the Nokya, I mean, I think it's assuming
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.120]   that you're gonna download it.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.360]   >> Users will be able to download the tracks
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.240]   either via the handset, this is the Nokya plan,
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.320]   or a PC, syncing songs from one device to the other
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.360]   will be possible, tracks will be encoded in WMA DRM format,
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.680]   obviously, that's going to change.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.320]   It hasn't gone live yet, it will go live,
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.200]   they say the second half of this year,
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.120]   and they don't say what will happen
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.400]   after your 12 months is up.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.720]   So the free download is not for the life of the device,
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.000]   it is for one year.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.800]   >> But that's what they're talking about.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.480]   They're talking about doing it for the life of the device.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.160]   >> That's what it says here, but the Nokya plan,
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.560]   what they're also saying is Nokya paid $80 for one year,
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.440]   and Apple wants to pay $20 for the life of the device,
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.080]   I don't think so.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.160]   >> You know what I do if I were Apple?
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.840]   I'd figure this is a very unappled thing to do,
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.920]   but if I were Apple, I would make it so that
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.040]   when you buy a new Apple TV, we give you a coupon,
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.680]   let's you go and get a year of this for free,
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.240]   or even six months of it for free.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.480]   That would move some units.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.520]   To say like, from now on, here's your Apple thing,
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.440]   and by the way, if you wanna go grab music
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.840]   for the next six months, go do it.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.880]   >> But you'd have to, I mean, Apple would have to charge more
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.840]   for the Apple TV then.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.160]   >> I guess so, I mean, that would be $100,
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.040]   just that's the deal, you'd have to pay that.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.840]   I'm just thinking that would be a way to move some units,
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.680]   because now you've got a home unit.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.400]   >> Heck yeah, heck yeah.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.480]   I wish they would do something like that for Apple TV.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.400]   I just love my Apple TV, but I'm sure it's stalled.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.400]   >> I love it, I'm sure it's stalled.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.480]   >> So that's, according to Nokya,
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.800]   Nokya owners who buy a phone, one of the handsets
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.560]   with this deal will be given full, free,
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.040]   and unlimited access to everything available
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.240]   on the Nokya music store.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.600]   So that, I don't know what that,
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.800]   I guess that means Andy, yes, your scenario is accurate.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.720]   You could listen to a preview,
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.520]   but you had to put on a device to hear the whole thing.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.000]   That would make sense, you're gonna have to do something
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.160]   like that.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.600]   Otherwise you're right, 'cause then your iTunes
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.840]   would have complete access too.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:21.160]   >> Yeah, I mean, the more I look at other services,
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.920]   the more I'm convinced that Apple has got to have
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.800]   a solution to the problem of always having to buy
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.400]   every single track you use and never getting anything,
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.080]   any real music for free.
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:36.080]   Not just with Amazon selling you totally unprotected,
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.400]   totally DRM free content.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.920]   I'm talking about so many other sources
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.560]   where you can pay either monthly fee
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.160]   and get access to the entire library
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.560]   and sync it to certain devices to services
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.000]   that will just let you listen to,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.800]   you use internet radio where they will license
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.520]   an entire library, an entire catalog of music.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.200]   And so you could basically build a playlist for 10 minutes
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:59.240]   and spend the next six hours listening to full 256K
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.440]   music start to finish.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.600]   >> Well, I have to say this was the model
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.000]   Yahoo music store used and was cheap
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.560]   and they went out of business.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.920]   If you buy a Zoom you can do that.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.160]   In fact, when I was trying out my Zoom
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.000]   I had a month subscription to the Zoom store
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.400]   and that was great because especially if it's your first
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.280]   device and you don't have a lot of digitized music.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.400]   It is a good way to bring new users in
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.440]   because you buy the device and now you say
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.640]   I'll put that album on that album.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.400]   You fill it right there and it's a great feeling.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.760]   Now you have a device with a lot of good music on it.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.160]   >> The other thing I'm concerned about is that
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.840]   you are constricted by the way that the world was
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.080]   when you were a kid.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.600]   And we're starting to have the first generation of kids
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.680]   that grew up with the understanding that music
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.680]   doesn't have to be paid for.
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.520]   That you just go out and get it.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.320]   >> That's what music industry is worried about, isn't it?
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.240]   >> Well, but it might be one of those shifts
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.680]   that they just can't fight at this point.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.520]   I mean, it's really hard, it's starting to get hardwired in.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.360]   So I'm not saying that people that when these kids
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.880]   actually have jobs and can actually buy things
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:56.200]   that they're not gonna want to actually pay for things.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.200]   But a model in which you say,
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.800]   give us 10 bucks a month and we give you free access
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.720]   to everything might be more palatable
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.680]   to that generation of consumers than,
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.680]   oh, you want a song?
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.520]   It'll cost you how much time?
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.360]   >> Or better yet.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.920]   >> You buy the device and it comes with it for free.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.720]   >> I would take it a step further and say that
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.160]   you're gonna see people fighting to be the ones
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.200]   who are allowed to give stuff away on the iTunes store.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.840]   I mean, I don't think that's radical to say
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.160]   that within five years you're gonna wish you were the one
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.560]   that had that channel in front of you.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.400]   And if you don't have that,
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.640]   then people are gonna be throwing money at Apple
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.040]   and other companies like Crazy.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.360]   >> That's interesting.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.760]   This is a model that's dying, dying dead.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.400]   And to just keep pretending,
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.360]   I'm sorry, this is like, you may take a drink.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.840]   This is our music conversation.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:35.680]   But you know what I'm saying?
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.000]   Like to be on the platform,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.040]   I'm not usually a big believer
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.480]   in the whole first mover advantage thing.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.920]   I think that's kind of overstated.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.760]   But if you could be the one who is the anchor tenant
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.800]   at Apple going, you know what, fine.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.040]   Here's free samples of everything.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:46.880]   And here's something you can download.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.600]   >> What's the business model though?
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.600]   You gotta make money in this.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.280]   >> The business model is that then you come in
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.080]   and you're first of all, you're getting people in the habit
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.200]   of seeing iTunes as the place that you go
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.600]   for all of your music, right?
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.520]   It becomes that notion corner record store,
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.680]   except for a bunch of Julian people internationally.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.960]   And so you're what you're trying to do.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.040]   If they are the platform,
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.880]   that's gonna be the place that people buy music,
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.360]   then there's a lot of money to be made.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.320]   But right now, do you understand,
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.480]   like record companies give away like two CDs
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.120]   for everyone that they sell right now?
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.480]   I mean, it's not like they're not getting,
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.320]   it's not like I don't have an exact ad.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.160]   >> Is that true?
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.000]   Where did you see that?
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:18.840]   >> That's what I have heard that.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.680]   I do not have a style.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.680]   >> Giving away how?
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.040]   In cereal boxes, what are they there?
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.160]   >> You're constantly sending money to a store.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.400]   >> To record stores and radio stations.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.160]   >> And giveaways on the radio station.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.200]   I mean, we used to have, when I was spending,
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.040]   I had that.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:34.960]   >> I don't know if that's everything.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.800]   >> Does that make sense?
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.800]   I mean, let's say you have 100,000 selling album.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.840]   You're saying that you saw 100,000 people bought it
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.800]   and 200,000 people got it free?
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.080]   >> We should ask a friend of mine
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.960]   who's in the music industry to come and talk about this.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:47.800]   >> Jonathan Cole?
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.880]   >> And I would, I would love to have Jonathan
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.000]   on every show that I want.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.280]   But no, what I would like to do--
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.760]   >> No, I know, we'll ask.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.960]   >> Next week, Patrick Wilson of Weezer joins us.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.720]   >> Patrick Wilson of Weezer, what are you talking about, Leo?
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.360]   >> I'm not kidding you.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.480]   >> Are you talking about the drummer
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.000]   from one of my all-time favorite bands
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.080]   might be on Mac Break Weekly?
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.560]   >> I wouldn't mind is.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.560]   He asked to be on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.400]   >> He sure is.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.240]   >> Are you sure?
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.480]   >> He hits him.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.000]   >> Well, he says he's Patrick.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.160]   >> He can't lie about something like that.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.760]   >> He says he's the drummer of Weezer.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.120]   You wouldn't make that up.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.560]   >> You know what, we should have a drum off on the show
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.440]   just to prove he knows who he is.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.080]   Well, there you go.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.340]   (mumbling)
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:32.920]   >> This is exciting.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:33.760]   No, he's going to join us.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.680]   You know what, there's a guy we could ask
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.960]   who would probably know something about this subject.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.960]   >> I would also--
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.680]   >> That disqualifies him from conversation.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.280]   (laughing)
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.440]   >> I do think we'll just shout him down.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.120]   Don't worry, we'll just shout him down.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.280]   >> I do think that a hybrid, you know,
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.680]   of what Apple already has in this,
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.800]   I mean, we've talked about this before,
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.360]   but being able to have a subscription
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.880]   that I pay a certain amount and get a ton,
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.360]   I'd be happy to pay 10 bucks a month,
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.200]   or even 15 bucks a month to just have this ongoing,
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.720]   I can fill up my iPod with stuff,
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.520]   where I can still buy 256-bit, you know, DRM-free,
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.360]   if I really want to--
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.920]   >> Would you though, would you buy music
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.760]   if you have this subscription?
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.720]   >> Yeah, there's certain bands that I'd call like.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:09.560]   >> I guess that's true,
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.560]   'cause I have a Netflix subscription,
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.560]   but I still buy DVDs once in a while.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.760]   >> Right, so--
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.600]   >> 'Cause there is stuff you want to actually keep
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.120]   and you want to be able to trust that a year from now,
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:17.960]   you'll be able to get your hands on it.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.960]   >> And I almost always regret buying them, by the way.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.280]   >> More, more, more, more, more, more.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.840]   >> I mean, there's a difference between Sunday,
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.560]   go to meet and close versus like work close.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.200]   It isn't like people go out and buy one shirt
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.200]   and that's all that they wear.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.320]   >> Do you have Sunday meet and go to meet and close?
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.240]   >> I do, I have a very fancy hat that I like to wear,
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.600]   it's got lots of feathers.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.440]   And it's a big--
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.240]   >> The front wheel of your bike is like two yards wide.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.920]   >> What do they call that in the wire?
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.120]   Was her church platter, what was it called?
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.520]   >> Omar's grandmother.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.200]   >> Yeah, and they shot it.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.040]   What was it called?
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.240]   Her church something.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.760]   >> I forget, her church bonnet or something like that.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.040]   >> Oh, it was like a platter or it's something strange anyway.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.920]   >> But I'm just saying it's a terrible metaphor
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.800]   and there's hardly anything about it that makes sense.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.440]   But you understand that when things do eventually
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.320]   become a commodity, there's still lots of people
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.800]   who are going to buy different versions of it.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.600]   >> Well, understand, we're going a step further than this.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.720]   The end user doesn't really write a check for anything.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.120]   >> You're saying iTunes should rent pants.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.400]   >> I'm saying iTunes comes with pants.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.440]   You get two pants with every suit.
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.760]   >> That's a model.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.120]   >> If you look at Nine Inch Nails,
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.320]   we were talking about this on This Week in Media last night,
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.480]   Trent Reznor gave away his album
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.520]   and has made $1.6 million.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.360]   >> They're very happy.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.520]   >> Yeah, in 10 days, it made $1.6 million.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.840]   >> That's not it.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.000]   >> I'm kind of sick of hearing people blog about this
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.440]   as another sign of the death of the modern music model.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.720]   I mean, there's a Steve Martin routine that starts,
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.000]   I'll give you a two-step process to make a million dollars
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.760]   and not pay a set in taxes.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.040]   >> Two-step process for making a million dollars
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.600]   and not paying a set in taxes.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.440]   Step one, get a million dollars.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.160]   Step two, because when I'm seeing--
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.480]   >> What was step two?
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.880]   >> How to step step two is when the IRS comes after you
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.160]   just simply say, "I forgot."
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.480]   (laughing)
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.840]   >> But what I'm getting at is that--
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.160]   >> Shoot, I don't know if that'll work.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.920]   >> This proves that the middle men are unnecessary,
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.880]   they're dinosaurs, and this is how all this music
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.960]   is going to be distributed.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.160]   It's like, okay, well, here's your wonderful step two process
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.960]   on how to make a million dollars for millions of fans
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.800]   on the internet.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.240]   Step one, get a million fans.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.320]   Step two, put your album on the internet.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.880]   I mean-- >> Yeah, but I would say
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.640]   that Trent Reznor has not gotten much help
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.120]   from his label for a decade.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.520]   I mean, almost everything that he sold
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:35.400]   for the last 10 years or 15 years has been driven
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.680]   completely by his own work.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.480]   >> And Andy, wouldn't you say that the record industry
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.560]   is looking pretty hard, pretty desperately
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.760]   for new business models?
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.040]   >> Absolutely, but this is kind of an absurd,
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:46.880]   example.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.680]   The good examples on how to make money
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.160]   distributing your own content,
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.120]   guys like Scott Kurtz, he's the Sterling example
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.600]   where he is online.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.800]   >> Exactly, the boy genius cartoonist of PvP online,
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:03.400]   who he's not making enough money to start PvP co-enterprises,
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.440]   the international conglomerate that does cartoons,
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.640]   movies, TV shows, and canned rice.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.160]   But he can make a comfortable living off the fruits
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.520]   of his own labors without having to cut the profits up
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.240]   between himself, distributors, syndicate,
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.760]   and that sort of people.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.120]   I think that when we see this big revolution,
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.320]   20, 30 years from now, you're going to see a lot of people
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.640]   making a comfortable living from their music.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.360]   We're not going to have the sort of people
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.760]   who have drive a role, own three giraffes sort of money.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.960]   We're going to have people who are making decent money,
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.640]   but not the sort of huge successes
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.680]   that a lot of people are sort of hoping for
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.400]   when they dream about how big they could possibly
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.320]   make it a music business.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.520]   >> But I don't think that artists, most artists
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.120]   that I used to work with when I was in the music industry,
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.880]   they weren't dreaming, they were dreaming of people
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:47.520]   showing up at their show, not dreaming of making millions
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.640]   and millions and millions of dollars.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.720]   Now, I have to admit they were in the alternative rock thing
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.560]   and they were doing their thing and they just wanted
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.920]   to keep on making a living doing it.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.440]   And I think you're absolutely right though.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.080]   I think that the age of the superstar
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.800]   is probably on its way out.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.480]   And we're going to see much people making
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.520]   a more reasonable amount of money, good money,
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.600]   but not millions and millions and millions of dollars
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.680]   per album because I think that machine is going away.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.160]   >> According to the Financial Times,
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.160]   which broke this story, subscriptions
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.040]   would be available, or possibly could be available
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.240]   on the iPhone devices because Apple has that monthly billing.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.360]   While the comes with music model would work with iPhones
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.680]   and iPods, and according to their source,
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.560]   which is an inside source at Apple,
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.520]   the only sticking point, the entire discussion hinges
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.320]   on how much Apple should pay.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:34.520]   One Apple executive is quoted as saying,
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:39.200]   it's who blinks first and whether or not anyone does blink.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.080]   But if Apple gets to the point where they're offering
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.720]   closer to what Nokia is offering, $80 a device,
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.160]   I mean, record industry's already said,
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.000]   we'll do it with the Nokia, why wouldn't they do it
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:48.840]   with an iPod?
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.600]   I mean, there's a chance to sell a lot of music.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.080]   >> I think Apple's argument about the $20 is that,
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.840]   yeah, Nokia's charging 80, but we're going to sell
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:01.160]   10 times more iPods than Nokia's going to sell phones
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.640]   that have that service.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.640]   >> Sure.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.560]   >> So you sell, what do they sell now?
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.360]   One and a half million a quarter iPods?
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.800]   How many do they sell?
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.320]   >> I think it's more than that.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.320]   A lot more than that.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.320]   I don't remember what the number is,
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.200]   but I think it's more like 10 or 20 million.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.920]   >> So 10 million times 20 bucks is a lot,
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.000]   it's probably more money than the record industry's
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   getting in from a lot of sources.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.920]   Well, also realize that the record industries
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.120]   have a great motivation for doing great things
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.640]   for companies other than Apple,
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.760]   because now they're really, really scared that
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.560]   if Apple continues this level of success
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.720]   with the iTunes Store, they could be in a position
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.880]   ultimately where they can't ask anything of Apple,
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.600]   where Apple dictates the terms and they simply--
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.440]   >> That scares them.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.280]   >> Step to it.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.840]   If you take a look at the hulu.com,
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.400]   which finally went live this week,
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.000]   that when NBC and Fox and all these other producers
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.640]   pulled their content from the iTunes,
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.920]   their TV shows from the iTunes Store--
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.880]   >> Or more importantly from YouTube,
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.800]   I mean that was even more of a--
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.120]   >> Well, I think the big deal was that
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.080]   they're no longer willing to get a Buck 99 per episode
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.080]   of House Downloaded.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.480]   Now they want to give it away for free,
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.280]   but they want to be able to control exactly
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.440]   who gets it, who gets those ads.
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.480]   >> That's a good incident, those that.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.320]   >> Right.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.120]   >> And it doesn't work with video box,
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.880]   which is a big bummer.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.960]   >> Well, Hulu, you know, Hulu, they say,
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.040]   has done very well, but I think that's initially,
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.960]   well people continue to sit in front of their computer
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.040]   to watch, they have full-length movies,
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.640]   they have the usual suspects on there,
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.480]   but we'll be able to--
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.320]   >> Got the big Lebowski.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.160]   >> Huh?
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.000]   >> They've got the big Lebowski.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   >> Yeah, they have the Lebowski.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.760]   I've got the movie page in front of me right here,
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:34.120]   and I see as many movies here that get me interested
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.400]   in sitting down and watching a movie
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.080]   as I see on the iTunes.com.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.520]   >> I agree, I agree, but will you watch it on your computer?
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.440]   How do we get it on our TV?
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.160]   >> A lot of people will, I mean, the answer to that is
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.120]   to get an Apple TV, not to get an Apple TV,
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.480]   but to get a Mac mini.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.400]   >> That's what will happen.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.760]   >> Yeah, I think that's a real geek thing to do.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.240]   I don't think most people are gonna hook a computer
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.800]   up to their big screen TV.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.320]   But are most people gonna be willing to spend $3.99
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.240]   to get a movie for 24 hours as opposed to--
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.160]   >> Oh, that's a good question.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:01.040]   >> Getting it for free and getting it however--
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.560]   >> I think the jury's out on which model
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.480]   is a better model, I really do.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.720]   >> So, but it's interesting, I mean,
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.280]   if these guys were really, really interested
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:12.080]   in monetizing their content as great as possible,
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.360]   they'd say, "Look, Apple, hear the keys."
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.520]   As a matter of fact, we'll put the Pokemon keychain on it,
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.880]   keep the big lights up and you press it,
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.360]   by all means enjoy it, have fun.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.000]   Make us as much money as possible.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.360]   I think that there's an interesting sort of back and forth
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.440]   going on here where studios are willing to take less money
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.960]   for more power, hoping that the more power
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.960]   will translate into more money in five years.
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.840]   >> I think that the other risk that they're still running
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:40.320]   is that if Apple gets too much control in this area
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.560]   and they already have a lot of music,
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.200]   and the subscription service would be one of the final nails
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:47.240]   to really just owning the industry, there is a point.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.560]   And we get back to the nine and two nails thing,
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.120]   he said, "You know, the step one is to have a million dollars."
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:53.960]   But the question is, is for these big artists,
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:56.840]   why would you use, when your record contract
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.600]   runs out like R.E.M. just did?
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.960]   Or if you're Sting or if you're Alanis Morissette
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.560]   or someone who does, who can do that,
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.920]   why would you work with your label
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.880]   when you can just go directly to iTunes?
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.960]   >> Well, and this is what keeps the label in the mix
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.720]   because only a label can make a deal like this.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.960]   >> Oh, if Sting said, Sting came to Apple and said,
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.560]   I want to sell my stuff directly through iTunes,
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.760]   they'd sort it out.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.800]   >> Well, no, wait a minute, no, they wouldn't sort it out.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.520]   What I'm going to pay, I'll pay $99 for my iPod,
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.600]   but if I want Sting, I'll pay 105.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.600]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm saying,
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.560]   if Sting wanted to put his own music on--
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.440]   >> On iTunes, yes, but not this subscription,
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.440]   that's what I'm saying, this subscription model,
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.960]   keeps the record labels in the mix
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.200]   because it has to be an aggregator.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:38.880]   >> And so I think that's why
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.240]   the record labels are interested in this.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:44.720]   By the way, Apple sold 22 million iPods in Q4 2007,
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.560]   so that'd be almost half a billion dollars,
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.240]   even at 20 dollars.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:52.480]   And you go up to 80 dollars, we're talking two billion dollars.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.720]   We're talking big bucks here
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.040]   that Apple can move a lot of.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.440]   Now, would it be on every iPod?
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.600]   I don't think so, would it?
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.200]   >> I still think you're looking at a hybrid model.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.760]   I don't think you're looking at one or the other.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.600]   >> Well, that's the question.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.000]   If it's on every iPod, in other words,
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.040]   if it's just a surcharge now on every iPod,
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.400]   and Apple probably could give up 20 bucks per iPod, right?
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.480]   Then, that sells more iPods,
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.320]   the iPod market is stagnating a little bit.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.600]   Wouldn't you be much more likely to buy it?
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.320]   I'd buy a new iPod if I knew I could fill it
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.800]   with music for a year, or would you?
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.960]   >> I don't know that I would do that.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.960]   I mean, why not?
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:32.160]   There's the idea of first of,
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.600]   actually, a perfect example.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:38.600]   I mean, the first damage in the pulling
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.080]   of all Fox content from the iTunes store
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.920]   was when I desperately needed to get a copy
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.400]   of an episode of "House,"
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.760]   because my T-Vogue didn't record the last 15 minutes of it.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.160]   So I'd seen all the blank walls,
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.120]   I'd seen three misdiagnoses of Lupus,
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.600]   but I didn't know exactly what had happened
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.000]   to this poor woman.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.760]   And the problem, and they pulled it,
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.360]   obviously they pulled all those episodes from the store,
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.080]   so I couldn't get it.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:04.800]   But not only that, but they pulled every episode everywhere.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.760]   And so now the four or five episodes that I had on iTunes
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.440]   were the only episodes that,
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:12.720]   the only iTunes encoded content that I would ever get.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.680]   So what happens when you have the Superduper,
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.320]   I've got all, all you can eat access
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.960]   to the iTunes store for a lifetime,
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.920]   but then someone pulls a certain track back,
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.160]   and it happens to music as well.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.800]   The Times where I've bookmarked,
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.960]   I've saved certain tracks, I'm thinking about buying,
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.640]   but I'm not in the financial league
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.520]   to spend 99 cents on this track yet,
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.120]   but then I'll double click on it to finally buy it,
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.240]   and it says, "Sorry, this is no longer available
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.640]   off the iTunes store."
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.720]   When you have access to something that you own,
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.720]   meaning that this episode of "House that I Bought a Year ago,"
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.560]   it's mine, as long as I back it up,
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.920]   I will never be without this episode.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.160]   - Do you think people think of that though?
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:45.160]   I mean, you think they, I know you're thinking of that, Andy.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.040]   But do you think most people are thinking of that?
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.560]   Oh, what happens if they pull it?
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.800]   - Well, that is a good point, but I mean,
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.720]   every experience is a good experience
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.280]   till the first time it gets soured,
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.880]   and then it kind of gets tainted almost forever.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.760]   I mean, if there's a track that you always,
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.360]   that's part of your standard playlist
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:04.520]   that you just always listen to, always listen to,
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:05.920]   and then a year from now,
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.520]   let's go to a worst case scenario
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.960]   because this is the internet and we want to be negative.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.320]   Let's just say that your favorite song,
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.200]   suddenly Apple no longer has licensing rights for it
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:18.160]   or the licensing rights as applied to this,
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.960]   all you can eat metaphor have expired.
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.840]   Suddenly you try to play it from your playlist
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.880]   and it's disappeared, and you try to find out
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.080]   what happened to it, and then you get that error message
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.520]   saying, yes, this piece of music
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.240]   that was on your computer for the past year
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.960]   now is no longer on your computer
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.960]   because we no longer have the right to let you have it.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.600]   - Well, but I think when you look at this though,
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.720]   I'm still looking at the issue of,
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.400]   if I really like that song and I'm listening to it
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.040]   over and over and over again,
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.440]   I'm gonna buy it from apple.com,
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.800]   or I'll go to, if it's not on iTunes,
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.520]   if it's not on iTunes, I'm gonna go to Amazon.com
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.400]   and buy it 'cause Merlin says
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.200]   that that's the place to go to buy music.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.600]   And so I'm gonna go there, if it's not there,
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.800]   I'm gonna be able to find it to buy it.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.640]   If it's that important,
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.960]   if I listen to it over and over and over again,
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.880]   I can pay the 99 cents for it.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.400]   It's the, what I love is the idea
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.680]   of being able to casually experiment.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.440]   And I think that what's even more interesting
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.120]   is the ability to build playlists
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.280]   where everyone doesn't have to pay
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.400]   to listen to your playlist.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.560]   So I think there's a viral ability
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.840]   that you can do with subscription,
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.040]   that you can't do with pain,
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.600]   and where I can put together 60 songs
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.360]   that I think are really cool,
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.760]   and right now everyone can listen to 'em,
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.720]   and then they can buy the ones that they think are,
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.320]   ones that they think are keepers or enjoy it for the moment,
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.160]   and so on and so forth.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.920]   And I think that that viral ability
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.800]   is something that is one of the most important parts
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.760]   of the subscription model,
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.640]   people are gonna be able to share what they think
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.120]   is great music, 'cause that's what we're missing right now,
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.040]   I think.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.000]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.920]   That's one of the many reasons why Apple
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:44.320]   just has to do something to give people
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.640]   how you can eat access.
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.800]   Every time I come, whether it's,
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:51.800]   whether it's a formal site, like a Zoom,
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.000]   whether it's just a simple website,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.720]   like a last FM or something,
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.680]   the ability to sit there and listen to music
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.560]   just based on a whim, not without having to dip
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.800]   into your wallet, that's incredibly powerful,
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.480]   and that's something that Apple desperately needs to get in.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:04.720]   - So we're agreed they need to do it,
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.480]   and it seems like a great way to do it
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.160]   would be to just build it into the price
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.600]   of the device, right?
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.240]   - I think it's a lot.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.200]   - I mean, it depends on the price.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.360]   I mean, for some reason, I seem to think
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:18.160]   that it's okay to spend nine bucks a month
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.560]   for access to Rhapsody.
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.360]   I'm not sure, but however, I might balk
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.120]   if I had the choice between buying a $199 iPod
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:27.640]   and a $299 iPod, and they look exactly the same.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.720]   If I were there in the store,
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.160]   I would probably say, well, geez,
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.000]   I can walk out of here with an iPod and a hundred bucks
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:33.920]   in my pocket.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:34.960]   - Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.960]   Will Apple have a premium version of the hardware,
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:41.160]   or will it become with something that just comes
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.080]   with all the hardware or?
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.920]   - I think the perfect thing for both the artist
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.600]   and I'm not saying that Apple's gonna do this,
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.400]   but I think the perfect thing for the artists
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.600]   and the labels in Apple would be really a monthly subscription.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.720]   They pay 10 bucks a month, and X amount of that
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.600]   goes back to the copyright holders,
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.200]   whoever those are, whether it's the label,
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.840]   or whether it's an individual artist, or whatever it is,
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.240]   you just look at, 'cause Apple's gonna know what percentage.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.040]   So if I took 50% of, if the Beatles come out
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:10.120]   and they took 50% of all the downloads that month,
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.600]   then they get half of the booty.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:16.200]   You know, there's a pool creator.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.720]   - That's an interesting way to do it.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.680]   - So what happens is that if--
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:22.000]   - That's what a peer-to-peer service ought to do.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.120]   - Yeah, I mean, 'cause the thing is,
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.360]   is that now what happens is,
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.320]   is that Apple can do it in a way because they can manage it.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.440]   They have codes for everything.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.920]   They can see what's being downloaded by everybody.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.480]   And so what happens is, is that if I,
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.800]   and what's more important is if I'm an individual artist,
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.000]   if I promote it on my webpage, for instance,
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.680]   and I get 2,000 people to download my song off of iTunes,
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:46.080]   I'm gonna get more money from that promotion.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.520]   I don't have to persuade them to buy the song.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.640]   I just have to persuade them to listen to it.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.000]   And so, or if I build a playlist, for instance,
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.360]   that 1,000 people subscribe to,
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:57.120]   suddenly everyone in that playlist benefits
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.480]   from the fact that I put all of that,
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:00.760]   that I put their song in there,
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.200]   because everyone is downloading it,
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.720]   and listening to it, and so on and so forth.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.080]   And so it creates a marketplace, so to speak,
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.600]   where people have a vested interest in doing it in iTunes.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.320]   The bands have a vested interest in doing it in iTunes,
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.360]   because they're gonna make money just by people playing it.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.200]   It's a great model for them, I think.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.000]   And a better model than just handing money over
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.880]   to the labels, which aren't gonna give them any money
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.680]   in the first place.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.360]   Well, here's another twist,
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.040]   just to make things even more complicated.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.920]   What's to stop Apple from doing the same thing
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.680]   with independent unsigned bands
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.280]   that they're doing right now with independent
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:35.680]   unsigned programmers who wanna develop iPhone apps?
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.640]   Let me, as a band, just apply to put songs
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.840]   into the iTunes store.
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.920]   Apple, you take a 30% split, I'll take 70% split,
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:44.920]   just let me put my stuff inside your store.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:47.000]   - Well, they do that already, it's called CD Baby.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:47.840]   - Really?
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:48.680]   - I mean, that's what CD Baby does.
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:50.240]   I mean, if you wanna get your--
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.160]   - Is that the simple song?
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.000]   - Yeah.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:52.840]   - If you wanna get your song into iTunes,
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.560]   you send your song over to CD Baby,
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.000]   now there's film Baby or whatever,
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.080]   you can do short films or long films or documentaries.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.760]   And CD Baby is a clearing house
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.040]   so that you can basically, you can get it into iTunes.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:07.680]   What Apple doesn't wanna do is send 20,000 checks
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.040]   for 10 bucks out, they let CD Baby worry about that.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.240]   So CD Baby is essentially your label.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.080]   - It's clearing house.
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.640]   - Into iTunes. - Yeah.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.800]   - So that's how that's been handled up until now.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.160]   It's easier to get into iTunes as an individual band,
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.200]   but there's a, I think that what's interesting
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.800]   about the subscription model is that there is a,
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:30.400]   there is a threshold that isn't required
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.080]   to just listen to the song and to be shared by the song.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.280]   And you're essentially, if individuals
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.080]   are making radio shows, for instance,
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.760]   like I would make a radio show immediately
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.240]   if there was a subscription model where I could,
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.000]   and Apple should make a tool that lets you do this
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.120]   where you could literally build a playlist
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.720]   and talk about different songs
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.960]   and create your own little radio show like a podcast,
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.720]   but it's actually playing the songs,
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.560]   you know, that are there.
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.280]   - That's an interesting slice on this
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.720]   that they'd have to license that with a record companies,
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:55.560]   but boy, that would be--
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.400]   - No, you wouldn't.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.040]   What you would do is you'd make your own tracks,
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:50:59.880]   you know, within that thing.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.280]   It wouldn't actually, you know,
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.280]   you would be making a show that people listen to.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.600]   - It's just a playlist.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.680]   It's just a playlist that you can,
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.040]   but you can annotate it with your own,
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:10.120]   you know, the key is letting people annotate with it.
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:13.280]   - It's like their mix capability only just doing it live.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.800]   - Yeah, or not even live.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.200]   I can build, you know--
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.360]   - Well, you could do that right now with the mixes.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.280]   - Yeah, but the problem is is that people have to buy
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.720]   all those mixes.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.320]   They buy every song.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.440]   - So if you have an all-your-can-eat plan--
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.120]   - I can make a two-hour show--
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.360]   - Suddenly this works.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.280]   - That I build, you know, I build up the show
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.000]   and it sounds like a radio show and it has all the stuff,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.360]   but what it's doing is just simply activating those songs.
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:35.200]   - Well, they already got it.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.960]   All you have to do is put a play button on that.
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.280]   Once you have this subscription model,
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.800]   put a play button on all those mixes.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.800]   - Exactly.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:42.880]   - You already-- - So they got it.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.840]   It's already there, everything but the subscription model.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:46.680]   - Exactly.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.480]   - I mean, there's nothing about this that would be very
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.560]   difficult to put together.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:54.040]   And the key is, is that I still think that if I be much more
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.400]   comfortable as a consumer wanting to support artists,
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.760]   if the money went to the copyright holder,
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.440]   and it doesn't matter whether it's a copyright holder,
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.960]   it's a label or an individual band or anything else,
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.680]   you know, I can, you know,
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.520]   Apple's gonna create a pot and redistribute that money
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:09.600]   to whoever is in that pot.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:13.320]   To me, I think as a consumer, that seems like a fair
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:15.120]   distribution depending on what the percentage is
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:18.680]   of what I'm paying, but let's say half or 40% of what I'm paying
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.960]   is going back to all the artists and Apple, you know,
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.480]   whatever, the overhead and profit and everything else
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.320]   take it.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.240]   But the point is, is that, that I think it creates
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.480]   the opportunity for bands to come out of nowhere and not,
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.080]   and once again, like Andy said, not make millions,
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:35.080]   but possibly make, you know, a living or be able to buy
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:38.760]   a new guitar or something without having to sign their
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.120]   souls away to the, to a label.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:41.960]   - So I--
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:42.800]   - Do you have a spiff?
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.400]   No it's Steve.
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:49.400]   Well, it's pronounced SPF, but it's XML format XSPF.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.400]   Oh!
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.300]   I've seen some talk about it.
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:53.300]   What is it?
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:54.940]   I first want to talk about this, and this is kind of interesting.
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:58.200]   It's an XML format for playlists basically.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:01.840]   And it sounds like there's a lot of things that you can potentially deal with this.
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.840]   I just think -- I don't know if you guys need more than I do, it's just something a friend
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:09.380]   of mine told me a bout -- but it's kind of interesting to think about a world in which
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:13.260]   we have a standardized way to share the kind of stuff that Alex is talking about.
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.800]   Or for that matter it could be an album.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.800]   So I don't know.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.440]   I just think it's -- I see very much what Alex is talking about, but I see that also being
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:25.440]   something where maybe when the labels are ready to do this, maybe what they put out is some
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.280]   kind of a controlled version of this.
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:34.160]   And again, really up in the clouds, what if someday all, again, all of your media lives
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:37.680]   in a cloud somewhere and you're just -- you basically turn the key and then have access
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:41.840]   to it from wherever you are via something like this XML?
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:43.220]   I want to table this discussion.
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:46.380]   I think we're going to have much more to say when we have Patrick Wilson on with us next
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:49.460]   week since he's an actual -- Is he that drummer?
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.460]   Is he the drummer from Weezer?
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:55.660]   Is he an actual drummer from an actual band that has an actual recording contract?
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:56.660]   So he'll join us next week.
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:58.700]   And I think we really should discuss this in greater detail.
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:53:59.900]   We have other stories.
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:06.060]   I think we cannot ignore the Charlie Rose taking a tumble to save his MacBook Air story.
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:07.260]   I mean, it's committed.
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:08.260]   That is commitment.
[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:13.720]   Charlie Rose doing the show with a bandaid over his left eyebrow and a shiner.
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:14.920]   Looks like he was in a bar fight.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:21.920]   Turns out he stepped in a pothole and instead of falling as any sensible person would on
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:27.240]   his MacBook Air, he sacrificed his face to protect the computer.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:31.240]   He held the MacBook Air up and hit the pavement with his face.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.640]   And he's in television.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.640]   This is a man who loves his air.
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.640]   Wow.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:38.640]   He did.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.340]   He just missed a great opportunity.
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:46.940]   He could have made enough to buy two more MacBook Airs because if he put that on eBay,
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:52.020]   a MacBook Air with a perfect imprinted cartoon like Matt Charlie Rose in the aluminum.
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:55.100]   Wouldn't that go up to $4,000 or $5,000?
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:57.180]   I'll tell you, I'm sad I'm sending my air back today.
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.280]   It's so sad to see it go.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:01.540]   But I still like my MacBook.
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.620]   And you would bounce off of that.
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:04.100]   You wouldn't think that would be the first one.
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.100]   My wife is getting an air.
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.100]   Is she?
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:09.800]   She's thinking about carrying the baby and carrying everything else.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:13.500]   She's been kind of like, you know, she kept on asking me, how heavy is the air and how
[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:14.500]   small is it?
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:15.500]   It makes perfect sense.
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:16.500]   Yeah.
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:19.140]   And you can pack it up with your New York Times and recycle it.
[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:20.140]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:21.540]   That's why I told her to be careful of that.
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.060]   I'm buying you a second.
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:24.900]   Steven Levy at Newsweek did that.
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:25.900]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:26.900]   We talked about that last week.
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:29.100]   So here's a really interesting story.
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:30.100]   And then we'll get to our picks.
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:34.300]   Adobe says it's going to make a flash player for the iPhone.
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:39.380]   Don Cara, which Steve says, they're just going to do it.
[00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:46.580]   Chief executive of Adobe, Shantanu Narayan said, we believe flash is synonymous with the Internet
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:48.940]   experience and we are committed.
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:50.180]   This is the CEO.
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:53.460]   We are committed to bringing flash to the phone.
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:57.340]   We have evaluated the software, develop tools and we think we can develop an iPhone flash
[00:55:57.340 --> 00:55:58.340]   player ourselves.
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:04.260]   Of course, Apple would have to say yes, wouldn't they?
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.580]   Yeah, it'd be hard to do without Apple.
[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:10.020]   Yeah, I mean, the software development kit looks like it specifically makes sure that
[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:13.140]   you can't do cool stuff like that without Apple's permission.
[00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:14.820]   You couldn't say you couldn't distribute it.
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:15.820]   You have to distribute it.
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.660]   Well, not even forget about distributing it.
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:21.820]   You couldn't even build an application like you couldn't do it.
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:22.820]   You can't even do it.
[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:26.220]   A little assessment enhancement of that low level and build it with the software development
[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:27.220]   kit that they've released.
[00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:36.260]   It's possible that they're going to do something that would legitimize the third part.
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:41.300]   We need a new term for the illegitimate, the bastard iPhone development community.
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:45.180]   It's possible they could do something to legitimize the folks who are still building apps without
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:48.900]   this SDK, without any signing from Apple.
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:52.860]   That's the place where you can actually now still go and download apps for your iPhone
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:56.660]   today because there's still a very, very thriving jailbreak community.
[00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:58.540]   If Adobe were to say, "You know what?
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:03.020]   If Apple doesn't let us do this legitimately, we're going to produce a version of it that
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:06.460]   will work with jailbreak phones and we're going to basically keep this entire--"
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:07.460]   That's an interesting idea.
[00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:09.860]   That's the second one to the population alive.
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.340]   I don't see Adobe doing that.
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:13.900]   Look, they, you know, piracy is a big issue for them.
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:18.540]   The last thing they want to do is get in bed with people who are violating ULA's.
[00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:20.300]   I can't see Adobe doing that.
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:24.700]   The fact that this guy has looked apparently or as engineers have looked at the SDK and
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:26.500]   they believe they can do it, you're right.
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.780]   They can't hook in as a service in a Safari.
[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:30.660]   That's just not possible with the SDK.
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:34.020]   But they could write a standalone player.
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:35.020]   Hmm.
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:37.780]   But what Safari passed along the URL and handled it correctly.
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:38.780]   No, they couldn't do that.
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:41.660]   They'd have to enter URL directly into the player, right?
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:42.660]   Yeah.
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:43.660]   And then can you do that?
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:44.660]   I don't know.
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:45.660]   But it sounds like Adobe thinks they can.
[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:49.700]   Now, remember that the jailbreak community is not sitting still.
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:51.620]   They've got a dual boot solution.
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:53.500]   Now, they've got all sorts of hacks.
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.540]   I think you're going to see all sorts of third party apps for them.
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:58:01.620]   I just don't see mainstream developers getting in bed with these guys just because they're
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:02.620]   ULA breakers.
[00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:04.740]   Well, it's interesting to see.
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.380]   It's good to see that Apple.
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:09.940]   I think one of the reasons why Apple is going to create such a rich experience for developers
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:11.940]   is because they know that they have this competition.
[00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:16.220]   That if developers scream for a certain feature or certain ability and Apple refuses to give
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:20.620]   it to them, there's still this, again, thriving community of outside developers that will
[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:21.620]   let them do this.
[00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:27.740]   Yesterday, I haven't updated the apps on my jail broke phone for a few weeks, downloaded
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:33.380]   a brand new camera app that gives me a self timer, that gives me variable exposure, downloaded
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:38.100]   a brand new RSS catcher that updates the podcast directly, a whole bunch of games, a
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:41.580]   whole bunch of accelerometer and gravitometer games.
[00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:45.620]   If Apple doesn't give me an experience that is as rich and fulfilling as what I get just
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:49.660]   through the handset, just to this really wonderful, palm top browse, that lets me just look for
[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:52.980]   apps and get them and start playing with them immediately.
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:55.380]   This is the rabbit they're going to be chasing for the next year.
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:59:02.020]   Although now you see why Apple slammed so hard on the jail breakers and the unlockers
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:06.260]   with that firmware that brick the phone, Apple wants to send a chilling effect.
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:10.260]   I think I'm much more reluctant to jail break my iPhone.
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:13.500]   Yeah, I mean, it has to be said that I do have two iPhones.
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:16.620]   One is plain vanilla, the other is jail break.
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:17.620]   I do have both.
[00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:20.660]   If I had to choose one or the other, I would definitely keep the plain vanilla one.
[00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:21.660]   Click the pristine.
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:22.660]   You bet.
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:23.660]   Same with me.
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:24.660]   Especially now with this SDK.
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:26.660]   I'm excited about the stuff we're going to see.
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:27.660]   So I don't know.
[00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:30.540]   I mean, I think the jail breakers will continue and I applaud their efforts.
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:34.820]   I think it's very important, but I think that most iPhone users now are going to be very
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:37.500]   reluctant to do jail breaking.
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:39.580]   And especially now that you're going to get third party apps.
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:42.300]   So if I don't get flash, so what?
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:43.300]   I just think it's interesting.
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:44.380]   They think they can do it.
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:45.940]   That's what's really interesting.
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:49.460]   Also, there's unfortunately there's a certain product I can't talk about because I had a
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:51.660]   really great demo of it yesterday under NDA.
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:53.660]   It's going to be released next week.
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:55.860]   It's a telescope, right?
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:56.860]   No, no.
[00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:57.860]   It's a huge telescope.
[00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:02.100]   It lets you see heavenly bodies almost as if they're there.
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:03.100]   What's it doing?
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:07.500]   No, because you know how like sometimes like you have to carry a phone and a flashlight
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:11.700]   for this application will turn the phone into a flashlight.
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:13.900]   There's one last thing you have to take with you.
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:14.900]   It's brilliant.
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.740]   Don't they have an iPhone app that's a cigarette lighter?
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.980]   So when you go to concerts, you can hold up your lighter.
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:21.700]   I think they do.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:24.980]   There's also an iPhone app that's essentially, "Hello, my name is Tag."
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.620]   You just type it in and you hold it up.
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:29.500]   There used to be a trio app that would turn it into a mirror.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:33.380]   It would basically throw up solid black and so you could look into your trio and use it
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.380]   as a mirror.
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:35.380]   Ooh.
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:36.380]   You can't do that on the iPhone.
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.260]   The camera's on the wrong side.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.260]   And blacker.
[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:40.260]   That's true.
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:41.260]   But the--
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:42.260]   Sorry Andy.
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.260]   Sorry Andy.
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:44.580]   I'm going to turn it to you.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:48.580]   All I was getting at is that there are a couple of really great apps coming out that
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:54.420]   rely on Flash that don't use just JavaScript, don't use just CSS tricks to give you a really
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:55.420]   slick user interface.
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:59.540]   They're using Flash 9 in order to give you that kind of an experience.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:03.540]   And obviously these are all designed to work on notebooks and desktops as opposed to palm
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:04.540]   tops.
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:10.260]   But if this is where a whole bunch of development starts to go, if these huge-- and I think I
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:15.100]   kind of messed up my metaphor by when I was on Twitter, I didn't want to tell people
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:17.060]   about-- I couldn't break my NDA.
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:21.140]   I was-- people were asking, I said, well, look, if you were to name five really big companies,
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:22.940]   I guarantee you'd guess the name of this company.
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.700]   And of course, no one guessed the name of the company.
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.620]   I guess I was wrong.
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:29.220]   But it is a name that you would all recognize and you would all--
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:30.220]   10.
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:33.420]   If you guessed 10, really big companies you'd get.
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.820]   So it's going to be Beardpapa, right?
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:38.180]   It's going to be a cream puff technology.
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:39.180]   That's the--
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:40.180]   That's a web app, finally.
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.180]   Oh.
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.700]   You know, where is the talking moves for the iPhone?
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.500]   It's a really good point.
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:46.500]   It's true.
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:50.740]   I'm running out of-- I'm sick of just annoying people with my iPhone just by talking loudly
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:51.740]   movie theaters on it.
[01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:53.180]   I want a new way to annoy people.
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:56.020]   I want tiny Elvis.
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.020]   Let's take a break.
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.780]   We're going to get to our picks in just a little bit.
[01:01:58.780 --> 01:01:59.780]   Sorry.
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:00.780]   Go ahead.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:05.700]   No, I was just going to say, if this becomes an important part of the web, a lack of flash
[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:09.940]   support could be more than just not being able to see YouTube movies in YouTube.
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:13.540]   It could become, gee, there's this great web application that works great on Creos, works
[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:15.460]   great on Nokia's, but does not work on the iPhone.
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:16.460]   And not just Flash.
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:21.340]   I think Air and Silverlight, you've got to have those on any credible, portable platform.
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:26.100]   Well, the question, though, is that Apple has ignored other people before.
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:29.740]   And I think that the real question is going to be, once again, who blinks?
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:33.660]   You get to a point where if the iPhone gets big enough, then you don't build mobile stuff
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:37.060]   with Flash because no one can use it on an iPhone.
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:41.980]   If the Flash mobile stuff gets big enough, then Apple has to blink and put it on the iPhone.
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:45.180]   And so I think it's just a matter of, I think we're still in kind of an arms race to figure
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:47.380]   out who's going to get to that point.
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:50.540]   And if Google phone really does take off, I've heard from the fact that it's a great
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:53.020]   OS and it's free and anybody can put it on their device.
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.420]   They say, come on aboard.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.420]   Go ahead.
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:56.420]   You sure all you want to do is Flash?
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:57.420]   Hey, do Flash 10?
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:58.420]   Do Flash 30?
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:02:59.420]   Uh-huh.
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:02.060]   Or you can do SVG on the iPhone.
[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:04.340]   Alright, let's take a break.
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:07.580]   We're going to come back with our picks of the week, our software picks.
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:09.980]   But before we do that, I want to get our audio book picks.
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:14.820]   It's time for our weekly visit to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:19.180]   Audible is of course my favorite spot to go get my audio books.
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:21.140]   I am hooked on them.
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:24.860]   And I have a recommendation if nobody else on the panel does.
[01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:29.140]   But let me just mention that it's A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:35.140]   And if you go to audible.com/macbreak, you can sign up and get a coupon for a free book,
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:36.140]   a credit toward a book.
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:37.580]   And there are lots of books.
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:40.060]   45,000 plus in the US library.
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:41.460]   Plays on hundreds of different devices.
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.380]   You download it, you get it instantly almost.
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:46.500]   I mean, just take a minute or two, depending on your download speed.
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:47.960]   Then you've got the book.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.260]   You can listen to it on the computer.
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.260]   You can burn it to CDs.
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:53.540]   You can put it on your iPod or your iPhone.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:54.540]   I just love audible.com.
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.500]   And I was listening to a great book.
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:59.100]   But before I talk about it, I want to give a...
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.700]   You guys, Andy, you got a book you want to recommend or Merlin or Alex?
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:03.700]   Any books?
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:06.140]   I just download new one.
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:07.140]   The Spartans.
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:08.140]   Sparta!
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:09.140]   Sparta!
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:10.140]   Sparta!
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.140]   Well, I got into it.
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:12.460]   I have to admit, I have a bad habit of...
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:17.020]   If I see anything that's remotely historical as a movie, I have a bad habit of checking up
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.060]   all the Wikipedia stuff and then reading all the stuff.
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:23.460]   And then this is kind of finishing off the zone that I got into.
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.140]   There's a lot of Spartan books on...
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:28.740]   I mean, I see here's a book on Thermopylae.
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:31.660]   Which is the battle that of course 300 is about.
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:32.660]   The Peloponnesian War.
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:33.660]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:34.660]   I mean, this is great.
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.020]   So you got the Spartans by Paul Cartlidge?
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.020]   I did.
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.020]   And so far it's good.
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:40.020]   I just started it.
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:42.260]   Literally, I got it last night and I just started listening to it on the way home.
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.100]   And it's very good.
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:45.100]   It's history.
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.580]   And it's just nice to be able to acquire that information without actually having to use
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:49.580]   my eyes, which I like.
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:56.540]   And it talks about Lysurgus, Lysander, King Leonidas, and Helen of Troy and Sparta.
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:57.540]   Yes.
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:58.900]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:00.900]   Was Helen of Troy also of Sparta?
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.900]   I don't think so.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:02.900]   Hold on.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:03.900]   That's what it says here.
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.820]   Well, that's a good recommendation.
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:10.260]   If you're a fan of the 300, you're going to want to know more about the Spartans.
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:11.260]   And this would be a good choice.
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:12.900]   Andy, you had one you wanted to recommend to.
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:13.900]   It sounded like.
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:15.420]   Yeah, I had one.
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:18.620]   This is Alan Bennett is a name that you don't really think.
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:19.620]   Oh, I love this.
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:20.620]   Go ahead.
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:21.620]   Yeah.
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:22.620]   Yeah.
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:23.620]   He was part of the original Beyond the Fringe group.
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:24.620]   Oh, was he?
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:25.620]   Okay.
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:26.620]   Yep.
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:27.460]   Absolutely.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:28.460]   I think he was in there.
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:29.460]   Uh-huh.
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:33.220]   Dudley Moore was in there and they became really, really well-known comedians and strong swimmers
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.700]   and TV performers.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:38.020]   Alan Bennett, he decided to have a career where he writes really brilliant plays and
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:40.820]   becomes a really good radio monologous.
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:44.700]   But I'll British and I'm choosing them probably the most British thing in the Alan Bennett
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:45.700]   archive.
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:49.380]   It is an autobiographical story called Lady in the Van.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:51.140]   Oh, I haven't read that.
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:52.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:06:00.340]   He owns this really nice house in a very nice part, a part of at least Northern London.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:04.300]   And with a kind of like an abandoned van on the property that I needed to move.
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:07.860]   And then one day this little old lady just comes in and decides she's going to live in
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:08.860]   the van.
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:12.860]   And in America, we know that, okay, well, quickly get the kids out.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:15.700]   Let's move out of the house and let's get the police in and let's get the fire hoses
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.420]   in there and drive her out of the van.
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:18.420]   But again, he's English.
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:19.420]   So, oh, all right.
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:20.420]   Yeah, I see.
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:23.020]   There's a lady in the van.
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.820]   And so this is the story.
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:26.500]   It sounds like he's making it up.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:32.180]   But this charmingly eccentric borderline, she did have she obviously did have mental
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:33.180]   problems.
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:36.100]   But just this relationship with this woman who just lived in the van on his lived in
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:37.780]   a van on his property.
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:38.940]   You know, they had interactions.
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:39.940]   She was very proud.
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:40.940]   This is a true story.
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:42.380]   This is a true story.
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:45.180]   And she lived in that van until she died.
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:50.660]   And you know, it's funny, it's touching, it shows you how relationships work.
[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:55.020]   Most of all, you like it because Alan Bennett just knows how to tell this story without
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:58.820]   making either the woman or himself look like idiots.
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:04.100]   But you're just sitting there, your jaw is like half a dog thinking, but Alan, surely
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:09.060]   this is the point at which you didn't drive her to the doctor and then take her then drive
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:11.300]   her back from the doctors to the van.
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:14.700]   Surely you had her committed after you took her to the taking her to the doctor.
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:17.860]   That was a good idea because she was clearly injured, but you didn't have to take her
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:18.860]   back at this point.
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:22.260]   At this point, you need to like, you know, this is like my wife.
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:24.020]   My wife would have done this.
[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:26.460]   She would absolutely do this.
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:29.140]   That's so very charming story told very well.
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:34.140]   It's also read by Alan Bennett, who is, you don't want like tuck her Anthony reading.
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:38.700]   Oh, no, no, you need so with passion and, you know, and wit to actually tell it.
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:41.940]   These are, I think the other stuff I've read from our listen to from Alan Bennett is from
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:44.260]   his BBC readings.
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:48.900]   I don't know if this is also I just read from him an uncommon reader, which is a wonderful
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:53.700]   knob, our short story, maybe novella about the Queen of England discovering the world
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.780]   of books at 80.
[01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:58.340]   And it's just he is so great.
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.340]   It's kind of a coincidence.
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:00.340]   I'd never heard of him.
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:01.580]   My mom suggested it.
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:03.540]   And now I'm hearing it from you too, Andy.
[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:07.780]   So two great recommend that we got two today, the lady in the van by Alan Bennett and the
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:08.780]   Spartans.
[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:12.060]   They're kind of different by Paul Cartlidge.
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:13.260]   You pick which one you want.
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:15.060]   I'll be firing diff parts portions of your brain.
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.700]   So you want to alternate chapter.
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:20.580]   Definitely get the to really ramp up the confusion.
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:21.660]   That's the beauty though of Audible.
[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.180]   I mean, when you have 45,000 titles, it's a library.
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:28.020]   It's really a library on your computer that you can download a book anytime you want.
[01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:29.460]   I just love it.
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.420]   Audible.com/Macbrake.
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:35.500]   We thank him so much for their support and just go out and listen to a book.
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.860]   You're going to love it.
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:38.740]   Now it's time for our picks.
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:39.740]   That's a great pick, by the way.
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.540]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:44.300]   Our picks of the week.
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.100]   And who would like to raise show of hands?
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:49.460]   Who's got the most, the best one?
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.420]   I am Mr. Gotta go ahead.
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.420]   You may start.
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.420]   So, so what else?
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:55.420]   What?
[01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:56.420]   Ooh, ooh.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.420]   That was me.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:58.420]   Yeah.
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:08:59.420]   Okay.
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:00.420]   Good.
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:01.420]   Okay.
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:02.420]   Good.
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:03.420]   Okay.
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:04.420]   Good.
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:07.060]   I was gonna say because I'm enthusiastic about my pick.
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.060]   I'm not Arnold Shorschach over it.
[01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.060]   I'm horschach over this one.
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:10.060]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:11.060]   You should go first.
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:12.380]   Back even farther.
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:16.700]   Back to the days when I was using Microsoft Windows and tablet PC.
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:20.220]   Now, tablet PC is something Microsoft's been pushing for a long time.
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:24.780]   The idea that you have a screen that you can draw and you can write on, you can, you
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:26.620]   know, it has text recognition.
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:31.140]   And Microsoft added an application to its office suite to go with tablet PC called One
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:34.500]   Note, which is really kind of an interesting notebook application.
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.500]   It had a text recognition.
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:42.540]   So you could, you know, handwrite stuff and it would then be able to search it or you
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:44.220]   could even turn it into pure text.
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:45.820]   You know, and it did about the same as a Newton.
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:48.140]   I mean, look at handwrite recognition as a way to go.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.140]   But it worked.
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:50.300]   It was a way to keep all your stuff.
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:51.300]   I like notebooks.
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:52.620]   I've used notebooks on the Mac for a while.
[01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:53.980]   I thought this was pretty cool.
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:56.860]   Then I found a program, free program called Evernote.
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.260]   And this was Windows only.
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:59.460]   This is a couple of years ago.
[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:00.460]   Evernote was just incredible.
[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:02.580]   The idea was like it was a grocery list tape.
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:04.740]   It was just the notes kept on going.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:09.300]   You could put any kind of format document in their text graphics.
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:10.780]   It did handwriting recognition.
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:13.260]   And it's always bugged me that it's not available for the Mac.
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:17.220]   Well, the folks at Evernote have really taken a step into the 21st century.
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:19.140]   They've turned it into a web service.
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:25.700]   And it is now available on Mac, Windows, iPhone, and Windows Mobile.
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:28.500]   It's kind of like Skitch in the sense that it's in beta right now.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:31.620]   And I should say the beta is closed, but it's about to open any day now.
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:35.580]   That's why I'm finally bringing this up, because I just think this is the greatest.
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:37.540]   Go to Evernote.com.
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:42.700]   You could sign up for the beta, and soon they'll be inviting people to join in.
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:44.020]   Right now it's free.
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:45.660]   It will take text.
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:47.700]   It will take graphics.
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:51.260]   It will-- it does an interesting thing with the graphics.
[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:55.300]   It does text recognition on the graphics on the website.
[01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:57.940]   So you have a desktop application.
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:59.140]   And you enter in the notes.
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:01.940]   It has a clipping application, so you can clip from a web page.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:03.580]   You can save the whole web page.
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:08.540]   I sent them a couple of notes that, for instance, I love the print to PDF features of, say,
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:11.300]   your Jimbo to also work with Evernote.
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.340]   So you just print a PDF right to Evernote.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:15.060]   I'm sure they'll add that eventually.
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:20.780]   But then what happens is it syncs not to Mac.Mac, but to Evernote servers.
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:23.580]   And they do the text recognition at that end.
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:26.980]   So now all of a sudden, you can search for text in your graphics.
[01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:29.060]   And it's very, very good.
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:33.740]   You can-- it doesn't have the sketch capabilities to modify the graphics.
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:35.260]   It's just really a notebook tool.
[01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:37.620]   You can see the same notebook on the web.
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:40.180]   It has a web interface on your Windows machine.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:41.820]   It even has an iMac interface.
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:46.060]   So you could set up the iMac on your iPhone, have a separate Evernote mailbox.
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.620]   And all of your notes look like email messages.
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:52.420]   All of the text is in there, automatically synced from one to the other.
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:55.620]   So this is a totally cross-platform solution.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:56.860]   It's free right now.
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:00.340]   I think that the plan is to do a free version and a premium service
[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:03.620]   that would give you more storage and so forth.
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.780]   This is exactly the notebook program I've been looking for, finally.
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:10.140]   I mean, it is cross-platform works on the iPhone beautifully.
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:11.860]   It is free right now.
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:12.740]   The beta isn't open.
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:17.140]   I just sent all of you guys invitations, though, so that you-- because I have a few invitations left.
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:21.980]   Don't send me any meals because I just sent out my last ones to the team here.
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:23.340]   It just does a great job.
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:27.340]   Syncs very quickly, much more quickly than the .max sync.
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:28.340]   This isn't a great program.
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:30.700]   I think Merlin, you're going to want to take a look at it especially.
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:32.340]   How do you get graphics in?
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:33.340]   Do you just drag them?
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:34.340]   Yeah.
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:39.780]   For instance, if you copy a web page and use the clip feature, the Evernote clip screenshot
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:43.020]   into Evernote, it'll do a screenshot or paste Evernote.
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:44.940]   It'll paste the graphics in.
[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:45.940]   So you've seen it?
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:46.940]   Are you just looking at it right now?
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:52.660]   No, I just followed your-- I was paying attention to everything you guys said as I got set up
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:53.660]   with the beta.
[01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:54.660]   Good.
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:58.500]   The whole thing you guys, the conversation you had of a thing is awesome.
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:12:59.500]   Wonderful.
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.500]   The thing was great.
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.140]   You can put it on a USB drive.
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:04.140]   It's portable.
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:05.140]   Wow.
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.140]   Wow.
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:10.220]   So the idea, it's Google Desktop Search compatible for Windows users.
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:11.540]   I sent them a couple of notes.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:15.780]   One is I want to be able to encrypt individual notes because I like to store my passwords
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.820]   and serial numbers and these kinds of things.
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:20.300]   So I'd like to encrypt them so that they're invisible everywhere.
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:24.820]   I want that print capability so you can send a PDF right into Evernote.
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:27.260]   I think that's pretty easy to do on the Mac side.
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:30.660]   Probably the reason it's not there is because it's not a non-trivial on the Windows side
[01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:33.220]   and they probably want to keep the two versions together.
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:35.380]   The Mac version just came out I think a week or two weeks ago.
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:36.900]   It's pretty new.
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:37.900]   And yet quite polished.
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:40.620]   I think they've done a very nice job with the Mac version.
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:42.780]   You can email notes to yourself.
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:45.980]   When you sign up for the beta, you'll get a private email address.
[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:49.940]   So if you take a note, finally, if you take a note on the iPhone, you can mail it to your
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:54.420]   Evernote and it will then sync up with your iPhone and all your other devices including
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:55.980]   your Mac.
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:59.380]   So I've just started to tap the, you know, scratch the surface of this.
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:02.340]   This is a very powerful application.
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:05.300]   And I think a really good example of where web services are going.
[01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:07.820]   This is the way it should be.
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:10.940]   It's just called Evernote free right now from Evernote.com.
[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:12.460]   The beta is closed as I speak.
[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:16.620]   We'll open any minute now, but you can sign up right now and I'm sure you'll get an invitation
[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:17.620]   within the week.
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:20.220]   And that's my pick and it's zero.
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:23.740]   Alex is now Andy, not.
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:26.980]   Oh, you may go.
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:31.540]   This is now I'm safe in saying that many of you listening and many of the people here
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:33.820]   in this group are nerds.
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:36.860]   Geeks, boffins, whoever you wish to, however, wish to localize.
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:39.340]   I prefer to be called an enthusiast.
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:43.740]   What if I call you a sperm.
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.420]   Of course you would not be able to spell it because you do your.
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:48.420]   I was about to get off the phone.
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:49.420]   I was about to get off the phone.
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:50.420]   The flight and the silence.
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:51.420]   Merlin, I'm sorry.
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:55.340]   I was going to say something hurtful and you're the last person in this group that I would
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:56.340]   want to hurt.
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:57.340]   Merlin, you're a lot.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:58.340]   Clearly you're not a geek.
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:00.380]   Let's take that back.
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:01.900]   But what exactly is a boffin?
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.460]   That's what I want to know.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:04.460]   Anorac.
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:06.300]   You've been listening to too much Alan Bennett.
[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:07.300]   Yes.
[01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:08.300]   Here you go.
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:09.300]   Okay.
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:10.220]   I'm going to cut right to it.
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:15.980]   Here is a my pick is the Arduino, which is a I'll read it from the website.
[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:18.100]   It's an open source electronics prototype.
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:19.260]   You have to use the voice for this.
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:23.380]   Arduino is an open source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible easy to use hardware
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:24.700]   and software.
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:28.200]   What it is though, it's a little tiny little computer about the size of half of a three
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:35.020]   by five card that you can program very, very easily using a desktop application on your
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:41.340]   Mac that can control things like motors, lights, relays, things like that.
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:46.140]   And physical pieces of hardware like buttons, sensors and switches.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:49.900]   What you can do is you can very, very easily use it to write pieces of software that will
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:55.580]   work on this little device and then basically upload it to the device and basically build
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:16:00.020]   really cool electronics about having to learn a whole lot of hardware engineering.
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:02.420]   Let's say that you're thinking, you know what we really cool?
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:06.780]   I don't like to have a little $5 doorbell on my front door.
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:10.980]   What I want is I want them to press the door, press the doorbell and then like an animatronic
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:15.140]   Darth Vader doll mounted above the door starts lighting up and swinging its lightsaber.
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:19.980]   Meanwhile upstairs, upstairs the, my desk side lamp starts flicking on and off.
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:21.660]   Let me know the someone at the door.
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:26.420]   That would be somewhat complicated if you wanted to design those circuits yourselves.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:30.940]   If you wanted to do it with this little tiny little computer, you could basically write
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:34.300]   the piece, write the software to do that in about 12 or 13 lines.
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:35.300]   It is C plus plus.
[01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:38.100]   It is a objective C, object oriented C.
[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:42.900]   But if you get a sample application, it's very, very sample code of which there's plenty.
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:46.420]   It's very, very easy to see how to basically, well, how do I tell whether a button has
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:47.420]   been pushed?
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:48.900]   Well, here's the code for telling how a button's been pushed.
[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:51.180]   Well, how do I activate something through this board?
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:52.180]   I've wired into this.
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:55.620]   Well, that's how here's how you activate something that's been plugged into this board.
[01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:57.060]   What it is, and it's cheap.
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:58.060]   It's affordable.
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:03.700]   If you go to the maker store at make scene.com, you can buy one of these completely built,
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.180]   completely assembled for $34.99.
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:08.180]   You just plug the $34.99.
[01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:09.900]   $34.99.
[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:10.900]   That's great.
[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:16.740]   You plug it into your Mac, you download free software and free sample projects, and you
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:20.620]   go down to Radio Shack with $5 in your pocket, walk out with a couple of push buttons, a
[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:22.740]   couple of LEDs, a couple of DC motors.
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:25.980]   By the end of the day, you'll realize that it's the start of the morning because you've
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:29.140]   been up all night saying, "Well, okay, how about if I push the button and it makes the
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:33.500]   light go on and then the motor lifts the winch that raises a flag?"
[01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.660]   Wow, it works.
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:39.460]   The first time, some of us have fun with AppleScript and some of us have fun writing little
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:42.500]   bits of software and some of us even write web apps.
[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:47.820]   But very, very rarely do we get to make that leap from software that only lives inside
[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:52.700]   a computer to building an actual real physical thing that does cool stuff.
[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:57.420]   Usually it's because when I was learning electronics, I learned via the explosion in
[01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:02.400]   Braille method where you wire up a circuit and then when you hear a pop and you see that
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:07.100]   blue smoke erupting from the IC, you make a note saying, "Okay, I guess you don't put
[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:08.440]   12 volts on that pin.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.280]   That causes it to blow up."
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:15.180]   This is an easy way and a cheap way to start building real-world electronics that do really,
[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:16.420]   really cool things.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:20.260]   If you have this, and this is one of those things where if you have it in your desk drawer,
[01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:25.580]   anytime that you have a simple thing that needs to be built or just some free time and
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:28.980]   you need to do something cool with that free time, you'll be playing with it and playing
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:32.960]   with it and playing with it and doing increasingly heroically stupid and wonderful things with
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:33.960]   this hardware.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:39.200]   It's funny, there's a consumer gadget that you plug in, you add components to and it's
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:40.200]   pluggable.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.200]   This is the real deal.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.200]   This is breadboarding.
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.800]   This is where you can really do some stuff with it.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:44.800]   This is neat.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:45.800]   It's a lot cheaper.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:46.800]   Exactly.
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:47.800]   ARduino.cc.
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:56.120]   If you want to look at the human-friendly version of it, you can go to magazine.com.
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:01.500]   It's a lot of places to sell it.
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.220]   They have it at the maker store then.
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:04.820]   You'll see lots of support for it.
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:08.340]   Actually, next door to a whole bunch of books that show you how to do different projects
[01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:09.340]   with it.
[01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:13.900]   It is one of these really popular open-source sort of things.
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:17.940]   It's not Lego Mindstorms where you have to buy everything through the Lego Corporation.
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:21.100]   Hey, wow, someone built a robot, but it's based on the Arduino board.
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:22.100]   Cool.
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.100]   I have one of those.
[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:25.660]   Let's see how I control servos and motors with the Arduino board.
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:28.560]   Is there a chip on it as processor?
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:34.640]   It's a programmable microcontroller chip, but the cool thing is essentially it's a single
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:37.220]   chip computer all in one IC package.
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:41.960]   The cool thing though is that they've wired it up with all of the support hardware you
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:48.380]   need to turn it into something as simple as here's the USB port.
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:51.120]   Here's how you send software to it.
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:54.640]   Oh, you're a different pin so that here's where you hook up an LED to.
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:55.640]   Here's where you hook up a push.
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:59.160]   So you could be a software hacker and play with this as much as a hardware hacker?
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.160]   Exactly.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:03.600]   And if you are a hardware hacker, if you ever had a problem where you need to build up
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:07.480]   a custom ROM or you need to essentially build a really complicated custom circuit, you can
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:11.920]   essentially take whatever partner schematic that says, and now here's where you put the
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.960]   data lines for this really complicated circuit.
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:17.800]   Here's where you put the signal line for the power for this really complicated circuit.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:23.160]   You can just essentially build whatever circuit you want in software inside this device and
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.760]   just wire it into whatever big complicated board you already have.
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:32.200]   I mean, I remember a few, a number of years ago, my girlfriend was like really addicted
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:36.640]   to coffee where the way to really get to her heart was through the demon cocoa caffeine
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:37.840]   bean coffee bean.
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:41.360]   I'm not into coffee myself, so I don't know about that sort of thing.
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.240]   Not cocoa, that's rule number one.
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.240]   Exactly.
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:47.720]   That's why she dumped me because I said cocoa when I met when I met.
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:52.160]   But I built this thing so that through X10 controllers so that essentially whenever she
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:56.400]   hit the snooze button on her alarm clock, it would, I built some custom circuits that
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:03.520]   would essentially use that to send the snooze circuit of her alarm clock would send a signal
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:07.520]   to an X10 box brought into her coffee maker that would have a turn on, then there'd be
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:11.760]   more, another circuit that I added to the coffee maker that could tell when the ready
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:15.600]   light had come on and that would signal back to the alarm clock that, okay, now wake her
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.400]   up because now the coffee is ready.
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.360]   And you don't think that's why she left you.
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:21.760]   It was more of the cocoa of comment.
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:22.760]   She feared convenience.
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:23.760]   Exactly.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:24.760]   That was her tester shoes.
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.760]   I wouldn't have put up with that.
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.760]   Then she was definitely someone.
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:29.880]   What the buns have worked out.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:30.880]   It's really fun.
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:36.720]   Well, see, I forgot that she doesn't need a mechanical device to wake her up when coffee
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.880]   is ready to just psychically knows it.
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:43.600]   But the point is that this was like, it was like really complicated project, but it
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:47.080]   took me like a few days of like figuring out what circuits and what parts I needed,
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.280]   getting power, MOSFES together, all sort of stuff.
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:53.400]   Rest with this, as soon as I saw the specs for this board and I saw some sample code,
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:58.680]   I realized that, wow, that would be this board for $34.99 plus 12 lines of code to basically
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:02.040]   get all these bar up, these sensors that would automatically there.
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:04.040]   Oh, this is so much fun.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.160]   I wish I had time to do stuff like this.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:09.720]   It's like Legos for people who are not fearful of motives and electrocution.
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:11.320]   And there's a full language that goes with it.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:13.560]   So you, I mean, you really can control it by software.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:15.040]   Oh, this is neat.
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.040]   Exactly.
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:19.640]   I would go out and buy it all, but I know I'd never use it.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:21.320]   I'm going to buy one for my son's birthday.
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:24.480]   Yeah, I think for kids, what a great way to get him into digital technology.
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:25.480]   This is really neat.
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:29.320]   We're just going to give our daughter an outlet in a fork.
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.480]   Let her learn by doing.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.680]   Leo, we believe in the old fashioned way.
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:34.680]   That's right.
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:35.680]   Damn, Tooten.
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:37.280]   Merlin, man, what do you got for us?
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:40.640]   I'm on mine's kind of lame because it's one I have mentioned before, but it's something
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.880]   that I find myself using so much that I want to underscore it.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:49.240]   I mentioned earlier that like a lot of people, I rely on a whole kind of raft of different
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.040]   plugins for Safari.
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:54.280]   You know, Safari is never going to be Firefox, probably.
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.280]   No.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.280]   You're never going to have that level of flexibility.
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:59.240]   And I have to say there is some stuff that I use Firefox for.
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.880]   But for my day-to-day stuff, I really love using Safari.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:03.360]   Let me just get this Earl right.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:09.080]   If you want to find out ways to pimp your Safari, you should go to pimpmysofari.com,
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:13.400]   which is my pal John's site with lots of really great information about doing cool stuff.
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:21.080]   And one of the holy trinity of Safari plugins, which would include Saff and Pith Helmet, is
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.080]   Safari Stand.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:27.280]   And Safari Stand does something that I want to just concentrate on today because I use
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:32.280]   it so much that I have to imagine other people could benefit from this, which is, once you
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:36.200]   have installed Safari Stand and got it running, you know the little flutter, which is called
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:39.960]   a throbber, you know the thing in the upper right-hand corner of your browser, you used
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:44.880]   it called a throbber on IE because you're kind of knowingly swirl this animation.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:52.280]   You get added functionality commands under that throbber once you've installed Safari
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:57.320]   Stand, my favorite of which is- I'm just going to clip that little quote right out there.
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:59.520]   What did I say?
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:03.880]   You get functionality with the stand under the throbber button.
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:04.880]   I don't know.
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:09.520]   If you can stimulate the throbber in such a way that the pop-up-
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:11.920]   What on the Tony Bennett record?
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:15.160]   Now you want to put on some Johnny Mathers and click the throbber because-
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.760]   Whatever your throbber stands up.
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.200]   I want to push your button.
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:22.200]   I like it.
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:25.680]   Anyway, when you do that, all this is all this stuff under there.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:26.680]   He's not dignified.
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:27.680]   He's trying to make this.
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:28.680]   What do you need?
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:29.680]   He just left.
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:30.680]   I saw the team.
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:32.600]   He's like pulling out the driveway on this show about an hour ago.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:35.320]   I am your saft.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.080]   Let's sub-ease the edit together.
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:40.280]   He built the brake lights, driving away.
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:45.560]   And so when you do that, you'll find you have full read and write access to my offer.
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:49.120]   He can't keep the clip and feel underneath the throbber.
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:53.560]   Anyway, all excess moisture should be wiped away.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:56.920]   What you find is several really neat little functional things.
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:59.520]   You're on a page somewhere and you click the throbber.
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:04.080]   You've got four links that, four rather buttons that now appear under here.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:08.640]   Copy title, copy title and Earl, copy link, HTML tag, copy link as Markdown.
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.800]   Why is this awesome?
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:15.200]   You're on a page somewhere and how many times a day do you want to grab the HTML code for
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:16.200]   a page?
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.200]   Well, this makes it really easy for me.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.200]   I live in Markdown.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:23.720]   Everything I do in life happens in Markdown, which is kind of a John Gruber's simple, deceptively
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:25.440]   simple subset of HTML.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:27.480]   Anyhow, so I can go on any pages that I'm on.
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:32.080]   I can go and just grab, hit the throbber, grab copy link as Markdown and that goes right
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.080]   into my buffer.
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.600]   I can go to any text file, whatever, drop that in.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:36.600]   Super useful.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:37.600]   I use that all the time.
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:41.720]   Second, the other thing related to this, if you have Safari stand installed, anytime
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:46.400]   you're on a page and you see a link somewhere, you can right click on it and you get the
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:54.160]   option copy link HTML tag, which means, so being on a page, you can grab the HTML for
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:26:00.160]   a link or you can just click on the Ahref right on the web page and copy that right into
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:02.680]   your clipboard as well.
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:05.280]   Again, these are things that probably make a lot more sense when you're doing them.
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:08.800]   But if you're like me and you're constantly posting stuff, putting stuff on Tumblr and
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:12.840]   whatnot, this is such a fast way to grab a whole bunch of links.
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:16.720]   If you're using something like Quicksilver, you can just go copy, copy, copy, copy, copy
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:17.720]   a million times.
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:22.200]   Those all go into your Quicksilver and then you just go paste, paste, paste, paste to
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:23.200]   drop them all in.
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:25.200]   You can click on 3, 3.1.
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:28.560]   Well, you know, Leo, I am that guy now where I'm waiting.
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:34.720]   So I believe I saw a Mac update email this morning that said there's a new Safari stand.
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:37.240]   But you know, really, this is all in the service.
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:39.960]   It's probably in service of saying that because I think if you're a web nerd, that's really
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:40.960]   useful.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:44.520]   But if you're going to be on Safari and you're like me, you're adamant about not switching
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:49.880]   over completely to Firefox, grab a copy of Safari stand, grab a copy of Saffd and grab
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.080]   a copy of Pith Helmet.
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:54.600]   Because the functionality that those three things give you is pretty terrific.
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.760]   There's other good stuff out there, but that's my favorite.
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:02.680]   I actually use a Firefox plugin called Colt, C-O-L-T that does exactly that.
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:05.760]   And I desperately need it and love it.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.120]   And it doesn't work on Firefox 3.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.120]   And I'm in the same boat.
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:09.120]   That's funny.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.120]   Yeah, the same boat.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.120]   This is the thing.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.560]   And like really, I think, you know, once you get past the Dushy Top 10 list, the reason
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:17.840]   life hacky stuff works is because you learn where there are tiny little bits of sand in
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:18.840]   your gears.
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:20.800]   And if you can clear that out and you're going to really speed things up.
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:22.040]   This is a terrific example of that.
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:25.320]   If you're writing HTML, first of all, if you're not writing your HTML and mark down,
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:29.160]   you're probably wasting a lot of your time or textiles, another great one.
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:32.080]   Just this is just a super fast way to streamline your process.
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:36.320]   And again, it's almost like this unit-ish approach to being productive where you are
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:40.760]   kind of slightly improving your productivity on all these little different tasks.
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.840]   And in the aggregate, that ends up saving you a lot of time.
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.080]   Little tools that do one thing well.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:50.760]   I'm going to say I'm going to try the domain name, Hautima, H-E-T-I-M-A.com/Safari.
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:53.040]   It's mostly in Japanese, but there's an English version.
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:56.240]   As ever, you're better off probably just to Google the one word Safari.
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.240]   Or go to pimpmysafari.com.
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.320]   Pimpmysafari is a terrific site.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.120]   It's there with everything else.
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:03.960]   It's actually at the top of the page, I believe.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.480]   There's the essentials if you only install three make-a-tees.
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:08.480]   Very cool.
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:11.640]   That's funny because that's one reason I still use Firefox over Safari.
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:16.600]   I'd like to use Safari, but I don't have that capability to right-click and get HTML
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:17.600]   for a link.
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.880]   I've got a Firefox pick if you want one.
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:20.880]   Go ahead.
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:21.880]   Do you mind?
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:22.880]   No.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.880]   Gmail manager.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:24.880]   You guys use that?
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.120]   No, I don't know that.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:31.120]   If you are somebody who, let's say hypothetically, you're monitoring several Gmail accounts for
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.120]   different people.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:35.840]   Hypothetically, you would never give yourself extra Gmail accounts because that's not kosher.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:36.840]   No.
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:41.080]   Hypothetically, if you've got five or six Gmail accounts, this lets you go, enter all of your
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:45.920]   information, your password and whatnot, and very quickly jump to a login to Gmail for
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.440]   any of those accounts.
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:52.040]   The second it gives you down in the status bar, it shows you for your preferred account,
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:56.920]   how many accounts and the account for all the labels and whatnot as well with the summary
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:59.800]   of all of the inbox in general.
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:00.800]   Okay.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:02.600]   Gmail manager, and I love it.
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.600]   Okay.
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:05.480]   Two for one, both zero Alex's.
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:09.120]   And now the king of the Alex, Mr. Alex Lindsey, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:13.840]   Well I actually have something to use all the free time that you've created.
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:16.080]   That's why you're after Merlin.
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:17.960]   Merlin creates free time, you spend it.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:18.960]   I spend it.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.120]   And this is zero Alex.
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:21.960]   I'm actually repeating a little bit.
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:25.800]   We've made some developments towards this whole marathon process that we did.
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.480]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:28.640]   Marathon infinity.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:33.280]   And now we talked about marathon in general last week, but this week we really wanted
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.760]   to get everyone to go download it.
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:36.760]   So yes.
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:38.160]   Oh gosh, yes, I completely forgot.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:40.680]   So here's the deal on next Monday.
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:42.440]   Not this Monday, but the following Monday for me.
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:43.440]   No, no, this is this coming Monday.
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.440]   Yeah, this is coming Monday.
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:45.440]   Okay.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:46.440]   So we're going to go to the front of whenever you get this, right?
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:48.080]   Because we're going to put this out before Monday.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.320]   We put it out today.
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:52.400]   So Monday the 24th, March 24th.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:56.320]   The 24th, we're going to at one o'clock, we're going to have, we're going to start
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.920]   the first marathon Monday.
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:02.800]   And so for one hour, we're just going to, you know, kill each other for fun.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:06.840]   You know, and so, so the idea, and here's the thing, is marathon is free.
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:08.800]   It's Mac PC Linux.
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:11.720]   It is, it's been open sourced.
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:14.480]   And it's a little hard to get your head around when you first start to just getting
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:16.000]   installed because it's open source.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.760]   And so the next Mac break that comes out, Mac break video, which should come out today,
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:24.960]   is going to be my own and little instruction how to get it installed, like where to go
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:29.400]   download stuff, how to get started, how to get, how to use screen flow to make that?
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:30.400]   Yes, I did.
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:31.400]   Which I like.
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.400]   It's great, isn't it?
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.400]   Yeah, I really like it.
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:37.240]   It has some trouble figuring out what the front window is at times, but like with Firefox
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:38.240]   or something like that.
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:42.040]   But in general, screen flow is the one that I kind of have started using a lot.
[01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:45.240]   So you're going to do a screencast on setting up marathon infinity.
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.800]   Yeah, just how to get started, how to join where to, you know, some of the stuff that
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:49.800]   you need to do.
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:53.200]   And hopefully people will go up there and, you know, download it.
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:54.560]   You just go to bungee.
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:58.320]   The bottom line is what you have to do is go to source.bungee.org and download the
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:01.560]   infinity and download the ALIF and drop the ALIF into the infinity.
[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:05.400]   And then when you run ALIF, it'll open up marathon and then you'll be ready to rock
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:06.400]   and roll.
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.160]   Hey, Andy, can you do an X10 extension for this?
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:09.840]   I think that's what we need.
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:14.080]   Now, Shosh actually built a DMG that will just install it.
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:15.080]   He did.
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:17.080]   So, so, well, that guy's great.
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:18.640]   He takes our show notes, by the way.
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:19.640]   That's fantastic.
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:20.640]   Yeah.
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:21.640]   So he just threw the whole thing in.
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:22.640]   So all you got to do is drag it.
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.120]   It's just a folder with the two of them on it.
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:25.760]   Where do we get that?
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:34.000]   That's at that is at dropbox.pixelcore.com/alex/marathon.zip.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.360]   So it's just a zip file.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:39.040]   You can click, you know, we're going to put it in the show notes and I also show it in
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.040]   the thing.
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.360]   So, so Shosh put this thing together.
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:45.040]   That's really all you need on the Mac is just to download that, drag one folder into
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:48.960]   the other one and then you'll have what you need.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:51.520]   Follow the instructions, play with it between now and Monday.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:54.480]   And then if it goes successfully, we'll just keep on playing.
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:56.680]   How big is that DMG, Alex?
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:58.480]   It's like 45 megs.
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:03.880]   Why don't you also, because it's a little easier, send it to my dropio account.
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.880]   So dropio, drop.io/twit.
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.880]   Yeah, I'm going to have you email that.
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:14.800]   Yeah, and that way it'll be very easy for people to, let's see, oh, well, that's not
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:15.800]   going to work either.
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:18.960]   Because that's not, I don't know if you could download stuff from that.
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:19.960]   It's easy to upload stuff.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:20.960]   I have to set it up to download.
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:23.000]   Let me see if I can figure out how to do that.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000]   Okay.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000]   Well, anyway, you can't get it the thing bit by bit, bit from Bungie.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000]   That's probably the best place to go.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.560]   If you go to source.bungee.net, all you can do is two downloads.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:36.080]   There's one called ALIF, which is the actual application and there's the infinity maps
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:37.680]   and source files and everything else.
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:39.680]   And so you just download those two files.
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:44.560]   You drop the ALIF application into the Bungie, into the infinity folder and you're ready
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:45.560]   to rock and roll.
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:49.800]   And so the thing is, is for those of you who have just gotten into the Mac or for those
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:57.080]   of you who are younger than whatever 35, the marathon was like the classic first person
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:33:00.800]   shooter for many of us for many years.
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:02.200]   And we love it.
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:03.200]   I love it.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.400]   I didn't realize that it was open source and I'm hoping that people will come play with
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:07.400]   us.
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:08.400]   So what time money?
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:09.400]   I'll be there.
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:10.400]   What time?
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:11.400]   Monday.
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.040]   1 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:14.680]   I believe that that is.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.520]   I'm getting a massage then.
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:17.520]   You are?
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:20.520]   That's going to be a tough choice.
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:21.520]   I have to think about it.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:26.040]   I think you have to move the massage because what you need is a massage at tube because
[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.600]   you're going to play for an hour.
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.280]   Are we only play for an hour?
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:30.280]   It's only an hour.
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:31.280]   It's just going to be one to two more.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:32.280]   And then my thumb will be sore anyway.
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:34.280]   Be careful on the throbber.
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:36.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:39.480]   And so anyway, so I'm hoping that people will come play with us.
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:41.560]   I think it'll be a lot of fun.
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:44.480]   It's, you know, it's, I've been having a lot of fun.
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:47.280]   There are a handful of people out there playing right now, but I think that we could.
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:51.840]   The only thing I'm concerned about is us possibly pushing the servers that kind of
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:58.120]   manage the tracking a little hard, but try it and we'll see how the first week goes.
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:00.480]   We'll do it for a couple of weeks and if people are really into it, we'll just keep on
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:01.480]   building from there.
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:10.560]   Sash can email, uh, tweet at drop.io, email the DMG to there and it will be in the drop.io
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:11.560]   folder.
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:17.600]   If you go to folks, if you go to drop.io/twit, the password is Mac break and you'll be able
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:19.400]   to download the DMG from there.
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:21.080]   That might be the easiest way to do it.
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:22.080]   Sure.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:27.000]   That way it's a just simple public folder that they can get it from.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000]   And it is open source.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000]   So we can do that.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000]   Yes.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000]   That's exciting.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.040]   I think maybe I could play while I'm getting a massage.
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.040]   There you go.
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:36.040]   Might be interesting.
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:37.040]   Hmm.
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:40.040]   Let me think about that.
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:41.040]   Hmm.
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:43.960]   Well, we are out of time, but boy, what a fun show.
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:50.280]   This has been a reminder next week, Patrick Wilson, the of Weezer, the drummer from Weezer,
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:55.280]   who requested to be on Mac break weekly because he loves it so much.
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:57.240]   Will be joining us.
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:02.560]   And I think we will really have a good discussion about music and so forth at that time.
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:04.080]   And he co-wrote.
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:05.080]   I didn't know he co-wrote.
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:06.920]   He's in the Reynolds 2, which is an amazing band.
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:09.680]   I didn't know he co-wrote some of the Weezer songs.
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:13.120]   I thought it was all pure rivers, but he co-wrote.
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:15.280]   My name is Jonas, which is one of my favorite Weezer songs.
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:18.040]   Well, I could tell this is going to be a Weezer Fest.
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:20.360]   So gang, get your Weezer catalog out.
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:24.720]   Listen to the songs so that when the concert happens, you'll know them all and we will
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:26.440]   see you next Wednesday.
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:30.240]   Again, that's our new time next Wednesday for Mac break weekly.
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:31.840]   Andy and I co thank you for joining us.
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:32.840]   He's in the Chicago.
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:39.440]   Sometimes you can find him at the celestial waste of bandwidth C W O B dot com, right?
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:40.440]   Absolutely.
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:43.480]   Do you need the dub dub dub still or not?
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:44.920]   I like the dub dub dub.
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:49.840]   It gives me that extra me time that I need in the middle of a busy day.
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:52.080]   Like an international general foods coffee.
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:55.240]   Okay.
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:56.240]   You made it.

[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:01.640]   It's very refreshing and has a slight taste of mint.
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:02.640]   It's very refreshing.
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:03.640]   I just tried it.
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:05.840]   You do need the dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub
