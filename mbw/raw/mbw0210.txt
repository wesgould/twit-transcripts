[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:12.080]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, kind of a special edition.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.080]   We're recording this right after Apple's announcement.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.160]   It's September 2010 announcement at the Erba Buena Center
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.640]   in San Francisco, California.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.400]   Joining me right now, Mr. Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.000]   And we are talking about what Apple has said.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.560]   I mean, that's pretty much going to be the story on this show.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.680]   If you didn't see the Apple announcement, of course,
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.440]   Apple streamed it live for the first time in a long time,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.080]   maybe as much as a decade.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.480]   So many people were able to watch live, but Apple, of course,
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.160]   I'm sure make a quick time version available
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.160]   so you can watch that.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160]   And we did our coverage, our traditional backseat coverage
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.800]   of the Apple event.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.840]   We weren't able to rebroadcast their stream.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.960]   We asked permission.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.120]   We were denied it.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.400]   But we did broadcast our kind of--
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.640]   - It's a high quality stream.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.480]   - Yeah, it looks good.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.120]   And right up till the end, when a lot of people were watching it,
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.400]   go to twit.tv/specials if you want to see our live coverage.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.520]   Tom Merritt, Alex Lindsey, and myself.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.600]   Plus, a lot of the chat room was also involved in that.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.720]   We kept the chat room up for most of the time.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.680]   You could actually-- I think if you synchronized your playback
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.960]   two different windows, Steve and one, us and the other,
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.000]   you could actually recreate the live experience.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.880]   Let's recap what Apple said.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.320]   First of all, they started off talking about the success
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.320]   of the Apple stores.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.640]   Steve likes to start with numbers with positive numbers.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.960]   Didn't spend a lot of time there.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.160]   Said the pair of stores is great.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.240]   - I think that a lot of people have been pretty critical
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.640]   that Apple does these announcements
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.120]   and spends a half an hour talking about numbers.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.560]   And I think they're finally responding
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.200]   and kind of moving towards being a little bit more
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.400]   pithy about that.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.760]   - This is pithy for sure.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.960]   They also fired the only shot of the entire event at Google,
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.840]   pointing out that although Google has said
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.720]   we're activating 200,000 Android phones a day,
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.360]   Steve said, well, we're activating 230,000 iOS devices
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.720]   a day, and that doesn't include upgrades.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.760]   He didn't mention the G word, but he didn't
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.640]   imply that the other guys were including upgrade numbers.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.920]   I don't know.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.080]   Somebody will have to fact check that.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.440]   Nobody's saying exactly where those numbers come from,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.840]   anybody can make up any numbers they want.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.280]   - There's still a lot of phones.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.600]   - Well, he said there are 120 million iOS devices
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.120]   out there now with the iPhones there
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.880]   and the iPod touches and the iPads.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.720]   That's pretty good.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.680]   Not a lot of time spent on the iPads in this one.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.840]   He announced iOS 4.1 and a lot of new features in 4.1,
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.080]   but they're for the iPod touches and the iPhone.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.920]   - Right.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.760]   - HDR.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.960]   - They did announce, well HDR.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.920]   - Let's go through this one by one.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.440]   So you're a photography guy.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.600]   You do this weekend photography.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.280]   What is the difference between what Apple's calling HDR
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.120]   and true HDR?
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.360]   - So when you actually shoot, and I could be wrong,
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.800]   maybe when we downloaded it, it's actually shooting HDR.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.400]   But what happens is when you shoot multiple exposures
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.920]   and you combine those, you create a high dynamic range image.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.000]   The image is, it actually holds all this information
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.680]   in the image dynamically.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.680]   So you can actually go back and make exposure adjustments
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.520]   and so on and so forth.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.760]   What I think that he's talking about here is what the,
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.720]   you know, conventional wisdom is about HDR,
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.920]   but it's just not accurate,
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.920]   which is that it's a tone map, which,
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.840]   what that means is it takes these three exposures
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.360]   and it combines them and basically compresses
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.280]   that tonal information so that you get the high,
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.760]   you know, that you get the sky, you get the clouds in the sky
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.320]   and you get shadow detail all at the same time.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.680]   And anybody who's shot outside with your iPhone
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.440]   knows how frustrating it is.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.760]   You wanna take a picture and everything's blown out
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.040]   or everything's in shadow.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.120]   So that's what this is doing.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.800]   The thing that I'll be interested to see is that,
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.800]   of course, to make all of this work,
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.720]   you need to be able to get three photos
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.000]   that are right over top of each other.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.640]   So I'm curious how effective this is going to be
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.920]   when you, when it's taking three photos, you know,
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.960]   handheld and you have a little bit of motion.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.360]   Now, most image stabilization that they're already using
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.880]   might improve this.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.040]   You could just, you know, just stitching.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.720]   There's a lot of things that they could do.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.960]   The images aren't that big.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.440]   So it is possible for them to do it.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.280]   And I think-
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.280]   It's a strange thing to announce, don't you think?
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.200]   I mean, is this something,
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.080]   this is certainly not a feature people were demanding.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.040]   They weren't, but I will say it does up the ante
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.480]   for other phone manufacturers because no one else is doing it.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.080]   There are other, there are other cameras that are doing it.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.400]   Fuji makes a camera that uses what they call EXR,
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.880]   which is essentially the same thing
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.440]   except they don't only use just two exposures.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.440]   Three exposures is really the proper, in my opinion,
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.120]   the proper way to, you know, approach that.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.440]   In fact, I'm going to be shooting some HDRs
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.960]   in your backyard later today.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.120]   And, but I'll be using nine.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.960]   Andy, you're not going to,
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.440]   I think it's just joined us on the phone.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.760]   Hi, Andy.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.760]   Hi, I'm not going to say something nasty
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.640]   about a major video streaming service
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.720]   because it's all been said, really, hasn't it?
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.400]   Andy, you're the only one who has these problems,
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.880]   I don't understand.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.520]   Well, because I'm the only one who uses it
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.680]   at a high performance expectation level Leo
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.120]   that's three, three, three, three.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.040]   Andy is in Chicago where he is speaking to a users group.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.560]   We decided not to fly you out based on your hunch
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.400]   about how important this announcement would be.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.360]   Now, after the announcement, Andy,
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.040]   do you feel like that was the right choice
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.960]   or do you wish you were here?
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.840]   Well, I certainly wish I were there.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.440]   Actually, the decision wasn't based on
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.280]   what I thought was going to happen.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.680]   It was that I did make a commitment
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.200]   to the Chicago Apple users group some months ago.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.440]   They committed a certain amount of money
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.000]   to my travel and I thought that it was kind of bad form
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.760]   to leave them in the lurch like that with,
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.920]   somebody in the hole like that.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.760]   I agree.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.120]   And I was seeing a couple of other people
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.200]   yesterday and today and so it was just a big kerpuffle.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.320]   But he so, yeah, I definitely wish I would have been there
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.640]   only because, hey, how often do you get to hear
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.600]   solo acoustic music from Coldplay?
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.600]   Chris, Mark.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.600]   It was big stuff.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.000]   It was just like a lot of little stuff.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.560]   Even the video stream cut out for me at the very, very start
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.080]   of the introduction of the Apple TV device.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.800]   It's still called Apple TV.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.000]   Yeah, we're going one by one through the announcement.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.160]   Actually, your timing is very good because we've just begun.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.280]   So, I'll just start to start.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.960]   But Andy has blogged this.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.600]   His live blog is at inaco.com.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.320]   And you can go there and see Andy's thoughts
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.840]   in real time as he was watching the stream.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.880]   We started by talking about the features of iOS 4.1, which
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.440]   will be available for the iPhone and iPod touch next week,
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.920]   not for the iPad.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.840]   4.2 will be an upgrade for the iPad in November.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:30.120]   iOS 4.1 by 1 going through the features we mentioned HDR.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.960]   Yeah, that's--
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.480]   Boy, I can't wait to get my hands on that.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.960]   That sounds like-- if mean, Al already, I
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.080]   think they had the best camera phone on any phone.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.080]   Absolutely.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.080]   If they add true HDR, this will kick
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.320]   the butt of a lot of real pocket cameras.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.240]   If it is true HDR.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.080]   It seems to me an odd feature.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.240]   I was saying to Alex, nobody demanded it.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.640]   Nobody's saying, well, you've got to have HDR.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.920]   In fact, I could think of a few other features
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.880]   photo buffs might have wanted before HDR.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.480]   Well, that's the reason why Apple does so well,
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.880]   that I think that on other phone platforms, other OS platforms,
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.720]   they listen to users who say things like,
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.760]   we want a more reverse stack oriented data collection
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.520]   routine because we feel so that it's a pipe.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.640]   Apple tends to listen things like,
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.600]   gee, every time I take a picture like the sky's kind of washed
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.280]   out or the repeat details are black.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.240]   I wish your camera did a better job of that.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.720]   And so they know that the way to do that is simply at least
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.800]   is with the HDR.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.240]   What we'll get to the iPod touch in a bit,
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.400]   but HDR and all the features of iOS 4.1
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.720]   will be available immediately in the new iPod touch.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.760]   So presumably HDR.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.760]   In fact, when 4.2 comes out, HDR will be available in the iPad,
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.320]   which makes even less sense.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.800]   I was just wondering, did we have specs on the camera
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.760]   for the new iPod touch?
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.040]   Is it as good a camera?
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.600]   I would guess that it's the same camera.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.520]   If it's the same camera, that touch gets very interesting.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.360]   It is, in some ways, a pocket camera now as well.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.320]   You didn't know, though, the picture of the rear plate of it,
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.840]   I did not see an LED or any other kind of an aluminum
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.840]   and an LED or there.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.840]   No flash.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.840]   No flash.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.840]   No flash.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.160]   Well, you know, I mean, you could have said,
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.600]   we're going to build panorama into it if you'd wanted to.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.480]   I would imagine there'd be more people who want panorama,
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.480]   although they're great auto-stitch applications.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.200]   You know, but I think the tone mapping or HDR
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.480]   that they're incorporating will affect almost every user
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.520]   on a daily basis than almost any other feature they could add,
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.360]   in my opinion.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.240]   I mean, I think that being able to capture a wider tonal range
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.600]   is probably one of the number one problems
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.600]   that the average consumer, whether they know it or not, is,
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.040]   you know, why isn't that sunset look like it looked
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.040]   when I was there?
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.040]   Why is it blown out?
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.840]   Why is it, you know, why am I not getting that?
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.680]   And this is going to, in a quick, easy way,
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.440]   give them that access.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.040]   It does look like the camera on the iPod touch
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.040]   is not as good as the camera on the iPhone.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.560]   It is 970 by 60 by 720.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.560]   So--
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.560]   Oh, really?
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.840]   --to do the HD recording, the 720 recording that they--
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.840]   Oh, no.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.800]   Say again?
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.760]   I'm sorry, I'm hearing that news.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.920]   Literally, I delayed about 10 minutes just to, like, do all--
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.920]   fix all the typos, my, quote, live, blog, unquote,
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.840]   and post it, and then I attended with call you.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.600]   So there are emails waiting for me.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.000]   There's probably official releases waiting for me
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   that haven't even checked yet.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.280]   So I'm going to be a lot of-- oh, it was so really-- oh,
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:24.840]   interesting.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.360]   Oh, no.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.680]   I'm looking at the tech specs.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.200]   Yes.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.680]   Right, we're all going to get all excited.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.600]   Looking at the tech specs for the camera on the iPod touch,
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.920]   960 by 720 back camera, and a VGA quality front camera,
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.480]   which is that is the same as the iPhone.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.320]   What else in 4.2 did they add?
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.280]   The gaming game center is now active.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.040]   And that could be very interesting with the growing
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.640]   social-- adding social to all these casual gaming stuff
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.640]   that's available now, I think, could be interesting.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.240]   Game center.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.840]   There'll be a game center app, as well as game center availability
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.600]   in other applications.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.120]   Yeah, it's that social.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.240]   Apple's kind of making a little service to social
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.840]   in this announcement in several ways.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.840]   So that's kind of intriguing.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.400]   Then we talked about 4.1 and 4.2.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.280]   4.1, we'll get to 4.2 in a second.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:25.840]   Oh, I got it.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.840]   OK.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.440]   What else is new in 4.1?
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.480]   Anything else you're excited about in 4.1?
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.480]   I mean--
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.480]   Not really.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.640]   He highlighted the bug fixes, which I think
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.760]   if you're an Apple iPhone 3G owner,
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.320]   you'll be very happy to hear.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:38.800]   Right.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.800]   He called out the proximity sensor problem,
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.640]   the 3G bug, and the problems with Bluetooth.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.600]   Are you surprised that the proximity sensor is a software
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.720]   error?
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.160]   Oof.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.000]   I have no idea.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.200]   I mean, it could be a Hubble problem where they realized
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.360]   that they could fix it either by recalling the phones
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.080]   or adding new software to sort of fix it on the phone.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.000]   And they know that they're not going to recall the phone.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   They said--
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.360]   I bet you they just added the Butterworth filter.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.280]   That's actually a technical.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:07.920]   Is it Mrs. Butterworth?
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.720]   It's a low-pass filter.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.720]   Oh, OK.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.920]   Just throw a Butterworth.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.200]   Any time we have problem with motion capture,
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.560]   we have motion capture with jitter and stuff,
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.520]   I just had a Butterworth.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.080]   Well, as an iPhone 4 user who has had problems
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.480]   with the proximity sensor, I'm glad to see
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.360]   that upgrade.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.400]   That'll be available next week.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.600]   These are free, too, which is nice.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.840]   In the past, they've charged for iPod touch upgrades.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.440]   But they won't charge for that.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.960]   Did they say which iPod touches?
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.040]   Will all iPod touches be able to use--
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.120]   I guess so, for--
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.880]   No, well, there was an asterisk next to it.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.320]   When they said one's going to be available for multiple devices.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.840]   And so there is the legendary not-for-all iPod touch devices.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.280]   The really active ones, no.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:44.800]   Exactly.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.400]   I mean, if you've got a black bezel and I've squared off back,
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.680]   then I think you're going to guess
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.280]   that you're not going to be able to get those features.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.720]   Right.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.720]   It'll also add this new iTunes ping.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.360]   We'll talk more about ping when we get to the iTunes 10.0 release.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.080]   But you will have the iTunes TV show Reynolds built into your iPhone
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:07.240]   and iPod touch as part of iOS 4.1.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.760]   I don't know if there are other features.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.960]   I mean, I could see that really.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.640]   I'm about to get on a long flight on Friday.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.040]   And I could definitely see myself--
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.320]   99 cent Reynolds.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.040]   Running in three or four things before I get on the plane.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:17.540]   Yeah.
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.940]   4.2 will be available in November for all devices.
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.280]   That will include an iPad update, which will bring HDR and ping
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.160]   and all the other features to the iPad that will be--
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.080]   Well, maybe not because that's a feature of the camera app.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.920]   And unless the--
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.080]   They said-- he said in the announcement,
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.880]   I remember this because I thought that's odd,
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.720]   that HDR would be available for the iPad.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.880]   Now, the only question is whether a new iPad comes out
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.720]   in November that has a camera.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.200]   Well, whether you meant it would be available eventually
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   for the iPad.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.460]   If you had a camera, you could do it.
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.140]   But you don't.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.300]   So you can't.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.780]   All right, so there's the software updates, 4.1 and 4.2,
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:03.740]   4.1 next week for free, 4.2 in November for free.
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.540]   I think that's pretty exciting.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.820]   Then he moved on to iPods and announced a new--
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.940]   started with a new iPod shuffle, which really
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.940]   is a lot like the old iPod shuffle.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.980]   Buttons are back, baby.
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.980]   No longer the Wrigley chewing gum stick or the dentine stick,
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.900]   it looks back like the old previous generation.
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.120]   Hopefully, hopefully also not the-- oh, I forgot
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.980]   a clip that's my collar.
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.980]   It's gone through the wash.
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.180]   When I jumped up and I dumped that in the wash
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.140]   machine version.
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.860]   I like that form factor.
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.860]   And I have to think that consumers said,
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.580]   now we really want buttons.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.300]   I didn't-- I had no interest in the gumstick version.
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.980]   I think the gumstick version is actually
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.660]   the only iPod I've never bought.
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.660]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.940]   I think one of the other problems was that it's just--
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.100]   you don't have a physical connection to the device.
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.100]   It was the first completely wearable thing
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.100]   that Apple never did.
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.740]   And the idea of having never that thing
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.500]   you could look at and confirm that here's
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.540]   the button that I've sort of poised over.
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.980]   There's so many times that I change tracks, not by really
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.540]   thinking about it, by just simply hovering over a forward
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:11.260]   and a backtrack button and then just simply tapping as I go.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.940]   Now we move to the device that I'm most excited about.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.460]   I think this actually is the single biggest thing Apple said
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:16.960]   today.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.100]   I just think this is going to be great.
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.780]   The new iPod nano.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.020]   All the rumors were right.
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.100]   Square.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.380]   It has a screen on it.
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.460]   Very, very similar to the iPod, the new iPod shuffle.
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.500]   A little bit bigger.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.460]   It has a touch screen with multi touch on it.
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.460]   Yeah.
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.980]   I'm not sure how you're going to do a free finger touch
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.340]   swipe gesture on this thing.
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.140]   Do you notice that even Steve was a little bit
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.380]   like tentative and hesitant about operating this thing?
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.580]   I know that he was being projected in front
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.980]   of like a million people.
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.700]   But I'm wondering how much of my finger
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.460]   is going to be covering up the screen as I'm trying
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.300]   to control this thing.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.700]   It was upside down briefly.
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.460]   But the new nano-- by the way, we should say the touch price
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.740]   starts at $49 for 2 gigabytes.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.460]   The new nano is a little bit more expensive.
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:04.300]   It's $149 for 8 gigabytes, $179 for 16 gigabytes.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.380]   But for that additional $100, you get a screen.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.020]   A screen--
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.540]   $240 by 240.
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.100]   That's a pretty nice screen.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.140]   The screen that can show you album art, show you photos.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.620]   You can do slideshows.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.860]   It has-- he showed a wristwatch as well, an analog watch.
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.060]   And I have to say, at that size,
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.740]   that might make a pretty good replacement for your wristwatch.
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:32.380]   I mean, the thing is a 200 PPI is really getting close
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.140]   to an art magazine.
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.540]   I mean, it's better than--
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.300]   it's amazing to see these little displays going better
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:39.820]   than print.
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.900]   Not an OLED, probably.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:45.100]   Probably another IPS LCD screen I would think.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.140]   I'm not sure about the watch angle, though,
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.100]   because it probably-- is there going
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.340]   to be a preference you can actually keep it active
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.900]   and burning like a large thing?
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.140]   Well, you just touch it.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.420]   And you see what time it is.
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.900]   It also has an FM radio built into it.
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.020]   They did take out the nano's camera.
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.220]   That was clearly a feature that just--
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.460]   at the time, I thought, oh, watch out Flip.
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.380]   But once we saw the quality of the nano camera,
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.860]   I think Flip wasn't in too much trouble.
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:10.380]   Right.
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:10.900]   So--
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:11.420]   Thank you, Plus.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.300]   It has the pedometer feature.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.460]   And it looks like no video playback at all.
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.060]   So I think Apple's stepping back a little bit on the shuffle
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:22.420]   without a controls and on the nano with a camera and video.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.300]   Reserving those features really for the iPod touch,
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.340]   where it makes a lot more sense.
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.740]   I do wonder how many of that was-- how much that was dictated
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.540]   by the shape and size of the thing itself
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.420]   that they said that we'd like to do video.
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.580]   But we'd like to have a camera.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.380]   We'd like to have video.
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.500]   We'd like to have these features.
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.820]   But how the hell do you make a useful lot of device
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.460]   with the physical buttons?
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.180]   I think that's completely reasonable, isn't it?
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.940]   I mean, it's a pretty small little sucker.
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.260]   But I think very attractive in five colors--
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.740]   silver, blue.
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.900]   Yeah.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:51.820]   I like what Tom said.
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.180]   He said, no, no, that's not blue.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.700]   That's-- I can't remember what he said.
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.260]   Aquamarine and pink.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.060]   It's a really nice--
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:05.220]   Cerulean as you and green and a yellow that looks like mustard.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:05.940]   I think it's a mustard yellow.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.500]   That was nicer than what Tom said.
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.500]   I think it was I who said it was urine colors that you--
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.740]   yes.
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.020]   It's a little-- well, it depends on your urine.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.020]   I was going to say straight asparagus, asparanifreeze.
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.340]   But I think this is a great product.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.420]   I think Apple really owns the music player marketplace.
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.780]   It doesn't have to work too hard to keep that dominant.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.100]   Man, there is no oxygen there.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.300]   I mean, when you look at these--
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:30.820]   That's--
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.940]   I mean, for $49 all the way up to $400,
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.660]   there's just the best option at almost every price,
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.100]   except for maybe $99, is the--
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.300]   We were not concerned because there
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.220]   was no mention of the classic at all.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.500]   But it's pretty clear now that that's going to continue.
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.420]   It's still in the store.
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.100]   But it mustn't be a big seller.
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:49.740]   It's--
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.620]   Oh, you did?
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.460]   Go ahead.
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.500]   It's curious because Steve did say we're updating every single--
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.260]   we're updating all the iPods.
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.260]   Right.
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.500]   So I don't know whether that means that--
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.780]   Except for the classic.
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.940]   You can also get the classic and now you
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.700]   have the option of buying it or not buying it.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.540]   That'd be a great--
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.180]   That's the upgrade.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.260]   Well, it is the classic.
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.260]   I mean, it's still listed.
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.300]   I mean, it's right there.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.020]   There's the shuffle, the nano, the touch, the classic,
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.660]   as part of their product line.
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.340]   So--
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.460]   It must be selling enough to keep it.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.380]   It's for the high capacity user.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:18.900]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:19.900]   160.
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.500]   They don't have any other solution that does that,
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.220]   and that you can keep your whole library on.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.460]   And that's what this does well.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.460]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.420]   Now let's get to the touches, which I think
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.020]   is also pretty exciting, essentially putting all the--
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.780]   as we expected, I think--
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:40.020]   all the features of the iPhone 4 in a touch,
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:44.140]   the Retina display, front-facing camera and FaceTime.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.020]   By the way, I'm going to stand by my contention early on
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.300]   that FaceTime was a non-starter, at least as configured.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.100]   And maybe it's a little bit more successful now
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.420]   that there's some more devices you can use with it.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.300]   Do you guys use FaceTime, Andy?
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.460]   Use it?
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.940]   I use it for-- there are a couple of people
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.780]   that I use it with fairly often.
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.620]   And there have been more than a few conversations
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.700]   that where someone's trying to describe something to me,
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.980]   and someone says, oh, are you on an iPhone?
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.500]   Well, I just wanted to show you this thing.
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:11.980]   Really?
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:12.980]   Yeah.
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.300]   I wouldn't-- if I didn't have that feature,
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.420]   I wouldn't necessarily miss it.
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.660]   But I wouldn't go as far as I say that.
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:18.340]   I don't use it.
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.580]   In order for it to succeed, either you
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.100]   have to go 3G with it, and that's probably not
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.380]   going to happen, or you've got to get more devices
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.940]   like these iPod touches out there.
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.900]   Now, if you get a lot--
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.660]   another 50 million devices out there that can do it,
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:34.620]   that might make the difference.
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.740]   And people have to get used to it.
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.540]   I notice how little I want to--
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.220]   when I'm talking on the phone, the one thing I notice
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.260]   is how little I want to have a video.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.500]   Like, I do FaceTime a fair bit of time.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.420]   But I always sometimes feel like, oh, no, I'm sitting there
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.140]   and talking to the numbers.
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.140]   I really want to be doing this.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.780]   Well, I'm now unit-tasking when I could have been talking
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.540]   to them within my phone and washing my dishes.
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.540]   Well, that's always been my feeling.
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.340]   I think that's one of the reasons, frankly,
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:58.420]   these camera phone solutions, which have been around for 40 years,
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.460]   have never taken off.
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.340]   People don't really want to be seen.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:01.820]   Right.
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.340]   A phone calls a phone call.
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.700]   It is useful if you're asking how to do something.
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.700]   Like, there have been a bunch of times now where we just
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.780]   got a new piece of streaming hardware at the office.
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.140]   And what I really wanted to do was get on FaceTime
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.740]   with their engineer and then point it and say, OK,
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:15.940]   where do I push next?
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.700]   I think those kinds of just-in-time support
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.580]   could be very useful in this kind of capacity.
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.900]   I do think a retina display is great.
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.860]   It's too bad the camera isn't a little bit higher quality.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.540]   It would be great if it had the iPhone 4 quality camera in it.
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.940]   That's kind of a surprise.
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.100]   I've got lots of questions I need to ask Apple.
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:35.300]   And one of them is, will it even take still photos?
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.500]   Or is it that such a low resolution that Apple doesn't
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.020]   want to associate themselves with--
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.420]   They don't mention it, do they?
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:40.780]   Yeah.
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.820]   They only mention high-def video.
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.180]   FaceTime is using a front-facing camera, the VGA kind of camera
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.140]   that is--
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.180]   I'm just looking at the ad.
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.900]   They didn't show anybody taking a picture at all.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:52.940]   That's too bad.
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:53.860]   That's a real opportunity.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.060]   This could be a pretty compelling point-and-click camera.
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:57.980]   It's a good enough camera.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:58.980]   They made it a higher-res camera.
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.980]   If they used the same camera, it's kind of surprising
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:05.580]   that they would go down, sure it's a price point.
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.460]   Maybe there just wasn't even enough room in the bezel.
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.060]   It doesn't-- it doesn't-- it doesn't--
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.260]   the thick profile of the iPhone 4, like that's better.
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.980]   Well, and that's one of the selling points.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.900]   It is very thin.
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.180]   Yeah, they made a big deal about how much thinner it is
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:18.900]   in the previous one.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.780]   Maybe they just couldn't find a component that would do
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.260]   five megapixels in that sort of profile.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.980]   Now, one of the things they really pushed them rightly so--
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.460]   Steve said this iPod Touch is better-selling
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.140]   than Sony's PSP and Nintendo's DS combined.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.260]   It is the portable game platform.
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.820]   They brought Epic on stage to show the Unreal Engine port.
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:39.900]   They've got a new--
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.660]   something they called the Sword Project.
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.620]   Man, that looked good.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.860]   Was it a sword fighting game?
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.860]   I wasn't seeing the game.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.300]   It was a medieval fighting game.
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.980]   But the real-time 3D just looked really compelling.
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.340]   With the A4 chip in there-- and I presume the A4
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.020]   brings with it the graphics processing of the iPhone,
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.340]   you're going to have a nice platform for gaming.
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.060]   I mean, I'd played some of the Doom.
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.780]   A lot of the-- whether it's X-Plane or the Doom stuff
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:01.540]   that they had earlier.
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.780]   And even that was good on a 3GS.
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:08.940]   So this is going to be much, much better, much more compelling.
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.980]   You should point out, though, that's kind of a fudgy figure.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.180]   That if the only thing that the iPod Touch does was play games,
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.740]   I'm not sure that they would sell as many as--
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.260]   That's a good point.
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.420]   --but given that they're selling a multimedia to fuck up
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.380]   a policy, if the only company that's still selling a PDA,
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.500]   I think that's really why they're selling so many.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.380]   Oh, the PSP has a browser in it.
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.820]   It's more functional than just the gaming.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.620]   I think a lot of these companies want to have more functionality.
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:35.540]   They just don't have--
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.040]   Right.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:42.380]   Are we going to come back to iOS 4.2 for the iPad?
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.300]   Yes, iOS 4.2 for the iPad.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.900]   We had skimmed over that.
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.460]   Is something you'd like to say about it?
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.060]   Yeah, just that now they're adding wireless printing, which is--
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.260]   Oh, we forgot.
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.420]   That's huge.
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.780]   Which is one of those few features
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.700]   that the people who were set to complain about the iPad think,
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.100]   oh, you can't frame it.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.260]   Wait, if I have any daily computer, you can't print from it.
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.940]   And well, now that the wireless--
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.620]   with the exposure of printing, you
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:10.500]   can choose between the printer you want to choose output options.
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.060]   And most of the other announcements about 4.2 were just that, oh,
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.380]   and all the features that we've added to iOS 4.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:16.880]   Right.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.420]   The iPhone are now on the iPad, like folders and multitasking.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.140]   But they have a cool little system where
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.620]   when a print job is in progress, you
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.940]   have a print monitor application that shows up in the drawer,
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.700]   where you can see what print jobs are going,
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.980]   and also cancel jobs in progress.
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.020]   So if not for the fact that I thought
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.860]   I was going to need to stream live video for my hotel room,
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.620]   I would have just taken my iPad with me
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.540]   and made that my old book, "Pewter for the Strip,"
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.260]   that makes it even doubly compelling
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.980]   as for people who are just sort of on the fence about whether they
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:49.700]   need a real computer or not, really an iPad plus a Bluetooth
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.460]   keyboard.
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.940]   I think that will take care of 80% of what people need
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.380]   a computer for now, especially since you can print natively.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.100]   And we should mention that once we get to the Apple,
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.580]   the new Apple TV, that you will be
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:03.140]   able to take content that is on the iPad or the iPhone
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:06.180]   or the iPod Touch, already downloaded, it seems,
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.900]   not streaming content, but downloaded content
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.940]   and play it back on the new Apple TV.
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:10.300]   So--
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.300]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.820]   That's a cool thing.
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.660]   But I know we'll get to that a little bit later on.
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.700]   But I liked it, but I thought, you know what?
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.460]   It kind of burns me that a really complicated $99
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.260]   A4 powered network device and a Wi-Fi network
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.740]   will allow me to play this purchase content from my iPad
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.940]   onto the TV.
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.820]   But this $29 cable that Apple sold me, specifically
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.220]   to connect my iPad to my HDTV, will not
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.220]   play this precious content I purchased.
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:41.700]   Yeah.
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.740]   It's a little frustrating.
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.460]   We were going to have something to say about the new Apple TV
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.380]   as we get to it.
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.740]   That's going to--
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.260]   I believe the two of you will have a certain unique perspective
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:50.460]   on that.
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.700]   I do have to say the project sort sounds very interesting.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.780]   And you can now download the demo of the castle
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.020]   that you might have seen if you watched the video for iPhone
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.980]   and iPad on the iTunes Store.
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.420]   So I'm going to download that right now.
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.380]   I'll play a little bit of it back from my iPad.
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.740]   Oh, wait.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.740]   That's free.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:13.300]   Come on.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.300]   No, no, we'll get it faster.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.180]   It's just a demo.
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.100]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:17.620]   Say no.
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:18.620]   I see what you're saying.
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.580]   I just want to do it.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.060]   Yeah.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.300]   I think this is one of the most compelling features
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:28.140]   of the A4 and the Retina displays.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.660]   It is a really great gaming device.
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.500]   And it's something that they're beating--
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.260]   while we're getting Angry Birds on Android on Friday,
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.260]   and I've seen some now some pretty good games,
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.220]   including Assassin's Creed and so forth on Android,
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.540]   Apple still got to beat all six ways to Sunday in terms of--
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:45.620]   It's easy.
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:46.460]   It's easy to buy them.
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.380]   It's easy to buy them.
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:47.900]   Yep.
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.260]   It's easy to buy them on the Android.
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.260]   You just go to the marketplace.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.420]   That's not that hard.
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:52.460]   You search for it and you buy it.
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.220]   It's not that different.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.300]   In fact, Epic just--
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.300]   somebody I can't remember who just released a whole bunch
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.300]   of game demos for Android that were playing.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.500]   We heard many reports.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.220]   The last report I saw of the people
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.460]   who are developing for the Android and the iPhone just
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:11.100]   say that the cost for effort is way--
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.100]   how much they get out of it, for how much effort they put into it.
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:13.620]   For development.
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.980]   Yeah, for development is just a much better--
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:20.340]   I think some of that has to do with people's comfort with Xcode.
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.300]   If you're an Xcode, Xcode is very polished, really beautiful.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.420]   Well, there's a lot of interface stuff that
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.300]   helps you make something look pretty quickly,
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.100]   which I don't think you have as much of--
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.380]   in this Epic Citadel.
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.500]   I'm going to download that right now.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.580]   Install that on my system and we'll be playing that momentarily.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.020]   Epic Citadel.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.500]   I will say that if the Android-- if we have an Android TV
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:41.860]   controller, I'd be more--
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:43.140]   they had all the apps.
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.060]   I'd be more likely to get an Android from my house.
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.660]   I guess we're going to go into that in a second.
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:47.940]   We'll talk about it.
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:52.260]   The not-iTV, the Apple TV.
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.500]   I guess we've gotten to that point.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.580]   Before we do, can I mention our friends at Citrix
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.820]   who do the great product, go to my PC.
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:27:59.700]   Andy's on the road.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.700]   We're all of us on the road these days a lot more.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.260]   And oftentimes, you feel a little disconnected
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.260]   from the home office.
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.460]   You can't get to the computer that
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.740]   has that keynote presentation or the data
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.940]   that you need or your corporate email.
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:17.620]   That's where go to my PC is such a boon.
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.740]   The new Mac version is so clean, so sweet.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:24.620]   It lets you access your office computer, Windows or Mac.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:28.060]   Any time you want to from anywhere
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.380]   as long as you can get online.
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.940]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.940]   If you go to go to my PC.com/Macbreak,
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.340]   you can install it on your Mac or your Windows machine.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.180]   And the next time you go on the road
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.220]   or even just want to go home early, avoid the traffic,
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.140]   you log on to go to my PC.com.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.380]   You enter in your user credentials,
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.460]   and boom, there is your office desktop.
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.660]   But you can use it just like you're at work,
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.020]   send and receive email, run any program, access, any network
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.380]   resource.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.940]   It's just a fantastic--
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.060]   Oh my goodness.
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.660]   Before I can download the Citadel thing,
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.260]   there's a little something that has to happen.
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.860]   I'll talk about that in a second.
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.300]   Go to my PC.com/Macbreak.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.300]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.260]   We thank Citrix, those great folks at Citrix,
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.420]   for their support of Macbreak and for their new Mac client,
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.740]   which is a sweet thing, a thing of beauty.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.300]   You can see it free by going to go to my PC.com/Macbreak.
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.620]   I just want to say the one thing.
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.420]   We now use it daily.
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.900]   You know, across the business.
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.740]   Well, we were actually a mixture of Go to Meeting.
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.860]   We have people that are using Go to my PC.
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.620]   We are also now subscribing to Go to webinar.
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.540]   Yeah, they have products.
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.940]   And so we have all these meetings that are going on constantly.
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:36.060]   And you just-- once you get over the, like,
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.380]   how do I get started on it, you're just like, oh, we don't
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.540]   really know what the client needs.
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.140]   So why don't we all get together online?
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.900]   You know, we got someone in LA, someone in Phoenix,
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.540]   and someone here, and let's just get online,
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.020]   look at the computer, and talk about it.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.980]   You know, and it's just so seamless.
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.060]   So I was mentioning before I could download this,
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.580]   I have new terms of service.
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.420]   As has happened last time when they updated iTunes.
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.340]   But these are particularly related to ping,
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.180]   and the availability of TV rentals.
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.620]   New terms have been added to the iTunes store terms
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.180]   and conditions with respect to ping, which
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.300]   allows you to follow friends and favorite artists to find out
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.420]   what they're listening to.
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.660]   By opting into ping, you agree that information you provide
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:15.620]   and information about your activity on the iTunes store
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.340]   may be shared in the manner described in the terms and conditions.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.380]   If you do not want others to view any information about you,
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.260]   you should not opt in to ping.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.340]   And then there's the terms and conditions,
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.620]   a total of 35 pages.
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.020]   I'm just going to read that all right now.
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.060]   I'll be back in an hour or two, and now I'm going to agree to it.
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:33.700]   Does anybody--
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:37.580]   Yes, anybody really, really read that stuff.
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:38.700]   You know, the last time they said,
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.140]   would you like us to email you this?
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.740]   They didn't do that this time.
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.340]   I'm too much of it in a hurry.
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:49.980]   I wonder if ping will be on these portable devices.
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.220]   I guess they said ping will be available.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.100]   They said it'll be available on the portable devices.
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.460]   That's pretty cool.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:54.900]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.260]   So let's talk about ping before we get to Apple TV,
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.900]   because we didn't mention that.
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.940]   Andy, while we were doing the live coverage an hour ago,
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:07.620]   I remarked, wow, this is Apple saying loud and clear to Twitter
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:11.500]   and Facebook were in social too.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.380]   I think--
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.580]   Well, the question I got was just
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.900]   that they're kind of tired of Facebook and Twitter having
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.180]   some success there and helping to promote
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.620]   the way that iTunes really can't control.
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.820]   And so they're trying to take away a lot of that traffic.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.700]   And that's much that they want the money.
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.580]   They just want to have the control of what that drives
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.420]   the action is, what the experience is.
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.260]   Do anybody know if affiliate links
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.780]   works within the ping ecosystem?
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:42.940]   If someone buys a track that I've just bought or recommended,
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.340]   do I get like an affiliate--
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.940]   Well, that's--
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.300]   We're speculating about that.
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.900]   If that happens, it'll be incredibly huge.
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.500]   In my opinion, I think that turns into--
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.580]   I mean, then you have people who are market leaders making
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.220]   money doing this in a closed system.
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.700]   And I think you'll see a lot of people
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.700]   pulling their Twitter followers into ping
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.380]   because they're going to generate revenue there.
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.860]   Don't you think Steve would have said, though,
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.420]   if that capability were there?
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.060]   I mean, that's--
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:06.420]   Maybe not.
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:07.540]   They don't really talk about the affiliate.
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.980]   There isn't affiliate program for iTunes,
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.460]   and they don't talk about it at all.
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.660]   But if you dig around, you can find it.
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:13.980]   You have to get iTunes 10.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.580]   The new iTunes is out.
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.020]   And that's the biggest feature.
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:21.420]   You mentioned briefly that they're going to do some simplification
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.580]   of the UI.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.780]   For instance, if you have five or more songs in an album,
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.100]   they'll show the album art instead of the album title
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.380]   repeating over and over again, things like that.
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.380]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.180]   Well, I don't know why you would even mention it,
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.140]   to be honest.
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:37.100]   It seemed like something that an intern did last week,
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.760]   because either that or get people
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.420]   and then enough people saw it and wanted
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.540]   to put in their own copies.
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:43.620]   You know what?
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.780]   That's the feature.
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.420]   They're already doing it with the books.
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:50.660]   If you have downloaded audio books from Audible or iTunes,
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.860]   it'll do that same kind of consolidation.
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.780]   It doesn't do it perfectly, by the way.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.820]   There are some cases where I have one book with three chapters.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.100]   It shows up three times.
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.180]   And it's not a perfect situation.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:04.260]   Maybe they've improved that a little bit.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.820]   So Ping is-- I think Ping is interesting to me.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.300]   I think it could be a huge play.
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.620]   Steve said several times.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:15.460]   We have 160 million people with credit cards in iTunes,
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:18.660]   all of whom have one-click access to buy songs.
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:23.140]   And I think that that is, I think, for advertisers,
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.460]   for music companies, for the artists.
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.300]   The idea that you have a social network that
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:31.820]   is fairly tightly wound, where everything's a one-click away
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.660]   from a purchase, is pretty compelling.
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:35.460]   Yeah.
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.380]   Yeah.
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.380]   And I was a little disappointed, Andy.
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.940]   I'm not sure what your take would be on this,
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.860]   that it was not-- didn't follow web standards in any way.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.100]   It's really a walled garden.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.260]   There's no interface to Twitter or Facebook.
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.260]   I mean, certainly it's going to do well.
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.420]   It's like at Last FM or something like that,
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.660]   where you have a social recommendations.
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:56.900]   You can follow a circle of friends.
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.460]   You can follow your favorite artists.
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.500]   You do have privacy.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.340]   He was very quick to show there are privacy controls in this.
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.020]   You can make sure that nobody but the people you say yes to
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.260]   can see what you're doing.
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.020]   Or you can be public.
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.020]   Who's the same as Twitter?
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.820]   Yeah, same as-- it's very much like Twitter, in that sense.
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:16.540]   Or blip.fm, which I think is a very similar service.
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.660]   Well, they still have the integration
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:19.740]   with Facebook and Twitter.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:22.500]   I mean, any tracking a library, any tracking a store,
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.180]   if you want to recommend it on either one of those sites,
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:25.460]   you can do it.
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.900]   I do think that it's more of a case
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.940]   that's controlled than what it had the power.
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:32.740]   Or the revenue.
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:35.340]   Yeah, I would-- you know, I think if they wanted--
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.300]   it could be this is a stealth entry into social networking.
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.460]   That doesn't seem like something Apple would want to do.
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.060]   But it could be that this is the beginning.
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.300]   But in order for it to really take off,
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.500]   people don't want multiple homes on the internet.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.220]   They want to either use Facebook or Ping.
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.500]   Well, that might be what Apple's betting on too.
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.180]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:55.340]   You know, if they get enough of a following in this area,
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.700]   then you end up in a situation where there people
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.820]   are leaving the other things.
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.980]   And Apple, again, doesn't need 90% of them to leave.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:04.300]   They just need 15% or 20%.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:04.740]   Good point.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:08.220]   I mean, do you think that--
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.100]   what percentage of the 160 million people live in iTunes?
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.980]   This would only make sense if you always had iTunes open.
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.700]   I think it's small.
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:19.020]   Andy, you don't live in iTunes, do you?
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.060]   No, I mean, well, does anybody live in iTunes?
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:21.660]   Somebody does.
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.140]   Tom Merritt said he always has it open.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.300]   I mean, some people--
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.060]   Well, what I mean is that I always have it open
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.420]   because I always want to have to wait the launch whenever
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.580]   I redox my iPad or my iPhone or something.
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.940]   But it's really not by nature of an application that you live in.
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.380]   It's one of the-- it's something that you tap into to start
[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:40.900]   a playlist going, and then you will want other things.
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.580]   Or you tap to buy something you just heard about or read
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.580]   about online, and then you tap out of it again.
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:46.980]   Right.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.540]   I mean, I'm not sure that that thing will make me--
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:54.060]   it seems to me like it's a sort of a tap that I would check
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.460]   when I think about it just because I'm curious about what
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.780]   my friends are into.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.420]   I'm not sure if it would be--
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.460]   it would never be something like Facebook where I'm going
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:02.980]   to do there.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:06.780]   And I'm going to be there to be an ongoing part of a conversation
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.500]   with all of my friends about what they're doing,
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.540]   what they spent their weekend.
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.420]   And that's the thing.
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.660]   Because by nature, it's so focused on music.
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:13.580]   Right.
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:17.020]   I will-- if they have--
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.580]   if artists can include podcasters,
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.260]   we'll certainly have to have a Twitter page there
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:26.020]   and hope that there'll be some activity there.
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:26.900]   I guess we'll have--
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:29.140]   I mean, really, do you want to have a conversation
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.820]   with a million different Coldplay fans?
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.700]   I mean, where you can say, well, I thought you'll--
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.980]   But you know, if--
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.620]   OK, maybe we're too old.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.020]   But if you're 22 and you have a circle of 50 friends
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.220]   that you're all really into music,
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:48.300]   I could see perhaps that working for them as a group.
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.220]   Oh, right.
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:51.900]   Again, social group's feature is cool.
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.580]   And I see myself using it as a way of-- again,
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.780]   when I have a certain level of-- a certain group of friends
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.580]   that is often turning on to really good music.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.340]   But as soon as I talk about, well, great.
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.100]   So Lady Gaga is going to talk to me.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:03.700]   Yeah, sure.
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:06.380]   I think she's going to see my comment.
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.700]   Well, somebody cares.
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.180]   5 million people follow her on Twitter with the same--
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:10.700]   Yeah.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:11.700]   --ish hope.
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.700]   And you want to talk to-- you want to talk about something
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:15.060]   really, really freaky.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.380]   The only times that I was having problems with the stream
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:20.980]   were all the time that Lady Gaga came on to the first band.
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.940]   All knew that-- oh my god, the Gaga's being mentioned on Apple.
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.620]   Quick, join the stream.
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.700]   Yeah, this may be-- this may as much be a stop
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.540]   to the record labels as anybody else.
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.820]   Well, I think it's the artists.
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:32.660]   I mean, I don't think this is good for the record labels.
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.060]   This gives the artists a close--
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.540]   Our.
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.500]   They now have a close relationship
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:45.380]   with their individual followers, where they can release a--
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:50.260]   here's a version of me playing live that we shot in my backyard,
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.700]   or here's a-- they can make that available on iTunes,
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:58.140]   put it on their feed so that there's no web interface.
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.780]   You're in iTunes where you can purchase it.
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:02.980]   They can put up a new live track that they did.
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.660]   They can then tell their feed of a million people that it's there,
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:06.020]   and--
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:06.940]   Titching.
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.140]   Make more money than they're making from the record labels.
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:10.620]   That's the whole thing.
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:11.580]   Nobody's going to mention this.
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.300]   It's certainly not something Steve would mention.
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.820]   But I think that-- a little pat on the back for Apple
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:20.620]   and accessibility for iOS 4.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.820]   And they've improved, in fact, accessibility even more.
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.740]   They've got voiceover, screen reading technology
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:29.900]   built into the iPhone and iPod touch.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:35.380]   And I hope the iPad soon, they also have iOS 4 supports
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.580]   wireless braille displays.
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.700]   They have out of the box support for 30 different wireless braille
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.940]   displays, screen magnification, playback of closed caption
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.900]   video, white on black text.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.140]   So Apple really has continued to lead the way with accessibility
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:49.640]   here.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.100]   I want a wireless braille display just to see it.
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.100]   They're cool.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.420]   Have you ever seen one?
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.620]   I've seen someone a long time ago.
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.020]   I haven't seen it hook it up.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.740]   You don't hook it up because it's wireless,
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.300]   but you connect them up.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:05.380]   And then it manufactures a strip of braille on the fly.
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:08.940]   It's got little pins that they can come up and down.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.220]   And so you hold your fingers over it,
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:15.100]   and it creates the braille, and you can read it.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.900]   So even if you can't hear, you can read the screen,
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.540]   which is fantastic.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:24.140]   So a little kudos on there.
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.940]   By the way, the gold master of 4.1
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.020]   is out on the Apple Developer site.
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.740]   So coders have it weak.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:33.660]   And to make sure there's stuff doesn't break.
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.980]   Let's see.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.540]   What else?
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:41.820]   I don't want to get to Apple TV too quickly.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:45.500]   Anything else in the announcements before we get there?
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.700]   I'm scrolling down.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.620]   I'll see if it will give you concert listing.
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.860]   If it was curious to see if it will all your buy tickets to--
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.700]   Yeah, you noticed that Steve was going to a Teigen and Sarah
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:57.940]   concert next week.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.260]   No.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.140]   Yeah, but see, here's-- and again, Apple, I think,
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:01.660]   has missed the boat.
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.180]   You can buy songs.
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.500]   And I think an affiliate program would really
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.420]   be good for everybody, including Apple.
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:08.860]   Wow.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.860]   Wouldn't it be great if you could buy tickets?
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.260]   And I don't see that capability built in.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:18.060]   It's Apple in this whole announcement.
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.860]   And some of this stuff is really great.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.060]   I mean, I'm really thrilled about the new touches
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:22.780]   and the nano.
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.260]   But I have to wonder if Apple's showing a little bit
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:26.620]   of lack of backbone here.
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:27.260]   They're not--
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.900]   Ping could be a very aggressive shot
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:30.980]   across the bow and face.
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:32.700]   But Apple doesn't traditionally do anything really
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:33.300]   that aggressive.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.860]   I mean, they evolve quickly.
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:36.380]   They don't need to.
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.100]   They evolve quickly, but they don't jump out there.
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.460]   There's that whole saying that if you're a one step ahead,
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:41.980]   you're a leader.
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:43.940]   And if you're two steps ahead, you're a martyr.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.260]   And I think they live by that.
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.380]   Hey, what do you-- yeah, I mean, the iPhone was a major--
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.140]   But we all knew it was coming in when it was released.
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.500]   We complained that there were no apps.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.260]   Like, where do we now?
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.420]   Yeah, a good point.
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:41:00.180]   And they slowly gave us what we were clamoring for.
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:04.140]   And they had to have thought of that before they had released it.
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.300]   I'm still downloading.
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.700]   This is a large download, the Epic Castle.
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.500]   But we'll give you a little demo of it
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.540]   as soon as I get it in on my iPad.
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:15.340]   It's still-- it's got to take a while, I think.
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.780]   It's not even really moving very fast.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:18.260]   It's big.
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.780]   It's got grandkids.
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:20.780]   It's got motion capture.
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:22.860]   He said motion capture.
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:25.500]   You're listening to a kind of a special edition of Mac
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:26.020]   Break Weekly.
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:29.940]   We've just come off of Apple's September 2010 announcement.
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.980]   Did not hear-- some of the things we didn't hear
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:34.140]   that we had hoped to hear--
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.620]   a streaming music service.
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.820]   They bought Lala, but still no streaming music service.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:39.980]   No new iLife.
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.700]   There was a lot of speculation with that guitar.
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:45.380]   And maybe there'd be a GarageBand on iPad or iLife 2011.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.060]   In fact, some people were saying the guitar has six strings
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:48.940]   and four dots.
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.420]   It's 64-bit iLife.
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.740]   No.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.020]   We've heard a lot of rumors about that.
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.740]   Nothing happened there.
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.420]   I think though, the biggest disappointment
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:01.860]   is what Apple TV could have been but wasn't.
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:04.180]   We're going to talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.260]   Andy Inako is here via phone from Chicago.
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.380]   Thank you for joining us, Andy.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.340]   We're glad we could get you on.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:11.060]   Even if we don't see your shining face
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:14.060]   at Alex Lindsay in studio with me, Alex and Tom.
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:18.020]   And I did a live kind of simulcast with the Apple broadcast.
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:22.100]   And if you want to catch that, that's at twit.tv/specials.
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.660]   But before I go any further, I do want to mention our friends.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:25.500]   It's Squarespace.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.540]   It's the best way to make a website.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.180]   I know you might like iWeb, but I'll tell you what.
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.940]   iWeb is only going to get you so far.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.140]   And then what?
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.300]   With Squarespace, you've got a great-looking site.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.580]   As easy as iWeb, if not easier, that's
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:38.820]   compliant with web standards.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.620]   That gives you all the hosting you
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:42.860]   need much more capacity than something
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.020]   like mobile me, for instance.
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.660]   And a much more affordable price.
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:48.140]   And look at the other things you get.
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.980]   Complete social media integration, including Twitter,
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:53.540]   and Facebook, and Flickr, and LinkedIn, and Quick,
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.500]   and Pandora, and everything else.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.460]   The incredible Squarespace iPhone app.
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.100]   You can import your blog and export it, by the way.
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.540]   From movable type, WordPress, TypePad, and Bloggers.
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.420]   So you're never stuck.
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.580]   Great photo galleries and the templates.
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:08.340]   They're gorgeous.
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.620]   They start with gorgeous templates,
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.220]   but they're easy to modify with just point and click,
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:13.140]   drag, and drop.
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:15.820]   You don't have to be a designer to get a template or a site
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.900]   that looks like it was professionally designed.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.700]   And best of all, it looks like no other.
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.540]   Just take a look at some of the examples at squarespace.com
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:25.540]   of sites people have made.
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:28.620]   Every Squarespace site is unique, is yours, has your touch
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.700]   on it, because it's so easy to customize it
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.740]   and then make it look gorgeous.

[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.780]   squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:44.460]   And look, there's Jeff Kanata.
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:45.980]   His site is on Squarespace.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:49.780]   Kevin Rose has a great site on Squarespace.
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.260]   Sarah Lane is on Squarespace.
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.180]   Our own inside-twit blog is on Squarespace.
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:54.540]   We just love it.
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:54.540]   We just love it.

[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.300]   And we think the folks at Squarespace,
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:36.460]   they're a great sponsor.
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:38.060]   They've really been great for us.
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.100]   All right, time to break out the hankies.
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.180]   Because we're going to talk about Apple's hobby.
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:46.860]   It was the one more thing at this announcement.
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:50.340]   And it's interesting because they even the slide said,
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.020]   it's still a hobby.
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:56.220]   Well, did it say that it was something
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.900]   how he characterized the previous company to do it?
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.340]   It said it on the slide.
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.340]   It said--
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:05.300]   Well, no, I think he was the previous few years
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.940]   but because that was part of a litany of excuses
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:09.940]   or other explanations of the boundaries
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:10.940]   we recruited up.
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:13.820]   And people, if we designed it as a computer
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:14.900]   and people don't want a computer,
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:18.460]   it was based on an amateur hour content.
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.220]   People want professional streaming media.
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:26.860]   And we now think that storage is to computers today.
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:28.900]   What wires worked to computers five years ago.
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:30.620]   That there's something that should be deleted
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:31.900]   if possible.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:32.700]   All this sort of stuff.
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:33.740]   I don't understand.
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:36.780]   But when you put up a slide that says one more thing,
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:39.100]   and the thing is crossed out and it says hobby,
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:40.860]   of course it's a callback to the times
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:41.620]   he's called it a hobby.
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:45.020]   But it's also a little bit of a statement that don't get your hopes
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.780]   up too high here, kids.
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:49.580]   Yeah, we're still moving forward.
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.980]   But not as fast as you might want.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:51.620]   I don't know.
[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:52.140]   You're right.
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.580]   This is silly tea leaf reading.
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:58.100]   But I did think it was interesting that that word hobby
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.700]   was on the slide.
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:00.220]   It's like beta.
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:01.700]   It's Apple's version of beta.
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.700]   OK.
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:03.700]   Right.
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:04.620]   I don't think they've told them
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.380]   how many Apple TVs they've sold.
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:10.460]   So in January, when they're announcing their announcement,
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.300]   like a brand new version of the iPad,
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:15.500]   and part of the usual 10 minute pre-emble humble jumbo
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:17.580]   and can talk about the new International Spain
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.500]   and the nation Apple Store, they say.
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:25.780]   And in just four months, we sold over two million Apple TVs.
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:27.620]   Then we then you'll know something.
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:30.340]   If they don't, if they say it's but a successful watch,
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.660]   we're very proud of it.
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.820]   Anyway, about the Apple Store is Aurora, Illinois.
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:37.780]   Over 500 square feet.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:38.300]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:38.940]   Then that's the whole note.
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:39.660]   It's the hobby.
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.180]   Well, I have to say, I don't think it deserves to be more
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:42.580]   than a hobby.
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:43.820]   I'm very disappointed with--
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.060]   I mean, they did some very interesting things.
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.340]   I think OK.
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:50.340]   Well, first of all, let's just summarize what it is.
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.900]   It is A4 based, which means it's iOS based.
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.740]   They don't say anything about the operating system.
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.340]   They don't expose it in any way.
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.620]   It's very similar to the old Apple TV interface.
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:04.380]   There is a remote just like the old Apple TV.
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:07.740]   There doesn't seem to be any lip service to the Magic Track
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.100]   Pad or any of the other iOS devices.
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:10.980]   There's no storage.
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:12.820]   It's streaming only.
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:18.380]   Everything in HD 720P HD, Apple is going to turn off
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.180]   the buy feature in movies and television
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:25.420]   and let you rent TV shows for $0.99 and rent movies from $2.99
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:28.340]   to $4.99, depending on how current they are.
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:29.900]   He said, people don't want sinking.
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:31.060]   They don't want storage.
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.100]   They don't want a computer.
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.900]   They just want something that works.
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.980]   The good news is there is Netflix.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:37.980]   That's kind of a relief.
[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:40.340]   And it looks like there are still podcasts on here,
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:41.940]   although you'll have to stream them, not
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:44.220]   watch them from a download.
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:48.260]   You will be able to download movies and TV and podcasts
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:51.740]   onto your other iOS devices and play them on the new Apple TV.
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:55.700]   So I guess if you really want to watch this show after we
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:57.100]   record it or--
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:58.260]   I don't know what happens.
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:47:59.980]   I guess you could stream it from the download.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:02.180]   I'm not sure exactly what will happen to podcasts.
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:06.060]   It really is what Hollywood wanted, which is rentals only,
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:08.540]   no storage, no piracy problem.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.660]   Well, I really think this is a winner.
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:11.700]   I think this is a really--
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:12.180]   Really?
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:14.820]   I think this is a really smart update.
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:17.460]   It seems as though the simple thing they did is simply,
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:20.260]   someone put a Roku box on someone's desk and says,
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:21.660]   let's make one of these.
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:22.820]   People like these.
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.260]   People are buying these.
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.020]   So what features do we want to steal from it?
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:28.860]   Well, the first thing we want to steal is $99.
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:30.180]   We don't care about the other features.
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:32.060]   We want to make sure it is $99.
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.220]   No, good price dollars.
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:33.740]   Yeah.
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:36.380]   But that's definitely within the consumers.
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.020]   Oh, what the hell?
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.580]   Give it a try point.
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.980]   Especially when you consider that you don't have to sell
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:45.020]   somebody on the idea of Apple in order to get them to buy this.
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.940]   If all you tell them is that here is a cool box that plugs
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.140]   into your HDTV and lets you stream Netflix.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:53.060]   A lot of people will buy it for $99.
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.780]   They'll definitely buy it based on that.
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:56.980]   And when you tell them that, if you also
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:00.580]   have a copy of iTunes, it'll go two ways.
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:02.940]   You can have-- it will find any iTunes library
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.980]   with shared content anywhere on the network and play it
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:06.220]   through your HDTV.
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:07.780]   You can also be sitting on your sofa
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:11.220]   and decide that you want to play this video content from the device
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.460]   you have in your hands through your HDTV.
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:14.380]   That'll work great, too.
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:15.980]   And then you add Flickr, then you add YouTube,
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:17.700]   and you add a little extra copies.
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:20.940]   But as a $99 box, it gives you access to Netflix.
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:24.660]   And also 99 cent TV shows, I think they've already got a winner.
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:26.500]   I think it's their game to lose.
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:27.940]   I don't think I kill Brooklyn.
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:30.700]   I'm saying that if this is not a successful product,
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:33.580]   that's not a failure on the design and the pricing, I think.
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:35.500]   Well, of course, Roku has its channel store,
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:39.780]   which gives you a lot more content, including Amazon rentals
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:43.460]   and podcasts and downloads from the major networks and so forth.
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:46.300]   And with ultimate mention that just yesterday,
[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.540]   they issued a press release and I was
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:49.420]   going to price drops on a lot of their hardware.
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:51.940]   In fact, their price now for the top Roku box
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:54.820]   is exactly the same as Apple TV's $99.
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:58.980]   And if all you want is Netflix streaming,
[00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:00.780]   you can do that for about $3 now.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:05.420]   I thought that was the last hammer, the last nail in the box.
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:08.340]   It told me that, OK, everybody really thinks that Apple TV
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.620]   is definitely happening on Wednesday.
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:11.580]   That could have been a coincidence.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.420]   One thing missing from the back of the Apple TV
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:17.500]   is component out, which is the analog kind of hole
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.540]   that the Roku does offer.
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:22.540]   Alex was showing his USB--
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:26.980]   This little black magic recording, video recorder,
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:28.780]   that you can connect to that.
[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:30.780]   That's what the industry would like to get rid of,
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:33.580]   is the availability of some kind of analog output.
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.900]   There's only HDMI and optical audio out there.
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:37.380]   There is a USB connector on the back.
[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:38.980]   Nobody talked about what that's for.
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:40.460]   It says service and support.
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:41.700]   So it's just like the US--
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:42.340]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:42.860]   Jailbreaking.
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:44.740]   Jailbreaking, yeah.
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:45.740]   Service and support.
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:46.860]   No power brick.
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:49.100]   It's silent, of course, because there's no fan in it.
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:51.820]   Doesn't need to be.
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:54.580]   I mean, it's an interesting product, certainly
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:55.940]   an improvement on Apple TV.
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:51:00.220]   But it's not going to be something that Boxy Box or Plex
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:04.660]   or Roku has to worry about.
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.460]   I will say, I can't wait until someone digs in.
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:08.900]   For those of you who are out there developing,
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:11.460]   I can't wait until you dig in and jailbreak this bad boy.
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.180]   And just make it an iPhone that--
[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:14.700]   It'll be jailbroken, broken, I'm sure.
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:15.860]   Fairly, quite.
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:18.580]   I just want to let you all know that we'll promote it heavily.
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:20.740]   The point is that Google is going
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:21.980]   to do--
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:23.860]   and Andy, we talked about this last week.
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:26.380]   Google's going to be out here with Sony and Logitech
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:29.140]   and other players, Dish, with a Google TV that
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:32.980]   is Android-- an Android device that does support the App Store.
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:38.060]   Is it a mistake for Apple not to put apps on this, Andy?
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:38.900]   Well, no.
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:42.140]   It wasn't a mistake for them not to put apps on the iPhone,
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:42.500]   either.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.460]   And that seemed to do OK.
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:46.220]   I do think that they're good.
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:48.300]   One of the questions that should be in all our minds is,
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:52.220]   they're obviously going to be using the standard iOS application
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:54.900]   tools to get more features onto the device,
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.220]   whether that's going to be something
[00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:58.300]   that anybody can add features to,
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.420]   or whether that's just a way that when HBO does not
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:02.580]   need to want to add a $10 per month subscription
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:06.180]   model to the Apple TV, whether that's just a well.
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:09.100]   If you internally write this special application,
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:11.660]   we at the Apple Store will sign it and allow
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:13.220]   you to put it on the device.
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.820]   That's what we're going to be talking about.
[00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:17.780]   I think it comes down to their commitment to that statement.
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:20.420]   They said that they believe that consumers don't want
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.540]   a computer port into their TV.
[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:24.860]   They want an entertainment device.
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:27.340]   And that then, be able to run arbitrary software,
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:30.380]   does not qualify that as a consumer video device.
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.420]   No, you could put Pandora on a Roku box.
[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:34.540]   You could put so much on a Roku box,
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:36.780]   and you cannot do it on this new Apple TV.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.300]   I think that's a big mistake.
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:40.620]   And I will say, no matter how disappointed I am,
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:42.340]   because I'm very disappointed.
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:44.500]   I just keep on looking back at the iPhone
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.660]   and going, oh, I can't believe they want to put applications.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:48.860]   What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what.
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:50.340]   You know, and just made you insane. It made me insane.
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:54.020]   So you think that it's possible that they will open up the iOS
[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:57.220]   on this, make it, they had, but they, what my question is,
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.180]   if that's their plan, why didn't they do it right away?
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:01.380]   It doesn't sound like that's their plan.
[00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:03.260]   You know, what they typically do is they give you
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:04.900]   something simple, and then they slowly allow you
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:05.740]   to make it more complex.
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:07.380]   Why? Because it gets more, you know,
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:09.060]   it keeps it everybody's in a safe space,
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:10.140]   and then we're just going to give another.
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:10.980]   Doesn't scare any.
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:11.820]   Another little safe space.
[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:13.780]   So you don't have a lot of people going, oh, this doesn't work.
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:15.140]   I don't understand why this isn't, you know,
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:17.460]   I got lost in my interface and, you know, that kind of thing.
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.540]   They're going to get used to one interface,
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.060]   and then we'll add a little something else to it.
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:21.420]   You know, that tends to be their pattern.
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:22.780]   Right.
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:25.780]   Even though we want it now, I would like it now.
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:28.300]   I think, I think that the problem is that the world
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:29.980]   is moving pretty quickly right now.
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:32.060]   And you've got, you know, Samsung made a big announcement
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:37.140]   yesterday about apps on their TVs, as Google TV is imminent.
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:38.620]   I think the world's moving very quickly,
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:40.940]   and by Apple not, Apple had an opportunity,
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:42.660]   I think to put a stake in the sand and put a stake
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:44.540]   in the heart of all of these other products,
[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:47.380]   had they been a little more functional.
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:48.220]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:50.620]   No, I think that this is, I do think it's a big miss.
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:52.700]   I mean, I think I can see whether they're trying to keep it
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:53.820]   simple and trying to move it forward,
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.700]   but I think that they, this could end this conversation real
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.740]   quick or let everybody give everybody a little time
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:00.900]   to, you know, to catch up.
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.380]   Mm-hmm.
[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:04.660]   So Andy, you think this is the right product
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:05.620]   or the right time?
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:08.700]   I think it's a necessary step.
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:09.980]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:11.940]   I think that they sort of saw the bus
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:13.500]   during the pull away from them,
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.340]   if they didn't do something to make sure that they
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:17.420]   get control of people's TV screens,
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:19.700]   then some, but those, that would present a good opportunity
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:20.500]   for somebody else.
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:22.180]   I don't think it would have been an opportunity for Google
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:25.420]   because Google is not good at that sort of stuff,
[00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:28.140]   but it certainly, Boxy, certainly somebody else.
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.540]   Yeah, but you don't want to bet on a company
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:30.540]   fumbling something.
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:32.140]   Exactly.
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:35.180]   Well, but see, but a company like Boxy could be doing things
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:40.060]   that if a studio, if, if, remember that the only,
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:42.180]   Apple only got two different networks to sign on
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.340]   to these TV show rental.
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:46.900]   They had Murdoch and Disney, and that's it.
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:48.100]   And that's it.
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:50.460]   And if, imagine that if--
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.420]   Murdoch is Fox, I should say, just so.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:53.260]   Exactly.
[00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:54.820]   Imagine if the other networks,
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:56.500]   and even some of the premium cable networks,
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.140]   decided to go to Boxy and saying,
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:01.540]   number one, we are interested in helping you develop
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:04.100]   a Boxy box for consumers.
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:07.380]   Number two, we seem to feel as though we are in a
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:09.460]   negotiating division of considerable strength.
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:11.420]   Are you willing to adapt to what we think
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:12.780]   of this Boxy to be?
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:15.820]   I do think that that, that the company like Boxy would say,
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:17.540]   yes, they're HBO should deserve.
[00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:20.420]   We can sell HBO through our devices.
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:22.500]   We will more certainly put in whatever controls
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:25.020]   and software limitations you want to put in here.
[00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:26.940]   So that's what Apple's dealing with right now
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:27.940]   in terms of limitations.
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:31.780]   I think that, I mean, I'm racking my brain
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:36.300]   trying to think of, is it a technical issue?
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:39.980]   Is it a rights issue, or is it merely,
[00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:41.420]   I have to think it's this last one,
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:43.540]   merely that Apple didn't want to move too fast.
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:47.020]   How do you mean, like, what, what, what,
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:47.780]   but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but,
[00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:50.500]   Alex is saying, which is they didn't want to scare anybody.
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.700]   Including the industry.
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:53.020]   You know, that, that wants to have the whole thing.
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:54.620]   I think the industry would hate this idea.
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:56.020]   I think the only people who would hate,
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:57.180]   and we talked about this last week,
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.340]   the only people who would hate
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:00.300]   an apps enabled Apple TV,
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:03.460]   you would, would it be, well, the, the bandwidth company.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:04.580]   Oh, right.
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:06.900]   I don't think the, yeah, the competitors wouldn't be too
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:09.340]   happy either, but I think Verizon
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:12.060]   and Comcast would be none too happy
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:13.340]   because they're disintermediated.
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:18.100]   The, the, a box that had a Fox app on it,
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:19.900]   and an HBO app on it,
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:22.100]   would put the cable companies
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.540]   in a very difficult position.
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:24.700]   You know, Apple, one thing people,
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:25.940]   a lot of people ask about what, you know,
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:27.940]   Apple is, keeps on accumulating
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:30.500]   an enormous amount of cash.
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:31.860]   You know, Apple is going to get to a point
[00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:33.700]   where if it wanted to buy one of these companies,
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:34.780]   they could.
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:36.220]   They don't want to buy one because they want to,
[00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:37.780]   they want to deal with it across the board.
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:40.500]   As soon as if Apple becomes Comcast,
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:41.740]   then it makes it very hard for them
[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:42.900]   to do a deal with Verizon.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.980]   Maybe, but all I have to say is how many Apple users
[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:47.780]   would switch over to an Apple-owned network?
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:51.020]   No, no, but we have to think about it.
[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:53.220]   You said, you know, clearly Apple lacks a spine to do that.
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:54.580]   They could have done that with Ping
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:56.700]   and said we want all you Facebook users
[00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:58.580]   to come on over and they didn't.
[00:56:58.580 --> 00:56:59.740]   They could have done it with it.
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:02.780]   Oh, God, that would have been the most
[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:06.340]   narcissistic, the most donkey-hody move ever to say that
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.180]   we're going to, we want to take over the traffic
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:10.740]   of the single most important and most popular site
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.180]   on the internet.
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:14.420]   You don't think Steve is capable of doing that?
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:16.700]   I think he's capable of doing it and not saying it.
[00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:19.100]   I think he's capable of thinking it
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:21.020]   and then realizing that no, that would be a move
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.540]   that would fail and I'd like to do moves
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:23.740]   that actually have a chance at the game.
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.700]   And let's not forget he does have a board of directors
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:27.380]   that he has to convince.
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:29.180]   And they may, he may well have said,
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:30.780]   we could beat Facebook and they may have said,
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.780]   you know, we're our dead bodies.
[00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:33.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:36.860]   So that's when the blow gun with a little guard
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:38.100]   that's always like the degree.
[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:39.060]   Ready to take him out.
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:40.580]   The first time it's taken out of its case
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:43.460]   from hitting space underneath the board room table.
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:44.780]   All right, well, here's the test.
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:46.540]   Let's ask the chat room.
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:48.220]   99 bucks available.
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:50.540]   When is the Apple TV available next week?
[00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:51.380]   Next month's.
[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:52.220]   You know what?
[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:55.060]   You can pre-order it this week as due
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:56.220]   at the end of the month.
[00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:57.540]   He says it's been four weeks.
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:58.380]   With it four weeks.
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:02.580]   How many of you chat room, we've got 1,000 people in there,
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:05.860]   are going to buy the new Apple TV based on what you've seen today?
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:11.580]   I haven't seen a yes yet.
[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:14.980]   One guy in the one guy in the audience, he's going to buy one.
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:16.380]   And a couple of yeses.
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.540]   But well, I mean, we're getting a few more now.
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:21.780]   Maybe maybe there maybe just took a while for the Apple people
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:23.420]   to figure out how to type.
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:26.380]   But oh, I was mean.
[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:29.260]   I would say it's actually a surprisingly large number of yeses.
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:30.740]   In fact, a number of people, how many of you
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:34.380]   have actually ordered it, a number of them have already ordered it.
[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:34.940]   Well, I think so.
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:38.580]   Including, by the way, Jeff Jarvis, who tweeted just a minute ago,
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:41.100]   that he's already ordered his.
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:44.340]   So I take I was wrong.
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:45.660]   I think this is enough.
[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:48.340]   I guess the real question is this enough of a product for you
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:50.340]   to order it, right?
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:53.220]   It's obviously not as everything we'd like it to be.
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:55.740]   Is it enough for you to get it?
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:57.940]   I'll tell you this.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.100]   I've been stuttling adding Roku boxes to my house
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:02.740]   over the past year and a half.
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:05.620]   And I think I bought my last one like six months ago
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:08.540]   for the last TV in the house that I bought regularly.
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:10.100]   Because I wanted one on every TV.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:12.100]   And if I had known the Apple TV, I existed.
[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:14.300]   Then it wouldn't have been a question about buying an Apple
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:15.500]   TV instead of a Roku.
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:17.460]   I use the Amazon on the Roku.
[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:18.900]   And I use a lot of the channel store stuff,
[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:20.260]   including our own channel.
[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:22.980]   So for that alone, I would continue
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:25.180]   to buy a Roku as opposed to an Apple TV.
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:27.540]   Well, for me, it's the integration into iTunes.
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:30.500]   And I know there's a channel that there's an external service
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.700]   you can use through the Roku that will let you connect
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:37.780]   to your iTunes streaming your local iTunes up to this company
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:41.180]   server over the internet and back down to your Roku box.
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:43.700]   But the ability to simply find another iTunes library
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:46.860]   somewhere on my network and just have access to it.
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:49.380]   If you lift me by music, because I'm doing house work,
[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:50.620]   would be the huge one for me.
[00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.300]   A lot of people are saying, oh, it's got the A4.
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:53.860]   But so you don't see any benefit to the A4
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:57.220]   until they make it an iOS box where you could put games
[00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:58.060]   or whatever on it.
[00:59:58.060 --> 00:59:59.580]   And I think there's an opportunity there
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.780]   to make it an iOS device.
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:02.900]   But I don't think they did it.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.900]   - Good heavens, I'm surprised there are people
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:07.100]   who are just putting on their ninja ropes
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.660]   and trying to repel into Koopa-Kinner right now
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.340]   to get the hardware to start the work.
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:12.540]   I still breaking this.
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:16.100]   So the idea of writing iOS apps that work on a TV said,
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:21.460]   oh God, I almost would buy another Apple TV
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.140]   just for jail breaking purposes.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:24.020]   Just for that.
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.260]   - Well, that's what I'm trying to do
[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:29.100]   is to force in my mind the expectation desire
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:32.140]   that this would have been a app based iOS device.
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:35.340]   Okay, let's say that such a thing never existed.
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.620]   Is this enough by itself?
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.740]   And even then there's Roku, there's other good choices
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:42.940]   that are more capable at the same or lower price point.
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.620]   I don't see this as a compelling product.
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:46.180]   - If I didn't already have a Roku,
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:50.460]   I'd be leaning towards the Apple TV.
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.780]   Now that I have a Roku, maybe.
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:54.260]   I'm not gonna be in Russia.
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:57.020]   I'll probably get one to test one because I'm on the show.
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.860]   - Yeah, but I'll get one just getting out of it.
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:00.860]   - But I'm not.
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.820]   - And by the way, I'm a very happy Apple TV user
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:04.100]   and have been since day one.
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:05.340]   - Mine's sitting around, it's gathering.
[01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:06.980]   - It's less, well, that's what happened.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.180]   And you admitted that happened to you too, Andy.
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:11.540]   So as the Roku came along, Apple TV was like,
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:13.900]   well, they were both hooked up when it started.
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:15.380]   - It's connected to nothing,
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:16.780]   it's been started closet right now.
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:19.980]   - Yeah, very interesting.
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:22.460]   And of course, now the other shoe's gonna drop.
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:24.020]   We're gonna see what Google TV looks like,
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.260]   whether it even comes out,
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:28.860]   whether Logitech, Sony and Dish can make a product
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:30.700]   and what it looks like.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:33.620]   It's an opportunity for Google,
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:36.580]   but perhaps Apple knows best.
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:43.540]   One final note, Apple did broadcast this live
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:45.940]   for the first time in years.
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.220]   Alex and I, Andy were trying to figure out
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.540]   when's the last time Apple streamed an event?
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.700]   Do you remember?
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:55.620]   - I believe it was 2002, 2003.
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:56.780]   - It's been a while.
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:59.940]   - I know that it was the event in which they introduced
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.740]   the mighty mouse, excuse me, the redesigned Apple mouse,
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:05.060]   like the first redesigned mouse up to the iMac,
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:08.220]   because that was the one time that I decided
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.100]   that there was in New York, it was in New York,
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.820]   and I overstayed a little bit,
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.260]   and I had enough time to either really race around
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:16.900]   and get out of the hotel in time to make a keynote,
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.780]   or I could just simply stay in bed
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:20.260]   and launch it live by streaming.
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:22.180]   And of course that's when I thought the keynote
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:23.940]   and then I'd buy all and everybody here
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.700]   gets the free mouse and like, oh, good.
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.540]   - Giga home, Liz Gaines on Giga home
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.460]   was trying to figure out when the last time was,
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:32.900]   and she says some of us vaguely remember
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:36.100]   a crappy 2004 era quick time video stream.
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.940]   - No, I think it was actually 2006,
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:40.580]   because we were doing Mac break,
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:42.340]   'cause I know it was before we did a,
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:43.620]   it was before a Mac break recording,
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:45.060]   I remember Justine and a couple of other folks
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.420]   were all sitting around and watching.
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:47.260]   - You're right.
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:48.940]   - And we watched it, so it can't be that long ago.
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:50.220]   - You're right, and we launched Mac break.
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.100]   - In 2006, so you're absolutely right.
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:53.020]   So it has to be 2000.
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.180]   So it hasn't been that long.
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:57.700]   And the speculation was, well, why Apple, why now?
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:59.860]   And of course, you know, some of us think,
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.900]   well, it's because Apple wanted to control the story
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:05.460]   with all the live bloggers and the people streaming themselves.
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.340]   Apple felt like, well, this is gonna get out.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:08.780]   We better do it ourselves.
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.540]   And then there were those of us who said,
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:13.660]   well, maybe Apple's testing out their HTTP streaming
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:16.260]   capabilities, in fact, that's how they did it.
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.300]   It wasn't available on any Windows device.
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:21.020]   You had to have an iOS three or four device
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:23.900]   or Snow Leopard and Safari.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.740]   You couldn't watch it on Windows at all.
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:29.020]   Interesting article in GigaOM,
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:31.780]   Liz Gaines says it appears to be,
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:35.500]   and she says, I have proof that Akamai streamed this,
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:39.380]   that did not come out of the new North Carolina data center.
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:42.180]   Still was that QuickTime HTTP streaming,
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:44.140]   but then Apple owns like 12% of Akamai.
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:46.020]   - Yeah, it makes sense that they would use Akamai
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:50.380]   if their North Carolina data center weren't yet online.
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:53.300]   So that's an interesting side note on this.
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:55.460]   We'll know more in a little bit.
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:57.700]   It was an adaptive HTTP streaming,
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:59.220]   is an adaptive bit rate technology
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.420]   that notes how well it's working on your system
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:02.900]   and will downgrade.
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:05.420]   Some people reported that they went to audio even.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:09.100]   - Which is pretty cool, by the way.
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:10.460]   You don't have to have the high, the hallway.
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:11.300]   - That's a cool way.
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:13.780]   - And the low bandwidth, you just have the stream.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.180]   - Right.
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:17.580]   - We noticed some, towards the end,
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:20.180]   as you said, Annie, when Lady Gaga came on,
[01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:23.940]   towards the end, we did notice some stuttering.
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:26.540]   - Yeah, I had a problem at the very end
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:29.900]   where it would stutter for a little while during Lady Gaga.
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.500]   I had three issues.
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.260]   The second issue came when he demonstrated
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:38.620]   the movie "Rentals" where it didn't simply freeze.
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.780]   It actually turned me back to the very brief start
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:41.620]   of the screen.
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.060]   I went from seeing him like,
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:45.100]   "Wompering the Apple TV remote."
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:46.380]   Excuse me, I'm rather sorry.
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:49.220]   I saw him going from about to reveal the actual device
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:51.740]   to suddenly seeing an empty auditorium
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:53.260]   with a few people sort of filing in.
[01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:55.340]   It started right from the start of the stream
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:58.100]   and then I had a recess in order to get back to where I was.
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:01.300]   And then at the very end, when the cold play started playing,
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.380]   that's when the thing just packed up completely
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:05.140]   where it just would not come back at all.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:06.220]   - And we didn't have that.
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:08.700]   - So it wasn't second and second and second.
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.780]   - That's the one, yeah.
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:14.820]   But that's all I should say, that's all via AT&T 3G on the iPad.
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:15.660]   - Wow.
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:18.620]   - And also, as we speak, I'm actually taking it
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:21.300]   to the screenshots that I took in progress
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:24.060]   and adding it to my live blog thing.
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:27.380]   The quality on the iPad ranged from what I would expect
[01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:29.420]   from the Netflix app.
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:32.060]   All the way down to no worse than what I would expect
[01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:33.700]   from the streaming webcast.
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:35.100]   It was a very impressive,
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:37.780]   except for the times when Lady Gaga came on,
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:39.540]   it was a very impressive performance.
[01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:42.700]   - I have to say, Liz might be wrong,
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:46.020]   I'm looking at the live visualization that Akamai offers.
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:50.500]   And in fact, right around when this broadcast,
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:51.900]   the Apple broadcast began,
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.660]   there really wasn't much of a peak.
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:55.300]   It's not much different from the day before.
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:57.100]   In fact, a little bit even lower than the day before.
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:00.420]   So I have to wonder if, in fact,
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.380]   either Akamai's not reporting the streams
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:05.460]   that they were providing Apple, which I wouldn't be surprised,
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:08.540]   or they didn't in fact do it at all.
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:10.660]   - It could have been a blend too.
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.580]   Yeah, that's right, it could be.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:16.260]   Final thoughts before we wrap up
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:19.220]   on this Apple announcement, Andy Inako?
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:25.380]   - I'm not terribly disappointed
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:27.540]   that I didn't go to attend the event live.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.580]   I would love to be there and, you know,
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:31.620]   that would have been a two-place at once.
[01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:35.100]   There wasn't that absolutely transformative
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:37.300]   star dust, moon dust, and peace on earth
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:39.420]   could wilt towards men that you would get
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:42.180]   from like the iPad launch, where you just walk up,
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:44.180]   the iPad launch and even the iPhone 4 launch,
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:47.300]   where they totally, we feel as though
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:50.020]   they totally changed their business in a material way.
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:51.580]   I think that what they did is they added
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:53.620]   a lot of really good incremental features
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.380]   to a lot of existing products.
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:59.460]   I think that the Apple TV is obviously a revolutionary
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:01.780]   upgrade, I mean, it is a brand new product,
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:03.980]   but I don't think that it is yet a product
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:07.620]   that consumers have been scrambling to get me,
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:08.540]   just no matter who makes it.
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:10.500]   I don't think consumers have been scrambling
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:13.220]   for a streaming network box for their TV.
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:15.220]   So for that reason, the impact of the Apple TV
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:18.020]   is gonna be seen six or seven or eight months off.
[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:20.540]   So a lot of good stuff to go through.
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:22.460]   There's gonna be a flurry of emails
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.500]   in several directions of later on tonight,
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:26.580]   and I can't wait to get something.
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:28.460]   I can't tell if some of this sort of stuff just to see,
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:30.220]   you know, again, how many fingers can you put
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:32.820]   on a 1.5-inch touchscreen?
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:34.220]   - That's still a two-particle thing.
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:36.900]   I don't think it's gonna be a good gaming platform.
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:38.500]   I'll put it that way.
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:42.180]   - One of our chatters, Web 3278 is reporting
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.980]   that he's put the Gold Master 4.1 on his 3G,
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:47.340]   and he says big improvement in performance.
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:49.100]   That's a good thing.
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.700]   We were at the point where we were telling people
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:55.380]   not to put iOS 4 on any device older than a 3GS.
[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:57.100]   So that's good news.
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.340]   Alex Lindsey, your final thoughts.
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:00.340]   - 24 to 13.
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:02.620]   - That's the over-under?
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:03.820]   - That's the football score.
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:06.180]   If you watch the game and they won 24 to 40,
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:07.580]   it wasn't 35 to zero.
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:08.420]   - I agree.
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:09.580]   - It wasn't 24 to 23.
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:11.660]   It wasn't close, but it was a strong performance,
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:14.180]   not a commanding performance.
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.780]   They definitely have very compelling products
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.260]   for the holiday season, and you know,
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:20.380]   it would have been great to see them,
[01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:22.740]   you know, use their passing game a little bit more,
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:26.580]   but they're a good solid running game to stay ahead.
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.300]   I mean, you know, it's coming up football season starting.
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:30.140]   - You're saying Apple's keeping their head down
[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:31.020]   and grinding out the yard.
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.100]   - I think they're running out the clock.
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:34.820]   You know, I think that they've gotten ahead,
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:36.300]   they're running out there.
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:37.180]   - I think that's a mistake,
[01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:39.580]   because I think the competition is coming up strong
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:40.620]   and they're in the--
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:42.100]   - I think they needed to stretch out the second area.
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:43.500]   - Google's an Apple's red zone.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.020]   I think there's a potential problem here.
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:46.940]   - I think we shall see.
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:48.300]   - I think they needed to stretch out the second area
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:49.140]   with some long throws.
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.980]   - I think Apple came to play.
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:52.020]   There's no question about it,
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:55.140]   and chose a conservative, fairly conservative point of view.
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:57.060]   I'm very excited about the new Nano.
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:59.700]   I think that that's gonna be a hell of a product.
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:02.020]   And certainly a flashy eye-catching product.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.740]   When you see somebody with that new Nano
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.940]   in the subway or on a bus or walking down the street,
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:07.780]   you're not gonna miss that.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:09.300]   - It's gonna be like when you had the first iPads
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.260]   where everyone asks you, "What do you think?
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:12.100]   "Can I touch it?"
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.460]   - Yeah, pretty amazing.
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:16.140]   I have to say, I'm disappointed that Apple
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:20.380]   did not go for the Hail Mary play with the Apple TV.
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:22.300]   I thought they had a real opportunity
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.780]   to not only go ahead,
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:27.620]   but really to take everybody else out of the game.
[01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:30.740]   And we'll see, it may be that they're gonna do that next year.
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:32.500]   - Maybe November, but it may be too late.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.700]   I think this is the time.
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:37.780]   If you wanted to take the ball out of the hands of Google
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:40.860]   and Samsung and Sony and all the other players,
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:42.220]   now is the time to do it.
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.460]   - I think they're still trying to figure out
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:45.300]   what consumers want.
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.060]   I think this is just their first big edit,
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:48.540]   their first big rewrite.
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:50.420]   So I don't think they're confident enough
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.580]   about what the Apple TV product should be
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.060]   to make that kind of a bold thing.
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:56.900]   The iPad was three, four, five, six years in development.
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:57.740]   - True.
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.860]   - In which case, they clearly saw the product,
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:02.300]   they need, they clearly saw the product they wanted.
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:05.060]   And also they had the advantage of seeing the success
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:08.100]   of netbooks in the marketplace to see here's how people
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:10.660]   are using computers that cost less than 500 bucks.
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:12.620]   Here's what they're expecting out of them.
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:14.140]   I just don't think they have that confidence level.
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:17.820]   You have to make that kind of a really generously bold
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:19.460]   and courageous gesture that you want.
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:21.100]   - Well, and I think they're betting a little bit
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:24.500]   that Google doesn't have what it takes to make it happen.
[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:25.380]   - I don't think we do.
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:28.260]   And I think that they may be right on that bet,
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:32.220]   but Google has a second life, a second chance at this point.
[01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:34.580]   So Epic Citadel has finally downloaded.
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:35.420]   Let's take a look.
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:37.780]   This is the iPad version.
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:39.620]   This is the Unreal Engine.
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:43.220]   This is merely a demo available in the iTunes Store now.
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:49.660]   Pretty already of the Epic port, which will be Project Sword
[01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:51.580]   sometime this fall.
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.820]   I guess I'll turn the audio up
[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:54.380]   just a little bit on this.
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.780]   Oh, it crashed immediately.
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:57.060]   - Well, thank you very much, everybody.
[01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:01.500]   And I hope you enjoyed that opening screen.
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.900]   (laughing)
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:04.740]   - I had a couple of these,
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:05.740]   one of these high performance ones
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:07.100]   that I have to restart my iPad.
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:10.300]   - I might have to restart to get the clear out some RAM.
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:11.620]   - Go away, go away.
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:16.860]   It's, and another crash.
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:17.700]   You can try restarting.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:19.660]   - So I'll restart and maybe next week.
[01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:20.500]   We'll get it.
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:21.340]   It is a beta.
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:22.180]   (laughing)
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:23.020]   - It is a test.
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:23.860]   It is a beta.
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:24.700]   (laughing)
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:25.860]   - Thanks everybody for joining us.
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:26.940]   Now you better get back to work
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:27.780]   'cause we've been spending a lot.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:28.620]   - What?
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:29.460]   - I haven't announced.
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:30.620]   - Oh, plug time.
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.460]   - I have a plug.
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:32.900]   - Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core, yes sir.
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.900]   - Here comes the plug.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:37.620]   So we are very excited about iOS apps
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:39.620]   and we decided we wanna start writing our own.
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:43.380]   And we're trying to find programmers and so on and so forth.
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:44.940]   We decided we just need to train some folks.
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:48.420]   And so we actually got the guys from Big Nerd Ranch
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.580]   to come up to Pixel Core and do a class.
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:51.420]   - Oh, how exciting.
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:52.900]   - Yeah, and so, and I think we're gonna--
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.220]   - Big Nerd Ranch is awesome.
[01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:56.940]   - It is the place to get trained for programming.
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:59.180]   - I have dreamed of going there for a week
[01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:02.100]   and just taking a vacation learning to program iOS.
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.100]   - And so this is an iOS class.
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:06.580]   It's going to be held at the Pixel Core in San Francisco.
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:08.420]   So it's unusual for them to come out.
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:11.900]   Aaron Hillegas is actually teaching,
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:13.540]   which is, he runs the place now.
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:15.140]   It doesn't teach as much anymore.
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:18.940]   And he is the master Wrangler at the Big Nerd Ranch.
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:19.780]   So Aaron Hillegas--
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:21.820]   - I have his book and he's the Coco guy.
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:22.740]   I'm really excited about it.
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:24.820]   - And so this is designed for people
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:25.820]   who haven't programmed before.
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:26.900]   It's designed to ramp you up.
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.380]   It's five days.
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:32.380]   It's a good price for this class and it is at Pixel Core
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:33.900]   and there's only 10 seats.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:34.740]   - What?
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:35.580]   - And so--
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:36.780]   - Sorry, he sold out probably.
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:39.860]   - Well yeah, well the thing is that some folks from here,
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:41.980]   I think Lisa's coming down and some folks from the Pixel Core--
[01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:44.020]   - CEO, this will be very interesting.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:45.100]   - She's gonna be writing your iPhone out.
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:46.540]   - She's gonna be writing iPhone apps.
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:47.380]   That's awesome.
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:48.300]   - So she's very good with numbers.
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:49.300]   I wouldn't put it past him.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:50.620]   - No, no, I totally think.
[01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:53.180]   And so the thing is that we're very excited.
[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:55.460]   And so we hope a couple of our listeners,
[01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:57.580]   a handful of our listeners, come join us.
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:58.420]   - That's great.
[01:12:58.420 --> 01:12:59.300]   How would they get involved?
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:00.220]   Go to Pixel Core.com.
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:03.100]   - Actually go to bignerandranch.com classes
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:04.940]   and you'll see, if you go to locations,
[01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:05.820]   you'll actually see Pixel Core.
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:07.020]   If you go to the schedule,
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:08.540]   there's only one available right now
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:11.980]   for the it's the commuter iOS class.
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:14.300]   And it actually says with Macbreak
[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.580]   down the available classes.
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:18.020]   So, and this is just really,
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:19.220]   we wanna build some Macbreak apps.
[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.060]   - Is there a video in it?
[01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:20.900]   Are you gonna show me?
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.580]   - Nope, no, it's a class.
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:24.420]   It's a, it's gonna be closed.
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:28.260]   - Yeah, so, but we really hope people come checking out
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:30.500]   and we think that it's gonna be the beginning of us
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:32.180]   doing a lot more iOS stuff.
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:33.020]   - That's exciting.
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:33.860]   - Next year.
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.300]   - Alex is at the pixelcorepixelcore.com.
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:37.340]   If you wanna join that guild of multimedia artists
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:38.980]   who are learning and working together,
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:41.260]   Pixel Core.tv for Alex's podcast,
[01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:43.740]   including Macbreak, weekly.
[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:45.300]   Alex, thank you for being here.
[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.780]   Oh, it's working now.
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:47.780]   It's working.
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:50.940]   Andy Inaco is with the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:53.260]   He's a website is Sagan.
[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:54.820]   - I'm just, I was saying I should give a plug
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:56.780]   for my parents in Chicago tonight.
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:59.100]   If you go to Chicagoapple.org,
[01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:00.940]   you'll find all the details in the meeting.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:03.540]   At seven o'clock, I'll be at 25 West covered.
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.860]   And obviously talking all about what we have just
[01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:07.780]   heard about a couple hours ago.
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:08.700]   So, it's open the public.
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:10.460]   I'll mean it's dropped by.
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:11.780]   Just to find my presence,
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.460]   to have to find the expense that was undertaken
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:14.300]   to bring me in here.
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:15.540]   (laughing)
[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:18.220]   C-W-O-B dot com is Andy's site
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.940]   and go see him speak tonight.
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:21.900]   This is pretty cool.
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:22.740]   You know what?
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:25.300]   It reminds me of Google Street View for the Middle Ages.
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:27.780]   (laughing)
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:29.540]   Look, we can wander around.
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:30.740]   I can go up there.
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:32.180]   - I wish Street View worked this way.
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:33.900]   - Street View should work this way.
[01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:35.980]   - Yeah, this is, it's quite beautiful.
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:37.180]   And you could tell it's the Unreal Engine.
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:38.220]   It really has that.
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:40.260]   It reminds me a lot of the original Unreal,
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:41.740]   to be honest with you.
[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:43.580]   That's why we go in the,
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:44.900]   - What's great is they've already figured out
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:46.940]   all the tricks that make all this kind of stuff work.
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:47.780]   - The UI stuff.
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:48.860]   - Well, not only the UI,
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:50.300]   but the rendering tricks that were required
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:51.980]   for the old computers,
[01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:53.620]   can be reapplied to these things to take.
[01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:54.460]   - Oh, I see what you're saying
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:55.780]   by reusing the engine, yeah.
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:58.140]   - Reusing parts of the engine in ways that you calculate it
[01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:02.620]   and ways that you cull faces that aren't displayed.
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:05.100]   There's, we had to deal with little computers
[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.900]   for so long that we've gotten good at it.
[01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:09.900]   - Wow, this is actually, I can't wait.
[01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:12.980]   This might be the game of the year.
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:14.580]   If they get this out,
[01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:15.420]   look at that.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:16.860]   - Well, imagine being also able to,
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:19.820]   imagine having a Google Sketchup exporter.
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:20.660]   - Right.
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:21.500]   - You could, you know, for architect,
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.300]   be able to, you know, put it into the Unreal Engine.
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:26.740]   Imagine, you know, pre-vis for firefighters,
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:27.660]   you know, being able to say,
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:29.660]   "Oh, show me everything and be able to have it on an iPad."
[01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:30.820]   There's a lot of opportunities
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.900]   once the Unreal Engine's there.
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:35.660]   - Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna get back to work.
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:37.340]   - But you might want to play with this for a little bit longer.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:39.260]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:40.780]   That break is broke.
[01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:43.360]   (upbeat music)
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.940]   (upbeat music)
[01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:48.520]   (upbeat music)
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:51.100]   (upbeat music)
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.680]   (upbeat music)
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.260]   (upbeat music)
