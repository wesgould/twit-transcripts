[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.120]   news from Apple.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.040]   There's a lot of news today.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.440]   And the biggest news is Alex Lindsay's back in studio with us.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.840]   We don't know how long ago we were here, but we're thrilled
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.360]   at it.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.680]   And Renee took-- he saw you were going to be here.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.120]   He left.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.720]   He's like, I don't want to--
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.920]   No, he wanted some time off.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.520]   It's a perfect time for him to do it.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.600]   We've got Laurie Gill here from Represent and I, more.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.760]   She's managing editor over there.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.920]   Hi, Laurie.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.880]   Hi, how's it going?
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.800]   It's great.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.760]   Always good to see you.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.760]   It's great to see Alex back.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.240]   I know.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.960]   It's good to see you too.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.960]   It's good to be back.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.360]   Laurie is your official replacement, Alex.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.280]   Very good.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.880]   But it's good to see you both in the same room.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.720]   I think we know that--
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.360]   You're not the same.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.320]   And of course, from Boston Public Radio, Andy.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.320]   And not Co is also here today.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.760]   Show of hands, how many of you installed Catalina?
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.360]   The public beta came out yesterday.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.520]   I had a choose between the iPad, the new version of iOS
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.480]   or the new version of Mac OS.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.160]   And I realized that I couldn't have both platforms failing
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.960]   at the same time.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.840]   Good thinking.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.200]   Good thinking.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.320]   Also, I was more excited about iPad OS.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.080]   Well, and that's the other one.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.920]   But you can't use Sidecar without Catalina.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.680]   So I don't know.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.440]   I know.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.560]   I know.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.680]   So I did my MacBook Air Catalina and I left my iMac Pro
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.600]   Mojave just for that very reason.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.840]   I don't want to be completely without.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.920]   But I did immediately upgrade my iPad to iOS 13,
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.720]   which also came out.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.120]   Public beta for both a month early.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.600]   Or at least--
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.920]   A few days early.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.640]   A lot earlier than we expected.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.840]   And my experience has been there pretty stable.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.480]   I haven't had any problems on Catalina on Mac OS.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.560]   In iOS 13, the only issues I've had is one app.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.240]   Asphalt 5 wouldn't run.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.360]   And that's just a game, so--
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.320]   Just a game, Andy.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.480]   Well, while he in a world with Pokemon Go
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.720]   and the new Harry Potter game, I think now we can say
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.160]   there are some games that are just a game in some places
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.560]   where I insist that you correct this problem immediately.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.600]   It's Asphalt 9, by the way, not 5.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.880]   Asphalt 9.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.480]   But I--
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.480]   It was so long ago.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.400]   5 was like 2015 or so.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.560]   So yeah, one of the things I like that is available on both
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.600]   is the new Find My, which feels like a truncated sentence.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.120]   Mine.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.280]   Find My.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.160]   And the reason is it's Find My Friends Plus, Find My iPhone
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.120]   Plus, Find My Mac.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.840]   It's kind of cool.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.960]   I can actually--
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.160]   I don't know how I can show you this.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.840]   And by the way, I'm running dark mode.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.920]   Did you do the dark mode yet?
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.680]   Of course.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.160]   Of course.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.680]   It's pretty dark.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.280]   First thing.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.520]   None darker.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.080]   That goes to 11 darkness.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.880]   So that's the map.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.000]   So that's devices.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.720]   That's like the old Find My Mac.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.600]   But there's a tab for people.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.080]   This is straight out of Harry Potter.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.760]   I could tap my son's name, and it shows me he's at work.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.840]   That's wild.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.520]   That is dangerous, I think.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.920]   Well, how is it different than the Find My Friends?
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.920]   It's completely as far as--
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.800]   It's combined.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.400]   There's some additional features, but they combined it.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   I don't--
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   And they're--
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.960]   So I never had Henry on Find My Friends.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.480]   In fact, one of the problems I had with Find My Friends
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.000]   is nobody would do it with me.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.880]   So it is picking up devices or contacts some other way.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.240]   I think they're in my family group.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.000]   So anybody who's in my family group,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.720]   I can see their location now.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.360]   Well, and--
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.360]   That's interesting.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.480]   In my family group, Find My Friends has it all.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.680]   But it's not combined with Find My iPhone.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.840]   I have to look and see.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.840]   Maybe I just-- because I stopped using Find My Friends
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.480]   because somebody would ever allow me to find it.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.200]   But maybe that's a new thing that they added.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.520]   I'll look on my iPhone, which has not been upgraded.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.800]   They do use a different technology.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.680]   Renee would actually be so great at telling you the details.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.760]   Different technology with the way they ping devices now
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.960]   through Find My-- it's battery saving,
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.760]   but also just kind of uses a better triangulator.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.400]   So I'm pretty sure that I'm guessing that your family probably
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.000]   was part of your Find My previously,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.840]   and you just didn't notice it because I think you still
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.680]   have to give permission to be tracked.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.640]   I'm looking on my phone.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.400]   They are.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.760]   No, Abby-- oh, no.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.240]   No, no.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.720]   OK.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.040]   This is interesting.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.240]   On Find My Friends on the iPhone on an upgraded--
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.120]   let me see.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.560]   Abby can see my location.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.280]   No, it's the same.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.800]   You're right.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.320]   It's the same.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.040]   I can't see her location, but she can see mine.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.320]   So the only person who allows me to see his location is my son.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.120]   What a nice guy.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.360]   Well, he does work at Twitch, so it's not much of a location.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.640]   He's like, oh, yeah, he's down the hall.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.600]   I guess if he weren't at work, I would know.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   You'd know.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.680]   If he called in sick, you'd know where
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.320]   if he was down at the beach or something.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.280]   So dark mode in iOS 13, that's nice.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.960]   And there's also an automatic version.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.920]   I think this is on Catalina, too, where you could say dark mode
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.560]   at night, light mode in the day.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.440]   I don't understand that completely.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.880]   Is it dark at your house at night and light in your house
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.880]   at the-- I guess it is.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.840]   I don't know.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.600]   I saw--
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.320]   It's dark at night and light during the day.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.320]   It is?
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.320]   OK, because I have the cholesterol and I have no idea.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.320]   And theoretically, have you tried the mouse?
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.320]   Oh, I should.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.320]   The accessibility?
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.600]   Can you get me a mouse?
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.560]   Yeah, I'd like to try that.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.400]   That was the thing I was the most excited about.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.760]   I haven't tested yet.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.160]   I tried some of the gestures.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.280]   And it's really hard to get the-- so you can now
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.840]   select text by dragging across, but they haven't turned off
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.600]   the old method of selecting text.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.880]   So that pops up.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.960]   Triple finger swipe for undo or pinch.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.480]   It's complicated.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.000]   Right.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.640]   They do do a pop up that shows you.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.600]   Is this a wired mouse?
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.960]   I need a wired mouse.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.000]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, I have it in my hands.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   A wired mouse.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.920]   And you have the US--
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.440]   I have it connected.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.880]   You see to--
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.360]   Yeah, I tried it.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.400]   It doesn't-- if you're expecting this to be a mouse support
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.800]   for the iPad--
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.600]   That's exactly what I'm expecting.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.880]   It's not that.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:55.200]   It's an accessibility feature that people who don't require
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.600]   this accessibility feature might enjoy using.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:06.280]   But it didn't feel like a mouse interface on the iPad
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.400]   the way that when you plug a mouse into an Android phone
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.320]   or an Android tablet, it feels like
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.480]   no, now you've got a mouse controlling your touch
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.320]   through the phone.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.480]   But it's better.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.840]   It's good.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.600]   I'm trying to fudge it.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.000]   I think we've had this conversation a couple of times
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.400]   that it's not called mouse support.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.200]   It's called pointer device support.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.080]   And that's specifically because Apple still
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.920]   has an implemented full mouse support.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.120]   Now it's called iPadOS.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.800]   But it does give you that precision click and drag
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.760]   that you can't really do with your fingers as well.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.760]   So I think it's a big deal that even that is supported
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.000]   just because before we were trying
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.960]   to use our fingers and our hobbit hands
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.600]   were struggling to grab things and move things.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.240]   And this precision pointer helps us kind of like even
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.680]   drawing things or something like that in the apps that
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.040]   will allow it, I think.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:00.640]   It's pretty cool.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.600]   So definitely it's a step in the right direction.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.800]   I think this is really kind of the next step in actually
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.680]   having full mouse support.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.400]   Apple, I think, decided they would sort of put it
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.080]   in the accessibility section because it is a really good
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.280]   benefit for people who can't afford separate accessibility
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.120]   devices for the pointers.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.760]   They can just use any mouse to do it.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.280]   So that's a really great sort of addition for them.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.120]   But it also kind of gives the public a chance
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.920]   to test out how that works and how it feels.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.520]   And then they can maybe move on from there.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.760]   So I have a feeling we're going to see mouse support soon,
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.600]   maybe in a year.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.000]   I agree.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   I agree.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.600]   It is a help for people.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.400]   Again, I've only used it for about 45 minutes.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.320]   But in that time, it made me realize that if that in the
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.000]   future, I will do text editing with a mouse connected to my
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.200]   iPad because it is better than not having a mouse at all.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.000]   I just want to make sure that if you read a commentary and
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.680]   say, oh, well, most support really stings.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.840]   They can't follow the cursor and doesn't really--
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.400]   well, it's not meant to be mouse support.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:08.160]   Like Laurie said, this is an accessibility feature that
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.520]   makes it more usable for people who are going to have
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.600]   problems using a touchscreen-only device.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.400]   But like she said, this is a good indication of how good
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.440]   the iPad could be if Apple were to embrace full mouse
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:20.680]   support.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.080]   And I'm sure that she's right and that Apple is watching
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.080]   very, very carefully to see how people are reacting to this.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.840]   So we're still looking for the setting.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.640]   It's not--
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.640]   I don't know.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.640]   Well, how about the file event?
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.880]   How about the file event?
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.840]   It's under accessibility.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.560]   And it should be touch--
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.160]   it's under the touch section.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.280]   And then you'll find touch devices, I think.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.040]   And then that's where it's called, pointering devices.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.520]   I don't have my iOS 13 device in front of me to hand take
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.080]   view of it.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.240]   It'd be nice if when you plugged in a mouse, it said, oh,
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.120]   that's crazy.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:54.600]   It is--
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.920]   OK, so there's a good reason it's under accessibility.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.520]   It isn't really a general mouse.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.320]   Files is great.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.280]   I already plugged a USB key into it.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.400]   It saw it.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:04.880]   It read it.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.960]   I was able to plug my camera card into it.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.520]   I mean, this is very nice.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.800]   That's a big improvement.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.880]   It's exactly what you would hope that files should have been
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.440]   on the iPad--
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.680]   let's say after the first year or the second year,
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.600]   because it is the hang-nail on the thumb of every single iPad
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.560]   user just dealing with files on this thing.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.880]   I didn't have time to really rock and roll with it
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.200]   to see how well it works with my SMB servers and stuff
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:32.840]   like that.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.680]   But just the fact that I've got my USB key,
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.040]   and I could just move files from one place to another on it,
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.600]   was like, OK.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.720]   Mr. iPad Pro, my iPad Pro, I know that you've been spending
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.320]   a lot of time docked in that shelf.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.680]   You're going to be going out of the house a lot more now,
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.120]   I think.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.120]   [SIGHS]
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.120]   We need to touch.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.680]   We've been looking for scooter access.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.880]   Settings, accessibility, touch under the physical and motor
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.480]   section.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.560]   Get them back and touch.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.520]   It's like you have a different--
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.600]   like your accessibility is just--
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.160]   Pretty sure that's iOS 13.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.600]   Because the biggest thing, and you see it immediately,
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.800]   is you can now swipe your notifications over
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.640]   onto the home screen.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.880]   The home screen grid is smaller icons, lots more icons on there.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.360]   And, in fact, let me show you this,
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.640]   because this is awesome.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.840]   Actually, you know what we can do?
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:34.040]   John, why don't you get the Apple TV up on your switcher?
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.360]   Because I can cast this to the living room,
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.920]   so we can show you what it looks like.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.120]   That'd probably be the best way of doing it.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.320]   Yeah, we can't find this.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.400]   But that is 13, right?
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.840]   Because it's dark.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.760]   It's dark, right.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.280]   Accessibility.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:49.760]   Oh, here it is.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.000]   Physical motor touch.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.760]   No, no, no.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.720]   We had gone too deep.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.600]   Assistive touch?
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.000]   Is that what it is?
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.840]   And then--
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.000]   Ah, pointing devices.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.280]   Pointing devices.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.280]   USB optical mouse.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.360]   So it's on there now.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.480]   Customize additional buttons.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.440]   So I could-- OK, I left click is a single tap.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.400]   OK, oh, so you actually have to manually custom.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.160]   Right click could be what a double tap?
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:17.960]   Yeah, let's do that.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.840]   All right.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.000]   I have a scroll wheel.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.160]   Can it see that?
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.520]   Yeah, it does.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.600]   I can make a click on the scroll wheel be pinch.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.040]   That'll be useful.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.360]   Anyway, so yeah, you can assign it commands.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.600]   But I don't know.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.880]   You don't see a mouse on the screen.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.840]   It's not like you have suddenly a mouse cursor.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.400]   Was it-- we said the settings, but we have to turn it on.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.520]   I think I turned it on.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.440]   Pointing devices.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.760]   USB optical mouse.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.240]   Connected.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:44.760]   It sees it.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.200]   I don't know.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.200]   Anyway.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.200]   You're not going to play with it anymore.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   Well, let me show this first.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.200]   Did you get the Apple TV up?
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   Because I just love this.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.880]   No, I'm not seeing anything coming up.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.120]   I'm just seeing a screen saver.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.040]   So let me go do screen mirroring.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.040]   Yeah, see what I can do.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.040]   Oh, there we go.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.040]   I see it.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.520]   So this is the new home screen, which I really like.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:15.240]   So you could see I've-- you get more icons on there.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.000]   But also now we get notifications.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.240]   You can-- in the notifications, you can pin two of them.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.800]   So I'll show you when I edit.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.800]   Keep on HomeScape.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.840]   Keep the today view on the Home screen next to your apps.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.000]   And then you can choose-- I've got weather and calendar pinned.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.600]   You can pin up to two of them.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.920]   But if there's two you like.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.920]   And those will always show up.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.520]   And then if you swipe up-- so there's my calendar and weather.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.240]   If you swipe up, you'll get whatever else you've put into your-- this is great.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.080]   So there is no longer a swipe left.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.000]   There's nothing over there anymore.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.840]   The today panel is there, always.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.880]   Your battery, all of the stuff that you want to have there.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.560]   I think that's a very nice feature, I think.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.760]   So much of this is just basic-- here's how the screen works.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.760]   It's a revolutionary thing where it's no longer like the iPhone.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:10.640]   It really is like a desktop metaphor where you're going to have a home page that is not
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.640]   just an app launcher.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.960]   It is kind of like home-based, the concierge for the rest of the device.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.000]   And you can also have additional workspaces that you can set up for whatever task that
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.960]   you've got going on at that moment.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.200]   So it's-- and you might-- for people who use pretty much every other operating system,
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.800]   including macOS, it might seem, oh, wow, you mean that I can do that same thing I've
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.720]   been doing for seven or eight years.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.920]   But it really is the sort of thing that makes you think of this as, hey, wow, I'm using
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.240]   an iPad for productivity and I'm actually getting away with it.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.700]   And I really did, like, over the course of just like a day, start thinking about my
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:48.920]   iPad as something that has parity with my MacBook and has-- and my ThinkPad and my Chromebook
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:54.040]   as something that I'm going to take to a work environment and just work for eight or nine
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.200]   hours on as opposed to aren't I clever.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.840]   I managed to find a way to do an entire day's work on an iPad.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.720]   I should point out my iPad battery is depleted pretty much more quickly, noticeably much
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.640]   more quickly than it did before I put iOS 13 on it.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.840]   That is one of the things Apple has yet to optimize.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.460]   And power optimization comes last, so don't worry about that if people are saying that.
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.660]   Yeah, but just be aware that's one of the things that you might--
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.660]   Right, right.
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.660]   --price you might be saying.
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.100]   This is one of the reasons why you maybe don't want to put it on something that's mission
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.100]   critical.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.660]   Can you show the-- there it is.
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.660]   That's what it looks like.
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:27.660]   There's the mouse.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.220]   Yep, I made it big, so it's--
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.820]   Well, that's what you probably want.
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:31.820]   And now you can--
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.780]   Can you click-- left click is a tap.
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.780]   Super.
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.740]   Hold on, let me-- you could change the tracking speed.
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.980]   Do you want to change the training?
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:38.980]   Yeah.
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:39.980]   Because it's almost impossible.
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.560]   Turn it all the way down.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.560]   OK.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.560]   That's too much.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.560]   And also notice that it's not an arrow pointer.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.880]   It is a circle with a point in the middle of it.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.960]   It is really for targeting a touch target.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.000]   So it's real purpose is very, very clear there.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.400]   Yeah, even the small cursor is fairly hefty.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.960]   You can change the color.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.960]   Nice.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.040]   That's really, again, accessibility feature for people with--
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.040]   Exactly.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.040]   --who are in line and things like that.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:09.960]   I think this is-- I mean, this is not my mouse supporter trackpad support, but I don't
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.460]   know, Alex.
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.260]   Are you going to like it?
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.260]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.260]   Alex likes it.
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.140]   I mean, the question is whether people will take advantage of it.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.780]   There are certain apps that obviously--
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:18.280]   Could use it.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.180]   --you could use it like numbers, omni-graph-ful.
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:27.220]   It's just one of the-- I use omni-graph-ful a lot to build wiring diagrams.
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:31.060]   And on the Mac, you need to-- especially when you're doing wired diagrams.
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.020]   There's a whole bunch of connections like this.
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.700]   And doing that with your finger and trying to get the right selection is--
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.220]   it's just not usable on the iPad.
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.220]   For complex pieces.
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.040]   It's better for Pete Kalk, probably, because some of those buttons are smaller.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.040]   Exactly.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.540]   And numbers I find hard to get in and out of the cells like pages and keynote, I actually
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.480]   build on the iPad without any trouble.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.520]   But with numbers, it's too hard to get to the cell options.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:02.320]   We should also mention that there isn't an easy way to go back once you go to iOS 13.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.760]   It's a big hassle going back.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:11.040]   So if anybody needs some advice on that, I wrote some articles on I'm more about how
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.040]   to downgrade.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:19.680]   But make sure that you archive your iOS system before you get the beta, not after, because
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.680]   it's too late.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.360]   So archive a backup of iOS 12.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.840]   And find it on I'm or you just do a Google search and ours will probably be the first
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.360]   to come up or at least one of the first to come up.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:34.240]   And a good reason not to go to Catalina, because iTunes has gone to Catalina.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.240]   So like I don't.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.880]   You have to do everything in Finder.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.360]   Yeah, I presume you could still do make an encrypted archive of your.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.360]   Yep, you can.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.600]   In fact, the only difference is that it's in Finder instead of iTunes.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.120]   Everything looks the same when you actually plug in your device and you go to your device
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.720]   settings in Finder.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.080]   It looks exactly the same.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.880]   So yeah, it's actually really easy and really intuitive.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.200]   It's just in a different place now.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.120]   I was a little over confident and I did not back up.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.200]   So don't screw it up Alex.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.600]   I'm going to get this back to you.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.600]   No, no, no, no.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.600]   That's fine.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.200]   I'll show you a couple other things.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:14.480]   You can now run more than one window of the same application.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.480]   That's fantastic.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:20.880]   The multi window section is mind blowing.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:26.480]   You can not just have two of the same at once, but you can have tabs of three different,
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.080]   four different, ten different things popped up and you can also have that with split screen
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.720]   with two of the same apps.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.720]   It's incredible.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:39.480]   I'm really into the multi tasking section with the multi tab windows app.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.640]   It's probably my favorite addition to iPadOS.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.720]   Show my screen again, John, and I can show you.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.360]   So I've got Safari open.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:51.600]   One of the things you get is this new thing where you have not only a sidebar, but you
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.160]   can have multiple sidebars open as you can see.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:02.960]   I can switch between those just like that, which is that's between iTunes and my photos
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.840]   album.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:11.640]   I can make one take over the whole screen, I think, as I remember by dragging it up.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.560]   That's one of the things I have a little trouble with getting, there we go, by dragging it up
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.000]   like that.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:25.040]   If I drag the dock up, I can then take Safari and make it a half of this page.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.040]   Let's see if I can do this.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.680]   I guess maybe it's just a question of getting used to it.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.680]   I don't know.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.000]   You definitely have to.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.720]   I just re-sprung it.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.080]   So you can show that.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:42.720]   That is the finder or the watch or re-springing, springboard's re-springing.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.400]   That happened a bunch of times.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.560]   I now have both a mouse pointer and a finger pointer.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:52.680]   So let me disconnect the mouse because that's making me nuts.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.160]   Yeah, I think that with some practice, what is that?
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.160]   Is that?
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.160]   That's a specific question.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.840]   So that was what was connected to the...
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.520]   You just have to disable SSD test to get rid of that little thing.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.640]   I'll leave it there for a little bit.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:14.240]   So now if I wanted to put another Safari, I would just drag that here and then it would
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.360]   be half of it or how do I get it?
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.640]   Yeah, there we go.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.640]   So there's another Safari.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:23.360]   And then look at that great little thing that's giving you the option to choose.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.480]   Which Safari page did you want to make?
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.480]   Oh, no.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.480]   I love that.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.480]   It's very sweet.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.960]   And I think I can do a third as I remember.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.880]   I can even have a little tab.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.880]   You can do a tab.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.880]   Let's see if I can do that again.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.880]   Just going to take practice.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:43.240]   We're not used to this so far, right?
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.000]   And unlike the last revision to how Slide Over and that stuff works, it really is worth
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   the practice.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Again, I really...
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.840]   Like everybody else, I have not had more than a few hours worth of experience with this.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.600]   I have less than others.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:01.120]   But just messing around with it, it was so easy to figure out how this...
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:06.040]   This is no longer a productivity problem that it was just a year ago.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:10.160]   The reason why I'm using a Chromebook for a lot of my "I just want something tablet-like"
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.800]   while I'm out of the office for a few hours was just this ability that I just need to
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.880]   keep a Twitter client on the side of the screen.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.800]   I don't even need multiple overlapping windows or I just need to have two web pages open
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.800]   at the same time that I can look at and reference from.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.400]   It's not only a solution to the problem, it's not just catching up.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.480]   It really is an elegant solution for dealing with multiple apps at the same time in one
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.960]   window without making one-third of your brainpower have to go to Windows management.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.200]   I really love this.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:44.680]   So you think it'll be as good as having a windowing operating system that it's sufficient?
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:50.800]   Within the context of what you're using a tablet for, that there are still laptops out
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.280]   there, there are still alternatives out there.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:59.440]   When I have an iPad as the device I'm taking out of the house, it's because I know I'm
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.240]   not going to need Mac OS.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.680]   I'm not going to need a desktop operating system with all the things you can do with
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.800]   like window workflows.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:11.400]   What I need is there's a task that I usually want to do one task at a time, but sometimes
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:17.800]   that task is enhanced by having another information from another app handy and visible without
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.480]   having to, because I don't have a mouse on this really, on this iPad, it was such a big
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.840]   deal to suddenly have to, I can't overlap two windows and just click into another window
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.840]   when I want it.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.560]   I will have to like tab between two different apps and I can't really see both at the same
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:32.560]   time.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:38.400]   But the ability to use a split screen in a really effective way and to be able to switch
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.360]   between what that second app is going to be really quickly and efficiently and make it
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.600]   not look like, hey, here's a trick-out feature that we've added, but this is a natural way
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.080]   of how the iPad OS lets you interact with applications.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.400]   I think that Apple has done an outstanding job on this.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.840]   It's not just, for me, it's not just this feature right here right now in the beta, but
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:03.680]   it's also an indication of what the next version of iPad OS is going to be when they
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.160]   see how people work with this, see what they like about it, what they're not using about
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.600]   it, and then use that to evolve it into the next iteration of it.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.920]   It really is and it was an exciting few hours that I spent yesterday with iPad OS because
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:23.200]   again, as much as I love my iPad, I've only been taking it out and putting it in my bag
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:29.040]   when there was something I wanted to do that day that was only really good to use an iPad
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:35.200]   for whereas now it's gotten me excited about keeping that thing charged all the time and
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.960]   getting back into the groove of using it.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.440]   Here's typing and swiping, so this is notepad.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.560]   They aren't doing a good job, I think, for discovery.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.760]   With popping up little things, so here's speed up your typing by sliding your finger across
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:49.840]   letters to compose a word.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.400]   This is the little floating keyboard which is wild.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:59.520]   It's an iPhone-sized keyboard and it could float around and if I start typing, this is
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.520]   swiping.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.640]   You'll see it does swiping, which is great.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.600]   It also has really surprisingly good dictation.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:12.120]   This is the kind of thing where you might take the keyboard, reduce it in size, float it
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.200]   around, start dictating.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.080]   This is pretty cool.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:21.400]   Now I don't know how to get out of this.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.200]   I'm sure there's a really easy way to do dictation.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.760]   That little button below the space bar I think gets you back to normal.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.920]   I'm dragging it around.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.080]   Maybe if I drag it up to the top or drag it down to the bottom.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.080]   Oh, there we go.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:39.400]   Now it's the full size keyboard and you get into it because there's a keyboard menu right
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.520]   here so you can choose floating right there.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.520]   That's interesting.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.520]   Let's play on it.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.760]   For all the kids who only know how to type with their thumbs, you just get it in the
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.760]   far corner right now.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.760]   This is a Therian typing.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.760]   It's bad.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.840]   There's also, I can just drag my finger to select text.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.840]   That's a big.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.840]   I really like that a lot.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.760]   I think it's very nice.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:09.560]   I have a really hard time with selecting text to copy.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:15.280]   I really like the way they changed that and made it a lot easier to work with.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.000]   You can also drag it once you've got this.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   It's easy to drag.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Sorry.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.600]   I also have trouble with the copy and paste, the pinching to zoom in and out.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.600]   I don't know.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.800]   I've just never been very good with any kind of three finger gesture.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.000]   I think I could get used to it.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.640]   I see myself just falling back on the way you can do it now, which is also still going
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.640]   to be in it.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.600]   It's not mandatory that you have to use the three finger.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:49.520]   I see myself just going back with the way they had been doing it before instead of teaching
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.800]   myself the three fingers.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.600]   It just never felt comfortable.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.880]   So I did it, but I did it.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.080]   It took me four times to do it.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:03.160]   I'm putting three fingers down and now I pinch to cut.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.480]   Yeah, that's picking it up in other words.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.480]   Okay.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.480]   I picked it up.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.480]   Now I'm going to select a different area and I'm going to unpinch and there it pasted
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.280]   and it pasted with the formatting, which is cool.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.080]   That's the Zach King pinch to.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.480]   I pick it up and throw it away.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.640]   I wish it were that kind of felt that intuitive.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.640]   Exactly.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.240]   This is like a joke where you have to explain the joke.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.680]   That means it was never really a joke to begin with.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.880]   It doesn't make me a nammer to actually start to learn this stuff because it's getting
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.880]   to be messy.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.480]   Fortunately, there's a very easy way to do it.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.480]   You haven't lost.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.480]   Exactly.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.200]   It's there for people who want to learn it.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.600]   People who don't want to learn it, it's not going to interfere.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.600]   You're right.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.960]   That's also available on iOS 13.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.680]   So your iPhone, you'll be able to do that on your iPhone 2.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.880]   The selecting of text thing, very nice on a small screen.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.880]   Oh, I bet.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.720]   That's an important point you just made, Lori, which is some of these features are iPad
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.440]   OS, like the multi-window features.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:07.880]   Some of them are iOS 13, like the cutting, pasting, swiping, swooping.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:13.960]   There's some things that you wouldn't think are available for iOS 13 for your phone that
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.960]   are.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:23.360]   If I remember correct, I think jump drive support, I think is available on iPhone.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.040]   There was one more that I was really surprised to find out.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.640]   I think it was also pointer support, so mouse support.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.720]   I think that one is also on iPhone.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.440]   I could be wrong.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.320]   Anybody out there is listening and can correct me on that.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.160]   But I remember being surprised by a couple of features is that I thought we're only going
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.000]   to be on iPad that ends up being supported on both, which is pretty cool.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.400]   Nice.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.200]   Any other features we should mention?
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.400]   I mean, there are a lot.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.800]   I think you should talk about Sidecar because it's a really cool feature.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   Okay.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.120]   I can't demo it because I don't have a Catalina Mac.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.240]   So tell me how that works.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.760]   It's sort of like mirroring.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:12.760]   So when you're on Catalina and you're on iPad OS or possibly, that's when I can't remember.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.160]   That one might be also iOS 13.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.120]   It wouldn't make sense on a phone because it's really a second screen feature.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.480]   I assume that it's iPad OS because I can't remember for sure.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.040]   So you've got your iPad on iPad OS 13.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.120]   You've got your Mac on Catalina and you're just working on your Mac and you suddenly
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.440]   decide, you know what?
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.200]   I need a second screen real quick.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:38.120]   You click on the mirror icon that you already have from mirroring to your Apple TV or something
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.280]   like that.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.960]   And instead of choosing Apple TV, you choose your iPad.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:42.960]   Bam.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.600]   You're using it as a second screen.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.960]   You can choose to either mirror or use it as a second screen.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:53.760]   And then you just can drag and drop just like you do on any monitor that has a second screen.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.280]   Move your chats over to your iPad or, you know, whatever, like a movie that you're watching
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.600]   anything you want, you can just drag it over to the second screen.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:08.480]   And with pencil support, there's a lot of apps that will support actual drawing on the
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.240]   iPad, even though it's a Mac app, which is pretty fascinating.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:17.920]   You got to see a demo of that at WDC.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.000]   And I haven't actually tried it yet, but I know what it looks like and it's pretty amazing.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.120]   Yeah, that's a game changer for me.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:31.400]   Particularly if they extend it to the phone as well, the ability to throw user interface
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.520]   elements onto the second device could be a game changer.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:40.920]   It's everything that I would have wanted the OLED bar, the touch bar on the new MacBooks
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.920]   to be.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.200]   It's like, don't give me like little like tic-tac like buttons.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:50.120]   Allow me to have like a scroll or control or allow me to have like a slider on an iPad
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.640]   or on a phone.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.360]   That could absolutely transform the way I use my Mac.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:31:00.400]   Well, and with a MacBook Air or a MacBook, having a second screen is the same size as
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.840]   the laptop screen means you've got a pretty decent setup with just an iPad in the one
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.040]   that you could draw with.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.960]   Yeah, I think that's very intriguing.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.080]   For photography, my MacBook Air probably by itself wouldn't be worth carrying around,
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.360]   but I love the iPad photography.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.400]   Maybe those two together would make a pretty good combination as a travel.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.200]   And I've been going through a bunch of tutorials recently and you just want another screen
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.200]   to watch the music.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.200]   Yes.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.720]   And it's not quite like I'm taking these Xcode little online classes.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.560]   And so the problem is is that the screen is just the video is just a little too big
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:36.120]   to have Xcode open and at the same time.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:40.240]   And you could have it without the sidecar, but it's nice to be able to cut and paste
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.440]   from the tutorial into your main computer.
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.440]   Well, and there's things you want to click on.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.080]   The problem is that there's a bunch of example files.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.440]   And so when I get to that on the web page, I need to be able to click on it and have
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.800]   it download to the Mac, not to the iPad.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:58.160]   And then I use AirPlay and hopefully AirPro for AirPro for AirPro for some time.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.160]   And I really like that.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.040]   And I've had a lot of friends that have used Duet with Photoshop and a lot of other tools
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.120]   for years.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:09.520]   And so I think this is going to be great, not great for Duet, but great for everybody else.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.800]   Still Duet's the only way to do it on Windows, although I did actually destroy my Windows
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.280]   10 machine when I said, oh, I should last week.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.960]   I said, or maybe it was two weeks ago, I said, oh, let me put this on Windows 10.
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.880]   And I had to rebuild the whole machine.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.480]   I did not know the hardware, but I just trashed Windows and I had to reinstall everything.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.360]   So be careful with Duet on Windows.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.920]   Not that I'm bitter or anything.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:33.920]   And then it's also--
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:34.920]   Go ahead.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:41.400]   It's also a really nice reward for being into the Apple ecosystem.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:45.000]   The idea that you have these two devices made by the same company, the company's made the
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.080]   same hardware, same company's made the operating system.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:54.320]   And it seems like such a simple thing for Apple to say, well, since we've given you--since
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.800]   you've purchased this really, really great display panel and it just happens to be inside
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.920]   an iPad, we'll let you use it as a display on your Mac.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:09.800]   That's why it's not so much lock-in on the Apple so much as it's a trade.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.800]   We're the same.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:15.840]   I'm going to give up some ability to switch to another platform for messages.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.000]   But if I have everything that has an Apple logo on it, they're going to find ways to
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.960]   let me use all of it in a really cool way.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:24.800]   Well, I have the Luna Dongle, which is a hardware dongle.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:30.000]   I don't know if this will Sherlock the Luna dongle because I use that as a--so I put
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.880]   the Luna on my Mac in my office and then I can use that Mac for my iPad anywhere in the
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.880]   building.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.680]   I don't think Sidecar will do that.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:41.960]   No, it only goes 30 meters, I think of us.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:47.960]   And it's really to second screen on the Mac, not so much the Mac screen on your iPad, which
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.960]   is what the Luna lets you.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:53.920]   But I can also see--I mean, really using this for professional artists, like for instance
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.920]   with the new--
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.920]   Yeah, you have a Cinci now.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.760]   --with the Mac Pro and the new Mac monitor that you're not--even if it was touch screen,
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.680]   you wouldn't want to touch it.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.600]   And now you can pop it up and that's your Cintiq that you can--your little Cintiq that
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.600]   you can draw on.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.000]   Actually, let's take a break.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.920]   We could talk about Catalina if you want.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.320]   More about iOS 13 if there's more to say.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.440]   We certainly want to talk about project catalyst apps.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.800]   I haven't been able to try any of those yet.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.200]   I don't even know if they're out yet, but I'd like to talk a little about those iOS apps
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.840]   on the Mac.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:25.080]   And then one thing I really wanted to talk to you when the Mac Pro came out, I wanted
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.720]   to get Alex Lindsay's take on that.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.720]   So you know what?
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.720]   Let's take a break.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.720]   And I'm excited to hear about that.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.920]   We got an actual pro in house.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.640]   What does he think about the new Mac Pro?
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.800]   It's great to have you.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.880]   Alex won't be here every week, but whenever you can, it's always great to have you.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.720]   And of course, now we have Laurie Gilles, so never come back, Alex.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.720]   This is lovely.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.720]   They almost won the money on the show.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.840]   We almost kicked Laurie out the show because of you, Alex.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.080]   No, I think it's great to have you.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.080]   That's why Renee, being a gentleman, he said, "Well, I won't be on."
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.920]   Well, this is up to you, Leo.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.920]   It's your call.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:05.640]   Can we call Alex the panelist emeritus, just like when they kicked Janah and Jack Janah
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.640]   out of the club in the zoo?
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:08.640]   So he still has an official title.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.640]   He's emeritus.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:13.400]   He's not really emeritus because he created the show in the first place.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.000]   So he does have kind of a pride of ownership.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.880]   But also, anytime you want to be on Alex is always welcome.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.520]   And I'm never getting rid of Laurie.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.520]   So there's there.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.520]   That's the way it is.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.520]   Period.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.520]   The end of the story.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.600]   It would be here, we were planning to do a five person panel, but Renee had some family
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.600]   obligations.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.760]   It worked out perfectly.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.120]   We're going to take a little break.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:37.080]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.560]   I love Rocket Mortgage.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.560]   They're back.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.160]   We kind of missed them for a few months.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.280]   Rocket Mortgage is from the folks at Quicken Loans.

[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.000]   This is the most expensive thing you'll ever buy, the biggest check you'll ever write.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.680]   It's great to have a partner like Rocket Mortgage.

[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.960]   origination.

[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.240]   Rocket Mortgage.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.360]   From Quicken Loans, I love their slogan.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.440]   It says it all.
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.880]   Push button.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.880]   Get mortgage with Rocket Mortgage.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:31.760]   Well, we're all sitting here a couple of weeks ago watching the WWDC keynote.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:37.360]   And I'm just thinking, man, Alex Lindsay must be so happy right now.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.680]   And actually I texted you and you said, yeah, it really is going to depend on how much I
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.400]   can get on a second mortgage on my house.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.760]   Because you knew even then this is not going to be cheap.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:54.200]   And I think that one of the things that we have to really think about is what does pro
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.200]   mean.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:02.320]   So when we say, and this is truly a pro piece of hardware, when we think about it as a personal
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.720]   item, like something I'm going to buy, it doesn't really add up a lot of the time.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.280]   I mean, that's a big piece of hardware.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:13.080]   But you have to remember, like when I was part of the time that I was at ILM, I was working
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:20.480]   on a octane, SGI back in the day, made these desktop computers called octanes and they
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.560]   were about $60,000 each.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:28.280]   And so now while most of my time was spent on a Mac, I did have a period of time and
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.800]   it was a very powerful computer.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   So I think that--
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.120]   Because it was tuned, it was designed to do that thing that you were doing.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.880]   It was designed to do high end graphics.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.080]   You know, it's really built for that.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:43.360]   And I think that this is squarely focused on one group of people.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:47.040]   There's been a lot of attention to price, especially the monitor price and my understand
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.040]   price.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.800]   I don't-- I agree with you.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.800]   It's a price--
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.800]   You've always said this.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.800]   For reference monitor, that is cheap.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:02.080]   So like for like the quality of if it does what they showed on stage, it is like half
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.080]   the cost of what we've spent on those kinds of monitors.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:09.720]   But even if it weren't, pros are spending-- this is-- it's worth it to them.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.840]   They're spending either money from the client, which is they don't care, or it's their business.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.720]   So this is what they need to spend to do their job.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.720]   And that's not--
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.160]   It's an ROI conversation.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.600]   So how long-- how much are you paying that person at the desk?
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.600]   How much are they producing?
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.800]   How much revenue are they generating?
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.960]   How much more would they generate with a faster computer?
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:25.960]   How much better work would they do?
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:30.440]   If you're paying somebody through 50 an hour, saving them half an hour saves big bucks.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:34.920]   You walk into some of these post houses and you're paying thousands of dollars an hour
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.680]   for that place.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:42.600]   And when you go in and pay $1,500 an hour, $2,000 an hour, you're going to expect a Mac
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.880]   Pro to be with a little light coming down on it.
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:50.640]   Because literally this is in, I believe, in Hollywood.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.880]   This is going to be one of those status symbols that you're going to put on there.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.880]   I think you're right.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.880]   You know that I'm-- you know that is-- because there's not really another version.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.480]   I think that's why they give it such a distinctive design too.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:03.400]   If you see one of the new Mac Pros in the wild, you'll know you're seeing a Mac Pro.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.880]   It looks like nothing else.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:11.760]   And I think that there was a lot of up and down about the stand.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:16.680]   The thing about stands is that I don't even know where 90% of my stands are.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.680]   You don't use them.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.680]   We don't use them.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.680]   I did bring that up.
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.480]   You take the stands off and get a Visa Mount.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.480]   No, Visa Mount.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.360]   Literally, the one thing I look at when I'm buying a monitor is does it have a Visa Mount?
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.000]   And if it has a Visa Mount, then we're set.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.520]   And usually those stands go somewhere.
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:34.840]   What was nice was that they created the stand that they thought would be perfect.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.080]   But they didn't bundle it.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.280]   But didn't bundle it because it's expensive.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.520]   And it created this whole market.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.520]   There's this massive market.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:45.840]   If I wanted to get into something, I would-- you know, the 300 and below for a stand for
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.360]   that monitor is going to be a lucrative market.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.360]   There'll be many.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.360]   There'll be many.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.160]   And they're going to be really cool designs.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.880]   And there're going to be all kinds of other things that you can do with it because they've
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.720]   opened that market up because they didn't have one.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.440]   So the real question, honestly, for me was not the price.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:07.000]   But what you thought of Apple's choices are the hardware.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.360]   In other words, did Apple listen to what you wanted?
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.360]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.360]   They made a rack mount.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.360]   No, they--
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.360]   No, you wanted that.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.360]   They made it rack mountable.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.360]   They made it modular.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.520]   They made it very scalable.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.440]   How about the Vega Pro cards?
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:24.840]   Well, I mean, so the-- I understand why Apple is not putting in video cards.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.680]   And I'm still bummed.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:32.320]   You know, like not having-- to me, at a professional graphics level, I still believe that Nvidia
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.320]   is superior.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:39.640]   And it's the way it manages the graphics chunks is just a much-- from a game perspective,
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:44.000]   may or may not be as efficient as what's done, you know, but with the Radeon cards
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.280]   but the Vega cards.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.800]   But for high end graphics, I believe that the Nvidia performs better.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.160]   The problem is that Nvidia wants to write the drivers.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.160]   And they both have valid cases for that.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:59.120]   And so I understand why they're doing that.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.600]   But I think that's what's stopping us.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:04.880]   That's what's been stopping us forever is that control.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:09.440]   So the fly and the ointment for the whole thing is that I can't put in video cards.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.040]   And I definitely would vastly prefer in video cards.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:17.880]   But I think that overall the design within that limitation, which is kind of to me an
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:21.680]   understood limitation, is that it's a very good thing.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:25.840]   It hit all the marks of what I was looking for.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:30.320]   And I think that Apple now, if you look at-- you could argue from the Mac Mini or even
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:34.800]   down to the Mini iPad as a little computing device all the way up to a-- we don't know
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:39.520]   how expensive, but probably as much as a pretty good car.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.520]   You know, range.
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.840]   Apple now probably has the widest range of solutions of any manufacturer.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:44.840]   Really?
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.080]   You know, if you think about it, I mean you got--
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.600]   That was one complaint is that, well, you've got this super high end.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.440]   But you also have a Mac Mini and you have the iPads.
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:56.120]   For a lot of people, Mac Mini, it'd be a great choice.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.480]   Mac Mini would be fine.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.600]   You know, and the new Mac Mini's are great.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.600]   They're not very expensive.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.040]   You've got the iMac Pro, which is kind of a higher end.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.040]   Exactly.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.720]   The iMac Pro takes you up to $15,000, loaded.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:11.400]   And it's different now because the old iMacs, you could only accelerate them so much, but
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:16.440]   with USB-- sorry, with lightning, you can put a lot of power--
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.440]   Thunderbolt 3.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.440]   Thunderbolt 3.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:19.440]   Thunderbolt 3.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.440]   Thunderbolt.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.440]   Thunderbolt lightning.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.440]   Very, very frightening.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.880]   But with Thunderbolt 3, you can externalize a lot of power as well.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:33.720]   So it's not your iMac Pro is-- can be very powerful.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:39.840]   This is-- basically, there's an overlap there of kind of a low end Mac Pro and a, you know,
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.160]   going up to whatever that allows you to do.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.920]   But the bottom line is with that kind of RAM.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.280]   I mean, there's-- for instance, there's a-- on my iMac, I don't have an iMac Pro.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:53.360]   On my iMac at home, there is a shot-- I shot an India, the square that I shot that I used
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.240]   for photogrammetry tests.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.840]   And I took 192 photos with a Canon.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:01.240]   So it's, you know, 24 megapixel, 192 photos.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.920]   And I throw it into photo scan.
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:05.240]   And photo scan will churn on that for four days.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.240]   Wow.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.360]   So when you're taught-- you know, and I'm clear that, you know, I'm dying to get a hold
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.280]   of a Mac, you know, to go to-- so I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro anytime soon on the
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.280]   money right now.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.280]   So I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.280]   And I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.280]   And I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.280]   And I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:37.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:43.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:31.280]   It's worth it.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:51.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:46:11.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:18.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:25.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:32.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:39.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:46.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:53.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:47:00.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:07.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:14.280]   I'm not going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.280]   I hope in sometime in the next year or two,
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:21.280]   we see a laptop that takes the same approach.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:28.280]   Right now, what we call a Mac Pro right now is a Mac Book Air Plus,
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.280]   in my opinion, as a graphics professional.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:34.280]   If I want something that really is going to be fast,
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.280]   I'm not buying them.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:41.280]   I definitely have fast processing laptops in their razor or somebody else.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.280]   They're not Alienware.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:49.280]   They're not Macs for that super high-powered process.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.280]   I'm hoping that Apple will take this as the,
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:56.280]   what if we had a beefy, heavy, lots of battery, lots of power,
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:59.280]   lots of graphics, laptop that professionals could go in.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.280]   Wouldn't hold my breath.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.280]   I can dream.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:04.280]   I dreamed about this thing for years.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.280]   I dreamed about this for years and it happened.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:18.280]   I think that it is the best, I mean, definitely the best desktop made.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.280]   No, I would agree with you.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:21.280]   I don't think there's anything.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:28.280]   I think that's where Apple should be focusing its efforts on the best of whatever area it's going to go into.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:32.280]   There's no reason for them to go into pretty good.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:37.280]   I also think this was Apple a little bit flexing its design and engineering muscles and saying,
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:42.280]   look, if we didn't put any constraints on our engineering team and our designs team,
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   if we just said, cost is no object.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:46.280]   We want to be modular and how cool.
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:47.280]   What would you do?
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.280]   Here's the requirements.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:53.280]   We've got all these, I mean, they hired professional videographers,
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:58.280]   artists, photographers to work at Apple to advise them on this.
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.280]   So I'm sure this team was saying, well, I mean, if you would be nice if you did this,
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.280]   it would be nice if you did this, it would be nice if you did that.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.280]   And they said, okay, we'll give you everything you ask for.
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:09.280]   And that's sure what this looks like, except for maybe Nvidia.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:14.280]   This is a very impressive piece of hardware.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:20.280]   And I think a lot of the people who are but hurt because there isn't a less expensive version of this.
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.280]   There isn't less expensive version.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.280]   It's called an IMAC Pro.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:25.280]   Yeah, but I mean, there's a lot of enthusiasts like me.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:30.280]   I would love to have this, but it's just out of my reach completely.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.280]   You know, I would love to have a Ferrari too.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.280]   Right, same thing.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.280]   Same thing.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.280]   Instead, I have a used...
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:39.280]   And Ferrari doesn't make it an inexpensive Ferrari.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.280]   No, they don't make it an expensive...
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.280]   Well, an Apple does.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:44.280]   That's a funny thing, is Apple makes it an expensive computer.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:48.280]   They make really inexpensive computers and they happen to make a really high-end one.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:52.280]   So this is more of a kind of almost a Chevrolet.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.280]   I don't think it's a good example.
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.280]   But it's having a...
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:01.280]   There's a wide range of Macs that you can get and they all run the same operating system.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:07.280]   And no matter how big you get, there's one that will take all the money out of your wallet.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:12.280]   And the display, did that check all the boxes for you?
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.280]   I mean, that display...
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.280]   I mean, it is...
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:18.280]   The display is amazing.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:25.280]   And definitely for the price, I know that sounds like an expensive display, but for what it's competing with, it is inexpensive.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:30.280]   To get a display, HDR display that has...
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:35.280]   I thought the XDR was a little much.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:40.280]   But 1600 nits is very bright.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:49.280]   What is considered kind of HDR, quote unquote, HDR screen nowadays is really 1000 nits.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:54.280]   So 1000 nits full sustained is very high.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:58.280]   There's not that many that are doing 1000 nits full sustained.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:04.280]   That's the HDR JJ Abrams and you had some specular highlights on a starship.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.280]   It would blind you.
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.280]   It would hurt.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:09.280]   It has to do with the brightness of every color.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.280]   So everything is going to look richer.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.280]   It's not just the bright one.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:18.280]   No, no, because the more nits it has, the greater contrast between black and white.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:21.280]   So now you're going to have the bright are really bright.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:28.280]   And the format, the PQ 2020 format goes to 10,000.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:31.280]   You know, gamut, I mean, the 10,000 nits.
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.280]   But almost, I don't think anyone makes a monitor the 10,000.
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:39.280]   I think that the monitor, the highest I've heard of is 4,000 nits.
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.280]   But 1000 is kind of considered that base.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:45.280]   It's not overall brightness that you're thinking about though.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.280]   Or is it?
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.280]   It's definitely not.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:50.280]   Well, Mike was saying it's not Rec 2020.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.280]   It's not Rec 2020.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.280]   It's P3.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.280]   But anyway, the--
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.280]   Should it be Rec 2020?
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.280]   That's the high end standard.
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:51:59.280]   This is good.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.280]   I mean, it's enough.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:02.280]   P3 is enough.
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:03.280]   P3 is what?
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.280]   You know, like it's--
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.280]   Rec 2020 is what movies are mixed to, right?
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.280]   Well, no, no, no.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.280]   Rec 2020 is just, it is the next HDR.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.280]   You know, it's the HDR format.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.280]   Okay.
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:16.280]   You know, and so there's, that's a much still a larger gamut.
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:24.280]   You know, P3 is a slightly smaller gamut inside of, you know, inside of that gamut.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.280]   And the Rec 2020 monitor would be--
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:28.280]   That's like, well, I mean--
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.280]   20,000.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:31.280]   Again, a lot of these get really expensive.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:35.280]   And so, I don't know exactly what the numbers are, but it's a--
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:39.280]   Anyway, it's a very, I mean, 6K.
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:44.280]   You know, that level of resolution, an accurate monitor, we think.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.280]   I mean, that's what they're--
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.280]   Well, if it happens--
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.280]   It's gonna be accurate.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:51.280]   If it is what they're proposing, you're talking about something that for a creative professional
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.280]   is the, you know, the best buyout.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:59.280]   More for a videographer than a photographer or a photographer would want this to.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.280]   Well, a photographer that's making a lot of money would definitely want that.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.280]   I think that it's probably a little overkill for a photographer.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.280]   If you're any lead with it, you want this monitor.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.280]   I mean, I think that--
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:11.280]   And you can afford it.
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.280]   You know, I think that the--
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:16.280]   If you can afford it, I mean, everybody who can afford it is gonna want this monitor and
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.280]   the stand.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.280]   But the--
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:20.280]   Is the stand really worth a thousand bucks?
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:24.280]   I mean, you made the excellent point, which is there will be third party.
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.280]   Yeah, I think that the stand--
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.280]   I presume that Apple hasn't done something that makes it impossible to make a third party stand.
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:30.280]   Well, they've built an V-amount adapter.
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:38.180]   So you would buy the V-
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:39.180]   So you could even--
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.180]   So you could even adapter and then--
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:41.180]   Well, I think some people are gonna probably--
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:43.180]   People are gonna be able to everything, right?
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:44.180]   Right.
[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:46.180]   And so I think that's gonna be--
[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:47.180]   That's gonna be fine.
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:49.180]   Anyway, but I think that--
[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:51.180]   You know, a lot of people are gonna want that monitor.
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:55.180]   I think that for photographers, it's gonna be better than what the iMac does.
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:58.180]   As far as the monitor goes, I don't know if it--
[00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:00.180]   I don't know if the ROI is there just by itself.
[00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:06.180]   If you're shooting with medium format, you know, some of the brand new, really large,
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:11.160]   like giant medium format and you're shooting in, you know, HDR and, you know, those files
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:15.160]   could get big enough where having that kind of ram that the Mac Pro has, you know, with
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:18.160]   that monitor would definitely make a difference.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:22.160]   But I definitely think that, you know, where you're gonna see this really take off is in
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:25.160]   the, you know, the really high-end professionals that are using--
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:31.160]   That want to use a Mac, but also want to do, you know, so the people who are using Maya and Cinema 4D
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:39.160]   and doing photogrammetry, doing LiDAR work, doing 8K video, 4K video, those types of
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:43.160]   things, compositing, you know, I think that those are all places where this Mac is gonna make,
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.160]   you know, it's gonna pay for itself.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:50.160]   And do most of these people pay the extra thousand bucks for the non-glare, the nano-textured glass?
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.160]   I would. Okay.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:56.160]   The biggest, the biggest frustration that you have when you get these monitors is the--
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.160]   You get these highlights and stuff like that.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:00.160]   And the problem has been is that it's been--
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.160]   Matt really put Matt and then--
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.160]   Kills the color.
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:04.160]   Right, exactly.
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:07.160]   And so what, you know, I mean, I would look at it before I ordered it.
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:12.160]   I would want to see the monitor next to the other one and make sure that it doesn't drive me crazy, like Matt does.
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:17.160]   But Matt is usually what we've done in the past because it was not as good, but it wasn't as, you know,
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:19.160]   the mirror reflection was definitely problematic.
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.160]   Larrus and issue, yeah.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:24.160]   It was Jim Dalrymple, wasn't it, Andy?
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:27.160]   I think it was, who did see these at the event.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.160]   And was really impressed and said, you saw it too, Lori.
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:32.160]   I don't know.
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.160]   Did you look at the standard versus nano-textured?
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.160]   What did you--
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.160]   I did.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:43.160]   Well, I think the Matt screen is incredible on this display.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:51.160]   I can tell the difference between them, but only just in that I can tell that one of them is Matt and one of them is not,
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:53.160]   but when it comes to--
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:55.160]   You know, I think we had talked about this before.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:56:00.160]   There's almost like a fuzz that goes across a Matt screen, and that does not happen on the screen at all.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.160]   It's beautiful.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:07.160]   In fact, if you don't see them, you can't tell at first.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:11.160]   Is that a Matt screen or is that a regular screen?
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.160]   You almost can't tell.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:18.160]   It's only when you see the other one that you go, "Okay, now I can see the difference between the two, the shine versus the Matt."
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.160]   Right.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:22.160]   Well, I'm not surprised.
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:25.160]   I thought Alex Lindsey would want one, but I want one.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.160]   I just wanted to make sure--
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:31.160]   And I admit that I'll probably wait until after the first version's out for a little while.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:41.160]   With any company, not just Apple, when they have a brand new piece of hardware that is a jump in form factor or a serious change,
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:44.160]   it almost always makes sense to just let it sit there for a little while.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:46.160]   I got the trash cam back right away.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.160]   I had it back.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.160]   It was terrible.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:51.160]   I did the same thing, and they never quite worked right.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:55.160]   There was two that worked great, and the first one I bought was like, "Never really."
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:56.160]   I said the first one back.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.160]   You had it back, they fixed it.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:00.160]   They crashed, and they fixed it, and then it never was perfect.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.160]   Exactly.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.160]   So I paid the price for that.
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:06.160]   The two that I bought a year after were fine.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:09.160]   The one I bought right when it came out was not fine.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.160]   Good advice.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:13.160]   Anybody on the panel know this, said where they're going to make this.
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:15.160]   Are they going to make it in Texas?
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:18.160]   I still don't know.
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:21.160]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.160]   Apple is making noises.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:27.160]   Foxconn is making noises about moving its production out of China because of the tariff situation.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:30.160]   It would make sense to move it out of China either way.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.160]   I mean, not move it all out of China, but it would make sense to diversify your...
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.160]   There's a whole bunch of...
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:36.160]   There's plenty of places you can make this.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:39.160]   There's a whole bunch of dangers to your entire business.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:45.160]   That when you have everything made in one city, there was a...
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:46.160]   A lot of us...
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:56.160]   Do you remember SR-HTCam SR, which was the 4, 4, 4 uncompressed on those big cameras that I used to have?
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:59.160]   So the death of that tape had nothing to do with the demand.
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:05.160]   Well, it had something to do with the demand, but it was because there were two big machines.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.160]   These are multi...
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:09.160]   Like tens of millions of dollars machines.
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:11.160]   And one was in Los Angeles and one was in...
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:12.160]   The connection manufacturers.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:14.160]   That could make the tapes, right?
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:18.160]   And so, like, there's two of them and they're kept one in LA and one in Japan.
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:25.160]   So they once a year just calibrate them, they'd take the LA one and they send it to Japan.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:31.160]   And so for about a week or two, the two of them would sit next to each other while they calibrated them together,
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.160]   and then it would go back to LA.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:39.160]   Well, that warehouse wasn't very far from where the earthquake was.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:43.160]   So when that happened, it flooded and destroyed...
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:44.160]   Both machines.
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:48.160]   It happened to be the one time they were both in the same place at the same time.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:52.160]   So suddenly, out of nowhere, there was no capability of making these tapes.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:56.160]   And what Sony had to do is look at, like, what is the future demand?
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:58.160]   Because there's all this digital stuff coming out.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:03.160]   And it didn't make sense to rebuild these multi-million dollar things.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:05.160]   And I was...
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.160]   I don't know, I'd thrown those tapes away a long time ago.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.160]   They were tapes, right?
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:13.160]   And they were selling them like $1,000 a tape.
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:18.160]   Because there's people doing sitcoms and the only thing that records them is those tapes.
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:23.160]   So there were people deleting old episodes and trying to figure it all out.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:26.160]   And so it was like mass chaos.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:33.160]   So anyway, so the moral of that story is having all your production in one place is a bad idea.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:36.160]   And Apple can make some in India, but...
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:44.160]   Also, the trade wars in China and also the increasing control of the government over what businesses can and can operate.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.160]   And now they can do their operations.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:49.160]   I don't think there's anybody who is thinking it's a good idea to pull out.
[00:59:49.160 --> 01:00:00.160]   But there's a good idea to have, why don't we encourage industrial manufacturing for our needs in India and in Taiwan and other places?
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.160]   Because there's might be...
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:09.160]   Let's cover our butts because in five years it might be a really, really bad idea to have all of our stuff being made in China.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:13.160]   And while Foxconn will say that they think that they should move to Taiwan, that would be a horrible idea, of course, for Apple.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.160]   That would create such a political nightmare.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.160]   Foxconn's a Taiwanese company, though.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:25.160]   They are, but moving it to Taiwan makes sense for the founder who is now running for office.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.160]   It makes a lot of sense to bring Apple to there.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.160]   But the financial...
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:39.160]   Obviously, as Andy just pointed out, China could very quickly tighten the screws on Apple if they suddenly saw a bunch of stuff going to Taiwan.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.160]   I think that it'd be more likely...
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.160]   I think that Apple could spread it out.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.160]   You just got a tiptoe around all this.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.160]   But...
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:50.160]   You know what, Tim Cook's probably the right man for the job.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:01:01.160]   According to a story in the Nikkei Asia Review, Apple is thinking about shifting from 50 to 30 percent of its production capacity to somewhere else in Southeast Asia.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.160]   I think that's very prudent.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.160]   Yeah.
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.160]   They have...
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.160]   Chips are Made in Taiwan by TSMC.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:11.160]   Samsung makes a lot of the memory in South Korea.
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.160]   So they already have...
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:19.160]   They're spread out pretty well already, but assembly happens in Shenzhen, China for most iPhones.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.160]   And yeah, I think they've experimented already.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:22.160]   Well, they've done some in India.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.160]   They've done some in Brazil, so it's not like they haven't...
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.160]   Right.
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.160]   Figured it out.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:29.160]   Yeah, Foxconn has facilities in both countries.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.160]   Alright, let's take a little break.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.160]   More to come in just a bit.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.160]   Andy Inako is here from WGBH of Boston.
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:43.160]   Actually, there's a question in the chat room about what ship is behind you.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.160]   And you don't have to look right now, but well, you can if you want.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.160]   I will prepare that information.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:54.160]   When we return, we will find out what sailing vessel is a model in a case behind Andy.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.160]   There's a lot in the forum.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.160]   You've got in the IRC now, and you have to guess what it is.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.160]   Yeah, everybody gets what that ship is, and it will tell you.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:04.160]   It's the schooner, boaty, mikbokbok.
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:10.160]   Also with us, of course, the wonderful Lori Gill, managing editor at Imore.
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.160]   She's in the kitchen with Lori.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:15.160]   I have a cute dog up there.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:19.160]   Oh, yeah, look at that ceramic terrier or something.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.160]   And...
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.160]   It's typically like a boat and a bottle.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:29.160]   And Alex Lindsay making a triumphant return to the program.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.160]   At least a temporary visit.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.160]   It's always great to have you.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.160]   I'm going to say I brought to you by Keptera.
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:40.160]   Keptera is the leading free online resource to help you find the best software for your
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.160]   business.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.160]   Business software is one of those things that keeps...
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.160]   Let's just put it this way.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:50.160]   Keeps Internet Explorer 8 and Microsoft Windows XP alive.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.160]   So many people.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.160]   You wonder, yes, we do all the time.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.160]   Why are people still running XP?
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:03:02.160]   Because the software that Joey wrote, the niece of the controller 15 years ago wrote
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.160]   the program that we use.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:09.160]   It's the only way we know to keep track of our inventory and it requires Internet Explorer 8.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.160]   Because of that, yeah.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.160]   Well, let's look because there's lots better software out there.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.160]   Modern software.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:20.160]   Software that works better and is right for your business and the best way to find it.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.160]   Don't Google it.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.160]   Keptera.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.160]   Keptera is free.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.160]   It's a directory of all the best business software.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.160]   Thousands of products.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.160]   There are 700 categories.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:40.160]   The big names, CMS, email marketing, IT service, SEO workflow management, CRM.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:46.280]   But also direct line of business programs like Yoga Studio Management or Dog Grooming
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.280]   Software.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.280]   There it is.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.280]   Yoga Studio software.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.800]   And there's quite a bit of it as a matter of fact.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.320]   But then it goes the next step because it's got filters so you can narrow it down to how
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.720]   it works, whether it's a free trial, how many seats it supports.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:01.920]   Is it on site?
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.640]   Is it in the cloud?
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.640]   Narrow it down.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.640]   Pick the apps you want.
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:08.080]   You could put them side by side in a comparison chart.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.520]   But the best part of all.
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.560]   Look at Zen Planner for Yoga Studios.
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:12.560]   Of course.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.520]   Easy facility here.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.520]   Momo Yoga.
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.840]   See, I'd be tempted to use that.
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.280]   But before I do, I'm going to read.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:25.520]   Look, there's 19 reviews of Momo Yoga by people actually reviewing it.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:31.920]   Kaptera is approaching now 1 million real reviews from real users that's going to give
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.840]   you the best way to know if this software is right for you.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:39.600]   And there's a thousand new reviews every single day.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:43.280]   It is the best place to find the software you need.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:46.840]   Kaptera believes software makes the world a better place because software can help every
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:50.440]   business become a more efficient, effective version of yourself.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:55.880]   If you're looking for better software, first stop, last stop, the number one place.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.880]   Kaptera.com/macbreak.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.080]   C-A-P-T-E-W-R-A.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.800]   Kaptera.com/macbreak.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:08.240]   Finding software is complicated, but you can simplify it with Kaptera.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.560]   And it's free.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.560]   There's zookeeper software.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:13.560]   Okay.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.840]   Everything you need.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:19.200]   Kaptera is software selection simplified.
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.000]   Kaptera.com/macbreak.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.400]   Thank you for using that URL that lets him know you saw it on the show.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:29.120]   And thank you, Kaptera, for your support of Macbreak Weekly.
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.560]   Andy, what is that boat behind you?
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:36.360]   It is unlabeled, although it is a magnificent boat model.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:42.840]   There is an even better boat model right next to it, however, that I can point to...
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:43.840]   Oh, look at that.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.840]   What are you in?
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:45.840]   The schooner room?
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:50.960]   No, this is the library that I choose to podcast from.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.640]   My internet is back up and running is fine.
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.640]   I kind of like doing it from the...
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:06:02.760]   The library is overlooked like a man-made little bay where they used to manufacture boats.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:06.480]   And they would float them out into the harbor after they were regular.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:13.600]   So this boat over there is the Bark John Carver out of SIRS Port, Maine, presented the library
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:17.120]   by a Mr. Robert's Parsons, and it is quite...
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:21.520]   I thought that the one behind me was the USS Constitution, but that's not it.
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:25.960]   It looks like it's from the USS Constitution product line.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.960]   It's like the USS Constitution mini.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.600]   The mini constitution.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:35.880]   The one that they made instead of what the consumers actually asked for.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:40.640]   But I'm actually now curious and I will get that information for next week's show.
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.640]   That's okay.
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:42.640]   I just thought I asked.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.640]   No, no.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:47.080]   Again, there's so many pretty things and artifacts in this conference room that I kind of like
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.080]   now look at.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.080]   It's really great.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:53.560]   I swear, I think I'm six shows away from like offering library corporate sponsorships
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.560]   to members.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:55.560]   I know.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.560]   Hey, we'll be glad to plug them.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.560]   I don't...
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:58.560]   Anything they want.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:03.000]   Honestly, I think you've discovered the new place to make podcasts to your public library.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   I get...
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.600]   I get to get there next week.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.600]   Yeah.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:10.280]   I am actually thinking about saying, well, what if I've got a whole bunch of podcasting gear
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.880]   that like after I upgrade, I don't...
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:17.000]   What if I like to basically put it in a box and wrote like an instruction guide and...
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.960]   After assuring the library that I get first dibs on the room at all times.
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:21.960]   Of course.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:26.160]   That anybody who wants to do a podcast, here's the microphones, here's a stand, here's some
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.160]   lighting stuff.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.160]   Yeah, you could do it.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.160]   And here's a room.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.920]   Are you going out to a New England lorry?
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.920]   Sure.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:34.920]   Oh, okay.
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.520]   I got the impression you were going to be visiting.
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.360]   Okay, okay, good.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.760]   I think I was talking about just wanting to go podcast in a library so that I have better
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:44.760]   connections.
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:45.760]   How about Sacramento?
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:46.760]   They must have some.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.760]   I bet you have a Carnegie library.
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:49.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:54.760]   We have a great old Carnegie library in Petaluma, but it's no longer a library.
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.160]   It's now the Petaluma Museum.
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.160]   Right.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.160]   It's kind of a fun museum.
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.280]   There are a lot of events there, concerts there, and it's a beautiful...
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:05.800]   These Carnegie libraries at Andrew Carnegie built in an attempt to get into heaven after
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.360]   being a son of a...
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:10.320]   They're really gorgeous.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.880]   They're really nice.
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:15.200]   And many, many towns have Carnegie libraries now.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.200]   So numbers time.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.240]   I got a bunch of stories with numbers.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:24.480]   Starting with, Apple says its devices can now be repaired in 1000 plus Best Buy locations
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.800]   across the US.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.600]   So that actually is really good news.
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:35.640]   There were only 270 Apple stores in the US, but with 1000 Best Buy being official Apple
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:36.640]   repairs.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:37.640]   Great.
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.600]   We kind of experienced this here in Petaluma.
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:44.920]   There's a little hole in the wall, one of those iPhone repair places that all of a sudden
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.480]   became an Apple certified place.
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:50.880]   And we were told by Apple when we had iMacs to fix or whatever, oh yeah, just bring it
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:51.880]   to there.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:52.880]   So that counts.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.400]   That's like going to the Apple store.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.760]   So this is very, very good news.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:04.640]   7,600 newly Apple certified technicians, same day repairs on iPhones and other products.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.440]   This is Apple's, I guess, response to the right to repair movement.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.440]   Right.
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.440]   Well, all right, we're going to make more places you can make more places.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:15.440]   I hope it is.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.440]   Go ahead.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.840]   I just hope that it doesn't reflect Apple feeling as though now they're kind of free to
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:25.800]   restrict access to to to components to people who are not on their good list, let's say,
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:31.600]   because you need people who are also able to do repairs that are not condoned by Apple.
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:35.520]   And we're not talking about doing something, putting putting a phase converter inside
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:36.520]   the CPU.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.840]   We're talking about, oh gosh, I'm sorry.
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:42.560]   This motherboard is this logic board is way too water damaged for this.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:47.200]   Or, well, or I know, but perhaps this person who is willing to take a heat gun and try
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:51.680]   to reflow this reflow solder on something or do a cleaning job and get it back working
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:56.120]   again for $50, maybe this person should be allowed to try that if someone doesn't necessarily
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.800]   have $600 for a new logic board.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:00.800]   I agree.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.000]   Just don't put it in the test oven.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   Yep.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   Apple really is one of the main companies fighting these right to repair laws state by state.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.920]   And, you know, I think they should.
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.400]   I think we should have the right to repair it.
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.400]   It's our hardware.
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:22.120]   Apple is it'd be nice if they could make things a lot easier and having best buy as
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.640]   an option does help.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:29.160]   It certainly helps open up the opportunity for people who just don't have easy access
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.920]   to an Apple store.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:31.920]   Right.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:32.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:33.920]   Right.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.920]   And that's a lot of people.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.680]   Now there are 1,800 locations, third party repair locations in the US.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.040]   That's quite a quite a big improvement.
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.280]   Apple is the fourth largest gaming company.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.080]   What wait a minute?
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.920]   That's not up on everybody.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.440]   A new line of business for Apple.
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:54.040]   And remember, this is the fourth largest before Apple Arcade comes out.
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.040]   That's right.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.960]   That is one of the changes with iOS 13 that it took me a little while.
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:03.240]   I went to the app store on my iPad and I'm looking for the update button.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:07.680]   And where the update button is or was, there's an Apple Arcade button.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:12.120]   And all it says is coming soon, which is not exactly what I've been looking for.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:17.800]   But it turns out the update, you tap your picture in the profile and the right hand corner.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:23.120]   It actually has a little red dot saying how many apps you have to update.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:27.160]   The rise of mobile gaming and the operation of the app store helped the iPhone maker beat
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:33.440]   other gaming industry mainstays, including EA and Nintendo.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.000]   What?
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:42.600]   The top 35 public game companies generated get this $114 billion in revenue last year amongst
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:43.600]   them.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.520]   82% of the global revenue.
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:48.360]   Apple is said to have earned $2 billion from gaming.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.000]   It's not that they make games.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.440]   That's not what makes them a gaming company.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:57.680]   It's just the fact that games sold in the app store make them a lot of money.
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.680]   $2.09 billion.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.600]   Oh, wait a minute, that's the first quarter.
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:06.320]   More than $10 billion for all four quarters.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:10.800]   And this is, you know, Apple's very well positioned, you know, for a lot of this stuff.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.920]   My kids, I'm amazed at how much they play on Apple TV.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:17.160]   You know, like they're like, I'll look over at the TV and they're playing, I guess, the
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.800]   story mode in Minecraft.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:19.800]   Yeah, that's big.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.760]   Yeah, on the big screen and they're playing away on their, you know, with their little
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:24.760]   controller.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:25.760]   With the Air Play it over?
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:26.760]   No, no, they have it.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:31.360]   There is a, there's an Apple TV app.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.360]   Oh, on the Apple TV.
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.880]   And so there's an app and then they have a little controller that, you know, and they're
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.680]   sitting there just running away with it.
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:41.520]   And so it's, and anyway, it's, it's a, they're great platforms for this.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.200]   And I have to admit that they're not really pushing the platform very hard.
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.480]   Most of the games aren't.
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.880]   So there's still a lot, a lot of upward mobility.
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:51.440]   And I think that the, a lot of folks are going to have trouble getting squeezed between as
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:57.200]   we move forward, getting squeezed between the new Xbox, which is incredibly powerful.
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:59.440]   Scarlet, but not until the fall of next year.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:00.440]   Right.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:01.440]   So it's still coming out in a while.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:04.400]   But if you're thinking about what you're going to buy and start buying, that's true.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.400]   You got budget.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.400]   You got to think about it.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.400]   Yeah.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.400]   You got to think about like, am I going to buy?
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.960]   Like, so I think that consoles are going to have trouble with that.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:16.120]   And on the other side, you have mobile kind of really continuing to pick up speed.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.000]   Especially when you think about like the curation that comes from something like Apple Arcade,
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.760]   it really will cater to a niche group of people who want a particular type of sort
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.480]   of indie mobile gaming experience.
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:33.720]   If Apple does it right, this could really be a big deal for people who like the sort
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:41.680]   of atmospheric games with lots of beautiful imagery that have puzzle games or have deep
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.560]   stories or something like that.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:48.600]   You know, you're never going to get those sort of AAA games on mobile devices, even
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:54.360]   using with your Apple TV or your Mac, but you can get some really fancy indie games that
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:57.240]   are really explorative and fun to play.
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:02.880]   So I think this could be a big deal for Apple to grow in the industry by using this Apple
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.200]   Arcade in the future.
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.200]   I agree.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:09.240]   We, on iOS today, earlier today, Michael Sargent filled in for Megan Maroney.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:12.400]   We were doing the Apple Design Award winners for 2019.
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.680]   And there's a game on there that I just think is gorgeous called Elo, E-L-O-H.
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:18.280]   It's beautiful.
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.280]   It sounds great.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:23.160]   And it's not the kind of game I think you would see if the iPhone and our iPad didn't
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.160]   exist.
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:27.120]   I just don't think you'd see that anywhere else.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.840]   You look at it, you go, "Oh, that's definitely an iPad game."
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.880]   It's unique with both sound and imagery.
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.480]   And it's just gorgeous.
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.520]   It's really, really nice.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:42.360]   One thing that the cynical part of me has to mention in this is that now that we see
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:46.320]   exactly how much money Apple makes off of gaming, that's a really great success story,
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:50.680]   particularly given how they're not known for, they're known for being, "Oh, you want
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:51.680]   a gaming platform?"
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.280]   Then you do, "Oh, it wants something made by Apple."
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.240]   They're Mac games kind of stink.
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:02.600]   But it's something that we should probably keep an eye on as we figure out that gaming
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.640]   companies don't just simply sell a game and then take the money and pocket it and then
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.960]   hope you'll buy the next game.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:13.520]   One of the game that they sell you or they give you is a platform for introducing you
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.480]   to a brand new store of content and trying to get you to buy more content as you go and
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:19.880]   as you go and as you go.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:23.520]   So it's one of those things that I sort of want to keep an eye on of.
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:27.640]   Apple is really, really upset with Google and Facebook for taking your personal information
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:31.600]   and making money off of it for very, very good and logical reasons.
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.360]   But let's also mention that they don't make money off of that.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:39.000]   Let's make sure that Apple is also going to protect its users against vulture like game
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.360]   producers that are trying to increase game revenue.
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:47.760]   Let's see if they're willing to lose a lot of their own Apple's own incoming revenue
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:51.080]   from these games if it means that they're doing right by their people.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:58.840]   It'll be interesting to see how the price is distracting.
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:15:59.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.600]   It sounds like what do they call those?
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.600]   Those African thumpietas.
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:07.040]   Doesn't it sound like I'm in beer?
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.040]   In beer.
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.040]   That's it.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.040]   It's like you're making a little in beer.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:19.120]   You have to get these balls come out of here and you got to get them to go where you
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.120]   want them.
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.760]   Oh, I've seen the greatest minds of my life destroyed by generation.
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.560]   No, it's a good game.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:28.120]   It's a good game.
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.120]   Holy cow.
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:30.120]   I got it crazy.
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:36.360]   There we go.
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:38.760]   Isn't that fun?
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.840]   It's like little monkey heads.
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.480]   Alex, you might have to do the next entry.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.480]   Just be safe.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:44.480]   What?
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.480]   Hello?
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.840]   Anyway, that's that's you love.
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:54.200]   But it'll be interesting to see like how the pricing model works once you have a subscription
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.200]   model.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.640]   Like, is it going to be kind of all you can eat and you're just back to playing games?
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:16:59.640]   When does our cake come?
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:00.640]   When does our cake come?
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:01.640]   Having a kit, all that upgrades.
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:02.640]   What does that come out?
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.520]   I think they said sometimes this fall.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.720]   Is it going to be an iOS 13 thing?
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:08.560]   I guess that's why it's in the atmosphere.
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.080]   Most likely.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:13.760]   I have a feeling we're going to see them drop at the same time.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:18.400]   I can't imagine, especially when you see the beta and it says coming soon.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:22.520]   I have a feeling that as soon as it's available to the public, that's when we'll see it.
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:27.320]   They've kind of, I mean, obviously they've got to have developers write the games and
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.320]   this would like that.
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:32.200]   Elo game would be a perfect arcade because I don't know.
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:36.120]   They charge a few bucks, but it'd be nice if they probably make as much, but it would
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:37.560]   give you a chance to play it.
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:41.880]   A subscription model also, just what Netflix is starting to prove is that a subscription
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:46.200]   model also changes your expectations of the actual content.
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:49.680]   So there's a lot of things that you're happy to play as a subscription that you wouldn't
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:51.600]   necessarily be happy to pay for.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.360]   So if it's just part of the, so now you have a bunch of games that you can kind of lightly
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.760]   be interested in as opposed to games that you really feel like you have to get your
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:17:59.760]   money's worth.
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:03.520]   And that's what they found with that new Adam Sandler movie, for instance, with Netflix
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:04.520]   was.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.520]   Why did that get so many people watching that?
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:10.280]   They said that, you know, that a lot of it lines up with the fact that it's a, it's
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:13.280]   casual, like it's just something like a casual movie.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.280]   It was a casual movie.
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.520]   It was a totally casual movie.
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:18.800]   My wife, my wife keeps on saying, Hey, why don't we watch the Adam Sandler movie?
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.640]   And I'm kind of like murder mystery.
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:21.920]   You know, it's so funny.
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:25.640]   I came up, Lisa is very careful about not watching stuff I might want to watch.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.040]   So she watched it because I wasn't home.
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.840]   And it was, it was as dopey as it looks.
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.920]   My, my girl later wanted to watch it.
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:35.600]   I was like, how about we, how about we try Fouda?
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.280]   And she was like, what's Fouda?
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.600]   And it sounds painful.
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:39.920]   It's, by the way, it's great.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:40.920]   Okay.
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:41.920]   If you like homeland.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:42.920]   Love homeland.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:43.920]   Okay.
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:44.920]   So Fouda is homeland.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:49.200]   I can't say murder mystery is great, but it is apparently the most successful movie ever,
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.200]   ever made for Netflix.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:54.000]   Well, again, they, you know, and the thing is, is they have an enormous amount of data.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.560]   So Netflix has more data about how we watch films than anyone else in the world.
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:02.320]   And, and so what they figured out is how to build casual films.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:05.640]   You know, that I don't think a lot of people would have gone out to the movies to see this
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:06.640]   and probably almost nobody.
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:12.480]   So it'd be like, you know, opening weekend of $4.2 million, you know, and, and, but as a
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:20.040]   casual, you know, they know that, that Jennifer Aniston and, and, and Adam Sandler are popular
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.280]   in their group.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:25.240]   And they know that this kind of movie is popular in the group and combining those together,
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.800]   you know, just becomes just adding good pieces of recipe.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:28.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:36.320]   Also the people who were other of the absolute age demographic to make Adam Sandler a huge
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:44.120]   star for hit the movies that he made in the 90s and to make friends a huge hit are now
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:45.400]   20 years older.
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:46.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:49.240]   And they're in their 40s and they're staying home.
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:54.760]   And so when you see someone that says, Oh, wow, that, that Randy Adam Sandler fellers
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:56.520]   has a movie here.
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:01.120]   And, and this is exactly the sort of line that an older sister would use to put a younger
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.720]   brother in his place.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:06.200]   I know from once I speak saying, Oh, congratulations, Adam.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.640]   I heard about how successful the movie is.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.200]   You're a very big deal.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:13.800]   So long as people don't have to pay money to see the movie or even leave the house or
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:19.280]   the sofa and the service tells them specifically that you have a movie out.
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.280]   That's cool.
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.280]   Wow.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:22.280]   I'm impressed.
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.200]   13 million people watched it in one week.
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:28.960]   And this just will tell you everything.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:35.240]   Adam Sandler plays a cop, his wife of 15 years, Jennifer Aniston plays a hairdresser.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:39.360]   The pair turned out to be evenly matched because although he's a cop, he's not a very good
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.360]   one.
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:44.840]   And although she's a hairdresser, she's read a lot of mystery novels.
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.680]   This is a review from the national review.
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.200]   I'm really, I'm really confused.
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:49.400]   He's not in his street clothes.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.680]   I thought that he doesn't, he's not willing to sign a contract unless he's allowed to
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:57.120]   just either do it while he's on vacation or not change out of his cargo shorts, T-shirt
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:58.120]   and baseball.
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:59.120]   Okay.
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.120]   They shot it in Lake Como, Italy.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.120]   I think he was on vacation.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:02.120]   Okay.
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:06.480]   But he's going to know he still has his professional priorities.
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.240]   He's got his priorities.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:09.880]   We were talking numbers, more numbers.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:18.200]   Apple has held on to 40%, 47% market share, even though the premium smartphone market
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.920]   is hurting.
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:24.720]   Apple's global percentage of it is almost exactly half.
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.080]   Not bad, Apple.
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.080]   Not bad.
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:29.320]   That's during the March quarter.
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:32.480]   The iPhone shipments did bring down the segments overall performance.
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:37.520]   Samsung's more prominent, but nevertheless, iPhone still a significant amount of market
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:38.520]   share.
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:42.280]   That number three company there, that's called Huawei.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:46.520]   I expect that wedge to shrink quite a bit.
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:49.520]   Google and OnePlus 2%.
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:50.520]   So not bad.
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.720]   47% for Apple.
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:56.280]   That's not a, is that of revenue?
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:00.720]   Let me see if I can figure that out, or of units.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:01.720]   Revenue I bet, huh?
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:03.360]   For some reason I thought it was units.
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:04.360]   Gotta be revenue.
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.360]   Well, I don't know.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.360]   No, because premium.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:07.360]   I can't imagine the momentum.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.360]   Oh, okay.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.800]   But I can imagine the momentum moving more units than the steps on that.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:15.800]   I think that the problem for the premium market in general is that when you start spending
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:18.440]   that much money on a phone, you stop buying one every year.
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:21.400]   You know, like it is just like a, I don't want to buy a new phone.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.080]   I don't want to buy a new phone, exactly.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.080]   I know.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.120]   But if they put the right better features in than I have to.
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:27.120]   I have no choice.
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.120]   They make me do it.
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.120]   Exactly.
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.920]   Make me a cheese grater phone.
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:35.000]   That's called a red.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.440]   He has the cheese grater phone.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.440]   You don't want it.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.440]   You still have it.
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:39.440]   I'm still rocking the red.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.040]   I'm supposed to send one of them to Andy and I keep on.
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.640]   Here's the thing that's stopping me is I can't figure out how to make sure that I actually
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:48.680]   took the photos that the photos, I'll just send it to you because there's no secret
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:49.680]   photos on it.
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:51.960]   It's just that I was trying to make sure I backed them up, but I don't, the format is
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:52.960]   weird.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.800]   So I'm like, you know, I'm nothing but discreet.
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:58.240]   Yeah, that was the first time I actually held one for it.
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:01.760]   When Alex was in town, we had about dinner and hang on for a while.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:04.960]   First time I'd really had like more than like five minutes to hold on to one of these
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.960]   things.
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:13.160]   That is a really that that and that super industrial NFG style of aesthetic.
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.160]   I like that.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.160]   Yeah.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:16.160]   Yeah.
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.160]   It's just compelling.
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:18.720]   I want it's like those.
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:23.880]   It's like those police flashlights you can use either as a flashlight or you really
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:27.480]   could it's got like finger, you know, like you can really get a grip on it.
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:28.480]   You could really.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:33.320]   I was thinking of like remember like those old like 1940s, 1950s like movies where the
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:36.760]   movies where the phones from the other Bakelite and someone would be beating the death with
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.000]   a handset on a phone.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.240]   That's what reminded me with that.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:43.080]   Not that I will do that with this phone.
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:45.080]   Right.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.080]   Apple card.
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.400]   We don't know exactly when it's coming out, but we all want one.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.400]   Do we really?
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.280]   I don't want one.
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.280]   It's getting closer.
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:57.160]   The retail workers at Apple now are getting them.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:01.200]   So if you work in an Apple store, you might have one of those pretty pretty Apple cards
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:06.360]   made out of titanium.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:07.880]   I don't you.
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:08.880]   Why do you want one?
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:09.880]   It's just a credit card.
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:10.880]   It's more secure.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:11.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:12.880]   Is it?
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:13.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:14.880]   Okay.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:16.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:16.880]   Because you're not going to you're really not giving you a usable number to anybody.
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.640]   It's not more secure than Apple pay on your watch.
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:21.880]   No, no, but I'm saying if someone requires a credit card, they need a card, right?
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:26.280]   Which is I mean, I don't I don't use a credit card very often anymore, but but when I when
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:27.280]   I do, I'd like to have one.
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.280]   That's what this is really.
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:29.680]   There's no number on the card.
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:36.280]   So somebody if you pay for a restaurant meal, the waitron can't somehow steal your card,
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.280]   right?
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:39.880]   I mean, that's even if they got one when they put it in, it gets the number that number
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:40.880]   doesn't get your number.
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:41.880]   It's it's not eight.
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.680]   Well, there is no real number.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:44.680]   Right.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.080]   So actually, you know, for rest you're right.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:50.440]   It places I go where I need to use a physical card and it's going out of my position.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:51.440]   You're right.
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.240]   That probably a good thing that and it's just and that's the last place.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:57.240]   I mean, there's just a handful of places that I use a card anymore anyway, because usually
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:02.480]   I have to admit that if it doesn't take Apple pay, it's probably the other than a restaurant.
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:05.640]   It's pretty much the last time I'll come.
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.440]   Well, I'm not I'm not cash only.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:13.360]   I'm Apple cash like the funny thing now is I found that when you use your if you use like
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:18.200]   your ATM as the backup for your Apple cat for your Apple pay, then you never know what's
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:22.240]   going to happen like you put it up there and I might ask you for your ATM code or it might
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.640]   ask for a signature.
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:27.560]   There's all this BS that goes on with the every register is different.
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:30.520]   I found out the reason they asked for your ATM thing is because if they could give you
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:32.680]   cash back, they legally have to do that.
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:39.600]   I'm like, okay, well, I don't ask me for if I want cash back first, you know, and so anyway.
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:44.200]   So if you just transfer money from your credit card to your Apple pay Apple cash, so I just
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.360]   move big chunks of money into Apple cash.
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.360]   Really?
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:51.760]   Then I just put that on my watch and then it's like there's you never you never taken.
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:54.800]   Was never going to be no, there's never going to be any bill.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:58.400]   Well, there's never going to be me typing something out and there's never going to be
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:01.640]   signed something you literally walk away.
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:04.720]   You know, and it sends you an email what you spent and where you spent it and the data's
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.360]   better than what you were getting before.
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:11.280]   So it's it's you're actually thanks to intrepid cup reporter Lori Gill.
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:14.960]   We do know how much the Apple card weighs how much is it way?
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:19.360]   It's your scoop.
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:23.240]   It was was at 14.75 grams.
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:24.240]   That's correct.
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.240]   According.
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:29.120]   So you got an Apple employee who sent you a picture.
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:31.320]   Somebody that we work with.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:37.760]   Oh, I don't want to I don't want to cause a stir here.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:41.800]   But if people if you ask someone a question about how much something weighs and ounces
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:47.200]   and grams and they have a scale on them back in the way in those amounts, their follow
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:51.160]   up questions and perhaps your and tests that should be performed afterward.
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:56.480]   I do have to point out that the scale looks just like the stamps.com.
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:58.560]   You ask me scale.
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:01.400]   I don't know what that means.
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.440]   If they bake, yeah, so bake.
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:08.040]   So yeah, I have a grams, a gram scale in my house because of baking too.
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:09.440]   Yeah, me too.
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:11.320]   This one says .52 ounces.
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.480]   So Lori clearly did the conversion.
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:14.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.480]   That's so cool.
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:18.080]   I love the way this card looks.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:23.040]   It's so silly to make a big deal about a credit card, but I love that minimalist look
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:28.240]   that just sort of oh, also when I discovered that one of our readers had to point out to
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:30.440]   me that it's not embossed.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.240]   It's debossed.
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.600]   Wait a minute.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.520]   So, okay, it's not embossed.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.080]   Does it stick up?
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.080]   Right.
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.080]   It's sunken.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:43.600]   I had never heard the term debossed before.
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.360]   Convex perhaps.
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:49.040]   So it's all embossing, if you ask me.
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.280]   But okay, fine.
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:51.280]   It's debossed.
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:52.880]   I guess that's luxury.
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:58.200]   Do you know how much it costs to like emboss the entirety of the card except for the Apple
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:27:59.200]   logo?
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.200]   That is like menu.
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.200]   That's a good point.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:02.200]   That's blurry.
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:05.960]   The card is both M and D bossed.
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.960]   I am debossed.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:12.120]   At least that's what I tell myself.
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:16.240]   The card has an Apple logo on the front debossed.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:21.160]   The card holder's name is on the front in black lettering.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:24.320]   But Laurie says we've removed the name for privacy purposes.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:30.840]   Yeah, so basically right across from where that security chip is, that's where the person's
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:31.840]   name is.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:37.760]   And it's black with just like a tiny bit of like a goldish sort of.
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.840]   Now I do want one.
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:43.840]   Like background, background sort of accent to it.
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:51.600]   Yeah, it is pretty, but I really am getting impatient with Apple that I don't, I want
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:55.880]   to see them prove to me that they know how to use color.
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:57.280]   I'm not even really joking here.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:01.820]   It's like, oh, wow, look, another thing that is monochrome with absolutely no color and
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:04.480]   oh wow, it's gray on dark gray.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:10.600]   And now it makes me feel as though if I said, I've just bought the company for $80 trillion,
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:14.540]   I'm going to give you personally a $1 billion bonus.
[01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:20.360]   If you design me anything that has two bright colors in it and I'm wondering if they just
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:23.340]   they'll be caught out saying, all right, we have to admit it.
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:26.500]   We lied on a resume about understanding how color works.
[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:28.840]   We've finally been caught out after 14 years.
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:31.160]   It's just it gets a little bit boring.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.160]   Or source.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:42.020]   Maybe they'll put out some exclusive candy, matte candy color cards someday in the future.
[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:45.300]   Or maybe there's there'll be like a new like market for like cases.
[01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:49.740]   So if you really want to get the Apple card case.
[01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:51.740]   Oh my God.
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:55.260]   We got to shoot the ad for the only $49.95.
[01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:56.260]   Right.
[01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:58.460]   And of course it's pride month.
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:02.920]   So get the pride case.
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:10.500]   Your source who shall remain nameless said it took about a week to get his or her physical
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:15.000]   Apple card, but that the process to apply was very quick because Apple already knows
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000]   everything.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000]   Yeah.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000]   About a minute.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:25.680]   Apparently it takes just a minute because your your all of your your information is tied
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:26.680]   to your Apple ID.
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:30.860]   If you're using that same shipping and all that information, it's already there and you
[01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:35.660]   just have to add a couple little extra things or edit it if you need to.
[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:40.220]   And then you just hit the send button and then you get your response pretty fast.
[01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:41.460]   Your source.
[01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:42.900]   You don't have to have great credit.
[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:44.940]   Your source said she'd heard of somebody.
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:50.620]   We don't know who with only a credit rated between 600 and 700.
[01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:54.740]   That person was approved, but they had a limit of only $1,000 they could charge.
[01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:57.640]   That's not unusual with credit cards.
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:58.640]   Exactly.
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:01.220]   What I think is great about this.
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:05.120]   If you have no credit or if you have bad credit and you're trying to rebuild, which
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:10.640]   Apple is trying to position itself as we want to help you do better with credit.
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:15.880]   So if you start off by giving people with bad credit or no credit, the opportunity to
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:18.600]   start over, that's how you do it.
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:23.600]   You accept those people who have poor credit scores or no credit scores and you start them
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:28.520]   small and you help them build tools to be a good credit user in the future.
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.200]   So I love this idea.
[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:31.200]   It's not exclusive.
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:33.920]   It's not only for people with a 750 credit score.
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:38.600]   It's for people who have low credit scores and they're trying to do better.
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:45.400]   And with the app that comes with it that helps you track your budget and things like this,
[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:49.280]   this could actually help people get, you know, do better with their money.
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:55.640]   And I think that the nature of the way people pay bills too, it could be a lot easier with
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:57.280]   the whole Apple pay.
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:01.520]   You know, like when I want to add money to my Apple, my Apple cash, I literally just
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:05.040]   go into Apple, you know, the Apple pay and just go, I just want to move it from my ATM
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:08.120]   to my Apple cash and boom, I'm done.
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:11.640]   And this is one of those things where, you know, if you have to make a payment, it's
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:14.920]   going to be, I can imagine a notification popping up and then you being able to just
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:17.080]   take it out of some other account and pay it.
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.800]   You know, and just like, and make sure that it's sorted.
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:27.480]   And so definitely, you know, for me, fortunately for a long time, my wife is in all those things
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.480]   because I'm notorious.
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:32.160]   Did I know, did you do it, me having the money or not?
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:36.040]   It was literally just remembering to mail it or to look at it or to even open it or to
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:37.040]   go to the mailbox.
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:38.520]   All these things are very busy for me.
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:39.520]   Look at all these things.
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:42.280]   It's a little bit of a pretty, I don't do snail mail.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:43.280]   Honey, where are the bills?
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.760]   I think they're all in the mailbox.
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:48.200]   Yeah, there, yeah, where they've been for the last three weeks.
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:49.200]   Exactly.
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:50.200]   It's the dog ate them.
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.240]   The bigger the mailbox, the less often you have to go.
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:53.240]   Nice.
[01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:54.240]   I love it.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.040]   I literally haven't been to my post office box in six months.
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:59.480]   I dread what I would have found there.
[01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:02.760]   I'm just scared to death.
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:04.520]   Here's a nice feature of iOS 13.
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:06.360]   I don't know if this is the public beta.
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:09.640]   It's in beta two, the developer beta.
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:14.280]   It will use your iPhone microphone to adjust Apple TV audio.
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:17.640]   Oh my gosh, if it works, it's going to be so amazing.
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:19.120]   That's brilliant.
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:21.960]   It puts a little thing on your screen.
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:26.200]   It says Apple TV will use your iOS device to measure how long your television takes to
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.760]   play audio and video.
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:32.840]   That is always an issue because audio decompresses faster than video.
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:36.840]   Keeping it in sync is tough because frankly, most television doesn't have SIMTY codes or
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:38.160]   anything in there.
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:39.960]   There's no way to synchronize it.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.280]   This is a tough thing everywhere.
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:43.120]   I mean, we're delayed, right?
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:45.680]   Our audio is delayed here to some degree.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:49.080]   We are troubleshooting this thing all the time.
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:50.080]   Audio and video.
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:56.880]   To sync it on a, let's say, a broadcast truck level, there is a thing called...
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:00.600]   What a lot of us use to do this in broadcast is a thing called a validate.
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:01.600]   A validate is like...
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.320]   You can't even buy them anymore.
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:09.240]   There's a new company that makes one that does the same thing called Hitome.
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:15.280]   What it does is it plays this special video and it plays a special code of audio.
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.600]   Then on the receiving end, it'll tell you how many milliseconds you're off.
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:20.760]   Now the advantage that Apple has is they have two devices that are looking to each other.
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:22.760]   They own both ends of the conversation.
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:25.680]   The Apple TV knows exactly how to send that signal.
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:30.600]   You don't have to do anything.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:34.280]   This is the dialogue Apple TV will use your iOS device.
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:40.000]   It then plays tones from your speakers and says listening and then audio sync complete.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.500]   Wow!
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:44.080]   I almost want to get my sync out.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:49.240]   I wish we could do that with Skype.
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:51.320]   I hope that's dynamic too.
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:57.840]   If it's interactive and it can say, does that sound like about the right volume for you
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.840]   right now?
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:06.840]   There are so many shows that I watch where it'll be like, "Okay, now we're meeting here
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.640]   in this secret location because we're going to be discussing."
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:10.640]   Then commercial like, "Hey!
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:13.560]   The present is done!"
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:19.320]   It's like, "Could you dynamically keep the volume at the exact same level no matter
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:21.320]   what is playing?"
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:22.320]   Then I have that.
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:23.320]   I do.
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:24.320]   I switched me back to the Apple TV.
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:28.360]   I've heard of this thing called advertisements on TV.
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:30.840]   I haven't seen it.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:32.840]   My kids have barely seen it.
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:33.840]   They're dying of life.
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:34.840]   They barely seen one.
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:38.640]   And I know you're forced to watch Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston solve murders.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.280]   That's the only negative.
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.280]   It's weird.
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:44.560]   I know that the theory amongst advertisers is that if it's louder, you pay more attention
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:45.560]   to it.
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:50.400]   But it's gotten it long ago, got to the point where as soon as commercials come on, I mute
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.400]   it.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:56.360]   I'm not even going to play in the background just in case it's like, "Who's this?"
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:01.360]   The theory is that when the commercials come on, they're expecting you to walk into another
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:04.360]   room, like the kitchen or the bathroom or whatever.
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:07.720]   They're like, "Hey, you want to make sure you can still hear us as you walk into the
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:08.720]   other room?"
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.560]   "Hey, you in there making a sandwich!"
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:12.360]   That is the working theory.
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:14.880]   "How about some adult diapers?"
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:20.120]   And folks who are monotaskers who can actually sit there and watch the video the whole time,
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:21.120]   dinner or annoyed.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:22.120]   But there's not that many.
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:27.600]   And I know the irony and I apologize to any podcast listeners who had the volume set correctly
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:29.600]   for my normal voice.
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.600]   And I said, "Are you muttering?"
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:32.600]   And I did it all by himself.
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:33.600]   We call it compression.
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:36.000]   We fixed that with what we call compression.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.160]   We don't compress as much as we used to.
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:39.160]   I wish we did.
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.480]   We used to compress the hell out of these shows.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:42.480]   I know.
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:43.480]   I loved it that way.
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:44.480]   I do like it.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:45.480]   It's very radio.
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:47.040]   I can't even fix our editors to do it.
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:48.240]   It's not very NPR.
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:49.240]   Yeah.
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:52.880]   "There is a Mac OS gatekeeper vulnerability.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:57.400]   It was discovered by a security researcher last month and is now out in the wild."
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:05.480]   Apparently an adware company, according to a researcher, Felipe Cavallarin.
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:09.960]   This adware company is now exploiting it in Tigo.
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:11.760]   You've all heard of it in Tigo.
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:18.920]   They're a malware research team that discovered the first known uses of Cavallarin's vulnerability.
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:19.920]   And malware.
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:23.200]   So update, I guess.
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:27.440]   The malware is described as an Adobe Flash Player installer.
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:30.080]   Oh, man.
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.080]   That's not new.
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:35.360]   I've heard of other exploits taking that same route, Adobe installer.
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:36.360]   Oh, it's very popular.
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:39.120]   That's an easy way to get into it.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:40.520]   I had a great conversation.
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:46.360]   I was a hard conversation, but on the radio show, an 80-year-old woman called and said,
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:50.760]   "My Safari keeps crashing, so we did a little digging."
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:55.280]   She had something called Mac Search installed, and then we did a little more digging.
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:56.720]   She had another Mac malware.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.320]   There was a bunch of Apple malware.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:00.560]   You really can't get malware out of Mac.
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:05.000]   She said, "You know, my 16-year-old grandson uses this computer."
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.240]   I said, "Stop it.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.080]   Don't let him go give him his own."
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:09.480]   "Don't let him go give him his own."
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:10.480]   Well, that's what I said.
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:11.480]   Make your login for him.
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:12.920]   I guess it would be safe if he--
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:15.720]   It's pretty sandboxed to that point.
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:17.600]   Apple Watch is doing great.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:25.040]   According to CounterPoint Research, 22% uptick in 2018, thanks to Series 4, which was the
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:31.080]   best-selling model, even though it was available only for one quarter in 2018.
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:38.480]   Apple Watch easily tops everybody else, including all the rest combined, I might have.
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.240]   It is not even close.
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:44.640]   Apple Watch has a dominant market share.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:49.000]   It's a great sign, particularly when you see that the new Watch OS puts so many more capabilities
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.200]   on the Watch itself.
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:56.080]   Like being able to check out previous workouts, not just the last one, but your workout history
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:57.080]   directly from the Watch.
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:01.720]   I really hope this means that there can-- I hope that we are not too far away from making
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:08.600]   it a multi-platform watch, because I really did give a lot of thought to--
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:13.160]   Whatever the next Apple Watch is, I might just buy it because I want a good fitness watch
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:19.320]   and I don't even care that it won't sink to my Android phone, because this is just so
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:23.800]   hidden shoulders above everything else in terms of capability, in terms of style, in
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:30.400]   terms of health features that it really does overrule the fact that I can't simply get--
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:35.600]   There's no easy way to get it to work in any wave shape or form with my Android phone.
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:40.120]   >> It's one of those things that I have found that kind of snuck up on me where I realize
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:42.880]   how much I use my watch now.
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:48.760]   On a daily basis of everything from the timer to the activities to--
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:56.240]   I get-- last night, for whatever reason, I was watching TV and I didn't think it was
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:58.840]   particularly exciting, but I noticed that my heart rate was a little high.
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:02.400]   I felt a little stressed and I looked down and my heart rate was a little high, and I
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:05.680]   was like, "Well, I wonder how it averages for the day."
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:06.680]   I just stretched it out.
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:07.680]   >> Is that cool?
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:13.080]   >> You didn't even think-- it took me a second to back up and just realized that I can look
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:15.480]   at my overall average and how it's all working.
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:16.480]   >> It's amazing.
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:18.920]   >> And when I get into the-- if I get into a pool, I just love the fact that it goes,
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:19.920]   "Hey, I see you're in a pool.
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:21.640]   Would you like to do some laps?"
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:24.120]   You know, like you get this little notification, you're like, "Why?"
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:27.320]   >> I'll try to do-- I will kill myself trying to do 500 yards.
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:33.120]   >> And I'm with you, Andy, but I see no reason for Apple to make an Android compatible version,
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:36.920]   because any more they're making Android compatible eye messages.
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:38.680]   >> It's a great luck into Apple.
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:43.080]   >> I think the problem is that someone who used to do cross-platform, it's just a lot
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:46.640]   of extra engineering, and so you have to really decide how much money am I going to make doing
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:47.640]   it.
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:51.760]   Like for us, we stopped doing Windows because it was just-- it was a lot of-- there was
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:56.280]   a lot of support and not much uptick in revenue.
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:01.120]   >> Well, they did it with Apple Music, they did it with the iPhone, although that might
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:04.400]   be an old-fashioned sort of example.
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:09.040]   And it would kind of underscore the sincerity of their belief that they can help people's
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:12.000]   lives with this health device.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.560]   It would kind of be a bummer if they were saying that, "We want to make Apple users
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:20.840]   live longer so they can continue to buy Apple products."
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:25.280]   I do think that this would be a very, very big thing for Apple to do.
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:28.160]   I think it's an important thing for Apple to do.
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:30.240]   >> Let's just keep telling them that.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.160]   I still want my watch face.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.880]   I just want to go design my own watch face.
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:34.880]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:37.600]   I don't-- the Android thing would be great, but come on.
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:38.600]   >> I like the watch face.
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:39.600]   >> Like where's my watch face?
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:43.320]   >> My watch faces are fine, but the thing is, I don't understand-- I don't understand
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:47.160]   why I can't design my watch face.
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:48.160]   >> You're a fan.
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:52.880]   >> All right, let's take a break because we've been going on and on for hours, and I think
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.640]   it's time to-- but everybody--
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:55.640]   >> We're having so much fun.
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:00.240]   >> Everybody turn out another commercial, and please don't.
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:03.240]   >> Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:06.680]   Actually, this is a commercial you're going to want to listen to because if you have iPhones,
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:12.280]   if you have iPads, if you have MacBooks, and you want to get the new one, this is a great
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:13.280]   place to go.
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:20.160]   Gazelle is the trusted online marketplace for buying certified pre-owned devices.
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:23.520]   See, this happens all the time with my kids for some reason.
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:27.520]   They break their phone, or maybe you lost your phone.
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:31.200]   You just don't want to pay full freight on a great device.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:32.200]   Go to Gazelle.
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:38.080]   Devices are available at a range of prices depending on condition-- fair, good, or excellent.
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:42.640]   Everything from the iPhone 6, all the way back to the 6 through the iPhone 10 to-- actually,
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:47.280]   I'm just thinking I'm pretty sure they even have the 10s, yeah, they do.
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:51.960]   Variety of Samsung Galaxy phones, they offer MacBooks, Air and Pro and iPads, standard
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:54.000]   Air and Pro.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.960]   Before you get a certified pre-owned device at Gazelle, you know that device is in great
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:02.640]   working condition because it goes through a 30-point inspection.
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:06.280]   And if there ever is a problem, they're backed by a 30-day return policy and there is no
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:09.160]   restocking fee and shipping is free.
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:12.320]   So you're really at no risk and you're going to get a great product.
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:17.880]   They're all sold without carrier contract, but they do work with all the major carriers.
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:19.800]   Locked or unlocked, it's up to you.
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:22.680]   Actually, I guess they're not locked, but you can get them completely unlocked if you
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:23.680]   want.
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:26.240]   Financing is available on all devices.
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:29.360]   They use a firm, so that means you can check out as you're checking out.
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:32.360]   You can say, "You have finances over three, six or twelve months."
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:34.240]   Makes it very affordable.
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:37.520]   Gazelle has an amazing selection of quality pre-owned devices.
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:40.680]   A lot of students, just anybody on a budget.
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:45.840]   There's no reason everybody knows you're overpaying when you buy something brand new.

[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:03.480]   If you use that address, by the way, you'll be letting them know you heard it here, which
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:06.280]   is important, but you'll also get 10% off your purchase.
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:07.760]   That's really important too.
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:09.760]   Gazelle.com/twit.
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:10.760]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com/twit.
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:15.840]   We thank Gazelle so much.
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:21.840]   They've been supporters forever, it seems like, on MacBreak Weekly.
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:24.200]   Alex, I don't know.
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:25.200]   Do you want to do a pick?
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:26.840]   We haven't had a real--
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:27.840]   I have a pick.
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:30.040]   Full Alex caught picking a long time.
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:34.160]   I go through a lot of iPhone cases.
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:35.960]   This is the best one I've gotten so far.
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:37.640]   Oh, so I want to know.
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:39.960]   And I don't say that lightly.
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:43.040]   Now part of it is because I'm doing so much stuff with Apple Pay and everything else that
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:44.120]   makes it easier.
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:45.160]   So this little guy has--
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:47.320]   Oh, you're wallet.
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:48.320]   My wallet.
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.880]   I would not have known that, which is a good thing.
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:51.800]   Exactly.
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:55.480]   It's a rugged-- it's a pretty rugged iPhone case.
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:57.880]   This is a Vena iPhone case.
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:59.520]   V-E-N-A.
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:03.400]   And what's slick about it is, number one, is it's rugged.
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:06.920]   Number two, is it'll hold quite a few little cards in the back.
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:12.960]   So the back here is, if you can see it, flips open and it's magnet.
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:17.200]   It's magnetized, so it just kind of just closes.
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:18.640]   So it's not a hard shell.
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:23.120]   It's metal, so I have a magnet in my car, and I just go, set it up.
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:24.120]   Oh.
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:25.120]   It just snaps to the car.
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:26.120]   But the bad thing is you can't do wireless charging.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:28.160]   I can't, but I don't do that anyway, so I don't care.
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:29.760]   I don't even like wireless charging.
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:30.760]   I don't like watch.
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:31.760]   So anyway, so--
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:32.760]   You have to wireless charge or watch.
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:33.760]   I do.
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:34.760]   I don't like it.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:35.760]   I just-- I don't like doing it.
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:36.760]   You only have to do it.
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:37.760]   I have to do it.
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:39.480]   So I don't even like it there.
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:43.960]   So anyway, but it'll hold four or five cards in the back.
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:48.360]   You can see that I got some Whole Foods cards, which are very useful.
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:55.160]   And then the only card that I use, which I won't show on the air, and my driver's license.
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:58.640]   So it's got this little area in the back here, and it works super well.
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:02.320]   It's easy to get stuff in and out, which was one of my big problems.
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:06.120]   And then the back case-- let's see if I can do this right-- will actually fold up into
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:07.120]   like a little mini--
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:08.680]   Oh, it's a kickstand.
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:10.120]   I like having kickstands.
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:13.600]   So the kickstand-- the little piece in the back actually works really well.
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:17.560]   And it just has all the bits and pieces that make it great.
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:20.720]   The only thing I would add to it is a quarter 20 mount.
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:23.360]   Everything should have a quarter 20 now, like this one.
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:25.760]   If they had a quarter 20 mount, it would be absolutely like a--
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:27.280]   Because so then you could put it on a tripod.
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:28.280]   And they put it on a tripod.
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:32.080]   Like that would be like the only thing that they could add to it that would make it better,
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:33.080]   in my opinion.
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.080]   So--
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:37.840]   Military grade drop protection, because as you know, in the military people drop their
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:38.840]   phones all the time.
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:40.840]   When they're using it.
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:45.120]   Flip leather cover guard, slot holder kickstand compatible with the iPhone.
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:49.960]   In this case, it's the 10S Max, which is weirdly less expensive than the 10S version.
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:50.960]   I don't know why that is.
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:51.960]   Five bucks less.
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:52.960]   It comes in black.
[01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:53.960]   It's not particularly expensive.
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:56.800]   Like most of the money I bought in the past have been like $60, $75.
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:58.360]   So $35th of an Alex.
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:01.160]   So it's cheaper twice the price.
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:02.160]   $29th.
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:03.440]   That's the best I got.
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:04.440]   That's good.
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:09.080]   All right, Mickey, you have something for us.
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:11.240]   A pick of the week, perhaps.
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:13.720]   So we were talking about the--
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:15.720]   You're going to explain this game to me.
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:19.000]   We were talking about the Apple Design Awards.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.520]   And it triggered a memory for me.
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:23.160]   I've been playing this game lately.
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:26.000]   It's called The Gardens Between.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.280]   So Micah, Sergeant, and I tried to play it.
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:30.120]   We couldn't figure the thing out.
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:31.480]   Oh, it's amazing.
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:34.080]   It's a puzzle game.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:36.880]   That's probably why we couldn't figure it out.
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:43.440]   So you play the game by going either forward or backward in time.
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:47.720]   All right, so then as you pass by, you have two characters.
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:49.560]   One of them carries the light.
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:55.640]   And he triggers things by bringing this light with him everywhere he goes.
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:48:01.200]   And the other person alters time.
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:02.880]   So he stops time, actually.
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:05.840]   So when you stop time, other things happen.
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:11.320]   So your job is to get to the top of each one of these structures and place this light.
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:15.720]   But there are things that you have to do to get there that requires.
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:19.840]   So you'll be walking along up a pathway and you'll get stuck.
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:22.000]   And then you go backward in time.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.120]   And then you use the guy that either has the lamp.
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:29.440]   You put that lamp on something and then suddenly something is triggered.
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:33.280]   Or you use the other guy who stops time and does other things through it.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:37.400]   He stops time so that some other action takes place.
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:39.480]   And then you walk forward through time again.
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:45.920]   And then everything completely changes at that moment when you alter your events leading
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:47.200]   up to that time.
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:52.760]   So you have to walk forward, then walk backward, then walk forward again after you've made
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:54.920]   these changes to it.
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:49:00.840]   And it starts out pretty simple and then gets so much more complicated that you start getting
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:05.160]   sort of confused as to, what am I missing here?
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:06.160]   And I'm sure--
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:07.160]   You're right.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:09.160]   I'm not sure this too.
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:13.320]   John was just showing me what I should do, which is screen mirror this so you can watch
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:14.320]   it.
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:15.320]   Screen mirror, yeah.
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:17.720]   And then you can tell me what I'm doing wrong because I'm kind of stuck.
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:18.720]   All right.
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:19.720]   Okay.
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:22.200]   It's such a beautiful game and it sounds really good too.
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:24.600]   We are on this island.
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:26.320]   And are they moving?
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:27.320]   I don't understand.
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:29.280]   There's boxes of stuff.
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:30.280]   And so he's--
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:32.040]   So you're moving forward through time.
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:33.040]   Here's the brother.
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:35.920]   And here she is with the empty lamp holder.
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:39.800]   And then here we-- oh, look.
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:40.800]   Okay.
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:42.000]   So should I pick this up?
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000]   Yeah.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.040]   So now-- I don't know what's happening.
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:46.040]   Now do I go back?
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:48.560]   So now you-- yeah.
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:49.560]   Not yet.
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:52.440]   So you see how this little guy is kind of jumping forward in time.
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:54.440]   Oh, you need a light.
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:55.440]   You need a light for him first.
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:56.440]   That's the problem.
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:59.200]   So I blew it.
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:01.200]   But I wish all games had this feature.
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:02.200]   So what then what?
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:03.200]   You could go backwards.
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:04.200]   There's the light.
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:05.200]   So you just tap it.
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:06.200]   And then you go forward in time.
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:07.200]   And now you go forward in time.
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:08.200]   And now you go forward in time.
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:09.200]   And now you go forward in time.
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:10.200]   And now you go forward in time.
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:11.200]   And now you go forward in time.
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:12.200]   And now you go forward in time.
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:13.200]   And now you go forward in time.
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:14.200]   And now you go forward in time.
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:15.200]   And now you go forward in time.
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:16.200]   And now you go forward in time.

[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:08.200]   iOS today.
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:12.200]   11 o'clock Pacific would be 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:15.200]   It would be a 1700 UTC.
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:16.200]   Or is it 60?
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:17.200]   I don't know.
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:18.200]   My math is so difficult.
[02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:21.200]   Seven hours later it would be 1600 UTC.
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:22.200]   >> Some time in the evening.
[02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:23.200]   >> Yeah.
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:24.200]   Here's the deal.
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:28.200]   You can go to twitter.tv/live and watch your listen live to anything we do.
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:30.200]   Or ask alayosha.
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:32.200]   Or jikiermo.
[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:33.200]   Or slomo.
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:37.200]   You can almost always just say, "Hey, play Twit Live."
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:40.200]   And you'll get the live stream or play Mac break weekly.
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:41.200]   And you'll get the most recent episode.
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:43.200]   It's a magical thing.
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:50.200]   We also have on-demand versions of audio and video at our website, twitter.tv/mbw.

[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:55.200]   That way you'll get it automatically the minute it's available.
[02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:56.200]   Find a podcaster.
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:05:00.200]   Put us down for every week for Mac break weekly.
[02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:05.200]   Now time to get back to work because as Alex Lindsay wants to say, "Break time!"
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:06.200]   It's over.
