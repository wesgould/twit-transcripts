[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.640]   your Macintosh needs.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.080]   Satisfies them.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.880]   Although lately, it's not been much Mac.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.480]   It's almost all iPhone, iPad, and other things
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.440]   with us right now, as always, from his fortress of Macitude
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.200]   in beautiful New England.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.000]   I am just abusing FaceTime right now.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.560]   He's FaceTiming himself.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.800]   I'm FaceTiming.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.240]   I want to use the entire show.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.200]   Oh, look at that.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.000]   Like, 8-second delay by FaceTiming
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   from this side of the office onto the other side of the office.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.280]   Wow.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.920]   There you go.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.680]   This must be what Steve Jobs was thinking
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.680]   when he invented it.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.040]   You know, enough of this, like, talking to your children
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.000]   for the first time, enough communicating via sign language.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.520]   This is exactly how this was supposed to be exploited
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.480]   by idiots like me, enjoying the fact
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.880]   that he sounds a little bit like an old-time stadium
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.360]   baseball announcer.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.280]   And also, in left field, batting number three.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.320]   Chris, bring the fount of all Mac knowledge.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.120]   Oh, sorry.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.000]   I was just playing iPhone over here.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.040]   Oh, stop it.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.520]   How many--
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.320]   Straight fluff.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.240]   Is that the original iPhone?
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.960]   The--
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.440]   Yeah, the original iPhone.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.440]   3G, 3GS.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.440]   3GS.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.680]   Yeah, the other touch mixed in there.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.680]   3G.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.240]   Yeah, my wife's got the 3GS, so that one's upstairs.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.760]   But yeah.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.560]   Well, I think the iPod touch can stand in for the 3GS.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.320]   That's fair.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.080]   So I guess, really-- and by the way, Alex Lindsey
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.960]   is on assignment.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.960]   I don't know what the hell that means.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.680]   But he will be back with us next week.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.360]   So it's Chris Andy and me talking about your Macintosh stories.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.280]   And of course, what else are we going to talk about today
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.880]   although there is a lot more.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.320]   And we'll get to that in a bit.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.040]   But iPhone 4 came out on Thursday.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.440]   And I have 4 by the desk.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.440]   And I can probably get more Chris.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.080]   If you want to play, we can play.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.600]   Oh.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.920]   I just--
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.440]   I can just go over there to that locker.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.120]   And we can just play.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.160]   We can just play.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.640]   Oh, you guys.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.280]   Don't you know about Gazelle for crying out loud?
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.320]   Get some money for those things.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.480]   Mine had a hard--
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480]   OK, I have one.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.320]   I'm not going to show off.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.800]   I have one.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.960]   But mine had a hard crash.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.440]   I was talking to you before the show began.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.040]   And I put it in the gym locker when I came back from my exercise
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.360]   class.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.040]   I tried to turn it on.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.600]   It wouldn't go on.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.760]   But Chris gave me the special two-finger salute,
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.200]   which is you hold the home button and the on/off switch
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.000]   until it gives you the white apple.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.480]   Yeah, that's simply a demonstration of the iPhone smell
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.480]   sensor.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.360]   And so that would indicate that you
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.160]   need to do your gym laundry a little more off.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.000]   A smell-erometer.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.880]   And it basically tried to kill itself.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.640]   And that's what happened.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.920]   It went into a coma.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.760]   It could be.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.200]   It could be.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.720]   That's very possible.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.960]   But I thought, what happened?
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.720]   I got it right next to my Bluetooth headset.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.080]   And silly me, I thought, oh, I've somehow shorted them out.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.560]   And they both-- because they both seem like they were dead.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.840]   So I don't know what happened there.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.440]   But anyway, it's working well.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.480]   Let's get-- I know both of you have written reviews
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.240]   of the iPhone 4 by now.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.240]   I have not.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.840]   First, let me ask you, Andy, did you have an advanced copy?
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.800]   Or did you start your review on "Processed on Thursday?"
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.640]   Oh, for the love of God.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.960]   I actually did not get an advanced one.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.280]   It was a little bit embarrassing because they got to me
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.360]   by the fastest way possible was to get
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   me picking up in the store that morning.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.640]   And so they actually FedExed it from Cupertino
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.560]   to my local Apple store.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.760]   And I want you to imagine a line like a mile long.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.120]   And out of 1,000 people, maybe there
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.280]   will be a few people who recognize me and say, hey, Andy,
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.800]   nice to see you.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.000]   Hey, Andy, nice to see you.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.840]   And that sort of stuff.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.400]   And they're very, very nice and very, very kind.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.800]   And here I am, like Queen Mary, just sailing right
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.600]   to the front, walking right in.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.080]   They're walking right out with a bag with two iPhones in it.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.840]   And I'm just-- I would like to compare
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.920]   like the looks I was getting on the way into the looks
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.560]   I was getting on the way out.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.200]   I felt really bad.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.400]   I had this look of--
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.960]   All right.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.800]   Was Jason Bateman with you when all this happened?
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.080]   Do you have a special access?
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.840]   They actually pulled him out of line, out
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.760]   of the back of the line and brought him up.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.080]   And he sort of did this.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.520]   The rain cut over his head.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.000]   But he still went in and got the phone and came out with him.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Celebrities don't have to wait in line, don't you know?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.840]   Early.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.280]   Well, I didn't wait in line.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.280]   See, I'm a celebrity.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.640]   You know how I got my iPhone.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.200]   I pre-ordered it.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.760]   On Tuesday, they put it on sale.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.480]   I talked to the story.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.320]   I told the story already.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.640]   But they put it on sale on Monday.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.880]   I didn't get through because of the AT&T Snafus.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.560]   So I came back Tuesday and I ordered it.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.200]   I went through and I was so happy until I saw July 15th.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.800]   Shipped date.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.160]   I went, oh.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.520]   And then Tom Merritt was in line because he had pre-ordered
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.720]   for pickup.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.480]   And we were talking to him because we broadcast the launch
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.160]   live and he said, hey, just ask him.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.720]   See if they'll sell you a second one.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.280]   And they did.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.720]   They said, no problem.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.280]   So he bought a second one and brought it back.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.360]   So what is the latest on this?
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.760]   Apple says they sold 1.7 million iPhones.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.920]   Are they in stock now?
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.920]   Is it easy to get them?
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.880]   Or is it still kind of catch as catch can?
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.600]   Do you know Chris Breen?
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.320]   I believe it still catches catch can.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.200]   I was actually surprised that they were selling them
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.200]   the day of.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.040]   I was one of the people who stood in line.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.040]   I was not escorted to the front.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.680]   And they had the two lines.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.760]   There was the one line of people who had pre-orders.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.480]   And then there was the optimists who were in the second line.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.000]   Boy, that is an optimist too.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.920]   Maybe we'll get it.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.680]   And they were like--
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.960]   I was in Monterey, California, which is not a big Apple
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.280]   story.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.320]   And there were a couple of hundred people on that line.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.800]   And I thought they would never get in.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.560]   However, as we went through the line, about every one of every
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.240]   five of the pre-orders have got in, they let somebody else in.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.760]   So they did have a stock at the time.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.360]   But eventually they went through that line just to say,
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.600]   we love it that you're this optimistic.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.160]   But it's just not going to happen today.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.640]   Go home.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.320]   Yeah, go home.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.880]   So I think Apple sold their 1.7.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.720]   I think they were looking at couch cushions
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.160]   that Apple HQ defined as many as they could to sell them.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.440]   Because I think they sold out everything they had.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.440]   They would have sold more if they had an opportunity to.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.160]   Why is my question?
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.800]   Why did this iPhone sell so much better than any iPhone did
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.360]   they?
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.400]   What is it?
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.600]   I think it's because this is the first iPhone where you
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.240]   could communicate so very clearly with the differences
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.160]   between this model and the last model.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.360]   It's nice that the GS was faster than the 3G.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.680]   But this one you're saying, you see this?
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.000]   The old display was like this.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.720]   Our new display is like this.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.680]   The old camera was a snapshot.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.560]   The new camera is a great video thing.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.640]   Our old camera could--
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.360]   Our old phone left you more distant and unavailable
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.440]   to your friends and family.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.560]   This one has FaceTime.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.840]   Look at this cool demo.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.560]   So it definitely--
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.520]   It just demoed well.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.680]   And it's true because they even though for geeks like me,
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.800]   the fact that they're now using the A4 processor,
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.760]   that was a big deal.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.360]   The fact that they have better battery life,
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.480]   that's a big deal.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.160]   But they didn't really push that very hard.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.600]   They pushed the things that normal people would go,
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.560]   ooh, I want that.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.160]   Well, also AT&T made this more affordable for people.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.720]   When Steve Jobs announced this thing originally, he said,
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.640]   and AT&T has been very generous in offering people
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.440]   who are first adopters of the 3GS an opportunity
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.160]   to get in without paying an arm and a leg to do that.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.320]   I was thrilled that--
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.440]   because I got my 3GS the day of.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.360]   And when it came time to update, I thought, OK,
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.600]   I'm going to have to pay the penalty.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.360]   And I went back, and sure enough, it was only $199
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.440]   for the 16 gig, plus $18.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.760]   So I think a lot of the people who might have held off
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.880]   because they were going to have to pay this penalty
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.120]   didn't have to and thought, well, great,
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.920]   I'll go get the new one.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.840]   Why not?
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.320]   Right.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.520]   I guess that makes sense.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.440]   And I would also guess that it's
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.000]   kind of like the VISTA XP situation.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.360]   There were a lot of people who didn't upgrade the 3G to 3GS
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.920]   because, Andy, as you say, they weren't
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.320]   able to articulate the difference.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.520]   Those people were due.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.240]   They had had it for two years.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.080]   So it made sense to leapfrog, just as people leapfrog
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.120]   VISTA and went right to Windows 7.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.120]   You think that is what happened?
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.280]   Yeah, there's that as well.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.120]   I mean, it's kind of silly to buy a new phone every year
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.400]   as they come out anyway.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.680]   So it's kind of interesting to see
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.960]   how happy people are with the iPhone as a concept
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.520]   versus the ones who feel as though this feature is what's
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.120]   going to get me out to actually hand over my 200 or 300 bucks
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.160]   and finally upgrade.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.440]   It's also-- I mean, even two years
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.280]   is a fast turnaround time.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.880]   From the feature phone era, you would keep it for years.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.200]   But I guess nowadays with a smartphone, two years and out,
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.600]   Apple has shortened that time.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.440]   They've got us.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.840]   They've got us.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.600]   And for us, one year.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.600]   Well, because we care about our readers and our listeners.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.120]   We have to.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.320]   It's called responsibility.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.520]   We have to.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.240]   So let's talk-- let's get your thumbnail reviews.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:53.880]   Good, bad.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.120]   And then we'll do the ugly.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.720]   I would say the screen lives up to its billing.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.240]   Does it not?
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.000]   It really looks good.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.600]   In fact, those people who said, oh, no, no.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.640]   It's not a retinitis play.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.480]   You'd have to hold it at arms like three.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.360]   You'd not see pixels.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.720]   I can't see pixels.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.000]   It even up close.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.360]   It's pretty good.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.880]   Yeah, I mean, my pal Phil played the-- who runs
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.640]   at badastronomy.com, did a whole post about it.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.600]   And he's an astronomer.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.760]   He worked on the Hubble telescope.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.400]   And he knows from optics.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.680]   And so when Wired chose a rather clumsy headline saying,
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.200]   oh, that could be false advertising,
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.880]   because Apple says that it's beyond the ability
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.400]   the human eye to resolve, Phil says
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.000]   that if you have absolutely perfect vision,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.680]   meaning that if your mom had like mythological Congress
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.400]   with a hawk and you have been gifted with absolutely perfect
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.320]   flawless vision, then it would be possible
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.560]   to discern individual pixels.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.240]   Anybody who has anything less than absolutely perfect human
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.000]   vision would not be able to discern it.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.680]   But when you hold it in your hand, it really does come across.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.600]   I mean, when you-- the first thing you do
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.600]   is, of course, you put up a newspaper web page.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.000]   And even with the entire web page scrunched into one screen,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.040]   you can read headlines easily.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.480]   You can even, as a stunt, read actual articles.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.800]   And the stuff that's even too small to reasonably make out,
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.440]   at least you can sense what it is.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.480]   I took a picture for my review to sort of point this out,
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.080]   that you can actually, through a magnifier, actually read
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.640]   what the weather and what the forecast is
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.160]   in the Chicago Sun Times page, even though it's just like maybe
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.040]   five pixels high, even in the magnified view.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.800]   So at the very least-- now, you're not
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.960]   going to be reading that off the display,
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.880]   but at least when you take a look at this thumbnail view
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.520]   of the screen, you'll know, oh, well, that's the weather.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.360]   I want to zoom in on that, because that's information
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.240]   I'm interested in.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.280]   And it carries through on every part--
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.240]   almost every part of the experience.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.360]   I have a very, very--
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.200]   when my picks of the week a couple weeks ago
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.360]   was a smart HUD, which is the app that's always running that
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.400]   just gives you my speed and just something to keep an eye on
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.480]   while I'm driving.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.000]   And it's just really all this is a two-digit number
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.200]   with a compass around it.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.520]   But the fact that not only is it high definition,
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.680]   but it's an ultra-high contrast ratio
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.880]   that it stops looking like a computer screen
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.640]   and it starts looking like a 35-millimeter slide.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.640]   It's that good.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.640]   It's pretty spectacular.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.680]   Absolutely pop right exactly.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.000]   That's not just something I'm coming up with,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.120]   just to sort of explain it.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.720]   I have a freeze frame on the movie up
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.040]   and huge dynamic range, huge detail of the image.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.120]   But with the brightness turned all the way up,
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.360]   it is uncanny how much it looks like just a 35-millimeter
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.360]   transparency.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.160]   Really good looking.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.040]   How about you, Chris, you agree?
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:28.960]   Yeah, I do.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.320]   I was out to dinner the other night with a couple of friends
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.160]   and they had their 3GS with them.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.400]   And I had my new iPhone and they said,
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.200]   OK, let's do a test.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.600]   And so we had a couple of images that were similar
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.800]   and we A/B'd them against each other.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.720]   And really, the new display looks so great with photos
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.760]   comparatively.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.800]   And to compare the cameras as well,
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.360]   we took pictures with each one and swapped them back
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.640]   and forth via email.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.040]   I said, oh, yeah, this is-- even this picture
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.760]   taken on a 3GS, we bring it over
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.880]   and before it really looks so much nicer on this display.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.800]   Videos look great.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.200]   Using something like Instapaper, you get really
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.800]   the fine edges of text where you don't
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.480]   on the 3GS and earlier iPhones.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.960]   So as for a viewing experience, it's fabulous.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.960]   It's also--
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.120]   I mean, go ahead, Danny.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.680]   I was just about to say, I mean, you're
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.800]   looking at some pictures that I took on Saturday downtown.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.800]   And I was walking around with the iPhone, the iPhone 3GS,
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.800]   two different Android phones, and my Nikon pocket camera,
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.200]   shooting the same scene with all five
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.040]   so I can take it back and compare it.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.320]   And it's such a good testimony to the iPhone's display
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.920]   that when I was on the green line,
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.320]   on my way back to the car, I'm looking
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.720]   through all these pictures and thinking, my god,
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.080]   I mean, the iPhone 4 is just kicking the butt of every--
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.240]   oh, they're cameras, not even close.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.880]   And it wasn't until I got back and I dumped all these pictures
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.280]   back to my desktop that I realized that, yes, the iPhone
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.080]   camera is better.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.960]   But the reason why the other pictures
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.760]   look horrible on the Droid X and on the Nexus 1
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.800]   and the other display--
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.120]   The screen was not nearly as good.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.120]   I like that Apple had screen a lot,
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.640]   but I have to say there's nothing like the Solidity and Christmas.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.000]   And by the way, this IPS screen from LG,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.320]   when you tip it on its side, your viewing ratio is--
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.320]   our angles, I should say, is really pretty impressive.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.160]   And it doesn't seem to have the same problem
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.320]   that the iPhone, the iPad screen has, maybe just simply
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.880]   due to the fact that it's a smaller size.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.920]   It's not-- on the iPad, it's very difficult to use it
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.640]   outside in bright sunlight with the iPhone 4.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.640]   It doesn't perform as well as the 3GS does in sunlight,
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.920]   but it's still perfectly usable.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.040]   Yeah, I think it really looks good.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:42.480]   Is that--
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.560]   Is that general burn side there?
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.520]   Yes, solid, great, great, great uncle, yes.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.240]   We paid for half of the library.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.520]   The inventor of the side burn.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.560]   Just release, really-- and these are all iPhone 4 pictures.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.040]   These are all iPhone 4 photos, yeah.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.840]   And I guess really, as long as we're going to talk about the screen,
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.760]   we should talk about that.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.000]   This is easily the best camera phone I've ever used.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.560]   I mean, this is as good as a 5 megapixel camera.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.560]   Look at the color.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.320]   The-- I don't see any artifacting.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.600]   Even in the sky here in a high contrast situation
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.040]   with a lot of sunlight, it's--
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.160]   Very wide dynamic range.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:15.920]   Really?
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.760]   Surprisingly good.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.440]   In the review, I had to say that--
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.240]   and this was intended as a compliment.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.200]   I think a lot of people will hear it as a compliment.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.920]   But I think it's the first phone camera that has to be thought of
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.920]   as a poor, performing, real pocket camera as opposed to,
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.840]   wow, that's a really great picture considering
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.200]   that it came out of a phone, of course.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.080]   Right, right.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.720]   Because you spent-- again, I spent like four hours
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.320]   walking around taking pictures with it.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.600]   And within like five minutes, I stopped saying,
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.600]   oh, taking a snapshot.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.440]   OK, I'm taking a snapshot here.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.360]   I was getting into my photography groove of where's the light,
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.200]   where the details were both good.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.200]   It's pretty fast, too.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.320]   There's not a lot of latency.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:51.600]   I mean--
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.600]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.360]   Not only that, but you can actually take--
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.680]   there's no burst mode in it.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.840]   But if you just keep pumping that button with your thumb,
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:02.120]   you can take several shots in very rapid succession.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.440]   And that also comes--
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.840]   I think it's an iOS 4 feature as opposed to an iPhone 4 feature.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.760]   But you can definitely rattle off three, four, five shots
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.720]   very, very easily.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.280]   And that's another area in which the iPhone just absolutely
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.760]   trounces Android phones.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.080]   I had two different versions of the camera app
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.680]   with the Droid X that has their own little skin on it
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.760]   and the version of the camera app that comes in for you, 2.2,
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.200]   that's coming out in a few weeks.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.760]   And it was just a nightmare shooting pictures
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.600]   with these applications.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.680]   I just hated using this thing.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.160]   Rest the iPhone presents absolutely no barrier whatsoever.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.640]   It seems like it wants you to take pictures.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.400]   You were using the 8 megapixel cameras in the Evo
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.160]   and the Droid X.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:40.640]   Is that right?
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.000]   Is it 8 megapixels?
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.960]   On the Droid X is an 8 megapixel camera.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.200]   It is a very, very good camera, I should say.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.960]   It also shoots HD video.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.040]   But if you put these two pictures side by side,
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.720]   you definitely notice a huge--
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.400]   excuse me, not a huge, but a very, very noticeable improvement.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.440]   It's not something that would come out
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.280]   if you have good studio lighting and good, even balanced
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.240]   lighting on a set.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.920]   And that sort of circumstance, they come out very, very equal.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.800]   It's when you have the trickier situations
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.440]   where there's a shot in there with a swan
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.160]   boat on the beautiful reflecting lagoon
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.680]   and there's like weeping willows on the opposite shore.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.560]   On the iPhone, it's a very, very lovely picture
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.000]   on the Droid X.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.640]   The background trees, it loses a lot of the shadow detail
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.160]   because it just doesn't have the sort of range
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.040]   to have the deal with the lightness of the leaves
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.480]   that are facing the sun and the darkness of the parts
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.800]   of the tree that are sort of buried in there.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.240]   So it's-- you would never really--
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.280]   most of the pictures you'll take with an iPhone 4,
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.800]   you don't need to explain that took this with my phone.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.120]   You can just print it at 5 by 7 or 8 by 10,
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.680]   put it on the wall and just not tell anybody about it.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.320]   I should say though, it does have two foibles.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.720]   The white balance seems to be very easily bamboozled.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.520]   There are many, many situations in which
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.640]   like where there's a good source of artificial light,
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.920]   where the white balance was not able to figure out, oh, wait,
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.200]   that's a-- that's tungsten.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.160]   I shouldn't make the picture all yellow like that.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.560]   The other problem is that it's more of a quirk
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.280]   than anything else.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.120]   If it has-- if it's in a situation where it has to either
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.760]   lose shadow detail or lose a highlight,
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.280]   it will choose to blow out a highlight almost every single time.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.520]   It's easily worked around.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.640]   And I also should mention that on the--
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.920]   I have the Nikon P6000 sort of as a control,
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.560]   like what would a real $300 pocket camera deal with this?
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.760]   And it had many of the same problems.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.360]   And also, it's an easy thing to work around,
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.800]   because with the iPhone, it does have that tap to focus,
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.720]   tap to do spot exposure.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.240]   So this dark one is that the Droid X,
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.000]   and then compare it to the iPhone.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.840]   Actually, all the ones that are up there right now
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.960]   are iPhone pictures.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.600]   I'm going to be putting up the full gallery later tonight
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.800]   and should be available when--
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.560]   You tap the trees, it looks like, then,
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.280]   and you've got a better exposure on this one.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.320]   Through-- exactly.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.120]   Well, through most of these tests,
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.240]   I was-- the rule I set for myself
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.160]   was to not use any of the manual settings.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.840]   Just hold up the-- frame the picture, squeeze the shutter,
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.720]   whatever the camera decides to do, it decides to do.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.160]   For that particular shot, I decided
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.400]   to try to use the modes in each individual camera
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.320]   to make for a better picture.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.360]   And that's an area-- that is one area in which I wish
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.400]   that we had some of the Android features,
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:15.680]   because versus the Android 2.2, the Froyo version of the camera
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.200]   app gives you fine control.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.400]   You can simply say, please overexpose this by a style.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.640]   Please, here's the white balance setting I want you to use.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.320]   And they're actually very, very accessible.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.560]   I really, really wish that there was just a little star
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.080]   in the corner of the camera apps screen on the iPhone,
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.840]   where it would just rotate around.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.800]   Instead of having those two little--
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.680]   those two simple adjustment photo buttons,
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.320]   now I have a full range of cluttered SLR-based controls
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.360]   where I can set everything manually.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:46.040]   It would really elevate that camera considerably.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:46.800]   Chris, you agree?
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.520]   You concur any other thoughts about the camera?
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.680]   I've spent a lot of time with the video part of the camera,
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.680]   because for Macworld, I review their pocket camcorders.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.840]   I don't want it to see how this thing compared to a flip camcorder.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.360]   And it's close.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.600]   It's not as good as a flip.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.680]   It's not as good as a flip.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.200]   That's interesting, because that's--
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.200]   No, I don't think so.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.000]   People were saying--
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.360]   It's not first-sided, and this is going to hurt the flip.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.240]   No way.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:08.680]   Interest.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:13.480]   No, because a flip doesn't cost you two years' worth of service.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.240]   And the flip really does produce one much better audio.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.200]   The mic and the flip is much more sensitive,
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.680]   so you get a better, louder audio.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.680]   These things tend to-- all pocket camcorders
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.840]   tend to blow out the highlights.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.560]   So I took a stroll around my garden,
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.600]   and invariably when I'd get a dark background
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.200]   with a bright yellow flower or a book in the ear
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.880]   where it's bright pink, the pinks and the yellows
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.760]   blew out terribly.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.600]   Just as they do on most pocket camcorders,
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.160]   the flip tends to tamp that down a little bit.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.160]   It's still not great.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.080]   It's not like using a full-sized HD camcorder,
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.120]   but it's better than what the iPhone is doing.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.040]   Still pictures, I thought were great,
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.920]   because I mixed up in the garden between Stills and Video,
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.680]   and I put it all together in iMovie for iPhone.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.040]   And the video was OK, but the Stills were fabulous.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.080]   They really came out looking just beautiful,
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.640]   and I didn't get as much of that bloom in the Stills
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.800]   as I did with the video.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.040]   - Their Michael Corbel of magic pictures.com,
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.960]   M-A-J-E-K pictures.com, has posted on his site
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.840]   a video that he shot entirely and edited entirely
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.680]   with the iPhone.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.080]   For those of you watching the video of the podcast,
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.240]   there's a video as well as audio now.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.480]   I'm just going to play a little bit of this.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.200]   This was edited in the phone, shot in the phone,
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.320]   and edited in the phone using iMovie.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.600]   And it's really a short movie that looks kind of surprisingly
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.000]   amazingly good, considering the whole thing
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.280]   is done in the iPhone, and he'd set it to come out
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.680]   at 48 hours to do the whole thing.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.440]   Close stops, you know, two shots, master shots.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.440]   (laughing)
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.280]   - I hate talent, don't you?
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.600]   - It should go and be done by the phone.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.400]   - Even the soundtrack, even the music,
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.920]   which is pretty amazing.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.440]   Now this is a model railroad that he's,
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.760]   I guess, put the phone on.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:15.680]   - Don't you think this is pretty good?
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.520]   - Yeah.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.240]   - For those of you know, watching, listening,
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.120]   you just have to go view the video,
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.520]   or just go to magic, M-A-J-E-K pictures.com.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:29.600]   - He's got craneshots, he's got pants,
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.720]   I mean, obviously very steady hand.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.960]   - No, he's got to have that on a rig, I want to,
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.800]   I would love to know sort of--
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.960]   - He must have a rig, like an alley or something, yeah.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.400]   - Yeah, so did you have the same problem that I had?
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.960]   I felt that I shot a demo video at my comic shop,
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.200]   and all the other samples that I was shooting,
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.360]   it works great if you can hold it steady,
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.680]   if you try to move with your subject or move at all.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.560]   Boy, there's a lot of shake and shutter,
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.800]   I don't know whether it's the shape,
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.120]   it's just the idea of having to hold the camera
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.040]   in that sort of awkward sort of picture frame sort of mode,
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.040]   or whether it's just something about how a process is movement.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.240]   - But that was the rig. - Here's the rig,
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.080]   he did in fact have a rig, look at that, he's good.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:07.920]   - Oh, okay.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.520]   - He's got a little crane and a dolly.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.280]   (laughing)
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.760]   - That a crew, 43 people. - That a crew, yeah.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.440]   Okay, never mind, but still, I mean,
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.920]   that's the point that we're making.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.560]   - Here's the phone is making the pictures, you know?
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.920]   - Right, I mean, put any other,
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.840]   put any other phone in that kind of rig,
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.360]   and you wouldn't get results as good as that, I don't think.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.560]   - Especially if you could try to edit it and film it.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.080]   - Yeah, but you could look at the bright colors in this,
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.520]   you could really see that they're blown out
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.200]   when they go and pan to the guy's hat,
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.800]   it's just totally white and has a hard time knocking it down.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.960]   - The biggest thing to me is that there's no,
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.920]   there's no hardware image stabilization,
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.320]   either stills or doesn't, I don't believe there is.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.640]   Oddly enough, when we were doing FaceTime,
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.440]   there was pretty clearly image stabilization of some kind,
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.960]   maybe it was just software based.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.520]   But I think that that's kind of--
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.800]   - Well, maybe that has to do with the fact
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.920]   that when you're doing FaceTime,
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.800]   it doesn't have to write all that stuff to disk.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.640]   - Right.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.200]   - So it has less heavy lifting to do.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.880]   That did occur to me when I was testing out the video
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.880]   because as you can see, the 720p is below the largest resolution
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.360]   of that five megapixel camera.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.920]   So you would think there's enough room
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:22.680]   that can sort of do some soft stabilization inside the frame.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.480]   But I'm guessing that this is a very
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.280]   very process or intensive sort of thing.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.360]   I can actually feel the back of the phone,
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.440]   not be hot, but get noticeably warm.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.200]   - That is something-- - This phone does heat up.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.200]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.040]   - It does heat up.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.440]   - It doesn't get uncomfortable.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.320]   So you won't get like singed hair on the top of your knees
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.200]   or anything like that as you do with some of the MacBooks.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.960]   But it actually made me wonder if that was one of the reasons
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.080]   why they decided to go with a glass for the back
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.680]   because glass will conduct the heat away,
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.800]   plastic will tend to insulate a little bit,
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.520]   and metal will just probably be way too painful.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.360]   - Here from Jalopnik is another short film done
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.120]   in the iPhone 4 called 156 turns.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.480]   This is, let me get this in the high def mode here
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.280]   before we start playing it.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.440]   But this is an example of because of the portability
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.960]   of the iPhone, the small size of it,
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.880]   you're gonna be able to do stuff.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.320]   Also the unobtrusiveness of it,
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.720]   you're gonna be able to do stuff that you probably couldn't do.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.040]   It is a little washed out.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.240]   The colors are not super rich,
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.360]   the contrast is not super great,
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.320]   although I think with this processing, you can fix that.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.680]   - I got asked a question one.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.560]   Have you had a cold ear up here?
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.240]   And I said, well, I think one of these other big cameras,
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.240]   people are using this.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.040]   (laughing)
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.040]   That's the one negative,
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.400]   you might feel like a little bit of a dork
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.080]   shooting this with your camera phone.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.600]   People might say, well, they can't be serious.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.760]   - I think we definitely want it, so,
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.280]   I'm just there to support it.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.200]   I hear that you don't like either one of these.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.560]   - I think that what we're gonna see,
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.480]   I mean, look, this is good enough.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.040]   This is broadcast quality.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.520]   What we're gonna see is a lot more video shot in the field
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.440]   by people who have iPhone 4s who are there,
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.160]   I mean, for news gathering,
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.440]   it's just the impact is huge.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.920]   - I think there's some processing in there,
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.080]   some post-processing in there,
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.560]   'cause you can't do subtitles like that.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.680]   - No, no, this is not, they didn't edit it
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.360]   with iMovie 4, they shot it,
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.840]   you can see speed up and stuff like that.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.320]   - Oh, right, right.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.440]   - But it's filmed with an iPhone,
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.120]   it says no color correction on this,
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.960]   and I think that's, actually, you can kinda see that.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.600]   - To me, the really big win is that
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.280]   iMovie for the iPhone really shows you how well
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:30.080]   a multi-touch operating system is towards doing video editing.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.720]   And I've got, from the China trip, from every other trip,
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.520]   I don't shoot lots of video, but I shoot enough
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.200]   that it makes me feel guilty that I just simply
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.400]   cut it onto my Drobo and I never do anything with it
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.200]   because it just seems like such a production.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.680]   And yet, after I got home from shooting the comic bookshop,
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.640]   I didn't really intend to start editing
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.000]   like during, while I was eating dinner,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.360]   but I was just starting noodling around with it,
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.800]   and it sort of came across as a game.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.720]   And by the end of 10 or 15 minutes,
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.800]   I'd cut together a very, not a broadcast quality thing,
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.760]   but at least something that would have satisfied me enough
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.280]   that I could post it onto YouTube.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.080]   So I could definitely see myself on the plane home
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.000]   for my trips, with the iPhone for my hand
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.160]   just doing video editing, and then by the time I get home,
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.320]   I can actually upload HD, finished,
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.840]   edited together stuff to my YouTube channel
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.000]   or just hand them out to friends.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.480]   - This also shows that with some clever editing,
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.280]   and if you know what you're doing,
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.320]   you can make it look like it's got Zoom,
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.520]   you can simulate a lot of the things
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.680]   that you're missing from a real video camera.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.800]   He's jump cutting a Zoom and so forth.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.040]   And this is kind of amazing.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.840]   This is a guy, Anna Ducati, with the phones,
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.160]   looks like strapped to the handlebars.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.840]   And that's kind of something you can't,
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:38.960]   you really aren't gonna do with your--
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.160]   - I think it was one handling it.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.000]   That was like two minutes.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:41.840]   - It might have been one handling it.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.480]   It was too far but clip all the way down.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.320]   - It's, you know, look, it's exciting.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.360]   It's exciting.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.120]   So we love the screen, no doubt about it.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.960]   Camera, still camera, excellent video camera.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.280]   Pretty good, no, not a flip killer.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.400]   - Okay, right.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.240]   - Face time.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:03.240]   Chris, have you used, have you made a lot of FaceTime calls?
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.760]   - Not a lot, I've done it a couple of times
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.360]   just to see what it's like.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.200]   - I have a picture of me--
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.040]   - I just said.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.960]   - doing FaceTime at Foo Camp with Robert Scobull.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.400]   This is about the way most of us are doing FaceTime right now.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.880]   I'm five feet away.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.920]   And, but it worked.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.760]   We were on the same Wi-Fi network.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.080]   It worked.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:20.920]   What do you think?
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.760]   - Yeah, it works.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.360]   - I just wonder about the longevity of this thing.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.960]   It's whether people really want a video chat that way.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.440]   And, you know, I'm not going to talk to my people at work
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.320]   and say, oh, hi, how are you?
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.960]   You know, 'cause then I have to like get dressed
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.920]   and I have to, you know, do the hair and that takes hours.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.120]   And, I don't know, you know, I much prefer not, you know,
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.440]   people using their imagination.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.680]   What does Chris's hair look like right now?
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.600]   I bet it's fabulous.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.440]   You know, it's impeded.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.440]   - Right, it's in curlers or there's gel in it
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.360]   or something like that.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.200]   So I don't know.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.240]   I mean, I expect a lot of people using FaceTime right now
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.920]   to try it and go, oh, this is really cool.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:59.120]   And then do those sort of here's grandma kind of things.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.520]   She can't be here right now, but here she is on FaceTime
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.800]   and oh, I'm on a business trip.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.000]   And hi, honey, here I am.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.280]   It's great.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.720]   And look, I'm in Las Vegas,
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.600]   but I'm in my hotel room and it's 10 o'clock.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.880]   I'd try to be here.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.240]   So there's a lot of, you know,
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.240]   possibility for fake backdrops for this kind of thing.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.640]   But I think, I don't know, Andy,
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.680]   what do you think about day-to-day communication
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.520]   versus FaceTime?
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.360]   I think it's cool.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.200]   I like it.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.440]   It works really well.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.280]   - It's a gimmick.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.120]   I thought it was a gimmick all along.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.400]   - Yeah, I mean, is it gonna be
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.000]   the way we communicate in the future?
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:28.840]   - Well, I don't know.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.520]   I certainly don't think it'll transform
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.720]   the way we communicate,
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.000]   but you think about what it used to be like
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.960]   to edit actual film.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.680]   It's something that nobody did
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.240]   unless they could make money off of it
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.680]   or whether they were passionate about it
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.480]   because it was just so technical and so expensive
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.320]   and so difficult.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.240]   There's so many steps involved.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.800]   What I like about FaceTime is the fact
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.920]   that you push one button
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.440]   and conceivably you are video chatting with somebody.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.520]   So you're right.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.040]   I don't even like talking to people on the actual film.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.240]   I would much rather text them
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.720]   than much other send a photo.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.120]   But there's so many places.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.320]   I don't have kids,
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.760]   but there's so many times when I'm in some place
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.960]   really incredible and I want to share it
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.240]   with a good friend and say,
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.200]   "Guess we're up call, are you from?"
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.480]   I'm totally in the Forbidden City in Beijing, dude.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.600]   Here's the Forbidden City.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.600]   And it sounds stupid,
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.200]   but you get pleasure out of sharing
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.960]   like you're placing your time with that.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.720]   And also, if you have,
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.560]   if my dad,
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.120]   when the amount of technology that he bought
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.920]   when the first grandchild was coming aboard, okay,
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.280]   he upgraded his camera.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.160]   He up, he bought a brand new camcorder.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.880]   He got all this stuff going.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.080]   I really have to think that if you know
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.000]   that your daughter has an iPhone 4
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   and then the fact that if you have an iPhone 4,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.240]   it means that anytime you call to say hi,
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.960]   you can be looking at live video of your grandkid.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.960]   That might sell some of my $200.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.600]   My dad would have spent that money,
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.440]   boom, without it.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.280]   That's a good,
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.720]   before he could even come up with the alibi for mom,
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.600]   he would have spent that money.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.080]   No, I think that's a very good point.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.080]   You know, it just remains to be seen
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.160]   whether it changes our culture.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:05.480]   It's a big cultural shift to move to video phone calls,
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.360]   more so than you just using Skype, which a lot of us do.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.840]   And I know, before we started, both of you guys said,
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.000]   the only time Skype's ever on in your houses
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.240]   is when you're doing a podcast.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.560]   So maybe Skype hasn't really penetrated as much as I feel like.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.440]   I use it a lot.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:25.040]   No, I mean, I use sex.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.800]   I mean, I don't think so.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.640]   I just saw it on one of those lines that I can't say
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.800]   because we don't have the explicit text.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.640]   OK, I get it.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.200]   All right.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.440]   Sometimes I really feel as if I lose.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.240]   And FaceTime is only Wi-Fi,
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.160]   although that sounds like Steve sounded implied
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.040]   that that might change when carriers came along.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.280]   And by the way, carriers plural.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.000]   It sounds like that's that's as like Dr. No doomsday weapon
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.400]   against AT&C, either increase your coverage
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.680]   or we will enable 3G access for FaceTime.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.320]   You have four hours before we just throw your network.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.640]   One of their features.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.840]   I do think there's a little bit better battery life.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.160]   Have you seen have you seen better battery life?
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.880]   I think that it's better, but I think that's largely eaten up
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:18.200]   by the cost of the screen and the stuff that you do with it.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.680]   The best, the most important metric is,
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.600]   can I get a full day's worth of intermittent use out of it?
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.160]   And when I'm in heavy use, can I get at least three or four
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.240]   hours of use out of it?
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.280]   And that's within that margin quite comfortably.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.880]   What do you think my battery was down after spending three hours
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.600]   doing nothing but shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot,
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.520]   photo, photo, photo, video, video, video.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.880]   After three hours, my battery is down to about 20%.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.240]   I think that's perfectly reasonable for that kind of use.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.400]   Has Macworld done that battery, any battery testing?
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.400]   They have.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.880]   We've gone into the lab with it.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.720]   I'm not sure exactly what the numbers are,
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.920]   but I think we've noticed that it is better.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.920]   It's certainly not iPad-like where you get to the end of the day
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.240]   with your iPad and go, wow, look at that.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.520]   I've still got 68% left.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:05.920]   In my own personal use, I've found that whereas my previous one
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.680]   was just terrible, that I'd get five or six or seven hours
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.640]   and then I'd have to stick the thing in a charger.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.640]   I don't have to do that now.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.720]   I can get to the end of the day of moderate use
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.800]   and still have something left, not a lot,
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.600]   but at least I can get through an entire day.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.840]   Yeah, that's been my experience.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.360]   And that's good.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.840]   Here is a--
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.720]   The real big news, I think, is talking
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.600]   about radio reception and network speeds,
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.560]   because people have been talking about the problems
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.400]   that have with the antenna.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:34.080]   But another thing I was doing is every time--
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.000]   I was keeping a very close eye on my-- the three
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.080]   chances of my personal phone.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.640]   And every time I was in a place where I saw
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.680]   I was not getting the full five bars,
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.640]   I would instantly take out the iPhone 4.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.160]   And I would always have better coverage on the iPhone 4
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.760]   than with the 3GS.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.520]   And now it works with HDU/SPA.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.640]   And so now uploading photos is more than four times faster.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.280]   It was such an improvement of the 3GS.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.840]   That's in a few markets, right?
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.800]   It's not everywhere, is it?
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.680]   I don't know if it's everywhere.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.880]   It is reliant on upgrades that AT&T has made here in New England.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.600]   I didn't have to walk around in order to find that happening.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.160]   Again, more than four times.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.160]   That's nice, then.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:14.080]   Download speeds, too, were increased by--
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.960]   according to my test, about 15%.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.120]   That's nothing to sneeze at.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:21.200]   GPS performance, they put in a much-uprated GPS chip.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.200]   I'm getting signal lock much, much faster.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.320]   I'm getting a lot less walking, so to speak.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.120]   When you're out and you check your average speed,
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.080]   it says, oh, my average speed was 731 miles per hour.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.840]   I guess that was what that boom was like.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.480]   Wasn't a pothole.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.320]   I actually passed the speed of sound.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.440]   That's what happens when GPS suddenly says, oh,
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.760]   actually, he's 50 yards from the left.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.840]   No, he's right back where it was before.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.920]   I'm getting fewer things like that.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.200]   In terms of-- and also, 8211N networking built in,
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.000]   the lower band, not the upper, not both bands,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.680]   but at least you get the lower band there.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:54.840]   So it's unfortunate that there's that problem with the antenna,
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.320]   but it's an easily avoidable problem.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.880]   And the benefits you get from the other features
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.840]   on the hardware, more than make up for it.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.560]   And that's not even talking about the camera,
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.760]   not even talking about the processor,
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.200]   not even talking about the screen.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.600]   I would still upgrade from my 3GS to the iPhone 4
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.200]   if all I got was this improved reception,
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.080]   improved GPS, and improved Wi-Fi.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:14.960]   Wow, you're pretty positive.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.680]   I am not so positive about the antenna issue,
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.160]   but we'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:20.960]   Andy, you're not close.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.480]   You're from the Chicago Sun times, pardon me?
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.400]   I was about to interrupt, but then you're about to go.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.480]   So I'm about to go.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.000]   But interrupt me when I get back.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.760]   How about that?
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.840]   Before you start to get back, I'll
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.680]   keep you from getting back so that Chris and I can continue
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.000]   to show without you and take it in.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.280]   Exciting new direction, I think, readers and advertisers
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.440]   will appreciate it.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.160]   You know, TechCrunch launched TechCrunch TV today,
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.280]   and I was trying to watch a little bit of it.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.480]   And it's so professional.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.120]   It looks so much like real TV, I thought.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.400]   And we don't have anything to fear.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.480]   We're the unprofessional alternative
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.720]   to television on the internet.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.560]   Stay tuned.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.920]   They might hire me as the weatherman,
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.640]   but they wouldn't let me near the anchor desk.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.720]   Never let you near the anchor desk.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.000]   Coming up, we will do a little bit of the negative--
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.520]   maybe a lot of the negative on the iPhone,
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.800]   because I think there are some negatives.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.440]   And in fact, I'm still not convinced
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.600]   that the iPhone is the way to go.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.040]   Despite all of these great things that I do agree with you
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:16.120]   about the camera, the incredible screen,
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.680]   there are some pretty severe negatives.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.360]   We'll talk about those in just a little bit.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:24.480]   Andy Inako, Chris Breen is also here from "World Magazine."
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.680]   He's the MacDaddy, senior editor for Macworld.com.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.240]   Before we go much farther, I do want
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.720]   to mention our friends at Citrix who bring us the fine product
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.880]   we know as go-to meeting.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.720]   These days, you've got these conference calls.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.880]   It seemed to be kind of the deuregrine business.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.720]   But when was the last time you were in a conference call
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:47.440]   that was not kind of tedious, boring, unproductive?
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.400]   There wasn't somebody playing with the Tetris or their farm
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.920]   bill while they were on the phone.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.280]   And you can always tell, because there's a silence all of a sudden.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.440]   And you could tell.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.320]   You've lost them.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.080]   People lose interest.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:36:59.800]   They disengage.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.240]   It's not productive.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.160]   And I think of what happens at the end of a conference call
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.200]   like that, people hang up feeling we've wasted our time.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.140]   That's where go-to meeting can really help.
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:09.880]   Not only make your conference calls more productive,
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.520]   but give people the feeling that really this has been effective.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.160]   This has really happened.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.680]   We were on the same page because you were it literally.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.440]   Here's how it works.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:23.320]   If you go right now to the website, go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.560]   You can sign up for a 30-day free trial, unlimited meetings
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.760]   for 30 days as long as you want as often as you want.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:33.680]   Includes, by the way, free voiceover IP and phone teleconferencing.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.040]   And a great iPad app that's free that really makes it fun
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.800]   to go to a go-to meeting.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.560]   Set it up.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.640]   It takes you 30 seconds.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.000]   Before I'm done talking, you'll have installed.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.720]   Now, the next time you're on a conference call,
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.840]   all you have to do is say, hey, guys, hold on.
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.920]   Let's table this for a minute.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.640]   I really need to show you something.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.520]   Or I want to show you the PowerPoint or the keynote
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.120]   presentation.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:56.160]   I want to show you the spreadsheets, whatever it is.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.200]   Let's work together on this document, whatever it is,
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.920]   that you're meeting about.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:02.160]   Undoubtedly have visuals you're looking at.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.360]   You say, go to meeting.com.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.240]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.000]   They go there 20 seconds later.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.280]   They're seeing your computer on their screens.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.920]   They see your desktop, your slides.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.400]   They can flip it and show you theirs.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.080]   Suddenly, I can't explain it.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.080]   You've got to try this.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.080]   The meeting comes to life.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:17.840]   People are engaged.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.760]   They're excited.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.640]   And they get offline saying, we did something.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.440]   We got something done.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.520]   Mac or PC, 30 days free.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:29.520]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak for a free trial.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.120]   Please do try this.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.560]   I think you'll see it makes a huge difference.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:38.400]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.

[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.920]   You smile in.

[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.840]   By the way, notice that it's not an iPhone 4.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.760]   They're using this phony FaceTime commercial.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.720]   It's over here.

[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.720]   Say hi to your dad.

[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.720]   Yeah, it's a sun.

[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.720]   You know, it's so unfortunate.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:41.580]   fortunate that some people have little tiny,
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:40:00.560]   shehards that can't see. Now much kind of a loser and then you can see it in video.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:18.600]   That is great. Little phony FaceTime from collegehumor.com/originals and I think
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.920]   that that kind of says it all. Maybe there's times when you just really don't want a
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:27.200]   video call. You're listening or watching Mac Break Weekly, Leo Leport with Chris
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:32.380]   Brain, senior editor of Macworld.com. Hello Chris Brain and Andy Inatko who is about to
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:39.080]   interrupt me. No, because I'm sure you're right about whatever it is. All right, so let
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:46.080]   me tell you. Okay, I'm a lefty and I for some reason, maybe it's just me. I think this
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.860]   antenna issue is actually a bigger. At first I poo poo today. In fact, I pointed to an
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:56.720]   article written by an RF engineer saying all phones have this problem. It's a normal thing
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:01.160]   ever since they took antennas out of phones. They've had to put the antenna in the body
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:06.200]   and you're going to have this attenuation if you hold the phone, right, where the antenna
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:10.560]   is. Yada yada yada. So I was really in the first few days saying, you know, I guess this
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:14.920]   is just the way it is. Steve Jobs is right. You should hold it different. You should get
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:19.560]   a case. But I'm going to tell you, I have killed, this is an antenna SIS blog by the
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:25.440]   way, and tennysys.com if you want to read the, I think very, you know, I thought very good
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:30.800]   article about iPhone issues and why it's going to be a problem with all phones. And in fact,
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.560]   it was a problem, apparently with the iPhone three, we tried it with the Palm pre on Thursday
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:40.440]   and at the same thing happened with the Palm pre. But it really correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:47.640]   guys, maybe it's just me. It seems to be a big problem. I routinely kill my phone routinely
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.640]   just by holding it all the time.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:55.440]   Well, it depends on what it's, I think that Apple shouldn't have at least such a glib
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.960]   response saying, well, just don't hold it that way. No deal. Come on. Don't bother
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:05.400]   me this sort of stuff. It is a problem. I again, I have so many phones in this house
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.720]   that when Apple explained that, well, it's something that happens to all phones. We don't
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:13.440]   feel this is a big problem. I, okay, fine, let me get out the iPhone three GS and every
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:18.400]   other phone that I that's working and I really couldn't reproduce that kind of problem with
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:22.080]   any of these other phones that I was having with the iPhone four. And I did notice it from
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.240]   the very moment that I first charged it up and took it out of the box. So it's a bigger
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:32.800]   problem than that. However, now I do think that it is a incredibly good idea for multiple
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.400]   reasons to have your iPhone in some sort of a case.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.680]   I guess I want to get a case, but I thought it was so pretty. I've gotten the, well, I
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:42.840]   mean, the bumper case is going to be a good idea anyway. And if you have anything covering
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:46.600]   the metal, then you're, then it's absolutely not a problem for you. Right.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.640]   Even without the case, I have to hold it in a way that I don't normally hold the phone
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:57.280]   right because I never, I almost never make phone calls like this. Secondly, when I hold
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:02.080]   that I tend to hold it like this so that my thumb could be free. So if it were, if it
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.040]   were the sort of thing where it was impossible to hold it in any sort of a natural way without
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:10.600]   blocking the signal, that would be a problem. If there was any way to, no way to avoid it
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.680]   like putting in a case, that would be a problem. And if there were no other benefit to the
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:18.640]   phone, other than to have this really cool, stylish little border around about it, it
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:22.520]   would be a bigger problem. I don't think it's a deal breaker though. Again, it is a problem,
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.080]   but I don't think it's a deal breaking problem. You agree? I have. I didn't cancel my order
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.800]   after this. That's right. Thank you. So you agree, Chris Green?
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:33.760]   I certainly think it's a PR issue for them. And I do, I agree with Andy. I think their
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:39.000]   response at first was ill considered the idea that somebody spent a lot of money on this
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.360]   device. And Apple has said it's magical and wonderful. And yet they said, well, yes,
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:47.840]   you can't hold it as you normally do. I'm a right handed person and I hold it my left
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:54.480]   hand so that I have my right hand to do things with. And I do cover those things with my
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:44:01.600]   hand. But Apple has to have some kind of response other than, oh, we'll hold it differently,
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.600]   or all phones do it when maybe they don't. But maybe that answer is that either isn't
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:11.840]   huh, we didn't know. What I am surprised is that given the amount of time they spent
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.600]   with this thing and testing it that somewhere along the line, somebody didn't say, Oh, have
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:19.120]   you noticed the bars dropping? We do this and I don't know if it's because that's
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:24.080]   their internal and saying, Oh, gee, well, we have so much coverage here. Nothing can,
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:29.280]   you know, it can penetrate our sweaty palms. But I think it is surprising. And it seems
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:36.360]   that Apple was caught off guard on this and needs to come up with a fix or at least a
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:42.440]   better explanation about what's going on either a it is a problem, hold it differently, or
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:47.640]   no, it isn't a problem at all. Look somewhere else. Well, I mean, clearly, it's it's bad
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:52.440]   timing given or a bad thing to have haven't given people's complaints about drop calls.
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:58.200]   I mean, it's just it resonates in the psyche that Apple's Oh, another problem with drop
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:05.320]   calls or another problem with their reception. I had my attitude was the same until I until
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:09.560]   I realized I can't use this phone because I'm sorry, you could try to train me. I'm gonna
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.680]   have to get a case. I guess. I mean, I can't use this phone without a case is the point.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.640]   But you're gonna you could try to train me, but it always goes back to holding it the same
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:20.040]   way. You know, and I don't want to have to think about like, I'd hold it with two fingers.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:25.880]   Daniel Aaron Dilger writes in Apple insider.com. He says he tweeted, Yeah, and if you cover the
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:30.040]   microphone, you can't speak and you cover the earpiece, you can't hear. It's not that. It's
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:36.520]   not that it is something that should work better. It's almost a deal breaker. It's that bad for me.
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:41.080]   I mean, I don't want a phone that I can accidentally mishold and lose the call. That's just dumb.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:46.280]   Anyway, it may be a software flaw. This is the interesting surprise. Apple says it's going to
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:56.200]   ship 4.01 early next week. And some people have observed that the same problem was not
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:04.600]   as big a problem in the 3GS until iOS 4. It's thought that perhaps the flaw is that when you
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:09.640]   short out the phone like that by covering this plastic band at the bottom of the left hand side,
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:14.680]   the phone is supposed to jump to another frequency. Instead, it turns the radio off.
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:23.720]   And so that somehow it's not calibrated correctly and that if the software fix could actually fix
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:28.840]   the problem. Does that make sense? Huh. Okay. If it's it could, I'll waste.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:34.120]   If that's the way it's being described where it's not simply that universal performance of that
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:37.240]   intended to grade, it's simply that it's supposed to switch through different frequency and the software
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:43.000]   that controls that is not working. That's certainly possible. I mean, I'm with Chris. It seems
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   incredible to me that this problem would not have ever surfaced during testing. Yeah, that's
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.080]   it's and by that by that, I don't mean that something suspicious. I'm saying I'm trying to work
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:57.960]   out a scenario in which they could figure they could have found this out at some point at during
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:02.680]   the development process and not been able to fix it or not been able to make a tweak or at least
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:07.640]   said this is a deal breaking issue. We need to we need to stop or at least delay. Also, Daniel
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:11.960]   points out in his article on Apple Insider and this confirms your experience, Chris Breen, that it
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:17.240]   only occurs on a WN3G network, not with a micro cell 3G network.
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:22.840]   Right. I have a micro cell in my office because I get no reception otherwise and it's
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:32.120]   it's that far away from me now. So I could put this thing in a in a black box from a crashed airline
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:35.880]   and I would still get reception on it because I'm that close to the thing and I've tried it
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:41.160]   around the house and I've done everything I could to try to cover the antenna and see if I can get
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:47.240]   the bar sticker up and it just it just won't happen. So my concern is, you know, will Apple,
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:52.760]   will their hardware fix basically be to send every iPhone 4 owner a little sticker that has
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:55.560]   five bars in it that you just place right there?
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:48:00.760]   No, because when I first heard about this, I was I thought, well, he said a perception issue
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.280]   that the bars are dropping, but you're actually not losing calls, but your experience seems to
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.880]   indicate that no, you actually lose calls. No, no, I am. Now, the funny thing is I don't make
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:11.800]   that many calls and I suspect most iPhone users make far fewer calls than they used to.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:17.240]   And I do do Bluetooth calls more often than not. It doesn't drop off on Bluetooth calls.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.560]   But if but it was really annoying to put the phone next to your ear and lose the call because you're
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:29.080]   holding it as I would normally hold a phone is extremely annoying. There's another problem that
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:33.160]   I have noted. I don't know if you guys have noted, but something's wrong with the accelerometer.
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:39.320]   Almost immediately I put the thing up to my ear and I muted the call twice. Normally on an iPhone,
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:44.360]   you hold it up. It turns off the screen. It doesn't seem to be doing that or it's doing it
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:49.480]   inconsistently. Have you noticed that problem? I haven't noticed it, but some people have been
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:53.640]   mentioning problems with the proximity sensor. I talked to some of the people who or whom that
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:57.400]   was happening. They couldn't describe it to me accurately enough. That could really feel as though
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:02.120]   I understood the problem. Yeah, and I may it may be and I should always say this, you know, it's just
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:07.080]   this is my experience with one phone. So maybe I have a lemon, although I do see a lot of others
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:12.600]   reporting this problem. And it was it was surprised me because I never had this problem in the
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.800]   iPhone before. And I said one of that was one of the most elegant things that the iPhone did
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:20.840]   was when you're on a call and you hold it up to your ear, the screen can't be touched. And it was
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:25.800]   really shocking me that I was muting the calls. I was dialing. People, I apologize for people I
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:30.360]   talked to in the first couple of days after I got the iPhone because I was sending long dial tones
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:36.200]   down the pipe and I was I was so unexpected. I didn't think it was me. I couldn't figure out
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:42.360]   what was going on. Oh, it was you, but it was also technical. It was me and it was the
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:47.480]   phone and it made just be texting obscenities to people accidentally making a call.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:52.440]   What about the yellow dots problem? There was some suggestion by one person on a forum that it
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:57.400]   went away with time that it was probably the glue hadn't dried. The laminate and glue that
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:02.280]   laminate the glass to the LCD panel have. I guess with your Mac 911 column, Chris Breen,
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:08.280]   you would have heard a lot about this. Yeah, I heard the reports and it seems to be everybody's
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:12.920]   experience who's gone through it is I would just wait a couple of days in the glue will dry and
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:17.720]   you won't see the ill spots anymore. And in the last few days, I haven't heard a single
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:23.880]   people about it. So either it's true or it was limited to a very small number of phones and it
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:30.360]   did clear itself up. Or people are just so amazed by their phones. They're not paying any attention.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:38.680]   He never heard anybody. Those are some very, very long shifts of the Fox Con factory. They
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:45.000]   have to be quoted. You think that's an understanding? I'm not saying. I'm just just guessing.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.200]   Just unifying. I'm just promoting rumors and scandal.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:56.280]   All right. Enough. I think we'd agree that what do we agree is the iPhone, the
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:03.800]   the must buy phone of the of the of the month. I was going to say the year, but I think we can
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:10.360]   at least say the month. Can't we? I would wait till next week to see if Apple uses that update.
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:16.520]   If this if this antenna issue can be solved and software, that would be great if it were solved so
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:22.360]   that people would would not be able to or wouldn't have to go in thinking, huh, I actually need my
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:28.120]   iPhone to work as a phone and I'm concerned about drop calls. Apple has to address this in some way
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:31.720]   and we'll see you next week if they really do come out with a software update that deals with it.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:35.480]   It is an unusually competitive environment, much more so than it has been in the past.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:40.760]   We have a droid X coming out the droid to coming out. These new Samsung Galaxy S based phones are
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:44.760]   coming out in a variety of different form factors with keyboards and not keyboards.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:48.520]   There's some great phones based on Android coming out this month.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.240]   Yeah, I mean, I've practically had to put out and that is also going to be the droid to
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:56.520]   droid to coming out in August for those of you who like flip out keyboards.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:02.280]   It's almost so that I really actually have to map out of my upcoming phone reviews to make
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.960]   sure that I'm not doing the entire month of phone reviews. I'm not kidding.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:09.720]   Problem of the past couple of months. Yeah, but you know, there is something that Apple has a
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:14.040]   consistent problem with that they are always so committed to developing new design concepts,
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:19.000]   a new manufacturing processes that this is just general advice that I give people that when
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.800]   Apple develops a brand new way of putting something together, whether it's the brand new Mac mini,
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:30.440]   this brand new iPhone or the way redesign the chassis of a MacBook, if you can, it's not a bad
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:35.480]   idea to wait a month or two because they're not really going to understand all the problems of
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:42.200]   the process and the design until they have 100,000, 200,000, a million of these out and being used on
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:47.480]   a daily basis. I honestly do think that this is such a radical new design that we are going to
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:54.360]   see a revision be at some point in the next year. And it is just a phone. Like I said before,
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:58.840]   the antenna problem doesn't affect me the way that it apparently affects some other people.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:04.200]   Even if it did, there's an easy workaround for it. And I think the added benefits of the iPhone 4
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:08.120]   outweigh that kind of the inconvenience of having to put that little band around it. But I mean,
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:13.720]   your mileage may vary, I suppose. Yeah. By the way, if you can't find anybody to FaceTime with
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:17.800]   Apple has solved that problem quite conveniently. One 888 FaceTime.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:28.120]   Sounds like a joke. I called out FaceTime with you. 888 FaceTime gets so humid here in the college
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:32.920]   Co-ed dorm. Do you mind? I just a little overheated.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:39.720]   You got it. I bet that they invented that job just for the engineer who lost the phone.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:45.080]   The beer hall. This is your punch. This is your one 888 FaceTime.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:51.880]   You're not being fired. Bad news. You're that guy.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:58.520]   So, a new dance monkey dance button on the phone. Have either of you come on. I haven't called it.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.880]   Have any of you called it? Should we call it? Sorry.
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.840]   You're going to call. Let's find out. I don't know what will happen.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:11.240]   Let me try it. Why not? Dial carefully. I'm afraid if you've one digit off, who knows what you're
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:15.400]   going to end up with. Yeah, that's a good point. We don't want to do it wrong here. Let me pull up.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:20.920]   Okay. 888. This is one of the interesting things about the iPhone is that
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:28.680]   when you do FaceTime, you make a phone connection first. And I say it's not going to cost you minutes
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:32.440]   once you go to FaceTime. But it's a little counterintuitive because it seems like you're
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:39.080]   making a phone call. Now, if the person is in your directory, in your contact list, you could
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:44.200]   directly FaceTime them via Wi-Fi only. So, all right. This is exciting.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:51.480]   Oh, there we go. Hey, don't hold it that way.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:57.400]   It keeps going dark on me. All right. FaceTime. Hello.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:05.560]   FaceTime failed. FaceTime failed. What's going on here? Hello.
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:17.640]   It says I have to be calling with an iPhone 4. Yeah, are you? Yeah, I think it's an iPhone 4.
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:24.040]   It has this. It says the square buttons. Let's try that again. Your Wi-Fi signal isn't like down to
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:31.400]   zero bars or anything. Oh, I'm full Wi-Fi. Oh, well. Hi. I don't see the face. I just wanted to try
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:39.000]   the FaceTime. It's not. It's failing. My name is Leo. All right.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:48.280]   Oh, I don't really want to give that out. I just I'm just wondering if why it won't
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:56:01.160]   it seems same fail. Oh, you have to call me back. Oh, okay. Well, I'll try this another time. Thank you.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:05.640]   I'll try the better ball hotline. Maybe the FaceTime.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:11.880]   Do you think? I wonder if that's a good question. If the third part of third parties,
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:16.680]   I can see FaceTime roulette. Oh, God. Now I hate the.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:22.680]   You know, there is one industry right now that has a FaceTime number. You got to think,
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:30.440]   oh, you know they do. You got to think, well, uh, dial X, X, X. Operators are standing by. Yeah.
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:36.360]   Lying by it's funny that he didn't know my phone number. I don't know why he wouldn't know my phone
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:43.960]   number. Everybody knows your phone number. Well, I mean, it doesn't it. I'll let I'll leave it to
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:51.240]   somebody in the chat room to try it and see it. Yeah, I couldn't say obviously I couldn't continue
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:55.240]   because I can't say my phone number on the air because then I'll never be able to use this phone
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:57:01.560]   again. I happened once before and it wasn't wasn't pretty. All right. Anything else you want to say
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:11.320]   about the iPhone before we move on? Oh, not really. Apple site accidentally reveals there will be an
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:18.760]   iWork for the iPhone. We don't know if this is a typo or what, but a screenshot highlighting the
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:26.040]   iPhone's ability with iOS four to open attachments and external applications showed the words iWork
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:32.520]   for the iPhone. Right. And earlier during the actual launch week, they there was a screenshot
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:38.120]   that had opening keynote, I believe before they pulled that one down. Right. They got they got a
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:42.040]   change in O ring there on the PR the PR looks because things are leaking out.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:48.120]   That's back rumors.com with that story. I don't know. It doesn't make me jump up and down. I bought
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:53.080]   it, of course, in the iPad, but I've rarely used it. I mean, I saw keynote keynote
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:58.120]   presentations and plug the thing into it. Yeah. Projector keynote would be pretty neat.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:07.000]   I guess, let's see any other iPhone stories just before we move on. Oh, Kindle.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:13.560]   The Kindle app is updated for the iPhone and the iPad. Add video and audio support.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:19.320]   So that's interesting. Of course, you'd have to have books that have audio and video. I don't
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:24.440]   know of any yet, but that's a that's a really interesting play, especially on the iPad, I think,
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:30.520]   because it means the publishers who are publishing to the Kindle platform may want to start including
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:36.200]   multimedia in there. Right. Well, actually, actually, though, if we're moving off of iPhone 4 into
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:40.440]   iPhone and iPad in general, Hulu has just announced that they're going to be offering Hulu to the
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:45.320]   iPad and the iPhone for 995 a month. I know. I think that's very interesting story. This is
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:50.840]   who that plus you can download it. Let me zoom out a little bit here for you. We've already
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:56.440]   downloaded it. Oh, it's going to be my next story. Hulu. Sorry. Sorry. You're like, I didn't know.
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:00.520]   See, I and only the news only came across. I got to have been going for 20, 30 minutes. I
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:04.120]   took my phone. There are times when I've hauled off and said, I said in my pick of the week,
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:08.200]   I'd like to talk about Steve Jobs resigning as CEO, which he just announced 20 minutes ago.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:11.800]   What? And it's having bought a sit on the International Space Station.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:19.400]   Careful. So, plus will be $10 a month, 999 a month, more episodes, more seasons, more shows now on
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:27.480]   your TV, iPhone and iPad in HD. You can go to the store, the app store and download it for free.
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:32.520]   But you have to request, if you want it, you have to request an invitation. And as soon as I
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:39.160]   press request an invite, I got this service is not yet available. Sorry. Check back often.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:44.360]   You can't even request the invite. So, a little premature putting the application up on the
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.560]   store since you can't access it via the web. I access it via just a desktop browser and it
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:54.200]   works just fine. Yeah. Yes. Maybe I could sign in via desktop browser. Right.
[00:59:54.200 --> 01:00:01.480]   The following clip is brought to you by Kin. If that's the Microsoft Kin, I'll be amazed.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:07.320]   And there's and there you have it. Not exactly HD, but I am able to watch the family guy
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:16.680]   on my iPad. So, that's kind of that's that is that's huge news. I'm not expected. We'd heard
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:20.680]   the rumor about it for a while. Yeah. But it's nice that's actually coming through. And that's
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:26.440]   that's just another brick out of the out of the flash wall that that basically when people
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:30.920]   complain that they don't get flash content or don't get streaming video on the iPad is another
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:35.720]   sense. There's another sign that well companies that do streaming video are willing to convert
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:38.840]   their content and accommodate the flag the iPad and the iPhone on their own.
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:46.280]   Who finally has a plan? Yeah. Right. They have the web browser and they keep locking people
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:52.680]   like Boxy out. So, finally, yes, oh, we're going to make you pay for this. And it's fine as long as
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:58.200]   they get their catalog updates. So, I get an entire season of programs instead of the third,
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:03.320]   seventh and 12th episode of something possibly more important really to the future of non flash
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:08.840]   video. The fact that according to conceivably tech, a leading adult film studio digital playground
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:15.800]   has announced its intentions to go to HTML5 and abandon the flash platform where porno goes.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:23.640]   Who can fail to follow? And it's already happening. Not that I spend much time checking out these
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:30.360]   sites, but as part of my research to to see what's happening in terms of HTML5 versus flash,
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:34.120]   there are sites that are already doing this. So, they made iPad compatible.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:37.480]   Oh, yeah, of course. And they've always been on the cutting edge of this stuff. So,
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:43.240]   there are these sites that are converting their content over to iPad and iPhone format.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:47.880]   They're doing it very quickly because they understand that's where the future is and they
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:53.880]   don't want to be stuck with this old tech. Right. iPhone sells 1.7 million in the first three days.
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:57.720]   The best selling iPhone to date, that kind of underscores what we were saying that
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.560]   that people want this. They're ready to upgrade for some reason.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:06.840]   iPhone iMovie has been hacked to work on the even on the 3GS.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:14.600]   That must be interesting installation. Yeah. Yeah, because the story indicates that
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:21.480]   we have to have a jail broken 3GS to do it. But that its performance is actually quite acceptable
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:25.960]   because Apple has been saying, no, no, you have to have it on the iPhone 4 because of the
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:30.920]   necessity of the faster processor and the more RAM that's inside the iPhone 4.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:36.440]   And yet they hacked it. They found it. If you put it on a jail broken 3GS, it works fine.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:43.080]   And so, the question is, is it really a performance issue or is it just another thing to tempt people
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:50.200]   to purchase an iPhone 4? I would bet that the amount of RAM, which is 256 megs on an iPhone 3GS
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:56.440]   versus 512 on an iPhone 4, is not a limiting issue because 256 megs is exactly what's on the
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.960]   iPad. And you got to believe they plan on doing iMovie. They should if they don't. If they don't do
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:04.920]   iMovie for the iPad, they're really missing a bet. Yeah. And real director already works on an
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:10.680]   iPad and also works on a earlier version. So you can edit video on these devices without a problem.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:16.280]   I like real director. That was a pick of ours some months ago. In fact, people said, oh, iMovie on
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:20.200]   the iPhone. I said, well, real director has been doing the same thing. Maybe arguably better
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:25.240]   for some time. If you like iMovie for $5, you might be should look at real director.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:29.400]   Is it five? I don't know if it's them. Real director is four.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:33.560]   Yeah. So it's a buck less. It doesn't do certain things. Like you can't shoot
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:38.440]   video directly from the iPhone into real director. So you have to shoot it in the camera app and
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:44.040]   then import. Not a surprise. Not a surprise. I find his output is not as good as iMovie.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:50.680]   When you export from real director, it's it's uglier than it is coming out of iMovie. But you
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:57.240]   can split clips that you can't do in iMovie. You have control over titles. So in iMovie,
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:01.720]   you can't control the length of a title or change the font. And you can do that in real
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:05.160]   director. But the real director's interface is also more complicated. So you have to spend more time
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:12.120]   with it. I want to move on and talk more in just a bit about the news in the Mac world. But before
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:17.880]   we do that, I want to mention also a new sponsor, hover.com. We've been talking about them for a week
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:23.480]   or two. I have we've moved all our sites over to hover.com. I'm kind of a hover fan. If you haven't
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:30.280]   tried it, you might remember it as domains direct. That's the new name is hover. H-O-V-E-R.com.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:35.320]   They've been selling domains for more than 13 years. They've been around a long time. But
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:41.080]   hover has made it very straightforward, very simple. In fact, if you go to twit.hover.com,
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:46.840]   that's our special URL. You'll get a special deal on your domain names, a little discount.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:54.840]   10% off. You also see what a great site this is in one simple respect. It's easy. It's clean.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:05:00.520]   There's not 50 pages at 50 clicks before you get your domain. They've got a complete help resource.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:05.880]   Lots of information there about managing forwarding and transferring domains and email.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:12.440]   Very affordable domain forwarding with no email starting for $15 with one email box, $35.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:20.440]   Four email boxes, $60. The domain registration is as simple as can be. It's where I get my domain
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:30.920]   names now. I encourage you to do so, especially because their support is fantastic. Hover. H-O-V-E-R.com.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:35.960]   They decided there had to be an easier way to register and manage domains and email.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:41.320]   They've started it with hover. Do me a favor. Next time you want to register a domain name,
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:48.760]   just give it a try. twit.hover.com saved 10% when you use that URL.
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:55.080]   twit.hover.com. Thank you so much for their support of Mac. Break weekly.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:06:02.600]   So let's see here. What else is big in the nudes right now? Chrome beating Safari
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:10.360]   as the number one browser. You'd think Safari would have a kind of complete
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:14.680]   domination on the Mac side, but even I am using Chrome now that it's out on the Mac. I really like
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:20.600]   it. Which do you guys use? Chris are using Safari still? Yeah, I jump around. I use Safari
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:26.840]   sometimes. I use Chrome sometimes. Firefox at all? Yeah, I do use Firefox. We have the kind of
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:32.520]   publishing system we use at work. Isn't compatible with everything in Safari. I start my work in
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:37.240]   Safari and then every so often I'll find something where I can't load graphics and I need to jump
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:43.400]   over to Firefox to do that. I like Firefox a lot, but some reason I keep jumping back to Safari
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:48.680]   every time that come out with a new version. Just to try it. I've got some tools that work
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:52.840]   with Safari for doing various tools. Do you notice a big improvement with Safari 5?
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:59.560]   Does it feel faster to you? Not really. Maybe it's because I simply,
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:03.800]   because I'm always banging around to a different browser, that I haven't committed fully to any
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:08.760]   single browser. So when I get an update, I don't suddenly go, "Wow, this is so much faster." Because
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:13.080]   I think, "Well, no way, is it faster than Firefox or which one was faster yesterday than the one
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:21.560]   before?" Maybe that was Chrome. I don't know. So I jumped to Safari 5, but yeah, this is fine.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:28.040]   It's acceptable, but I didn't suddenly go, "Wow, how about you, Andy?" Yeah, I can't really, I don't
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:32.440]   really pledge allegiance to anyone browser. I'm sticking with Safari because it's prettier. I
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:37.880]   like the reader feature. There's just one thing I don't like about Chrome. I need to be able to
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:43.320]   drag Windows around. I don't know why they decided to make the title bar into a tab bar,
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:46.120]   because now every time I try to move around a window, I wind up switching to a different tab
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:53.400]   instead. It's not a big deal. It's just I just can't get my head around it. It's not that I'm
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:08:00.120]   boycotting it for that reason. To me, a browser is just a very practical and functional piece of
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:05.640]   software that and all of its features are inside the page itself. It's not so much the features around
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:12.200]   it. It's a utility, really. Exactly. Maybe someday I'll find a plugin that's available for
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:15.960]   one browser but not the others that totally transforms the experience and makes it into a deal
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:20.680]   breaker for me. If I had an Android phone, I'd certainly be switching to Chrome because all the
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:27.720]   really good plugins that take advantage of Froyo 2.2 are available first for the Chrome browser.
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:32.040]   The in level of integration you have between the browser and Froyo phone is pretty high,
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:35.240]   but that's not applicable to me. I've been sticking with Safari.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:41.080]   Here's a story that I thought was inflammatory. I bring it to your attention
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:48.120]   with a caution that there's no confirmation of this. It came out a week ago from addictivetips.com.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:54.040]   According to them, an Apple employee who works in the iPhone development department leaked
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:09:02.200]   information, most of which will come as a nasty shock to users. According to this employee,
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:10.360]   with iOS 4, AT&T locks all US iPhone owners to their network via regular, like every 7 to 14 days,
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:14.840]   OTA updates. In other words, you try to use this with another, we don't know yet. I guess we'll find
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:22.520]   out. If you try to use this with another carrier, you'll be locked down. Apparently, Apple is
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:29.960]   saving user information via FaceTime. FaceTime lacks encryption. This would be easy to verify.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:36.600]   And as a result, according to this leak, some Apple employees are just staying away from iOS 4.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:43.240]   They're nervous about iOS 4. According to this leaker, there's a line of code that sends over
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:47.640]   the air updates to the user every 7 to 14 days, which detects and locks the system if you're not
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:54.840]   using AT&T. I haven't seen confirmation of this. Now, the phone has been jailbroken. I was at
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:10:01.480]   food camp over the weekend with Sorek, the guy who does Sedia, the store on the jailbroken iPhones,
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:05.160]   and he came up to me all excited Sunday morning and said, "They jailbroken. I was up late last night."
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:11.400]   I think it's a 17 or 18 year old kid who does the main jailbreaking. So it didn't take him long
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:18.840]   to do that. So I think we'll find out pretty quick if this OTA update doesn't make a change.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:24.440]   And I would guess that if that's the case, that the jailbreakers are on it as well.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:32.360]   Oh, yeah. They're so fast. And I'm actually surprised that the main jailbreaker is as old as 17.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:38.600]   I think it's always a 12 year old. But before they hit puberty, it gets distracted.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:46.200]   So, yeah, I am following this simply from the jailbreaker side of it because I've
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.840]   jailbroken a bunch of stuff and I'm interested in to see how this works. And I expect they all
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:55.240]   be the ones to let us know pretty quickly and then find a way to get around it because they
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:11:00.360]   always do. One of the reasons people jailbroken, of course, was for a variety of apps you can't get,
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:05.000]   but the other one was things like multitasking. What do you guys think of the multitasking in iOS
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.200]   before? I think it works great. It's obviously a little bit more limited than what you get in
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:14.920]   Android. But the first time that I was able to live a dream that I've had for the past year,
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:22.120]   which is to use the GPS turn by turn navigation app that I like, which is motion XGP.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:26.600]   I love it, by the way, on your recommendation, I bought it on the iPad. It's remarkable.
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:31.880]   Absolutely love it. But I wish it had a really good dashboard because oftentimes I'm using it.
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:36.360]   I just need verbal cues that, oh, by the way, your exit is coming up. I really prefer to have
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:43.160]   that a smart HUD. So the ability to have the that heads up display program, giving me my speed
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:50.200]   and my travel information. Meanwhile, having voice, voice turn by turn directions from the other GPS
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:55.160]   app also ran in the background. Both have access to the GPS is a really big win.
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:59.880]   Have you tried this motion X on the iPad? Yeah, as a matter of fact,
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:04.520]   while the while the while the during the geek cruise while the ship was pulling out of New York
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.680]   Harbor. That's when hey, I want to get picture of the statuar load. Oh, it's on the wrong side.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:13.800]   Hey, I want to get a picture of the oh, we've already passed it. And it really do feel like a
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:19.960]   navigator when you have this huge moving map with all kinds of details and you can zoom in on it
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:26.280]   at any point. I do think the interface is a little bit cluttered, but it is a fantastic app. It's
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:32.680]   it's so tempting for me to buy a car mount for my iPad because I just I just want that
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:36.920]   mallet. I've got a car with 120,000 miles on it. I expect to put another 30 on it before I buy
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.840]   another one. I just like the idea that it just has like the trip computer from the
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:48.280]   Millennium Falcon Center console. It does. It's monster. Yeah. So this will run in multitasking
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:51.960]   on the iPhone, not on the iPad, obviously. Yes. Right. It will it will run happily in the
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:56.120]   background and keep giving you just the audio. You don't you obviously can't and exactly
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:59.720]   and of course when you switch back to it, it doesn't need to recapture GPS to sneak
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:03.400]   a relaunch as it used to like an iPhone three. It's just it's just been keeping tabs in your
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:07.800]   location all you all you go. One of the things that puzzled me about the multitasking, if you
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:14.680]   look at the multitasking, everything you've ever run is is in there. How much of that
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:20.440]   is really running? You know, I double tap here and I get, you know, just kind of like this endless
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:25.160]   list of apps stuff I haven't run for days. Is this all running in the background? No,
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:29.560]   it's all those are indication of recent apps that you've been running. I see. You can't
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:34.040]   you want to hold. You were doing yesterday. Right. Yeah. You can't press and hold and subtract
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:40.200]   them from the list. So these are not that's typical of Apple. It's not very clear what these are.
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:47.640]   They show up in the multitasking pane. Yeah, you'll see them in descending order. So the most
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:52.360]   recent app that you left is, you know, if it's not currently running will be on the farthest
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:57.880]   to the left closest to the to the iPod area. So you could dash back to that if you want to.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:02.440]   And finally, there is orientation lock. It's if you scroll all the way to the left, you get player
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:07.240]   controls for whatever music players playing. I guess it knows the difference in iPod and Pandora
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:10.680]   because whatever is running in the background, that's what you get the controls for. And I like
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:15.880]   the orientation lock because that's something I use sometimes on the iPad and it's really handy
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:21.400]   to have that. But it's not real multitasking going on here. Is it? I mean, is it, is it?
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:27.320]   Well, I mean, it's it's as it's no mobile device does real, real multitasking or at least not
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:31.400]   according to the tests you would possibly you'd develop if you were to define it the way we define
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:35.880]   desktop multitasking. And it's not as ambitious as what you'd find on Android and some other
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:40.600]   operating systems. But it is true multitasking in that events really do keep happening in the
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.120]   background with third party apps while other things are going on in the foreground. The
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:49.160]   difference is that you don't have the sort of thing where any arbitrary application simply by
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:53.960]   virtue of the fact that it's running on OS four keeps running and stays completely active in the
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:59.240]   background. So if you if you have like a photo uploader, you don't have to stay inside the app
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:04.200]   for the next eight minutes while continues to upload like your 30 or 40 photos to Flickr.
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:08.920]   You can move to the foreground, the app if it's properly written, can tell the OS, oh, by the way,
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.920]   I've got this task that I'm in the middle of. If you could just make sure you don't suspend me
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:18.840]   until I finish this task, that would be awesome. So thank you. So it's it's it's more of a practical
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:23.800]   and functional multitasking that focuses on things that you would really want to be want an app to
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:28.280]   do in the background as opposed to all a cart, whatever the app is, let's do whatever it wants
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:32.840]   in the background. If an app is multitasking where it will continue to run in the background
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:39.240]   along as resources are available. Running in the well when it doesn't run in the background per
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:45.160]   say it has to be one of these seven app apple created seven APIs, seven specific kinds of tasks
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:49.640]   that an application can continue to do in the background, just absolutely just full out,
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:54.520]   continue doing the background. That's why Pandora can continue to stream music. That's one of those
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:16:00.040]   APIs. It uses Apple's own code for streaming music and the for providing an audio channel in
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:04.680]   the background. Same thing for keeping navigation going. Same thing for keeping spoken commands
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:09.640]   going, that sort of thing. If you wanted to do but it's not arbitrary, if I were creating a Twitter
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:14.040]   a Twitter client and I wanted to make sure that every time that the application stays in the
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:20.040]   background and always badges from the foreground, how many direct messages and how many times
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.600]   certain keyword has been mentioned, it can't do that through multitasking. It would still have
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:34.280]   to do that through push notifications. Let's see, what else can we talk about today before we get
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:43.320]   our picks of the week? We talked about Hulu, we talked about all about the iPhone, any other big
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:50.280]   stories that I've left out? iPhone sales, 1.7 million, pretty amazing. Oh, there is a rumor,
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:56.360]   we don't know if it's true that the iOS 4 will come to the iPad in November. We knew it would be
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:07.480]   sometime later this year. This from a release for iAd, outlining advertising plans for iAds.
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:13.000]   iAds will go live on iOS apps for the iPhone and iPod Touch starting July 1.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:21.160]   And the story in advertising age said some are weeks, perhaps months away from having an iAd in
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:26.040]   the system. But an agency exec with several iAds in the works says most advertisers won't be there
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:32.760]   in July 1st, there just isn't enough time. And that November will be when it hits the iPad. I mean,
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:38.440]   it's not like I'm waiting with Bated Breath for iAds. I guess I can live with the fact that they
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:45.960]   won't be ready July 1. And iOS 4 on the iPad though should be pretty nice. I imagine it will be iOS
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:53.320]   4.01 or 4.1. Yeah, again, background multitasking, it isn't the full, the full bore multitasking that
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:57.000]   you're getting on the desktop. It's not even the more ambitious kind of getting on Android.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.880]   But it really does change the way you interact with the device, even if it's just the idea that I can
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:06.840]   leave an application, come back to it 10 seconds or 10 days later. And ideally, it will actually
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:12.040]   be exact where I left. I don't have to see that startup screen again and go through the update
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:17.880]   process all over again. Just that alone just really changes how happy you are using the iPhone
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:23.880]   in the iPad. And I'm completely used to unified inbox now so that when I go to my iPad and I go
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:29.000]   to mail to check mail, really do I have to check every single account I had instead of.
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:33.960]   It's amazing how quickly I got used to the idea of the unified inbox and how much I like it.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:39.080]   So it does seem jumping to iPad now. I was going, oh, no, I got to go back and form.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:47.800]   By the way, thanks to Houdini 7 for updating our TWIT app to work with iOS 4. And it does now
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:52.600]   background multitask. It must, he did it like in a day or two. So thank you, Houdini.
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:56.760]   So if you are a user of the TWIT app on the iPhone, you'll be able to multitask in the
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:03.000]   back or continue to listen to TWIT as you do other things. According to iSupply,
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:14.680]   the Apple iPhone costs Apple about $171 to build. If you add in another $35 for licensing fees and
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:21.240]   set aside for warranty claims, a total cost of the phone, $208. Just a little bit more than the
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:29.320]   subsidized price, 32 gigabyte iPhone 4, total cost of $230 for that extra gigabyte of RAM.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:34.360]   That sounds like it must be one of the most expensive iPhones yet.
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:40.680]   Yeah, I think that the report, one of the teardown reports was saying that the display alone
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:45.160]   costs something a little less than 30 bucks, which is pretty high for the cost of a phone.
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:53.640]   Yeah, that's the LG IPS display, nice display. Also 24 bucks for the flash RAM.
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:20:01.800]   So, I mean, look, there's a good healthy profit margin in this. Nobody's denying it.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:08.520]   But it is a fairly expensive phone to make. We took it apart on Thursday. We had the iPhone
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:13.960]   repair guy in and he took it apart and he said, "This is the nicest build yet." He said,
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:20.920]   "A very tight, very well finished internally as well as externally, a really well done hardware device."
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:28.920]   See, I supply estimated the 8 gigabyte, no, I guess it's getting cheaper. The 8 gigabyte
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:35.320]   first generation iPhone was $263 with a 56% profit margin. So, the costs are down about 30%
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:42.040]   since they introduced the iPhone in 2007. Get more? Pay less. It seems to be the way it is in the
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:48.920]   micro world. Then they didn't have any other phones like they're competing with.
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:54.200]   That's right. It's incredible. Every month they get another phone that is iPhone-like and
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:58.280]   very, very good. Yeah. It's great news for... They needed to jump.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:02.200]   Great news for consumers that we do have these choices. And I have to say,
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:07.800]   I have still undecided about whether I'll move to the iPhone 4. I'm really happy with the Nexus
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:17.000]   1 running 2.2. I'll miss something on either one, to be honest. But I think I'm really leaning
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:23.320]   towards the iPhone for one simple reason, the incredible still camera. Having a great 5 megapixel
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:28.760]   camera in your pocket is really nice. I took a lot of pictures this week.
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:34.040]   Particularly when you combine it with a great application like Auto Stitch, I did a couple of
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:39.880]   panoramas over the weekend. And when you start off with a camera that is that good,
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:45.000]   and then you stitch together several of these five megapixel images from a landscape.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.160]   We'll have to try this. What you wind up with is something that's like,
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:53.560]   "My God, I just made a bus ad." I need to call the Altoids people because they'll give you 80 bucks
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:58.200]   for this easy. When we were in China one year ago, Andy, I did a lot of auto stitching.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:02.360]   Is that still your favorite or is Pano? Do you like Pano better? What is that? Which is your favorite?
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:10.360]   I still like Auto Stitch. I should go back and check out Pano. I do remember that I checked out
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:15.560]   Auto Stitch Pano on another one, and it really was no contest. Auto Stitch was the easiest. It produced
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:22.200]   the nicest, the smoothest panoramas, the least amount of fuss, and the one I was happy to swim.
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:27.480]   As you've just reminded me though, the problem of iPhone apps is that in a competitive market,
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:30.920]   there's such leapfrog going on that just because you gave up on something a year ago,
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:34.200]   does it mean that this company hasn't found their car keys in the last year or so?
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:39.800]   When I'm at, how are you guys using photos? Do you like folders? Are you using them? Are they
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:43.400]   satisfying? Would you like a better implementation?
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:50.440]   I like a slightly better implementation. I find that when I, because I have a lot of apps on my
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:54.280]   iPhone, I think there's a lot of it still, and you toss them into folders, and now you've got all
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:58.440]   these little holes here and there around the interface, and you have to drag icons to fill in
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:02.120]   the holes if you don't want to scoot screens because that's the whole point of having folders,
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:07.560]   so you don't have to do this. I would really like there to be just within the reset home screen
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:12.760]   option is to reset the home screen and move all the folders and not take everything out of the
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:17.720]   folders and put them everything in alphabetical order again, because that's not the way this
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:22.840]   should work. Say that again, so if you reset the home screen, it resets everything?
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:26.920]   Yeah, it takes everything out of the folders again and throws them back on the desktop.
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:33.880]   No, that's not the idea. I went through all the struggle to organize and get the folders
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:39.800]   and don't spit them out again so that I have to put them back in folders. So yeah, it seems like,
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:44.440]   and it doesn't seem like Apple that way that I can't just drag folders,
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:50.680]   put things in folders and then have everything kind of suck up so that now I'm on two screens
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:56.600]   instead of seven. Yeah, I use three screens total. I have to say, I made a utilities folder,
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:00.920]   which includes, of course, the settings icon, but a lot of other icons that I might go to a lot of
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:06.040]   times and I put that on the top. I love it that I can put that on the home bar or the dock. That's
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:12.520]   pretty nice. And then I keep my games right on the first page, but I also have folders, a second
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:19.080]   page of commonly used apps and then a folder's page for all the rest. You're limited, though,
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:25.160]   I mean, you can't put more than three lines of four icons. Is that right? You only could put 12
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:29.320]   icons. Right. You only get 12 icons in there. So if you have a lot of games as I do, then you end
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:34.920]   up making games one couple of things to games. Yeah. Don't you think that it's time to abandon
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:40.760]   this structure of icons? It seemed like it was always designed for the idea of you get an iPhone,
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:44.200]   it comes with 10 built in apps and then you're going to be wanting to put a handful of the
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:48.200]   handful of the book. Exactly. Yeah. I really think that they should they should have the equivalent
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:52.760]   of smart folders. They should have the equivalent of a text view where I can simply do one tap that
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:58.360]   says, show me all the photo, all the photo genre apps. And that will give me a text scrolling list
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:02.280]   of all the photo apps that I type the ones that I've used most frequently are the ones at the top.
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:05.960]   I can get to that way. I can get to almost every single application that I use with just two or
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:10.920]   three taps. I don't get this stuff where I have to either scroll through six different pages of apps
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:16.680]   to find the icon I want. Or it's up to me to organize things physically. And I know it is my
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:21.880]   responsibility, but it seems as though the OS could be giving me a lot more help. We also be getting
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:26.680]   a lot of help from from app manufacturers because the number to remember just a few weeks ago,
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:33.160]   when when Lisa Bettany was in here and was talking about our camera plus app. And even if you search
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:37.480]   for camera plus, well, which of these three applications named camera press were you talking
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:41.960]   about? And of course, we want to download in the wrong one at first. It's terrible. But I'm pretty
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:45.400]   sure of the application I want. It's not something that I use every single day, but I use it often
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:50.440]   enough to keep it on my phone. But when it's reduced, it's reduced to an icon that is way too
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:55.080]   artistic. It doesn't really say what it does. And the text underneath it just simply says plus,
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:59.080]   or it simply says book saying, thank you very much. But which of these nine different book
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:03.240]   reader applications are you? Right. So I really think that this is this is right for raising the
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:07.560]   red banner revolution. If there's one, if there's if there's something that sometimes tempts me to
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:12.280]   carry around a Joel broken phone, it's that I would much rather have a much better application
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:15.960]   launcher than the one that Apple gives me. Well, I'm with you on that. In fact, that to me was
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:20.360]   the one thing when I got this iPhone for coming back from an exes one, it felt like it was
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:25.000]   a little antiquated in the UI. I mean, the widgets that you can do with draw Android,
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.920]   the organization capable capabilities of Android did feel a little bit more advanced
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:35.880]   than this this kind of array of icons. Folders was much needed and it is a big improvement,
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:41.240]   but it's still a little bit clunky. Yeah, I agree with it, Andy. It would be nice to have a list or
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:45.240]   at least one of their little selection wheels so that you could go down three year collection
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:51.960]   on a folder, give you alternate views. But it's not cute. And I think icons are the whole idea of
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:56.520]   playing with this iPhone is you, Oh, there's an icon and I will tap it and it launches and that's
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:02.280]   magical. But to have multiple views and say, no, I don't want the cute little icon. And I want it
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:06.840]   to be like my Mac. So I can see it in list view or I can see it in hierarchical view or something.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:11.960]   That gets geeky. And suddenly you lose mom and pop because I go, Oh, what's that? I don't I don't
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:15.800]   want that to happen. So again, it's the question on the iPhone. Do you provide
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:22.920]   functions for power users who want to be able to just get to things quickly versus mom and pop?
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:27.080]   Just I think that's I think that's a relevant question. I mean, our mom and pop frustrated by
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:32.280]   having five different pages of icons that sometimes confuse them as to what their individual uses
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:37.240]   are. If if all they did, if all Apple did was simply say there is an automatic folder, it's a
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:41.720]   smart folder. It's called recently launched applications. That's a smart folder.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:46.040]   Is a very nice idea. Not only that, but make that make the smart folders also contain items from
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:50.360]   every other from from all kinds of other different content areas. Just another one says,
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:55.400]   here is the most 25 most recent things that have been music files and sync to the device.
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:28:01.560]   But I would 25,000 recent web pages. Yeah. I mean, or I would settle for just here is the
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:07.320]   here the 25 the 10 applications you've most recently launched in order go.
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:13.320]   I almost don't want to mention this story, but Bloomberg has it again. Verizon watching an
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:20.440]   iPhone in January. It's a rumor with quote, two people familiar with plans.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:29.160]   It's like it's like it's like the Lindsay Lohan obituary. You just got to keep writing this
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:32.200]   every single month because some month you're going to be right and you're going to be glad you put
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:38.040]   that work in. Oh, you wear a sick puppy. It's not January 2011. Well, they didn't say that.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:43.640]   You're right. January. Well, there you are sometime in January, although remember that the Wall Street
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:49.160]   Journal in March said that CDMA iPhone production would ramp up in September. That would kind of
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:53.480]   jibe you start ramping up in September for a January launch. Would you think I mean,
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:59.880]   they're not going to announce it at Mac world Expo. Apple might have an event in January.
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:04.520]   Wouldn't it be ironic that Apple abandons Mac world Expo and then two January's because they
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:09.880]   don't want to be forced to make announcements on their schedule and two January's in a row
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:17.400]   makes announcements big announcements? Well, also, you know, there was a problem with even when they
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:23.400]   did WWDC where because they had an audience that was mixed of members of the media and members
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:28.600]   of the developer community. They had two different audiences. They had two different messages for
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:33.080]   each one of them. And a great number of members of the media were not even aware,
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.880]   myself included initially, initially, that there was even a demo room set aside because Apple wanted
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:41.480]   to make sure that the demo room did not get flooded with developers who were just curious and wanted
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:47.480]   to put their hands on an iPhone for the first time. And, you know, I think that it's more of a
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:51.080]   logistical thing where, you know, it seems kind of awkward that they are going to be having their
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:56.520]   own event. They might be having their own event, event 10 days before Mac world Expo in the building
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:00.440]   that's right next door to where Mac world Expo is going to be. But at least they know who every
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:05.000]   single person in the room is and they, to their mind, they will have a more successful event.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.560]   Right. Let's take a break. Come back with our picks of the week. But before we do that, I'd like
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:16.280]   to pick a book or two for you to read from audible.com. Audible is a great place to go where you can get
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:22.760]   what's there are 75,000 titles now on audible. Actually, that's probably even out of date because
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:28.600]   audible is growing so fast all the time. If you go to audible.com/macbreak right now,
[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:32.680]   you can get an audible book absolutely free. You sign up for the gold account. That's a book
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:38.200]   a month. And your first one is free. And we like to always recommend books for you. Andy Naco seems
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:43.960]   to be particularly adept at that. Andy, do you have one again this week for us? Yes. Now, this
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:49.160]   is a book that I didn't listen to via audio, but it's one that I read two weeks ago. Mark
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:54.600]   Fraunfelder is one of the founders of pointpoint.net. He's also a founding editor and the current editor
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:59.000]   of make magazine that great magazine about do-it-yourself building stuff. And he recently
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.000]   came up with a new book called made by hand searching for meaning in a throwaway world,
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.040]   which is it's an interesting book. I think it's perfectly time for the summer because
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:15.560]   it's about a 300 in print, at least it's about a 250 300 page book about getting more his own
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:20.360]   little journey and getting more connected to building things and making things and understanding
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:26.600]   why things work. There's only one bad part of the, excuse me, only one disappointing part of the book.
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:31.400]   The very first check, it's set up as little episodes on different projects that he decided to tackle
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:37.640]   himself from building instruments to making honey to educating his own daughter. Some of these
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:41.240]   things with success, some of these things with failure, but it's always interesting.
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:45.320]   Don't get, if you do get this book, don't get thrown by the first chapter. I think he made a
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:53.160]   mistake. The first chapter is about visiting this really just crunchy, hippie commune where it's
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:57.000]   the whole, they're attitude. I'm not quoting here, but the impression that I get from the
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.440]   chapter when he's reporting what these people are telling him is like, no, you know what?
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:06.040]   I'm not going to buy a Coke. I'm going to make my own coal because that way I'm not being controlled
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:12.520]   by the corporations and the government. Okay, thank you. You know what? A Coke cost me 65 cents.
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:16.280]   It's a delicious, delightful, it's refreshing. I'm going to buy it. That's really not what I came
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:22.280]   for. But that's, that's the, I wish he'd put it near the end. So for the first three chapters,
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:26.600]   I was sort of tensing myself for, oh, great. Now I'm going to find out that if I don't make my own
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:32.600]   pants, I'm killing small children and I'll sell it or something. But no, it really is lighthearted,
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:36.840]   but still a very thoughtful book. One of the best things about it, and this is something that I like,
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:43.160]   particularly about audiobooks, is first-person narratives of nonfiction, where there are areas
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:46.840]   in which I agree with what this person is saying and areas in which I think that it's slightly
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:53.720]   misguided because I drive, I drive sometimes an hour to certain places alone. I can have arguments
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:59.000]   with myself and with the narrator in the car, where I can say, well, how come, well, why don't I think
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.520]   that makes sense? That doesn't make any sense to me. Why wouldn't you do it that way? And so,
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:07.960]   it was fun. I love doing that. So it was, it was, I really liked it a lot. It's not a long book either.
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:13.160]   It's seven hours and 41 minutes. Some of the books that I do listen to take like weeks, weeks to get
[01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:17.640]   through. I think you can easily get through this one in a few weeks time. So, but as I said,
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:21.560]   for an entertaining book, makes you think a lot and very entertaining. And Mark is one of the
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:26.920]   genuinely nice guys in the business. You know, Boing Boing is fantastic. He's fantastic. I saw
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:32.360]   him at Food Camp. He came up and said, Hi, the book is is a great read. And the chapter on making
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:37.400]   the perfect espresso alone is worth the price of admission. And I learned how.
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:45.000]   Did you, I mean, you know, temperature and everything. Yeah. See, that's a good example because I love
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.040]   the, it's, it's, he's, he's tells a story really, really well about how he was unsatisfied with,
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:55.640]   not that he wanted to be independent and be a good part. Our pioneer forefathers made their own
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:34:00.360]   espresso. Why shouldn't I? It's just that he really wanted to have the ability to pour a perfect
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:04.840]   espresso. So one of every three. So he bought, he did the online research and got them,
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:08.920]   made, got the coffee, the espresso maker that everybody recommended. He couldn't get it to work
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:14.600]   properly. So we found like the greatest espresso maker, the king of the races or right in the world
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:19.960]   who did the whole, it was like, it was like taking a car to like an 8500 pit where he took it apart
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:23.160]   saying, okay, well, this is working fine. This is okay. The temperature regulator is off. You should
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:26.360]   do an upgrade to the regulator to do a digital one. You can do a set point, doesn't hold the,
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:27.400]   da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:31.080]   and you learn, I don't, I'm not a coffee drinker, but it really made me interested in the process
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:36.360]   where he now has to hack his coffee, his espresso maker with all these component upgrades and work
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:42.760]   and increasing its, its, its, its success about 1000%. And now through the, through the, through the
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:46.600]   hard, aftermarket hardware upgrades, like he's building a car or something and through actually
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:51.000]   learning how to properly make a, make a espresso for the first time. He's actually pulling perfect
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.480]   espresso. It's, it's a, it's a good, it's a good over the shoulder tutorial at when you're
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:35:00.120]   up, people who are obsessed with coffee. I'd be the same way about the picking, when I'm, when
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:05.480]   they're, when the, the sodas are four for, four for $10 for the coke's. I'm the one who's reading
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:09.480]   the product code that are, that are spray painted, get the actual, the freshest ones and the best
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:12.920]   ones. And so it's, it's sometimes it's great to peek into someone else's obsession and, and
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:17.800]   determination. No kidding. Really a great book made by hand searching for meaning in a throwaway world,
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:23.800]   but 75,000 titles, you're sure to find something you love at audible.com. Here's the deal.

[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:34.200]   and commander. This is a smart one for them to give away because you'll listen to the first of
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:39.080]   these Patrick O'Brien sailing novels take place in the Napoleonic Wars. They're incredible.

[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:52.280]   I am beautifully done too. I love those books. The recordings and the narration was so good on
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:56.120]   those books. He's the guy. I mean, you know, you go back to the paper and it's like, no, no, I have
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:02.600]   to listen. What else? Oh, the life of Pye, if you want a great narration by Yan Martell is maybe
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:07.480]   one of my favorite audio books ever. The time traveler's wife, I just finished it. This is free.

[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:55.240]   everybody. And I'm going to start today. Give Chris Breen a chance to think, give Andy a chance
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:38:01.880]   to breathe. Lightroom three is out and I am impressed. Now, you know, I've go back and forth
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:06.120]   between Lightroom and Aperture and you, you, you probably before you decide what you're going to buy,
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:15.160]   you should probably try both. Both have a free 30 day trial, but I am, you know, I am a Lightroom
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:20.680]   fanatic. Now, there's some advantages to Aperture in terms of, you know, in handles movies and so forth,
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:26.680]   but Lightroom in my mind, because it uses the Adobe RAW engine to render the pictures.
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:32.920]   And it has a new, you know, the sharpening tool is fantastic, but it has a new low light tool
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:37.320]   that is really spectacular. And if you've got some pictures like this one, I'm looking at that
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:45.560]   were shot in kind of low light. The new, the new cleanup tool for this is really, really good.
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:49.480]   They also have some excellent lens corrections for pretty much any lens
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:56.280]   made. So if, you know, you're using a wide angle lens and, and you've got, and you've got some
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:01.400]   problems with the lens correction, this is great. So here's the noise reduction. And I can do both
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:06.200]   in luminance and in color, and it's a slider. So I can see exactly what I'm going to get in real
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:10.040]   time. This is better than the NIC effects. I mean, I use a lot of different plugins.
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:16.520]   And this is just fantastic. Lightroom three is now out. It's been my favorite for a while,
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:21.880]   $99 to upgrade if you're already a user. I think it's $2.99 to buy from Adobe.
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:27.160]   And it is Windows as well as Mac. And by the way, when you buy it, you get a Windows
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:32.440]   and Mac serial numbers. So if you happen to have a Windows machine, you can run it on both.
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:40.920]   My pick of the week now to you, Mr. Chris Breen. Okay. Well, as you know, I'm, I'm a musician.
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:48.600]   I'm a keyboard player. But sometimes I long to be a guitar player because guitar players get to be
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:52.440]   in the front of the stage and they get to make faces. And you know, the keyboard players are just
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:59.080]   the guys in the back kind of doing that and paying attention. But I found something that's very
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:03.400]   cool for guitar players who are also Mac users. And I'm going to show it for the, those of you
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:09.080]   watching on video, what is this the Oh, it's like, it's just tap MIDI controller or something.
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:17.720]   It is the Apogee geo pedal board. I'm going to pack up the camera. So you can see it in its full glory.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:25.480]   And what this is is a, it's a controller for garage band and for logic. And if you're a guitar
[01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:30.200]   player, you plug your guitar into the back, you can plug your headphones in there as well. It's a
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:36.760]   USB device, you plug it into your Mac and you can set it as an input input and output device.
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:41.640]   And what it allows you to do is when you're playing in garage band, you have these pedalboard
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:46.520]   effects that you can use really cool. But when you want to trigger a new effect, you have to take
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:51.800]   your hands off the guitar, go over to your mouse and go click. You are not going to get the chicks
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:58.680]   doing that. It's totally unclin. So embarrassing. Right. So better that you continue to grimace
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:05.000]   and make faces and stomp with your left or right toe, depending on your preference.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:10.840]   On one of these buttons that appears at the bottom here, and this will kick in one of the effects.
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:15.880]   So, and the very cool thing about it is about each button, there is a little LED.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:22.760]   And the color of the LED will change depending on the color of the stomp box effect that you've
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:31.000]   got in garage band or in logic. So, for example, a fuzz effect may be red on your screen, a little
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.520]   stomp box is red on the screen. The little LED will light up red if that's the effect you're using.
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:41.320]   Plus, it's got transport control. So if you need to trigger garage band, so it's going to record
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:45.800]   or logic, you've got to record button, you've got to play button, you've got fast forward and rewind.
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:50.680]   So, if you're recording with this thing, you never have to take your hands off the guitar.
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:55.640]   Instead, you can just start and stop your recording that way. Rewind for another take, if you like.
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:01.160]   If you're using main stage, which is within logic, it's the live performance tool,
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:07.800]   you can control all the major main stage functions so that you can play live with this thing.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:13.720]   And it's a terrific way to play these instruments live. And the instruments are so good that you can
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:19.640]   play live and not feel like you're using some terrible synth sound or a cheesy little effect.
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:25.320]   The effects are really, really quite good. So this is 395. It's from Apigee. It's called the Geo.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:30.120]   I've been testing it for a couple of weeks. And I like it. And it's built like a tank.
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:37.080]   The thing is heavy. And it will stand up to the most rigorous gigs used for all edit. How much again?
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:43.640]   It's 395. Okay. And you obviously have to have musical ability to use it.
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:47.080]   No, you could just buy it and just put it on the shelf.
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:52.760]   Sounds like something I might do. It makes me excellent for stuff. Yeah. No.
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:57.960]   Yeah. For your Mac user guitar playing friends, this is a nice piece of gear.
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:01.960]   Awesome. Awesome. Andy, cannot go. You're pick of the week, my friend.
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:08.680]   This is a game that I bought just so I could test out the gyroscope on the iPhone for
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:13.720]   unfortunately it has had a certain plans versus zombies effect on productivity because it's a
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:18.680]   really fun game. But it's an action arcade game. It's made by the folks at NG MoCo, the same guys
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:23.560]   who do Godfinger. And it's called I really have to do the Quinn Martin voice because it's quite
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:32.360]   an odd name called eliminate gun rage. A Quinn Martin production. It's just a simple like
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:39.000]   in gameplay, it's a simple target range type of game where you're just using the phone and the
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:44.920]   and the and the gyroscope just to steer around like steer your your your your your aim around
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:49.320]   this little target range and some parts of it are within your immediate field of vision and some
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:56.040]   are not. But it gives you two cool things. Number one, it shows you exactly how precise the gyroscope
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:03.480]   are on the iPhone because it's a very good realistic high definition, you know, display optimized
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:10.520]   display and it works very, very fast. It's but it's so responsive to how you move the
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:15.160]   move the iPhone that it really does feel like I'm not playing a game. I'm actually just like
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:21.240]   recording something on video and this is the camera view as I keep moving around. But as a
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:25.960]   gameplay goes, it's very, very good, very, very simple fund first person shooter where
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:30.120]   their targets are human shapes that are actually painted onto tiles. You're killing nobody,
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:34.920]   you're still a there's still a a butterfly of the universe spreading nothing but goodwill and
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:43.160]   kindness. It's about time and eliminate what is it eliminate gun range? It's called eliminate gun
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:47.080]   range because they have an eliminate game. This must be part of the series of eliminate games.
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:50.360]   Yeah. Yeah. But this one uses the gyro eliminate.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:53.720]   Cool. And then gun range. Next. iPhone or iPad or both?
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:45:01.560]   It is a is an iPhone game because I believe that it requires the general school in order to work.
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:06.280]   Okay. Yes. Requires iPhone 4 technology, 3GS support and new content coming soon. But for now,
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:11.240]   you need the iPhone 4. But again, if you if you're trying to if they also there's also a
[01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:15.000]   jenga that jenga game, I think that was demonstrated by Steve Jobs during the keynote.
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:20.840]   Shooting stuff is a lot more fun. But it will convince you of this is really cool component
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:24.840]   inside your iPhone. And you will be waiting for even better games to come out and maybe even
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:30.120]   more productive things to come off that sport the gyroscope. Again, it is is you I mean, you
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:35.480]   what we already have games where the accelerometer sort of you realize the difference is that the
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:40.680]   accelerometer control is more like having a joystick. We're gonna sense, okay, he wants to move right.
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:46.360]   Okay, he wants to move down. Okay, he wants to go this way. The grab the gyroscope says, okay,
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:50.760]   he's moved at half a degree, half degree faster, half degree. Now we stop. Okay, now he's actually
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:54.120]   sort of jigging right now. His hands are shaking a little bit. So make sure that you wobble the
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:57.240]   view a little bit because that's how fine the control is. Well, I have to try this. It sounds
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:01.960]   like it's quite it's quite impressive. Even just as a demo of how good this is, right? It's a great
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:06.840]   demo. All right, my friends, we have run through all the stories. We have gotten our picks out of
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:12.840]   the way. I think it's time to adjourn for next week. Chris Breen is the editor senior editor of
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:20.680]   Macworld Magazine Macworld.com and the author of the Mac 911 column and the Buffont of all knowledge.
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:25.800]   Thank you for joining us, Chris and a very talented musician. If you ever get a chance to see him,
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:31.960]   he performs in his area down the peninsula in San Francisco Bay Area. But I think you
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:35.240]   you might catch him on a cruise ship from time to time, something like that.
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:40.440]   Every so often looked for me and just put a dollar in the jar. He's the piano man.
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:45.080]   Andy Inaco is the inkedained wretch of the crew. He is a
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:52.200]   sorry technology editor for Chicago Sun Times. And you can read his postings also in his blog,
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:47:00.520]   www.cwob.com. The celestial waste of bandwidth. Alex Lindsay will be back next week. I'm Leo
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:07.480]   LaPorte. We thank you all for being here. Now get back to work. Break time is over.
