[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.720]   And boy, there's going to be so much news today. We're going to have a long time to talk.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.880]   Fortunately, we got the best in biz here.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.920]   Renee Ritchie from his YouTube channel, youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.200]   He's a regular contributor to iMore and other magazines.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.840]   Hello Renee.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.160]   Hello Leo. Can I become a Twitch fellow?
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.480]   Yes. I'm promoting you to Twitch fellow at Jolly Good.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.960]   Excellent.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.840]   You're in the Jolly Good.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.200]   Get in the charge of sitting here and commenting.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.400]   We'll explain what that's all about in a second.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.160]   Andy Inako is here from WGBH Boston Public Radio and parts north.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.360]   Hello Andrew.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.280]   You get a little story you might think right about now.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.720]   Yeah, the trees are doing kind of like this.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.920]   And I've already gotten three warnings, three alerts on my phone,
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.720]   including from the power company saying, "Hi, if you've got anything you can burn for power,
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.400]   you might want to start stuff."
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.880]   All that toilet paper you bought that didn't use,
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.280]   you might want to start thinking about using that for
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.840]   yeah.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.800]   Generate electricity.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.720]   Well, stay safe and dry.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.800]   Also with us from iMore.com, where she is the managing editor.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.240]   It's Lori Gill.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.120]   Hello Lori Gill.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.000]   I would like to join the fellowship of the ring please.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.360]   She's also a fellow ship of the ring.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.880]   Actually, all that comes from an announcement early this morning that Phil Schiller is moving
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.680]   upstairs.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.760]   Phil of course, who was in charge of marketing in Apple for how long?
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.520]   Ever.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.040]   20-something years.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.760]   He was with Apple for 20-something.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.640]   He's been in marketing for like 27 years.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.440]   He's had a marketing for I want to say 14-15.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.560]   I can't so long that I can't remember who his predecessor was.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.320]   He is a fixture.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.920]   Look, you think about a Mount Rushmore of Apple,
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.080]   meaning that these are the four or five people that you see at every single keynote
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.000]   that represent like the face of Apple,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.200]   who know all of the stories deep, deep, deep back into the Steve Jobs era,
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.800]   who also are part of the brain trust that factors all the decisions.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.400]   When the fact that he has marketing in his title implies that he's choosing colors for posters,
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.400]   no, he is like deep, deep, deep, like waist deep in every single decision.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.040]   You run about.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.320]   Exactly.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.160]   As a VS in biology from Boston College, he was at
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.480]   Macromedia in San Francisco.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.880]   Yes.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.240]   I didn't realize that.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.280]   VP of product marketing.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.360]   We must have just crossed, you know, almost crossed paths at that point.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.520]   At Apple, he has been pretty much, as you say,
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.160]   and he part of every major Apple announcement of the past decade and a half,
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.600]   worked on the formation and marketing of iMac, MacBook Pro, iPod, Mac OS.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.480]   He's credited with coming up with the idea for the click wheel interface on the original
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:45.040]   iPod. He worked as a supporting role, best supporting actor to Steve Jobs'
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.560]   famous keynotes for both the iPhone and the iPads.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.240]   I'm a little wifi one.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.800]   The wifi one?
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.440]   He's turned off your laptops.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.440]   Remember he had to jump or something with the laptop while Steve was trying to beam him a signal?
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.800]   Like some of those are just so classic.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.760]   Like they could be a rerun show on a streaming service.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.280]   He, when Jobs was on medical leave, he gave several keynotes himself,
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.440]   including Apple's last keynote at Macworld in 2009 and the WWDC keynote in 2009.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:23.440]   He announced the MacBook Pro line update, the 3GS, new versions of iLife and iWork,
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.720]   but he's best known for one word, courage.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.560]   And not innovating anymore, my ass.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.720]   Both of which didn't age well.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.560]   No, but I mean, like they're the memories that we live with Leo.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.600]   They're the moments.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.960]   Unfortunately, you get kind of painted with that brush.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.480]   He is still at Apple. He will be an Apple fellow.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.800]   What does that even mean?
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.840]   Oh, thank goodness, Leo, because I actually lifted a walk.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.440]   Pee-be and I still couldn't figure out how that relates to what Phil Shillo will be doing at Apple.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.160]   There's no title between senior vice president. Like Apple doesn't have presidents.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.800]   They don't have anything else. They have a very enigmatic structure.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   And he's basically going to keep control.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.960]   So he just kept getting more and more things.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.080]   If we've noticed over time, like Steve Dowling hasn't been replaced,
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.920]   his job is just being done by others.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.520]   Angela Arrence wasn't replaced. Her job is just being done by others.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.360]   Some people are not at Apple anymore.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.200]   No, is this like true?
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.880]   And he's doing the show at Silicon Valley where they go up to the roof.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.800]   And they just hang out and have lunch because they don't have anything else to do.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.480]   No, but he has waiting to do this.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.040]   Which is why they promoted Jaws to begin with.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.040]   And now he's going to keep App Store.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.400]   He's going to keep the events because the events are going to be a challenge
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.760]   for the next year still.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.320]   And Jaws is going to do all the marketing stuff.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.720]   Yeah, so that's the second half of this announcement is that
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.760]   the very highly respected Greg Jawswiek, who's often called Jaws,
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.040]   will now be senior vice president of worldwide marketing,
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.520]   effectively taking Schiller's post.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.200]   So Phil will continue.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.760]   This is the quote from the Apple press release.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.720]   Continue to lead the App Store and Apple events.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.520]   Does that mean he's going to lead events?
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.440]   Or he's going, I mean, what does that mean?
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.160]   Well, if it remains to be seen, another thing that should be pointed out
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.160]   is that at Google and other companies,
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.440]   when we find when there's an announcement about,
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.160]   well, the senior executive has decided that he wants to pursue lots and lots of
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.000]   additional goals in addition to his wonderful 20 or 30 year career.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.360]   And so he's being elevated to a position that is kind of vague and undefined.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.600]   That often means that they lost their product launch supremely failed
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.040]   and they're being nosed out.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.040]   Or there is another reason why he's being offered a,
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.680]   we want, you're too big for us to fire you.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.560]   So let's just give you an opportunity to fade out gracefully.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.040]   This is absolutely not that sort of thing.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.160]   So it basically, it remains to be seen what it means,
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.520]   but I bet it means that he's still in the meetings.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.120]   He's still a part of the email list.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.560]   He's still part of the Slack channel.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.480]   It's just that he's no longer has.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.600]   Jaws is living out.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.720]   If you have these amazing people, like you have Kyan Drantz,
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.680]   who's just been promoted to vice president of iPhone product marketing.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.880]   And where do they go?
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.160]   Like they're all working at Apple, but they just don't have titles.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.000]   And Phil's been working there a long time.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.120]   He's got, he's gotten money forever and his family sometimes wants to spend more time with him
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.600]   and the money.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.040]   That's how these things work.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.520]   We'll see.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.480]   We'll just see.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.960]   My guess is he'll still have some stage time,
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.760]   but how much operational role is another matter?
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.040]   This was Mansfield, right?
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.160]   And we saw this happen too.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.000]   Mansfield got called back though,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.400]   because nobody could do Bob Mansfield's job.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.480]   Well, so are you saying that Jaws will start an ill conceived
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.480]   Apple Hot Tub secret project?
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.200]   The amount of aluminum will be too expensive for anyone else to sign,
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.720]   for Jeff Williams to sign off on.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.360]   And then Phil will come, come back and say you fix our outdoor party initiative.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.720]   Let me fill you in on Greg Jaws, who is now the Apple SVP for worldwide marketing.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.960]   He got his start early.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:13.440]   He got a degree in a bachelor of science in computer science in 1986.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.840]   And even then, they said his nickname Jaws was a combination of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.080]   He was destined to join Apple.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:30.160]   Join Apple in '86, two years after the Macintosh launched in Apple's newly formed
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.600]   support organization for the Mac.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.400]   So he has his roots deep in the Mac.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.480]   He was running that group within two years.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.080]   Then he led comms for the Apple Developers group.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.320]   So he has good relationship with developers.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.600]   I always like to see that.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:49.360]   That's a very important thing at Apple to understand the users,
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.960]   but also understand kind of the second most important group of users.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.400]   And Dut Dut reports into him now.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.400]   I mean, that's one of a big part of the marketing organization is World Wide Developer Relations.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:58.640]   Right.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:04.160]   In 1997, he led product marketing for the new PowerBook line.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.040]   Eventually, all portable products, eventually all hardware products,
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.120]   including in 2001, the iPod.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.920]   And then, of course, the iPhone and the iPad.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:21.920]   So he really has been in a marketing role, kind of a product marketing role forever and ever.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.240]   And they're very different than a lot of marketing people.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.280]   Because in my old job, when I was in product marketing, a lot of the people you talk to
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.160]   were salespeople who would just tell you whatever you wanted to hear.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.200]   Like, please buy my widget.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:31.840]   It will do anything.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.960]   Oh, you want it to pour coffee?
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.360]   It does that.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.160]   You want it to fly a plane?
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:34.720]   It does that.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.760]   Buy my widget.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.600]   And when you talk to Phil or Jaws, they will explain the silicon.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.120]   They'll explain the memory substructure.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.200]   They will explain the manufacturing process.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.560]   They'll explain how the software, they are mostly engineers, very, very hands on and very bright.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.480]   You know, in a way, my opinion is an upgrade because Jaws really is an engineer.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.920]   Phil Schiller's BS was in biology.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:03.280]   I think Phil was more a classic marketing guy who loved the product and loved the engineering.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.880]   Jaws is an engineer from the way back.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.440]   He's a classically educated engineer.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.680]   I mean, you work at Apple at such a high level that's much better on a resume than,
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.880]   "Well, I don't have a dream engineering, but I was a senior executive."
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.360]   I agree.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:19.360]   I agree.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:19.360]   I agree.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.320]   I agree.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.920]   Jaws, but I underscore what was said about Jaws.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.120]   I only had one briefing with Phil.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.240]   I've had many with Jaws.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:37.200]   I've also had those briefings with marketing executives where there is the script,
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.680]   where we're trying to implant these phrases in your head.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.680]   When I had a briefing and I saw Jaws in the room, it's like, "Oh, this is great.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.400]   We can just have a 45-minute conversation about every single note that I have,
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.080]   and everything that I don't understand about the technology or anything that was unclear.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.560]   And even if it's something he can't talk about, he will figure out what I'm really trying to ask
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.520]   and find a way to get them.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.240]   It was always a very, very deep conversation.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:09.440]   He's on that list of Apple people where I've known them for so long and have had such good
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.000]   times with them that, "Why am I much more retired so we can hang out and become actual friends?"
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.360]   Because I can't ask you out for a drink at a trade show because that would be wrong.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.680]   I'm very, very glad that.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:27.200]   Jaws has been at Apple one year longer than Phil Schiller, but he's not much younger than
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.800]   Phil Schiller, which is kind of interesting.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.240]   Phil turned 60 this year.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.240]   It's kind of... Apple doesn't say stepping down.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:42.400]   The press really sounded like he was stepping up, but really he's stepping down.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.080]   He's semi-retiring.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.600]   Sideways.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.040]   He's no longer overclocking his CPU.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:54.480]   The quote from the statement is, "I first started at Apple when I was 27.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.080]   This year I turned 60.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.960]   It's time for some planned changes in my life."
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.240]   As somebody in the 60s, I understand that usually means taking a long time to enjoy life.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.320]   He's been there a long, long time and he's done a lot of things.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.680]   He's probably worked, as you say, really, really hard.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.400]   But boy, you really have to say that with the exception of Tim Cook,
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.000]   there have been some massive changes.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.520]   Johnny Ives is gone.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.800]   Angela Arance is gone.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.080]   Steve Dowling is gone.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:30.560]   We dealt more with Dowling perhaps than the general public because he was their internal PR guy.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.600]   And then Phil Schiller, who is absolutely the figurehead,
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:39.600]   second only to Steve Jobs for this company for a long, long time.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.440]   It's weird, though, because their executive stays so long that when they change,
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.400]   it's a bit like... You watch a lot of technology events and it's different people
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.680]   every couple of years.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.720]   And the people you deal with are different almost continuously,
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.000]   like especially in other companies.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.040]   Normally, absolutely.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.480]   CMO changes daily.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.200]   That's why it's such a big thing that happens in Africa,
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.560]   because they've been there for 30 years.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:08.720]   So Chris Espinosa, who was one of the original Mac guys, tweeted,
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.600]   "Congratulations on being promoted to Apple Fellow.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.920]   Joining here are the other Apple Fellows."
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.320]   And this will give you some idea of where in the pantheon, Phil Schiller's,
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:23.520]   ending up Steve Wozniak, Rod Holt, who was an early engineer on Apple II.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.520]   Al Alcorn, same.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:33.360]   Bill Atkinson, who designed Quickdraw, was very involved in the design of the early Macintosh.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.640]   Steve Capps, another Macintosh engineer, Rich Page,
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:46.480]   Gershron Sedu, Gary Starkweather, Alan Kay, who is as close to a God in personal computing as you can get.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.760]   Don Norman and Guy Kawasaki, those are the Apple Fellows, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.240]   Legends.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:52.800]   So many.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.760]   I hope they have an embroidered smoking jacket, like when they weave coming out for
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.080]   Fellows.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.560]   I hope it's not orange, like, or what is a green room.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:00.640]   Especially room.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.520]   Like a master's jacket.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.080]   Like master's jacket.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.760]   I hope it's a nice color anyway.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.360]   Six colors, six colors.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.400]   Oh, it might be.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.520]   Six colors, yeah.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.280]   You know, the other thing about Phil we always knew is his hobbies.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.360]   He was, you know, he's a great photographer, right?
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.800]   They always showed off his photography.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.200]   He was a scuba diver.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.480]   I didn't know this.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.760]   Huge car aficionado.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.880]   Cars, drums.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.280]   Huge.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.360]   His BS was in Marine.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.000]   He played in a rock band, very briefly, a progressive rock band.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.960]   A Prague rock fan.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.040]   All of this is in his Twitter bio.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:37.360]   So he's not going to be sitting on the roof having lunch.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:44.000]   That's what's always so interesting about the longevity of the executive careers at Apple.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.600]   Because my experience with people who are working at that kind of a level,
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.520]   I'm talking about like mentally, is that they get very, very restless after time,
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:16:01.440]   where at some point they do, they did everything that they wanted to achieve at a certain company.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.560]   They are the really envious in terms of what they've accomplished.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:10.400]   But then they're like, but I really, really want to be the first people,
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.040]   the first one to photograph this presumed to be extinct species of bird.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.040]   And then suddenly that's all they want to do.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.200]   Or I want to make movies now.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:26.800]   Or I want to truly become a philanthropist, as opposed to I want to hide some of my money in creative ways.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:32.560]   It's always been very interesting to me that people who get to Apple,
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.480]   at that level, tend to stay at Apple.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.840]   Again, they have these 10, 20, 30 year careers where it seems like,
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.200]   it's like being the first, the number one on the enterprise,
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.200]   you are not going to dynamite will take, will blow Riker out of that seat.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.760]   And you wonder how long it's going to take for other people to advance up.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.880]   So that's just one of a dozen big stories today.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.520]   Oh my gosh, am I ready?
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:03.520]   The other big story that happened this morning, and I got the press release on my,
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.640]   I have a bot that follows Apple's PR on my echolleagram.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.320]   There's no echolleagrams.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.880]   Oh, I thought you meant Oprah's book club.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.840]   There's also in it.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.240]   Yeah, that was the press release yesterday.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.160]   That's when you heard the applications,
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.840]   because there's rumors about like Apple that all this stuff was ready.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.200]   And I see the Apple logo come across the notification center,
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.480]   and I'm like, it's go time.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.400]   It's Oprah's book club.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.360]   It's Oprah's book club, everybody.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.600]   So no, that was yesterday.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.800]   Today we get new iMacs, but don't get your hopes up.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.880]   These are not Apple Silicon.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:43.200]   In fact, this is almost certainly exactly what Apple was referring to when they said,
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.080]   we still have some Intel Macs in the pipeline.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.080]   Here they are, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.720]   your last Intel Mac and Tasha's.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.440]   They are the same design.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.400]   They basically just put 10th generation Intel chips in them.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:56.880]   Is that right?
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.800]   Renee, you already have done a, you're good.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.720]   You've already done a video on YouTube about this.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.840]   So it's basically what they did with the 13 inch MacBook Pro,
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.520]   and that is they took the same chassis,
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.800]   they updated the Silicon to the latest Intel generation,
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.760]   which is just more cores on the same process node.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.640]   We all know that story by now, latest AMD graphics,
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.520]   but also because the density and the pricing has changed on memory and storage,
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.000]   you can go up to 128, you know,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.560]   woo hoo.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.920]   You can do what's RAM now on the time app.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.200]   By the way, I would suggest that.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.160]   And you can't wait so SSD.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.720]   Because I have 64 gigs of RAM on my iMac Pro,
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.280]   and I still am able to reboot it just by leaving photos open.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.200]   So get 128 gigs.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.400]   Maybe, maybe, especially like logic,
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.440]   you're hard limited for the number of instruments based on the quantity of RAM.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.800]   So if you are, like you've been salivating for this, basically.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.720]   64 seems ridiculous,
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.840]   except that there must be a memory leak in photos.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.000]   Because if I leave it open invariably,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.840]   I'll come back to a rebooted Macintosh.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.160]   I'm so glad they got rid of that stupid fusion drive.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.520]   This was long overdue.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.080]   It's still in the very bottom very low.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.080]   A 21 inch, yeah.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.960]   But for most of them it would be SSDs, thank god.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.160]   But what's this about, like, the minimum being 256?
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.560]   That's like, I've got more stores.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.040]   It seems like a huge amount of storage.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.920]   Yeah, that's like exactly.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.400]   It seems like it's there, like the Cadillac that says,
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.520]   "Oh, you can get one without a radio, without air conditioning."
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.760]   And it's in this ugly color.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.400]   But for $20 more, you can get the executive.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.760]   It seems like it's only there so that people can go in and think of the cheapest one.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.800]   That's exactly why.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.760]   That's a well-known,
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:47.200]   you know, the people, free economics folks, what do they call that?
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.560]   So it's a marketing tactic.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.880]   That's why the Wall Street Journal has a subscription level.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.400]   You will never ever, in a million years buy, because it makes no sense.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.840]   It costs more just to get the paper than to get the paper plus digital.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.880]   Because they know no one's going to buy that one.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.400]   That's the bottom one.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.680]   It's a crappy microwave, right?
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.440]   Like there's a crappy one that always breaks.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.160]   You never want to buy it.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.240]   There's the normal one, and then there's a normal one
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.160]   that's just made out of more expensive parts for people.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.520]   I do have to admit, they offer that 256 gig storage
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.440]   across the entire 21 inch line.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.960]   So maybe it isn't completely the crappy version.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.240]   The usual story you hear about that is that it is intended for people
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:31.920]   who are almost entirely on external storage, and all they really want is to boot up the machine
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:32.800]   and don't want to pay Apple.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:38.080]   They also offer an 8 gig RAM configuration for the same dumb.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:42.240]   I honestly think it's so that they want to get you loosened up a little bit.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.680]   Come on, just spend a little more there.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.280]   Come on, just get that low price.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.240]   Once you start doing the build order, it's hard to stop.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:54.560]   Well, it makes the lowest price one, just speaking to the marketing that you're talking about,
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.760]   it makes the lowest price one seem low where you go, "Oh, you know what?
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.400]   It's only 1799. I can do that."
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.040]   You're looking at the specs and you're like, "Oh, I'm going to get a little more RAM."
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.920]   And then it jumps up, but you jumped into the pool because you saw 1799.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.360]   They did.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.200]   Did they upgrade the iMac Pro?
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.000]   I don't think so.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.200]   Yes, they did.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.880]   What's new?
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.680]   I mean, so to speak.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:25.440]   Basically, now that the regular base iMac nothing is about as powerful as last year's iMac Pro,
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:30.400]   they basically boosted the cheaper buy-in for the iMac Pro to make it as powerful as
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.360]   a little bit more powerful than the most powerful iMac.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:40.320]   So make it more of a transition between iMac and then actually jump to the lowest iMac Pro
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.760]   in terms of performance of then up from there.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:46.880]   So the iMac Pro always started at 5,000, but now you get a ZNW 10 core.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.120]   That's the same, isn't it?
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.640]   Or no, you got eight before six.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.360]   Eight core before, yeah.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:51.920]   Okay.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.280]   32 gigs of RAM.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.200]   They've always gotten that terabyte storage.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.160]   That's maybe.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.200]   So, okay, I get it.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.920]   So they're not putting newer chips in the iMac Pro, only in the iMac.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.160]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.640]   It's not clear to me what Intel's doing with Xeon at this point.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.480]   Good lord.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.040]   It's about-
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:11.920]   Well, they have been updating the AMD.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.160]   So glad they're abandoning Intel at this point.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.320]   It's just depressing over there.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.800]   So, 10th generation.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.720]   Let's just see how much you'd pay.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.520]   Yeah, I did that.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.320]   It's amazingly ugly.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.760]   Just hide your wallet first.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.960]   Hide your wallet.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.920]   So just the base model 27 inch 5k is $22.99.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.480]   Do we want to get nano texture glass?
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.520]   Yes.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.160]   We disagree on this.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.440]   It's just such high maintenance.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.600]   It looks gorgeous, but you have to use it to look off the clock.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.240]   It's just a special mod.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.520]   And I know I will never do that.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.720]   And why do you like it, Lori?
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:52.080]   Because it's got little bumps on it that I've been wanting to touch for the last two years.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:52.640]   But you can't.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.880]   It's less clarity, right?
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.280]   It is.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.240]   It's gorgeous.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.280]   I have seen it on the Pro display and it's really beautiful.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.080]   It really does look.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.680]   So, I love the idea of a matte screen,
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.160]   but I don't love the execution of most matte screens.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.080]   They kind of look like there's a film-
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.840]   So it's all facileen over the front of them.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:16.400]   And the nano texture on the XCR Pro definitely does not have that.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.840]   So presumably this screen would be the same.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:23.040]   It would be clear and crisp, but also matte.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:23.920]   Lori sold me.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.040]   Sorry, Renee.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.000]   We're going to spend $500 on the nano texture.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.880]   Let me just point out again that she got yelled at by Phil Schiller for trying to touch me.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.200]   Yes, she did.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:31.760]   No, I did.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.320]   No, don't touch it.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.440]   At least I asked permission.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.200]   It's hard not to.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.640]   You can get an I-9 in this one.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.760]   Ten cores.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.080]   Nice.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:44.880]   Again, don't know how that compares to the Z on W-10 core.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:51.920]   It's faster in its single chip clock speeder, max clock speed is 3.6 gigahertz, up to 5 gigahertz.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.280]   RAM.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.720]   That's where we're going to go crazy.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.200]   Look at that.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.000]   $2,600.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.240]   You're more than doubling it if you just go to the 128 gigs RAM by itself.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:10.000]   I think you should start with, you should get the 8 gigs because you can add RAM to the 27-inch
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.400]   aftermarket.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:10.480]   That's great.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:10.960]   It's got a little portable.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.160]   You can get a lot cheaper.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.440]   So on the 27, let's start with the basic.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.720]   On any Mac that it's easy to add RAM and that's not all of them.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.080]   It would be worse.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.600]   I think it's only the 27-inch iMac and then the iMac Pro.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.680]   You can't do it on the 21-inch.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.800]   But if you get 8 gigs, does it mean fewer slots or no?
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.320]   You get the full couple of slots.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.800]   You still get the number of slots.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.560]   You just don't get the chip in there.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.200]   Then go to other world computing or crucial or somewhere.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.040]   Of course, there get your own RAM.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:41.680]   You'll save money.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.080]   Exactly.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.440]   That's a lot of money.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:43.440]   Exactly.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.520]   So we're going to get 8 gigs.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.160]   Now, video cards.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.800]   We're still stuck with these pathetic Radeon Pros.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:55.760]   They say next generation, but they're not Navi2 as far as I could tell.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.520]   They look like they're just our DNA.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.040]   So I wouldn't spend any money on that.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.360]   Storage goes all the way up to 8 terabytes.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.800]   Well, you can't change them later.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.480]   So if you do want to do something that's more--
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.440]   You're stuck with the graphics card.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.320]   That's your only--
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.200]   I want to max that just because that's the best you could do.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.040]   Can't you use an eGPU with this though?
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:13.840]   Yes.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.720]   So that would be a way of getting a better video card down the road.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:24.320]   And to be fair, eGPUs are about the same price as a high-performance graphics card
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.840]   you get for Windows.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.680]   So there is some equivalency there.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:35.840]   Storage-wise, I think it's nutty to go to 8 because I think you don't want to put all
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.600]   your eggs inside this basket.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.280]   Because the basket is sealed up and you can't get out of these.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.000]   Yeah, get a terabyte.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.600]   If it was a laptop, I would say do it because traveling without external drives
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.080]   is just so much easier, safer, and better for data protection.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.320]   I actually--
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.520]   But if it's sitting on your desk--
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:49.840]   Yep.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.440]   Two terabytes from my--
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.360]   I always get two terabytes from my laptops, one terabyte from my iMac or desktops.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.800]   I'm going to get 8 gigabytes next time.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.640]   Good terabytes, sorry.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.840]   You're going to get 8 terabytes?
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.840]   For the next laptop I get for sure because Final Cut Pro is so thirsty.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.080]   Cheese, Louise.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.440]   It is so thirsty.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.600]   All right, well, that'll be that max silicon one.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.960]   By the way, that is one thing now.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.400]   They all have T2 chips.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.760]   And they all have upgraded 1080p cameras.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:17.040]   One would think for face recognition, but no.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.600]   Not the 2.5, not the 21-inch.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.440]   That's still got the 720p potato cam.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.840]   That's so hard to believe.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.920]   And my iMac Pro actually has 1080p.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.520]   It has a very good camera on the iMac Pro.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.160]   It's a good camera.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.440]   Should be everywhere.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:29.920]   That's good.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.600]   But the T2 also gives us faster SSD performance, doesn't it?
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.760]   Yes, it's got the KV-6 control.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.680]   It's basically the A10 chip from the Apple of the iPhone 7.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.840]   So it's got every all the storage controllers.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.200]   The image signal processor.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.080]   Isn't that amazing.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.520]   And then you can get regular gigabit ethernet or for 100 bucks more 10 gigabit ethernet.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.720]   It's basically a co-processor, but I wonder if their deal with Intel prevents them from ever
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.360]   calling it that.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.600]   The T2?
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.080]   It's just a controller chip, please.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.640]   It does the H.265.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.840]   It does so much.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.840]   It does all the audio processing.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.680]   So without buying the 8 terabyte, oh, I did buy the 8 terabyte.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.760]   Let's go back down to 1 terabyte.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:16.240]   With the 1 terabyte, I did actually get this pretty close to the cost of the base model
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.800]   iMac Pro with 64 gigs of RAM and 10 core processor.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.160]   I think this is actually, you're right.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.880]   This verges to iMac Pro territory.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.200]   But here's the real question.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.440]   Get the 10 gigabit ethernet.
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.480]   Why?
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.680]   It's only $100 more.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.400]   Oh, you might as well.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.520]   Yes, that's not our money.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.400]   Here's the real.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.400]   Yeah, I'm still under 5,000.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.040]   Get the hat.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.560]   There's a hat.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.760]   It's got a $380 hat.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.440]   Why isn't there a hat?
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.800]   Hey, at least it comes with a stand.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.160]   That's a good that's a blessing.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.240]   Why would you buy it in tell Mac at this point?
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.840]   Well, it's a couple of really important.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:01.440]   Well, Renee's got much better things to say about it.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.320]   But there's two things.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:08.320]   One, somebody who wants Intel, they're not afraid, or they're afraid to be a first,
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:14.080]   you know, a first adopter to the Apple Silicon Mac.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.520]   They don't want Apple Silicon.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.240]   They want Intel.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:16.880]   They know Intel.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.240]   They're familiar with Intel.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.360]   So that's one reason.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.200]   And the most important reason, and Renee will probably say this,
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.840]   is if you need a computer, you need a computer now.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.440]   It doesn't matter what chip is in it.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.160]   So that's the other important reason.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.400]   That's going to say different stuff.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:32.800]   Go ahead.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.320]   Let's say different stuff.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.120]   Go ahead.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.400]   No, she's absolutely right.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:42.640]   I was going to also say that if you depend on bootcamp or running Intel versions of Windows,
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.920]   you're going to need this.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:49.200]   And also, if you depend on some of the high-end 3D rendering stuff,
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.600]   you barely got Mac Intel support for that.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:57.280]   And who knows if or when they'll bring that stuff over to the R-Max.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:02.560]   And you can use the Rosetta for it, but if you're really doing high-end,
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:07.360]   like, stuff like Brianna Wu would be doing, it won't be tolerable for you.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.800]   Unity 5, you're going to want this, or whatever it is.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.280]   Unity's porting, but real hasn't said they are.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.320]   So it could be like, and Maya's going to port,
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.960]   but it's this, like, what's called photo brush or paint.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.760]   Like, some of the stuff Alex uses that he has to use on a PC, that's the reason.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.280]   In fact, last chance, kids, get your Intel Mac while you can.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.720]   Yeah, seriously.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.520]   That's more like it.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.800]   Also, also, like, this is a good gear to-- if you do need a Mac and you're worried about getting
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:43.360]   Intel, this would be an OK gear, because within the five-year time frame of the
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:48.800]   maximum usage of a brand new Mac, I don't think there's going to be a huge difference
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.800]   between-- certainly, if you wait until next year, like, like,
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:58.640]   Renee said through his proxy, Lori, that is exactly what I was going to say.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.800]   If you keep waiting and waiting and waiting because you know a new thing is going to come up,
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.760]   you're never going to have it.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.400]   And then in the next year, you're going to lose all the benefits of having a machine that is
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.040]   one-year-old, as opposed to the eight-year-old Mac that you're trying to replace it with.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.720]   So it's going to be a false economy.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:20.800]   I think I've mentioned this before, but there's also the sort of average consumer that you want
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:27.360]   to think about, too. There are lots and lots of people that don't give a flying F about what
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.040]   chip is in their computer. They just want a computer. They're not going to care whether it's
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:40.080]   Apple Silicon or Intel. So this is the latest, most updated version of an iMac for those people,
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:45.280]   for people who aren't waiting for the new big changes. They just need a new computer.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.720]   They don't even know what Intel versus ARM versus Apple Silicon.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:54.640]   I can tell you, though, in eight months when the new iMac with fins comes out,
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:00.720]   they're going to feel pretty left-bined. Those people, you're right.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:06.400]   They're not looking at the inside, but I promise you, the Apple Silicon
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.200]   Macs will look very different and will have features that will make you want them
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:17.680]   independent of the Silicon. But there's going to be a lot of people who they don't care about
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.800]   that kind of stuff. There's so many people in this world who just need X to work.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:28.400]   They're buying PC. They're not buying Macs. Those are people who are still buying
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.840]   Windows for reasons no one understands. You're right.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:37.360]   Understand those reasons, sir. No, even Paul. Right, I'm in the partial on that. But with,
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:42.400]   like Apple, the iPhone became so popular that people are now buying whatever iPhone they can
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:47.120]   afford. It has nothing to do with whether it's the most recent one. They're just buying the
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.720]   iPhone they can afford because it got so popular. But that's an iPhone. In a way,
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:56.320]   nobody's buying desktop computers. So I think in a way, Apple is trying to position itself as being
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.320]   the company where if you just need a computer, we've got one for you.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.960]   No, we've got the most reason one for you with the most advanced features.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:08.560]   No, no, no. If you just need a computer, you're going to buy a $500 Windows machine.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:14.480]   No, anybody, first of all, nobody's buying desktop computers. The people who are buying
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:19.920]   desk computers are businesses who are buying Windows. They're not buying Macs and professionals
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.800]   who know better. I have to think there's a very scant market for this.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.280]   So students, especially right now with the Paul.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.320]   Maybe they're going back to school. But even there, aren't they buying laptops?
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.360]   Why would you buy this?
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.880]   Front of house was huge for iPhone.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.720]   Not anymore. Nobody's in the front of house anymore.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:44.960]   Not a marketing positioning for Apple that they're trying to capitalize on the fact that they just
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.040]   launched a new iMac. So all these students are going back to school at home.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:49.760]   Yeah, that's who this is.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.800]   We'll have a desktop. All these children, all these parents with children,
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.200]   and they've got to get them up to speed with whatever's there.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.520]   It's not cheap, but it's the latest iMac.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.320]   So I think they're saying we've got a computer right now.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:09.120]   It's also the last time it's going to feel so out of date next year.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.680]   I can absolutely promise you. Having bought an Apple cube on the very last day,
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.720]   you could buy an Apple cube. I know what these people are headed for.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:21.440]   They may not know it. There is another group. Actually, there's the hedge funds.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.440]   The people who think Apple Silicon's going to be a massive flop
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:29.600]   who may say, "Yeah, last chance to get Mac OS on Intel.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.160]   The last great Mac." There is a small but finite chance that'll happen too.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.400]   This is the last good Mac.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.440]   I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:43.600]   When you talk about the uncertainty, you're also talking about,
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:49.600]   what if, again, what if you like the iMac form factor, you need a new one,
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.240]   how much you're willing to bet that Apple is definitely going to have one this year?
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:59.760]   The common wisdom with their quotes around it is that we'll have an iPhone event,
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.720]   a desktop event, maybe a month after that.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.240]   There's no guarantee that they're going to say,
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.080]   and these new, the first generation Apple Silicon Macs
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.680]   are available for order today. They might say, "Here it is.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.280]   We're going to be announcing a ship date when we're ready to ship it."
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:23.520]   Or they'll announce an Apple Silicon Mac that is not the Mac that you want.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:28.960]   For me, in my circumstance, the only Apple Mac,
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.360]   Silicon Mac that I'm interested in is a Mac Mini,
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:35.840]   because the iMac doesn't work for me. The Mac Pro is almost certainly going to be
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:41.200]   priced out of my reasonability range, and I could be waiting upwards of a year
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.640]   for a Mac Mini version of Apple Silicon.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:50.720]   And when I tweeted about this, "Oh, well, Apple's shipping a Mac Mini right now to developers."
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:54.880]   No, they're not. They're shipping a developer testbed
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.560]   that people can borrow for a few months, but they have to send back to Apple.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.440]   There's no promise that that's going to actually ship anytime this year.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.440]   So the question is, just like Lori was saying, how long do you want to wait,
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.880]   hoping that not knowing exactly when Apple's going to ship you,
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:14.080]   the machine that you actually want. So for a lot of people, if you need an iMac,
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.560]   and if you've been holding off for like eight years, and remember that one of the advantages
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.360]   and the the boat anchors of being an Apple user is that you're not forced
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.760]   to do the incompetence of hardware to upgrade before the thing just
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.560]   absolutely collapses like the blues mobile at the end of the movie.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.600]   These things can go over, keep going and going and going and going.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.520]   And you'll wind up with an eight-year-old machine that suddenly can't stream
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.000]   4K video the way you want to. And now is the time you absolutely need to upgrade,
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.960]   as opposed to maybe I could maybe I could upgrade, maybe I can't.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:49.200]   So there's still a lot of uncertainties. I think it's going to be a success,
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.040]   but you don't know when the machine that you want, the one that you need is going to be shipping
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.720]   with Apple Silicon. And it sounds like notebooks this fall anyway, not
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:03.200]   yeah, I'm changing my book pro. I honestly, I'm telling you folks, just listen to Leo.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.920]   He's done this before. I've been around the block.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:11.200]   If you can wait till next year, I was strongly wait, suggest wait till next year.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:16.320]   Yeah. If you can't wait, if you're a student going off your freshman college and you don't
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:20.640]   have anything to use, okay. But boy, I'd wait. I would.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:25.840]   Would I be thrown out of this club if I said I think that there's going to be another Intel Mac
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.840]   before they stop making the Mac?
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.360]   Really? No, you would be thrown out, but you'd surprise me. Why?
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:38.880]   I don't know why, but I just have a feeling we're going to see another new Intel.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.160]   What would it be? 16 inch MacBook Pro 10th generation.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:46.320]   There we go. I would like that.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.320]   That would actually make sense because it'll be a year before the Apple Silicon 16
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.560]   inch probably, right? Right. Yeah.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:58.000]   And it just, I thought we were getting it earlier. I didn't go all out on the last one because I
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.320]   was hoping we'd get it earlier. We didn't.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:05.280]   These are incremental upgrades, though, to existing machines. And 16 inch MacBook Pro would be
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:10.800]   an incremental upgrade to be 10th generation Intel. Honestly, I am so happy with my two or,
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:16.000]   what is it? Two or three year old iMac Pro. I have no pressure to upgrade that.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:23.280]   No, you shouldn't. Yeah, I don't need to. But I do believe there will be FOMO next year.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.960]   What is the opposite of FOMO? Shucks I didn't miss out.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:36.160]   Showmo. I'm glad I waited. When you see the new
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:44.400]   iMac with fins and glitter ball, you're going to go, oh crap. I love that.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:49.520]   I'll give you a couple of face ID, right? That's why it's not on this one.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:57.200]   Who cares? Okay. I mean, it's how many times do I log in on a desktop, like in once in the
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:02.160]   morning and that's about it. I say it's Windows hello and it's nice. I have to say, yeah.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:06.960]   I walk by and my watch goes, we unlocked your computer. I do like that. You're right. If you
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.480]   have an Apple watch, you don't need anything else. I would like it anyway, though, because I don't
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.680]   need the little broop thing. Because sometimes I'm just walking by. The broops are coming down.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:18.400]   And by the way, it's not just unlocking. Think of all the times you reauthenticate,
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.800]   but you wouldn't have to. Yeah, that's true. For purchases, yeah. Okay, that's a good point.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:30.400]   I'm not sure I need face ID on my iMac, but touch ID on my amnic, I think, would be well worth it.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:35.200]   I wonder if it's not doing that. So my understanding is that it makes the keyboard too expensive,
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.440]   because you have to have basically an Apple watch inside it. And now the T2 chip is even
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:44.960]   more. The original T1 chip goes straight to face ID. And the T2 chip is the iPhone set.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:50.400]   Yeah. So no one, I say they sold a magic keyboard for 300 bucks, but we complained.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.640]   And I think if the iMac magic keyboard was like 400 bucks, it's because it has a dumb display in
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.640]   it. And the reason it has a display is because they want to show you the actual number, and nobody
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:03.680]   can defraud you by displaying the bogus number next to the... Anyway, it's the thing.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:11.520]   I think they'll find enough surface features to make you feel like, boy, I bought the cube.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:17.280]   I bought the last emoji with face ID on the iMac. That's the only thing holding it back.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:21.120]   If it had an emoji, they would sell it. Oh, it's true. It could have an emoji.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:27.040]   But I do agree with you 100%. It's not just this... Not only am I looking for... I'm anticipating
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:33.600]   a huge speed performance, but I'm also looking forward to Apple dropping its handcuffs and saying,
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:38.000]   here's the things we can do that can be enabled by hardware and a desktop. That just like all the
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:45.840]   stuff we were able to do just because it seemed like a good idea or because we're not bottlenecked
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:52.240]   by hardware constraints. If we can put everything on our own custom chip, the idea of having even
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:57.600]   higher refresh rates, having iMacs that look that feel even more liquid than they do right now,
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.600]   that would be interesting. The idea of Apple. These will be out of the box. That's the main point.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:06.240]   And so you're buying something in the box right now. But because we're all in the box, we go,
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:13.840]   yeah, that's great. If that's how you think Buy Up Windows PC, because they're going to stay in
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:19.760]   the box for a long freaking time. But there's going to be a new kind of thing next year you're
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:25.200]   going to wish you had. No, but it is fair what Lori said. For people who are like Alex or like me
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:30.320]   when I edit my... I cannot afford any problems. I cannot afford any RevA boards. I cannot afford
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:37.120]   any software incompatibility. No fun, fun issues to debug. And so buying this now and holding it
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:41.120]   for two... Because pros, they pay off their machines with gigs and with clients and stuff. So
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:45.280]   getting this now, holding it for two years, feeling like it's a very, very safe bet.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:52.640]   Yeah. Can I say something that might be somewhat shocking? Well, maybe not coming from me. But
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:58.800]   this is the announcement of Apple Silicon really upended my hardware buying plans for the next year.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:06.640]   My decision had been that I've got $1,500 close to $2,000 set aside for a brand new Mac mini with
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:10.800]   whatever the latest thing is at the end of this year. If there's Apple Silicon, don't know what
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:15.600]   I'll do then, but it'll change that. And now I'm thinking that because the, again,
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:20.720]   the form factor that I need in a desktop Mac is traditionally a Mac mini, we're probably not
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:28.880]   going to get that this year. We might get a 13-inch MacBook Pro this year instead. Now my thinking is
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:37.120]   I'm broadening my thinking to, okay, well, why do you need a big desktop, a powerful desktop Mac?
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:42.400]   It comes down to things like, again, being able to stream in high definition like this,
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:47.520]   what we're doing right now, the idea that in the next year or so I might want to try to play
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:53.600]   with 4K video editing, Photoshop, things that are really, really high performance, premiere after effects.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:42:00.880]   And I'm starting to think, well, what if we took the money that we, some, maybe half of the money,
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.520]   three quarters of the money we put aside for a Mac mini this year, we build a PC that is high
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:09.360]   performance, but that is tailored to exactly the sort of stuff that I want high performance
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:14.160]   thing to do, make that the boring sort of like boiler in the basement that just gets the job done
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:19.840]   for high performance stuff. But then when I see a Apple Silicon Mac mini come out next year,
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:24.320]   I will buy that for all the Mac stuff, for all the stuff that involves like me actually doing my
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:29.440]   creative work, all my writing and all my communicating and stuff like that. Or even,
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:34.800]   God forbid, actually buying a Macbook Pro at the end of this year, knowing that I can still,
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:40.000]   I can, I'll be able to split my bets amongst multiple machines. That's how revolutionary this
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.560]   idea is. I don't foresee a future without having Apple Silicon on my desktop. And now I'm starting
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:53.760]   to think about what is precluding me from wanting to buy a new Macbook Pro, what is precluding me
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:59.440]   from wanting to buy a Mac mini this year or in the next like two quarters. And there's a,
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:05.840]   that's just an indication of how much this disrupts in a positive way the buying decision for people
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:11.280]   who still love Macs who still want to continue to carry Macs through forward. How do you like my
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:18.800]   outfit? Not to change the subject. It's very dark. It's very black. I'll take off the jacket. But
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:24.400]   the rest of it comes from Taylor store. This is my, this is a custom shirt that I got from Taylor
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:30.560]   store. And now I was really pleased. Taylor store sells Chinos. I'll show you my Chinos.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:38.080]   Look at that. This, by the way, this, these fit perfectly. And because Taylor store does
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:44.640]   something unique, these are custom tailored clothes. And you use their size me app to take a picture
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:49.920]   of you. And then that's the measurement. And then they send you shirts that fit like it was a
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:56.320]   tailor made it for you. Because it is custom made. I love Taylor store. I've been using
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:04.800]   their stuff for some time. And now they've added so many new options. The size me app just completely
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:10.400]   changes the measurement process using advanced technology and algorithms. They actually have a
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:15.200]   quick size option. If you, if you don't want to do this, which creates a measurement profile in
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:19.920]   just a few simple steps, you enter your height, your weight, their algorithm does the measurement
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:24.720]   profile. One of the things I really like when you go to Taylor store and you order your first
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:32.960]   products, you get one right away. I got my shirt. I got the new shirts. This is actually my old one.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:37.760]   But I got some new shirts. Like one of them. And I got the new Chinos, one of them. And I ordered a
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:41.840]   suit too, because they do suits now. And they sent, so they sent me a shirt. And they sent me
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.920]   the pants. They said if these fit, we'll send you the rest of them, they did. The suit was fun.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:51.600]   They send you a fake suit. It's like in canvas. You actually kind of tempted to wear it. I may
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:57.360]   wear it someday. It's a canvas suit. And then you take pictures of yourself in the suit and you say,
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.880]   you know, I'd like this to be a little roomier. And in fact, I did. They're going to send me
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:06.000]   another size or so. They're very careful with the suit. Still, the suits are just a little over 300
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.400]   bucks. And you and the best part about Taylor store. Well, there's two best parts. One is that,
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:19.040]   that they're custom. The other is boy, do you get choices? The fabrics, the thread color,
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:27.440]   the buttons, the embroidery, I chose the lining in my suit. You can, it's more than just tailored.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:35.760]   It's me. Customized dress shirts, Chinos, suits, polo shirts, shorts. When my suit comes, I'll wear
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:41.680]   it. It's a beautiful suit. I'm really excited about it. And if you're at all concerned,
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:45.120]   that can this possibly work? Well, besides the fact that everybody here has done it,
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:52.000]   and Mike and I both wear our Taylor store clothes all the time. They're rated 4.7 out of 5 stars by
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:59.600]   thousands of customers on Trust Pilot. Here's an example review from Constantinos. The vast variety
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:04.240]   of fabrics and an easy customization tool are just the beginning. These guys create some of the
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:08.960]   best shirts and garments on the internet. Literally, I am not going to buy a Pratap
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:15.600]   Porte or ready to wear shirt ever again. Me neither. I completely agree with you, Constantinos.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:21.360]   Stephen Roberts says fit is always his expected quality is top notch and shipping routinely seems
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:27.120]   to be faster than originally given as well. Yeah, I got my my shirt within a few days.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:33.760]   It's pretty cool. If the shirt doesn't fit, you don't have to mail it back. Just donated it to
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.960]   charity or a friend that does fit. Say this doesn't fit and they'll send you one that does.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:44.080]   So there's it's a really great process. Then once you got it all, of course, now
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:52.320]   go to Taylor store anytime and get more great clothes. I am such a fan of this company. They do
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:47:00.320]   everything right, including the factories in where the I think Sri Lanka, they will send you
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:05.760]   pictures of your clothing as it's being made. They're just very conscious. They're carbon
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:10.480]   neutral. I just love this company and I'm really happy to have them. Right now we got we we said
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:17.040]   Taylor store, Taylor store. This is a perfect time for you because people don't want to go buy clothes,
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:21.920]   but maybe they need a new zoom shirt or maybe they're getting ready to go back to work.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:27.040]   Now's the time to do this touchless measuring and delivery. And so they said, all right,
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:34.880]   here's what we'll do 20% off plus free shipping, not just for your first purchase, but for every
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:42.160]   purchase through October 31st, 20% off and free shipping through October 31st. But you have to go
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:48.080]   to Taylor store.com/twit and use the offer code to it. That is such a good offer.
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.720]   Actually, we thought they we thought they didn't we thought they didn't they made a mistake.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:59.760]   What you mean the first one? No, no, every purchase until October 31st.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:06.000]   T A I L O R store.com/twit. If it's time to get new clothes, maybe you're ready to
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.160]   emerge from quarantine or maybe you just want to have a zoom shirt that looks better. Honestly,
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:15.520]   I I love I needed suits and I've been waiting for them to do suits now that they do suits and look
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:23.600]   at the fabrics. I'm very boring. I just got black, but my new shirts are a little bit more colorful.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:28.080]   You've seen me in my flamingo shirt though. I thought that was pretty cool. I'm starting to
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.560]   branch out. Mike is a little bit more adventurous than I am. They have such gorgeous fabrics and
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:37.840]   you can get everything just right. You know, they say, do you want one vent in your suit or two
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:42.640]   vents or no vents? Do you want a shirt pocket? Do you want no pocket? Do you want a monogram? Where
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:48.400]   do you want them on a gram? It's completely customizable or just say, no, I want this one.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:53.200]   You know, they have on the website, they have our most popular shirts and you just so yeah,
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:58.960]   yeah, that's easy. Just pick that one. But actually, and I've done that too and they're all very nice,
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:04.640]   but to customize this, I'm just show you the interface and you get some some idea of what's
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:08.320]   going on. Now, remember, they already have my measurements. So everything I'm doing here,
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:15.760]   I can do completely. I know this shirt will fit perfectly completely with my measurements.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:21.680]   You could choose, look at all the colors. I decided to do a crazy thing. I ordered five
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:27.040]   shirts with no collar. I just thought, I'm ready for colorless. I'm ready to be a big boy now.
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:32.240]   But if you want to be like like the billionaires and you want to have the the Jeff Bezos spread
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:40.320]   collar, you can get that. If you want to be like George Will and have a collar, a pin collar,
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:46.960]   with a collar, stay, you can do that. I have kind of now eliminated, I used to be such a preppy.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:53.040]   It was always the same button down. I have changed my life. What's a placket? I now know.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:59.920]   Do you know what a placket is? Look, that's with the placket. That's without a placket.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:05.920]   You can look at the difference. Can you see the difference? Placket? No placket. Oh, that's a
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:11.120]   placket or a narrow placket. I had no idea where the you could choose your placket, folks.

[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:44.720]   because I got some more shirts. Actually, before they came back, I ordered a ton of shirts and pants.
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:48.960]   I said, "They got chinos." They said, "They have suits." I can't wait to get my suit. You're going
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:57.920]   to love it. Taylor store.com/twit offer code, Twit. Okay, so we did the Phil Schiller. We did the
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:04.160]   new iMacs. April quarterly results came out last week.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:13.120]   So much. Did they have a good quarter? They had a good quarter. Yeah. Let's put it this way.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:20.720]   They surpassed Saudi Aramco to become the world's most valuable company on Friday,
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:30.160]   partly because of their Thursday stock results. Shares are up 10%. 10%. They've even gone up more.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:38.960]   In fact, we'll talk about the testimony last week. All four big tech companies that
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:47.200]   testified, their stocks went up $250 billion after the testimony. They had a shelter in place,
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:51.520]   but it wasn't after the testimony. It was after a shelter in place when we were all desperate for
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:56.160]   new computers and new things to walk on them and buy for them. Tech, baby. Who knew tech was going
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:52:06.400]   to be the next big thing? Really, really good. How good was the quarter? Laurie, you can give us the
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:13.200]   rundown. It was really, really, really good. It was a lot better than they expected.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:21.040]   Based on the things that they did really well in, it's actually unsurprising because of the shelter
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:30.400]   in place orders. More people are looking for things like iPads, Macs, laptops, things like that.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:35.840]   So really, they got a boon from that, for sure. They were prepared, honestly. They were
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:42.960]   not prepared for the pandemic, but they pivoted really well for the pandemic. They got their
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:49.920]   ducks in a row pretty quickly to prepare for it. It's pretty cool. I was surprised to see 60%
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:58.000]   of their business is global, not in the US. I think the first time in a long time,
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:05.760]   iPad and Mac led Apple's financial results. I guess that's the shelter in place bump.
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:16.960]   My phone, SE was fortuitous to launch one it did. One thing we thought might be worrisome,
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:21.680]   I didn't think so, but there were a lot of pundits saying, "Oh, services, they're weak."
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:32.000]   Service is 15% up. It's a wide category. My favorite thing was Neil Seibart.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.240]   When the results came in going, "Why didn't you tell me you bought new iPads and Macs?"
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:43.200]   It would have changed everything. This is projections for those who were lost.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:52.800]   I always go to six colors to get Jason Snell's graphs to get some sense of it.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:58.160]   iPhone seems less dominant. It used to be more than half of revenue.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:02.240]   That's such a good thing, though, because it means the other products are...
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:06.160]   The big concern was that the iPhone is always going to fail. If it does well,
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.120]   this year, it's just even less chance it's going to do well next year. Come on, people.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:15.520]   It's showing that Apple is putting other products in the field and those products can do well.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:19.280]   While iPhone is still a huge earner for them, it's not a huge dependency,
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:23.040]   which is Wall Street's favorite thing. You grow this business, "Oh, you grow it so big. Now,
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:30.720]   we're worried about it." Over your total revenue growth, 11%, very nice.
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:40.000]   Mac up $7 billion. Year to year, Mac revenue changed 22% increase.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:48.880]   iPad 31% over last year. iPad revenue $6.6 billion. The iPhone is $26 billion,
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:54.640]   although because this is an off-quarter, that's actually better than we would have expected.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:55:00.560]   Their peaks are always in the first quarter of the year. We're in Q3. Revenue up 2%.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:07.840]   Services revenue, you like that line. It maybe isn't as big a growth as it has been in the past.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:11.680]   $13.2 billion in revenue. That's off a little bit, isn't it?
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:21.600]   I think with the services, the one, there's a lot of comment on how streaming services grew
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:27.440]   exponentially across the board because of the pandemic. There's been a lot of question about
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:35.520]   how is Apple weathering this streaming services, which this is about their revenue. That's not
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:44.320]   going to matter because nobody's paying for Apple TV Plus yet. I do wonder whether or not
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:49.040]   Apple TV Plus is going to weather this storm. If they're not
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:57.760]   lots more traffic than they ever were before, then they're looking at a danger zone because
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:05.280]   everybody grew Netflix and Hulu, HBO, and Disney. All of these other organizations grew, grew,
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:10.320]   grew, grew during the last four months. But we're not hearing anything about that with Apple.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:16.720]   Obviously, they don't report numbers called out like that. But I do wonder whether or not TV Plus
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:24.800]   saw traffic increases and whether or not they have some plans in place to fix that, which
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:29.040]   honestly, as much money as they've dumped into TV Plus, they're not letting go of that. They're
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:35.760]   going to do what they have to do to make it a service that is sustainable. It might be harder
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:39.280]   than it would have been had the pandemic not taken place.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:43.440]   Well, I mean, there's clearly the flaw in TV Plus is no catalog.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:48.880]   And there's just not enough content to keep. There's not enough content to keep it.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:53.280]   People are subscribing because you've seen it all or you've seen everything you want to see
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.600]   anyway. And Oprah's new book is not going to probably draw more much more traffic.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:01.840]   There's nothing coming. If they had a Mandalorian or they had a Game of Thrones or they had a
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.760]   Sopranos or they had one of those things that makes a service for as long as that was showing
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:11.040]   you episodes, that'd be great. But like you said, the next job after the big hit is I'm bored now.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:17.760]   What do I watch after that? But they can fix that. It takes time. HBO didn't have catalog
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:24.160]   when it's turning out. And also, TV Plus was always going to be a slow burn anyway. So,
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:28.880]   they're lower expectations for it. It's not like QB where they're saying, "How come you're just doing
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:33.520]   17% of what you said you'd do with this?" The absolute minimum. It'd be interesting if there
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:39.200]   are metrics on when the biggest event that Apple seems to have had was the acquisition of
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:44.720]   Tom Hanks Greyhound movie. So, that would be an interesting metric to take a look at. That when
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:52.320]   there is something that is well promoted, well-broad demographic, sort of like an event for Apple TV,
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:57.440]   even then where people just simply not aware that there is this thing called Apple TV next to
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:02.160]   Netflix, next to YouTube, next to Hulu, next to Disney Plus that they can actually get entertainment
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:08.480]   from. Because if the numbers for that were pretty, pretty low, that indicates a need for extra work.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:18.960]   That would be a concern. Well, $11.3 billion in profit for three months.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:24.000]   So, the interesting thing for me on the services is that Tim Cook made a commitment to shareholders
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.320]   and to Wall Street that Apple would double their services revenue by this year.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:33.360]   And they achieved that six months early. And he declined to make another commitment that they
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:38.960]   would be doubled again over the next two years. And a huge portion of that is App Store revenue.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:43.280]   Way more than it used to. It's still a huge money maker. It's the driver. And it's one of the most
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:49.840]   controversial ones. So, I'm hoping against hope that his reticence to renew that commitment is
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:53.680]   because they're rethinking all the stuff we've been talking about with the App Store for the last.
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:59.200]   Several months, years. Well, we're going to get to the App Store because it's still,
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:03.920]   boy, it's such a debate. And I kind of respect Alex Lindsey's point of view, which is, hey,
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:09.680]   Apple built this. If you wanted to open a forever 21 in the local mall,
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:16.000]   you wouldn't expect to do it for free. You got to pay rent. I feel like you get 10 years for that,
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:22.320]   right? Your innovation tax gets you 10 years. And then after that, the world changes so much
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:27.200]   that you've got to figure out a new mall. And there's also exceptions and things you didn't think about.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:31.760]   And that's really, I think it's the edges. It's the edge cases that they're getting in trouble.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:35.200]   We're going to get to that a little bit. But enough to say a good quarter,
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:39.600]   a better than expected quarter for Apple. More switches again, too. Say again?
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:44.000]   More switchers again, too. Tim Cook was very happy to announce that more people were switching
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.960]   to iPhone before as well because of the iPhone SEI thing primarily. And the number of most
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:54.000]   popular phones they still have is ridiculous in so many markets. It's like their number one and two
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.720]   out of three in North America, one, two and three out of four, I think, in the United Kingdom,
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.920]   three or four out of six in some of the other markets.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:06.960]   They aren't the number one phone manufacturer in the world.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.520]   Huawei of all people is followed by Samsung. Not by product.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:15.840]   By volume. By number of hands. They sell more phones, but Apple's phone is more.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:21.200]   Apple's single phone is the most popular, but Huawei sells many more phones. They make so many
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.280]   phones. Samsung, they make so many phones. They're into your tonnage, but no single phone out
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.800]   sells. Which Apple's single phone is the most popular? All of them?
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:34.400]   Well, the iPhone 11 is the most popular phone. And I forget what number two was.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.840]   I don't think he elaborated. But are they comparing? I'm sure we could look up somewhere.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:43.840]   Okay. All right. That's always been a weird statistic. It's not meaningless.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:49.600]   But when you're talking about how if you want a phone that runs iOS, if you bind to the ecosystem,
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:55.600]   that's the only game in town. You don't have options. Whereas in the Android space, if you
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.560]   want to buy a premium Android phone, you've got at least six premium options and at least 12
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:07.040]   really, really good, like 500 or 400 dollar options. So I've never really understood exactly what it
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:10.640]   means, except for the fact that iPhones is popular.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:14.160]   Apple. Also, sorry. Go ahead.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:18.640]   Oh, it's just going to add that Samsung and Huawei have basically the banks of
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.560]   a country's behind them. So it's like other Android vendors would love to sell that many,
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.840]   but they don't have the market share and the marketing that drives that market share because
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:30.800]   they don't have virtually unlimited bank accounts. I think HTC wishes they did.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.600]   Well, all these companies also wish they had Apple's checkbook.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:39.040]   Yes. The number one most valuable company beating Saudi Aramco.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.840]   Yeah. That's pretty amazing.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.880]   Awesome fuel oligopoly.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:48.320]   Yeah. See, if Apple were really serious about their environmental stuff, they would just like
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.480]   buy, they would like acquire oil companies and force them to stop selling oil.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.040]   Like let's stop them down and keep playing around with the shareholders.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.640]   Who were using recycled aluminum?
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:02.960]   Apple is going to, Apple stock once again, climbing up almost $500. They're going to do a
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:11.440]   four for one stock split on August 24th. So if you have the worst career ever, because if all of us
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:17.760]   had just not gone into journalism, they're piggy bank. They'll all be sitting on the beach now,
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.800]   collecting 20%.
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:27.280]   So somebody in the chat room said the Apple stock that he bought in 2000 A is worse,
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:33.200]   what did he say? Five times more, something like that. 500%. That's not bad.
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:37.120]   Si. Yeah.
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:44.000]   Well, that's life. If we chose journalism, we get to talk about it.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.240]   And I know nothing about the stock market. So I've probably saved myself
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.400]   more money than I've lost.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.520]   Would have lost twice over.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.680]   Exactly. Exactly.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:01.200]   It's like every time I've been under, every time I've tried to answer the question,
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:05.200]   even if we get past the ethical stuff, there's the legal stuff of, how much do you know that's
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:10.480]   not public knowledge and how much are you willing to prove that you didn't actually,
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.080]   eh, it's not worth it.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:16.000]   Yeah. Hey, I was a little concerned when I read this. I don't know. Maybe one of you can explain.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:25.200]   9 to 5 Mac, a new, unpaturable exploit allegedly found on Apple's secure enclave chip.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:31.120]   That would be a very, very big deal.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.680]   Yeah, previous version of the facility deal.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:34.720]   Except that it's not.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.120]   Okay.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:44.080]   Yeah. So I don't know. I don't think anybody knows yet what the exploit is capable of doing.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:49.920]   It's just been found, period. That's it. But there's also, it's something that
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:56.560]   the person actually would have to have the phone in their hands or have remote access to the phone
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:02.000]   in order to have remote access or have access to the secure enclave, which means, you know,
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.880]   it's a very big deal for a very small number of people out there.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.320]   I would caution you on that one.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:14.720]   Because generally the really, the big threats are chains of exploits.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.120]   And so, yeah, right now, if you wanted, we don't even know what exactly this exploit was.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:22.000]   It was discovered by a Chinese hacking team.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:22.960]   It's a party, right?
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:23.440]   The Panggu team.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.800]   I think Credy posted it on Twitter.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:29.760]   Credy? Oh, okay. It said, "Team Panggu has found an unpaturable vulnerability.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:36.720]   However, that would be the last step in an exploit chain. So you're right. Maybe the
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:41.840]   financial thing, you'd have to be holding it in your hand. But maybe you could eventually get
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:46.640]   a drive-by-mow wear attack that would then open up this possibility, that possibility to get to the
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:51.440]   point. As soon as you cracked something like the secure enclave, that is a real cause for concern,
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:53.040]   especially because it's company-aware.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.720]   Great.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:05:00.480]   And then there's Selbright and the other companies that specialize in providing law enforcement with
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:05.760]   tools to break into stuff like that. What's stored in your secure enclave?
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:07.680]   Everything.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.440]   I mean, that's the keys to the kingdom.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:09.920]   That's it.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:10.960]   That's the hardware keys.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.400]   Including your encryption chips.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:12.880]   Your biometrics.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.400]   So if you got the secure enclave,
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:14.960]   your part information.
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.360]   You'd be able to decrypt the entire, the contents of the entire phone.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:21.280]   If you read up, I mean, we don't know. It was a huge black box, and they managed to
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.880]   peel away one layer of protection a couple of years ago, only to find that there was,
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:30.400]   other stuff beyond the obfuscation. So we don't know what access they have or what they did.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:34.080]   But they're going to keep, especially the older chips, they're going to keep hammering on those.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:39.120]   And I forget what this was. It was A11 earlier.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:45.040]   So any of the newer chips, which there are hundreds of thousands of
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:49.760]   phones that are on A11 and earlier. So that is a big deal, but the 1213 and anything in the
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:50.960]   future won't be a good idea.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.720]   That's really good news, means you could, if you got something,
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.680]   anything later than a 10.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.960]   If you're really worrying, buy a new phone.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:57.280]   Yeah.
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.800]   Even the new SE.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:05:59.760]   It's a horrible, but it's preferable.
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.920]   It would be protected because it's young from 2012.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:07.760]   Yeah. I mean, it's not good, though. You don't want these kinds of bugs to show up, and it's not
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:13.600]   the first time. So it's cost for concern.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:17.600]   Yeah, they will, though. And so it's just, for me, it always depends how the company reacts to it.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:21.200]   Like, what is the exposure? What's the threat level? Who's at risk?
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.240]   How do they respond? And what are the options for people who need to
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.400]   to not be in that?
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:31.360]   Laurie's right. It's probably is only of real concern to people for whom
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:38.000]   nation-states or law enforcement would want to spend the energy and the time to try to get into
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.360]   their stuff. But it could conceivably become an exploit that's built into the next sell-bright
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:48.240]   machine that the customer's in border patrol has when we're named Richie once again tries to
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.440]   get into our fair land.
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:53.360]   Well, no, but the funny thing is that always when they catch these people, too, they have the
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:59.440]   oldest iPhones. They seize these phones, and it's always like, it's like an iPhone 4,
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.280]   or like an iPhone 5 or something.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.520]   That's because being a terrorist just doesn't pay that well.
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:08.320]   Well, it's one of my favorite law enforcement quotes, right? How did you catch them?
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:13.040]   Tail light turns out that there's no amount of manpower or money that equals the person being
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:13.520]   stupid.
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.440]   Yep. Speaking of stupid.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:25.600]   Have you been following the Twitter hack? And they have now arrested three young men, the chief
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:31.360]   hacker, who's... I'm not going to mention these guys names because it's always all alleged,
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:38.560]   but it was a very detailed indictment. And the chief hacker Kirk, as we called him,
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:42.320]   turned out to be a 17-year-old who had just graduated from high school.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.400]   It's like a giant talent bob movie.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:50.240]   It's like so bizarre. But that was kind of expected. The fact that they had something so
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:54.080]   valuable, and they just basically took it to the pawn shop and took $20 for it.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:08:00.880]   And also the fact that if Motherboard was correct, that they were talking to people who
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:06.960]   had actually committed this thing, that's exactly like 17-18-year-old kid mentality.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:13.440]   Getting money from it would be one thing, but there's no way you're keeping your mouth shut
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.400]   about something you thought that was really, really awesome that you managed to do.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:22.480]   Well, and it was like their ops sec was terrible. They reused handles.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:28.560]   They actually, the biggest thing I think that will be probably the evidence that will convict him.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.520]   And by the way, the 17-year-old is charged with 30 felonies and will be tried as an adult.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:41.200]   The thing that will end up convicting him is he used his driver's license to create the coin-based
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:47.680]   account, which you have to do, the coin-based account that he used for storing all that illegal
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:53.840]   gain. And reused handles and all sorts of things. But we still don't know what accounts they
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:57.040]   downloaded, right? We still don't know if this was all just talking about the thing where they
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:03.280]   Twitter knows, but is not telling. Twitter almost certainly has logs,
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:08.720]   because notice they went from, oh, he downloaded the DMs from eight accounts to, oh, he downloaded
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:16.320]   the DMs from 36 accounts. I think the logs tell all. We're going to learn more because the indictment
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:22.080]   is public. There's a lot of information. Motherboard did have the most complete story, and they published
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:26.720]   names. I'm not going to mention names because, you know, it's all so thankful that it was such a
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:32.400]   high school plot because it could have been so much worse. Yeah. And at least now,
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:36.560]   they'll be under huge pressure to operate like an adult big, big-person company.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.480]   Right. I hope so. This is not the first time Twitter has been hacked.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:46.080]   I hope they maybe they learn a lesson. I was watching the latest half his interesting video about
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:50.320]   the seven people who have the keys to rebooting DNS and just like the elaborate security.
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:54.400]   Oh, yeah. Is that fun? The key rotation. That's where Twitter says.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.960]   Sarah Moni. Absolutely. Yeah.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:04.880]   Charlie Monroe, let's do this story because you were a little, you were talking about this before
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:12.640]   the show, Andy. Who is Charlie Monroe? He is a developer, an Apple developer. He creates the
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:18.240]   really great utility downy, which is for downloading streaming videos that like art on Netflix,
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:25.840]   just things that are just open on the on the net. And so I found out that about a problem when I
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:32.800]   tried to restart my Mac, I always have downy like open, try to relaunch downy for said,
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:37.600]   don't start. Nope. We'll launch, try to relaunch downy three, wouldn't relaunch.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.400]   Try went to the website. So you will maybe have a corrupted version.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:44.960]   Then the download link on the website goes to a 404 page.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:50.640]   And the, when I looked at the console logs, the error was that this was, there's a problem with
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:57.520]   the signature of this app. And you go, I went down to look at the dialogue box that somebody tweeted.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:02.240]   Yeah. Downy four will damage your computer. You should move it to the trash.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.160]   And then a box that says report malware to Apple to protect other users.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:11.840]   Because so what happened? Well, I got, I got a, I emailed him this morning. It got,
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.280]   looks like a bulky email because obviously he's getting lots of emails. Hi, my developer account
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:20.400]   was suspended today without anyone telling me why this is the cause, why the apps are crashing,
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:25.440]   as the signature certificates have been revoked. The downloads from the official site have been
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:29.440]   removed for the time being as they would not work anyway. Please bear with me as I try to get
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.120]   this fixed with Apple, which may take several days as I am receiving dozens of reports like
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:38.080]   yours every hour. Please not. Once it's fixed, working download will be available for my website.
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:43.040]   And please check my blog, please check Facebook. So this is that notarization thing we've talked
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:47.440]   about before. If you're an Apple developer and you want to distribute apps, even if it's not in the
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:54.480]   app store, you have to submit the app to Apple and they notarize it. Apparently they don't,
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:59.200]   they don't, it's not clear what they do to give to notarize it. They kind of imply that it's
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:04.240]   just an automated process, but it's not fully automated. Are they vetting the apps? Are they
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:09.280]   looking at the apps more thoroughly? I don't know. I noticed that Downey doesn't work. However,
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:13.680]   I also own another one of his apps called Permute and that one launches just fine. Oh, interesting.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:20.400]   I bought that from the app store directly. It's, again, there is nothing but silence here
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:25.760]   from Apple. We don't know exactly whether this was, as Renee said earlier, whether this was just a
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:30.240]   screw up and they'll fix the screw up or whether they're saying, oh, well, this is a naughty app.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:34.800]   You're not supposed to be downloading videos that are meant to be streamed. We don't approve.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:43.280]   And so yank for you and yank for your application. But if that is the case, boy, that sucks Apple.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.400]   That's just such a terrible thing. And that's the reason.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:55.520]   I think I'm just, I was just, all I was going to say to wrap up is that this is what worries me
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:00.320]   the most about Apple gatekeeping. That if Apple wants to control all the apps that are in the
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:07.040]   app store, that's absolutely their right. But if I've spent $1,500, $2,000, $32,000 on a Mac,
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.440]   you don't get to tell me that I can't run like an app permitted pen and developer on it. You
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:18.480]   certainly aren't allowed to let me, excuse me, to suddenly disconnect, turn off my access to an
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:22.800]   app that I've bought and paid for. I've been relying on day to day to day. That's just stupid,
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:28.160]   piggy behavior. Can't you just couldn't he distribute the app unnotarized? And then you would have to do
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:32.720]   the right click on open. Yeah, that's the whole thing is so weird is that like, it's basically
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:36.320]   all that this is supposed to be as a train of trust to prove that this app comes from that
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.320]   developer. So it does two things. One, it proves that this app comes from the developer so that
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:45.200]   somebody can't make a fake malware version. They just scan for Mal, for malicious content.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:50.400]   But it's like, you know, hacker B can't put up this app and say this is the same app and you'll
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:56.320]   confuse the two and install it. And also if there is an app that's infected or if something happens,
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:02.160]   like a, like a developer sell, somehow like bad code gets put in a bad SDK or somehow like
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:06.000]   anything bad happens and they have to push that emergency button, which I think they've only done
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.120]   a couple of times. And it was in cases of imminent harm to users. The app can be, you know, remotely
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:16.400]   detonated or rendered null. But it doesn't make sense in this case because well, a couple things
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:20.240]   don't make sense is usually that there's a back and forth. Like even in cases where developers
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:24.560]   have had their accounts deleted, there was a huge paper chain of we think you're doing this fraud.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:29.040]   We found 30 or four other apps under your name that are scamming people this way. And we've proven
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:34.080]   that it's you and there's this huge public thing about it. This was like out of the blue,
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:40.800]   according to him. And also that that well, Apple can't talk about it without him because it's
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:44.400]   private, it's his information. They can tell him what happened. They just can't put out a statement
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:48.640]   and saying, Oh, you know, this was blah, blah, blah. They have to go through him on this. But
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:52.800]   under no parameter for which this system is designed to work does it seem to have worked in this case,
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:57.120]   which is why I suspect that it was just a huge mess. We should point out it's someone didn't sign
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:01.680]   a certificate somewhere. It's an automated system according to Apple, which means it could go wrong.
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:09.600]   Automated systems almost always go wrong at some point. So it's it's scanning for malicious
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:17.680]   content. It checks for code signing issues. It's possible that his certificate was compromised
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:25.680]   and they detected that. And so I think it would be prudent before worrying about gatekeeping.
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:28.640]   Because there's been no other example of Apple saying, Oh, yeah, we're not going to
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.120]   notarize this. Like they tried to ban another app and accidentally hit his like there's so many
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:37.600]   levels of dumb that could have happened. So I will wait. This just happened today, right, Andy?
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:43.760]   Just happened today just happened this morning about 12 hours ago. But it is disturbing that
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:49.520]   even if it's an automated mistake, that there is no automated email saying, Hi, this is why you're
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:56.560]   going to have your customers can't watch your apps today. What is possible though, or correct me
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:03.440]   if I'm wrong, it was my understanding I could write an app and have people download it. It would just
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:09.680]   get that gatekeeper warning saying, we can't verify this app. And then you would have to right
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.880]   click and select open from the menu, or you would have to turn off gatekeeper. There's ways around
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:21.680]   that. So he could distribute it without notarization. They haven't yet got to the point where you must
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:26.320]   be notarized to run on Mac. No, yeah, you can. It's an extra step. And I think by default, it's not
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:31.280]   like there that little radio button isn't available by default. Like you can still do it, but they
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:36.800]   don't make it a default option for you anymore. I'm more has a wonderful article, which talks about
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:42.720]   the shell command. You can issue the turn it back on, which I think is a good I mean, I'm going to
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:47.040]   I do that will probably will always do that with any new Mac. I'll leave the default be
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:53.280]   leave gatekeeper on. But if the fact that I could turn it off is a very nice feature. And I
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:17:00.480]   often download apps that I have to right clicker command click and open manually. Once you do that
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:06.320]   once, it's the last time and then it opens from then on. Yeah. So we Charlie's thought was the
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:11.840]   was the best way to go. Absolutely. Let me let me let it's the it's the best both worlds were
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:16.160]   apples giving its prudence and expertise saying that if we have no if we're not familiar with
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:20.880]   this developer, there are certain risks involved. But obviously if you're willing to go back, do
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:25.120]   what we tell you, which is to go back and assist in preferences and approve the launch of this app,
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:29.040]   then it's not our it's not our place to tell you not to launch an app. Yeah.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:34.880]   I'm just I'm just bummed because there's there's a streaming event tonight that I was not going
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.960]   to have time to watch. And I really wanted to like, yeah, you are it. And so it looks like I'm
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:44.880]   going to have to miss it. Because he could he absolutely could release it unnotarized.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:51.520]   I hope so. I do notarized. And I think you would probably in a normal course of events,
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:58.400]   just notarize it. It costs you 99 bucks a year, right? Is that right? All you need to do is pay
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:04.240]   for the Apple developer account and you can get it. I think so, yeah. But but that's but does
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.240]   something like this does like make you start there. Well, maybe I shouldn't notarize my app.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:13.200]   If I maybe I should just be the complete like completely outside the the Apple app ecosystem.
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:17.600]   If it means that again, something can get screwed up and there can be innocent mistake that nonetheless
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:23.440]   means that, Hi, I'm on deadline and this tool that I absolutely rely on to make things work
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:28.480]   because my mistake is down for two or three days for absolutely no adequately explained reason.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:33.040]   So it's just an inconvenience for me. But if it were for if it were like a big problem for
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:38.000]   someone else, if there was like a statistical analysis app saying that, Hey, I don't get to
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.040]   report the news like two days late. But thank you very much. Anyway, I download, I would say
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:48.160]   every week I download an app that I have to right click open. Yeah, just maybe that's the nature of
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:53.840]   this kind of stuff I'm playing with. But that's very common. Yeah, for me anyway. And I don't mind
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:58.800]   doing that. But I could see if you wanted to have a more polished app or more commercially
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.960]   viable app that you might say, well, I got to have it notarized. But then that's the downside.
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:06.400]   Then if it gets revoked, if this starts to happen a lot, then I don't think anybody's going to
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:10.240]   know that. So that's the other reason that Apple might want to act quickly. It's also scary for
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:13.600]   people like people who aren't very technologically savvy. They rely on these things to tell them
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.960]   what's safe to download or not. And they hear horror stories about people getting malware and
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:21.840]   viruses, download off the and some of those sites like download, like all those free software
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:26.720]   download sites are scary as hell. It's damaging to me with 800 Yahoo toolbar. It's damaging to his
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:32.000]   reputation because people will inevitably going to connect that message with downy. That's not good.
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:36.960]   So I would hope Apple will quickly respond. And we've seen like it's totally not the same thing,
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:40.400]   but we've had several times like it happened on iMORT 2 where something happened with the
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:44.960]   certificate and our site was said Google declared our site had malware. Right. Right. Couldn't get to
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:49.440]   it and we had to try to find somebody to fix it. And it's just yes, it's super protective. But
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:55.360]   if you're ever on the wrong side of it, right. Right. Well, that's the downside of strong security.
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:01.920]   New iPhone will not be coming out until October. Apple actually said this in the analyst call,
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:05.280]   right. Lori, did you were you on the phone on the horn?
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:11.360]   Yeah, it was like, wait, what? What? Hey, somebody write that.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:16.560]   Luca Main Street, the CFO said, as you know, last year, we started selling the new iPhone in
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:22.640]   late September this year. We project supply to be available a few weeks later, i.e. October.
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:30.240]   Not unprecedented though. No. And not a surprise. I mean, the fact that they even have anything
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:36.080]   coming, anything in the pipeline is kind of like a big deal. They're keeping going with it even
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:42.080]   without even with the issues with the pandemic and the supply line and everything. So a few weeks
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:49.920]   later is if they just said by November, I would have been like, yeah, okay, that's, you know, it's
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:53.600]   before Christmas. So they're doing their job. All survive. I like my iPhone 11.
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:21:01.600]   We're the 6.1 inch ones. 6.1 inch normal and 6.1 inch pro will come out first. And then the baby
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:08.240]   and the giant one will come out later. But that just seems weird. Which one do I want, Renee?
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:12.960]   I kind of hope they do though, because the years where they had staggered launches was so much
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:18.640]   easier for us to do review. Thinking purely selfishly, it was worse for consumers. But just like in terms
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.160]   of reviews, it's easier to do one thing at a time. This started when the 10R came out.
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:27.360]   This started when the 10R came out later. The 10 came out a month after you did. That's right.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.160]   The 10 came out and then the 10R the next year. And that was the most popular iPhone.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:36.320]   And they've kind of done that all along now with these, like the SE, I don't even know,
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:45.840]   that came out six months later. Yeah. I mean, so you think it will be which will be available
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:50.560]   first, the premium ones or the less premium ones? Well, the rumor says one premium one,
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:55.520]   non-premium both the same size. But I just find odd. Those screens may be more readily available.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:22:01.840]   Well, the regular one has the second class OLED screen, not the latest, greatest Samsung screen.
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:05.680]   But I think they tried BOE and that didn't work out. So now they're with LG or they're back with
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:11.200]   an older Samsung. And how big is the big one going to be? 6.1.
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:16.480]   It's .7, I think. Is that bigger than the Pro Max?
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:21.280]   Yeah, a little bit bigger. And the regular one's going to be a little bit smaller.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:26.480]   So they're going, they're changing on both ends. Unbelievable. How does Apple do it?
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:31.520]   And the leak for that was so funny because there's been no display zoom on the regular side.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:38.480]   Like the iPhone X, iPhone XS and iPhone 11 Pro had no display zoom because there was no
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:44.000]   interface size smaller than them that they could just scale up for accessibility. And now in iOS 14,
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.840]   that interface is there. So people just like, oh, I wonder how big it is. Let's just measure.
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:53.200]   iOS 14 won't be delayed, right? Yeah, it's come about the same time as the phones, I think. So
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:58.960]   it'll come out in October instead of September. Oh, oh, not at the announcement.
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:04.800]   It's usually two days. The gold master usually comes at the announcement and then the
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.800]   the shipping version, the general release two days before the phones hit the
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:12.800]   like usually the Thursday, Wednesday or Thursday before the phones come out on Friday.
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:19.280]   Bloomberg reports, Apple just bought Moby wave. Don't know if this means anything. It's a startup
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:24.720]   that allows phones to become payment terminals. So this is maybe Apple trying to compete with
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:34.320]   Square. Yeah. Like when he said the Apple hardware as a POS device is this unsung hero of the
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:38.000]   product line. The number of times you interact with an iPad, the number of times you interact with
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.600]   an iPhone or even a Mac, that's a very that's it's it's it's not like health in terms of Apple
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:50.800]   inventing in making sure that part of its business is this really, really nice growth market, but
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:54.480]   it makes a very it makes a whole lot of sense for them to go into POS more.
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:24:02.400]   Ewan McGregor is the new Apple TV plus star. He will ride an electric Harley
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:10.400]   through South America, but not as Obi-Wan. I think he's cool. Is he gonna have that weird little
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:16.240]   beard thing that he had? Probably. Yes. He's done this before. He has a couple of different
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:21.040]   motorcycle than like travel shows. Yeah. They're all like pretty amazing. The music is pretty
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:25.040]   incredible. So this is this is a pretty interesting get for them. I like it. They're gonna ride the
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:28.800]   live wires. Those electric Harley sets. Yeah. I'm not gonna have the high ground.
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:33.600]   They're gonna keep hearing. They're gonna start in Shaya, which is all the way down.
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:38.480]   And then they're gonna go all the way up to Mexico. So that's gonna be quite a ride
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:43.440]   from the tip of South America all the way up to Mexico. Kind of like easy ride. What
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:47.280]   do they do? They stop and eat food. It's a reality show, right? I haven't seen this.
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:52.240]   And it's very it's very off the cuff. It looks like something that like he could have been
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:57.680]   shoot he and his friends could be shooting himself. Yeah. It's not like from 2019. Yeah. Exactly.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:02.240]   It's not it's not like a Michael Palin documentary where there's a big crew that's falling around.
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:07.520]   Okay. And now let's now let's go to this arranged thing to see this part of this this part of
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:12.960]   of culture. It really is a very back of it. It's like you're riding on the back of his motorcycle.
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:17.040]   Your arms wrap tightly around his torso. So close to me.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:17.920]   You can kill motor.
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:19.840]   You can kill this bike on the highway.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.560]   You can kill. Looking for adventure.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:29.120]   Oprah Winfrey Apple TV plus Oprah Winfrey Apple news plus blah blah blah.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:33.120]   She's gonna be guest editor for Apple news. I don't know.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:35.680]   They're gonna have guest editors. What does that even mean? I don't know.
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.080]   I want Andy to be a guest editor.
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.600]   I do too. Set some some some some hard straight.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:47.200]   Yes. The press release we got yesterday was that cast the origins of our
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:50.400]   discontenses the is no way but that's not the new book.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:56.720]   Wait a minute. Let me look at these press releases once again. The Oprah books club book
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:01.840]   of the week again. I get mine on Telegram. Did you know you can do that? There's a
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:05.600]   Telegram bot that will send you Apple press releases. It's so awesome.
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.000]   The Apple P. I wish they could get me a burger.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.880]   I want telegrams bots to get me a burger.
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:15.360]   Oh yeah cast the origins of our discontent.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:21.280]   Now available on Apple books Winfrey narrates an exclusive excerpt in a new video
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:26.880]   and will be the first ever guest editor for Apple news Winfrey's conversation with
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:31.840]   Pulitzer Prize winning historian and author Isabel Wilkerson will debut this fall for free on Apple
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:36.160]   TV plus like I said Oprah Winfrey blah blah blah blah blah.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:45.520]   Wow Warren Buffett 35 billion dollars stake in Apple.
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:48.720]   We're thought of four billion now. Nice.
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:50.720]   Well Warren. Good for him.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.720]   Why is he a dummy? No dummy.
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:56.960]   Why do you see things finally go his way for once?
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.000]   Yeah right.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:11.040]   Here's one that this actually raises the interesting challenge for the Apple App Store on iOS.
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:17.840]   Microsoft has a new streaming gaming project that I think will be very popular called XCloud.
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:23.760]   $15 a month to get 100 games. It'll be available September 15th,
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:27.040]   Microsoft announced but not on iOS.
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:35.920]   And that's because of iOS policies right App Store policies.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:43.280]   They've been testing XCloud on iOS but they revealed their testing was limited due to Apple's
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:48.400]   App Store policies. You can't get Google's Stadia on iPhones or iPads either.
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:55.120]   Apple a long time. Yeah it took Apple a long time to get to let get Valve on there.
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:00.320]   Is it the 30%? Is it Apple putting up a roadblock?
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:03.840]   They have a rule against other App Store. It's like you can't have an App Store on the App Store.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:08.000]   Basically it's the rule. I don't think they may you know obviously they care about 30% because
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.520]   money but the higher level rule here is no App Store on App Store which I'm sure makes sense in
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:17.520]   some previous world where you didn't want to have someone shady doing something.
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:21.280]   This is a future. This is clearly how all this stuff is going to work from now on.
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:24.640]   That's what I was talking about when I was saying initially the App Store made sense
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:28.960]   positive and sensible as the edge cases start to emerge. This is an edge case.
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:32.400]   Here is a company, a kind of well-known company. Maybe you heard of them.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:39.440]   Microsoft with my own TikTok soon. My own TikTok and Microsoft says look we want to have
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:47.920]   this and I would say many gamers would want this. This X cloud on the iOS store
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:52.400]   but we don't want to give you 30% or we don't. This could be a problem.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:57.120]   There's no issue for Apple. What's the difference between having this and having HBO Go or HBO
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:00.720]   now on this where you can open up a place and choose a movie. You open up a place and you choose
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:03.760]   a game. It is a subscription. You're not buying individual games.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:11.200]   It is a $15 a month subscription. Although there will be in-app purchase capabilities.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:17.440]   Microsoft is all in on this. I think everything that they showed off at their last event.
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:21.920]   Every single X cloud enabled. Every single program. Yeah, every single game.
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:26.640]   There are multiple services that are going in on streaming games.
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:34.960]   I've read that's one of the reasons why there's a certain shortage on
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:39.440]   certain kinds of video acceleration hardware because they're being bought by the hundreds,
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:43.280]   by the thousands to be put into servers. They're going to run them so you don't have to.
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:45.280]   I think there's all the old such point-minded.
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:51.440]   This would be such an asset to have on an iPad. Surely Apple sees that.
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:53.680]   It really is. Microsoft wants it to be there.
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:56.560]   I'm sure. It would instantly make Apple TV eight times more valuable.
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:58.640]   Oh, good point. Didn't even think of that.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:04.560]   This was also something that I was thinking about earlier that it is possible to get access to
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:11.920]   a Windows server and essentially run desktop windows on any device, including an iPad Pro.
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:16.800]   Wouldn't it be wonderful if Apple just simply made that available as an app or
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:24.000]   macOS as a service and/or at least just let some sort of favored company develop this on their own
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:29.040]   because I can see absolutely the argument for we don't want to blur the lines between the iPad
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:35.840]   and the Mac. But imagine the utility that the extra value that you would have into an iPad.
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:40.320]   If you had the ability to run those few apps that there really is no desktop,
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:45.760]   excuse me, there is no mobile equivalent for iPad. I would pay 15 bucks a month for that in a heartbeat.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:54.240]   It could be that the reason they're not launching it on iOS right away is a rollout.
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:59.120]   Like maybe they're going to run it on Android for a while until all the Android people want it
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:03.600]   and then they'll run it out to Apple products. It's just because if they did both companies all at
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:09.680]   once, it might be too many devices for their cloud service to handle it. We've heard of this
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:15.040]   before where companies will roll out something to all devices and suddenly it crashes. Pokemon
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:20.240]   goes an example of that. Maybe they're just being smart about it and doing it bit by bit instead of
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:25.520]   trying to jump in all at once and then have a bad user experience. I shouldn't impute there's
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:31.360]   some sort of problem with the app store. It could be or it could just be they're just doing one
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:39.920]   then another. It could be anything. We really know that Microsoft is all in on iPad and Mac.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:44.000]   I mean they love it. You're doing it before you're doing it on the Xbox. Yeah.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:53.760]   Xbox controller is supported on iOS and TVOS. The pathway is there for this to happen on Apple
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:59.520]   products. It's just a matter of how soon they can get it done. Yeah. All right, let's take a
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:04.960]   little break and then I think it would be a good time. I think. For us to have our picks of the
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:09.200]   week. What do you think? What about it? That's a good idea. You've got to at least mention it.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:15.520]   Oh, I didn't mention the four CEOs walk into a bar. Can I just say that before this happened,
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:19.280]   I put up a tweet very specifically that said my guesses were tech support requests,
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:24.400]   conspiracy theories, and someone would mess up the mute button and all three of those things
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:31.760]   turned out to be true. Mr. Bezos, I think you're on mute. That's one. Can we have an antitrust
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:36.560]   hearing bingo next time around where each one of those are on a card and we can hopefully win
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:41.360]   our bingo. Tim Cook was like Gina from when she put on Amy's clothes on Brooklyn nine
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:45.440]   nine. So nobody would see her. It was like clearly no saturated. You turn away and they
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:50.240]   forgot about them for like 40 minutes. They didn't work. They really focused on the Bezos and Pichai
[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:56.800]   or pinch what do you call peachy? Why did you ban people? Why did you ban people on Twitter?
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:04.720]   Sir, I own Facebook, sir. Yeah. Well, it's well, it bears mentioning that this wasn't just a
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:10.800]   grandstand sort of trial sort of event. This is the result of one year of investigation,
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:14.400]   which a million documents were turned over. And every and yeah, there were some
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:20.560]   some cringe worthy questions, but a lot of them were super, super pointed in terms of Tim Cook,
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:26.000]   particularly about how you control the app store. Why do what about these allegations in which
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.960]   in which you were banning apps that compete with with Apple apps? What about these this
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:36.080]   testimony from these developers that say that essentially they're you own a monopoly on on
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:41.360]   iPhone apps and you're exercising that unfairly. He didn't get beat up nearly as badly, obviously,
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.080]   as Facebook and Google and Amazon did, because they're not that's that sort of business. But
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:51.440]   nonetheless, this wasn't this isn't like when they hauled when they hauled Zuckerberg after the
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:55.520]   Cambridge Analytica thing, where it's like, okay, well, we have to be seen to be doing something.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:59.280]   We are Congress. We're going to bring him in and then think about what you're doing. No, this is
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:04.880]   essentially when they bring you in when they ask you to come in voluntarily to talk about where
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:10.400]   you were on a certain night and and do you have any witnesses to that? You know that, okay, in the
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:15.120]   next couple of weeks, there's probably going to be either an arrest warrant or I'm going to have to
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:20.480]   turn turn witness against somebody. This was really, really serious heavy stuff. My answer, though,
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:25.760]   was that even the competent people like things aside from like Eric Schmidt talking himself into
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:29.600]   paying eight times more for YouTube than he had to just by weight. I mean, there was such hilarity
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:34.640]   in a lot of stuff, but they came in basically on the premise that these companies were so big
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:39.440]   that they were a threat to the country. And then they proceeded to litigate not that. Like other
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:44.560]   things that are certainly problematic, but that weren't along the lines of those of that stated
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:48.720]   theory, except for the cockamamie conspiracy theories. And then at the end, he just gets up
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:52.960]   gavels and says, it's obvious you're too big breakup. It just it seemed to me like there was like,
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:57.280]   no one with this isn't the end game. As Andy's pointing out, there is going to be a report.
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:02.080]   This was just kind of the pro form. Okay, look, we got a lot of stuff on you guys. And we did learn
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:06.800]   a lot. There were a lot of emails. It was like Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt, like, should you really
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:11.520]   hold send send our Pichai like culpable for some of the things that Eric Schmidt like the comedy
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:17.040]   of Eric Schmidt? But there's also some some, you know, because of, you know, the emails about
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:23.200]   Kindle pricing and, you know, why iOS users can't buy Kindle books, it's revealing about the app
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:29.280]   store. I asked it was great. Yeah, there was a lot of stuff in there. This is a report. It's going
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:35.360]   to come out at maybe end of this year, maybe next year from this. This is the antitrust subcommittee
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:41.600]   of the house judiciary committee. They will have recommendations. I think this was more kind of a
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.920]   pro forma. Okay, well, let's ask these guys, but they have a lot of material they've obviously
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:48.960]   been gathered. Jeff doesn't run Amazon. And the business know what's happening there. He told you
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:52.880]   that he said, I don't know it could happen. Certainly would be against the rules. Yeah.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:56.640]   Yeah. The big the big deal about this is that there is going to be a report from the head of the
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:01.120]   committee later this month. And it's going to be the first or just of a bunch of them. But the big
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:06.880]   deal is that a lot of money and a lot of effort was spent to to amass all of this evidence that now
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:12.480]   Congress can refer to and rely upon and analyze when it comes to deciding, do we need to put further
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:16.080]   controls of excuse me, new controls upon these industries and these companies.
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:22.720]   And there'll be discussions about, for instance, forcing Facebook to get
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:27.520]   Discord's Instagram. There'll be I mean, there's a lot of possibilities. It will also
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:30.720]   be very thing though. Well, I'm not saying that'll happen. There's there.
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:34.800]   No, but I mean, like, they're a blunt weapon. Like, like, I have no like,
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:38.960]   so to me, if I was any of these CEOs, regardless of the comedy that went on, I would be scared out
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.040]   of my mind. I know some people think that nothing's going to come of this, but they have proven,
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:47.200]   like them and the EU that it's basically random chance what they do to you. And the
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:51.360]   their understanding of the technology in the markets is nothing that I would ever want to rely on.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:56.640]   I would do like, if I was Apple, I would offer, I would immediately offer alternate payment programs,
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:00.480]   make sure that apps that don't need to be on an iPhone aren't like, you've got to download them
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:04.560]   from the app store, make sure that clips isn't using any API that isn't available. Like,
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:10.640]   and if I was Google, I'd make sure I never yelped or or like guru, rap guru, anything like that.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:16.080]   Again, if I was all of these companies, I would find the specific things that hurt me the less,
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:19.280]   but disarm them the most. And I would do them instantaneously.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:22.320]   The only thing I would point to in this is
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:32.800]   the Microsoft DOJ hearings of the 90s. And while at the time it really seemed like a complete circus,
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:38.000]   and maybe even a witch hunt. And I think there, I remember at the time many of us thought,
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:44.880]   exactly what you're saying right now, which is that lawmakers in Congress work at a different
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:51.200]   speed than technology. But I think you can also now in hindsight, 20 years later, look back and say,
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:56.960]   you know, it would be a very different Microsoft today if they hadn't had that slap, if they weren't
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:01.120]   forced for instance. And this might be one of the things that they, if you look at what the judgment
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:06.400]   was, I thought it was actually, and I reread it recently because of this, and actually was pretty
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:14.320]   well founded. And it did in fact persuade Microsoft to be a kind of a different company. They had three
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:19.200]   in-house ombudsman watching what they were doing that got to review all the records.
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:25.840]   There was a lot of regulatory stuff that compliance stuff that I don't think was an undue burden
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:31.680]   that I think actually helped Microsoft be a better company in the long run, and was good for the
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:36.480]   computer industry in the long run and the technology industry. I think you can make the argument,
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:43.440]   we wouldn't have the the landscape we have today if it weren't for DOJ Microsoft in 1998.
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:49.760]   So I think there is a roadmap for this that shows it can be done judiciously, appropriately,
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:56.160]   thoughtfully. And I don't think anybody would would say, well, these cut I mean, like being big
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:01.600]   by and even said this, being big by and of itself is not a crime. But whether a privacy
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:06.800]   concerns, there are antitrust concerns, there are market dominance concerns that can be I think
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:11.840]   reasonably a term, a normal business into a crime that like you can do almost everything that they
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:16.800]   are accused of doing when you're small. Absolutely. And you're that's the way it should be. That's
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:23.360]   the law. Yeah, yes, that's because I can throw a wadded up piece of paper at somebody and I'll get
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:29.120]   away with it. But if I should have gun at somebody, that's a much bigger deal. The thing is, it's
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:35.120]   absolutely correct that when a business at scale decides that I here is a here's a competing message
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:41.120]   platform that does something that is that because of our ability to eavesdrop on our users through
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:46.240]   our quote free VPN app, we have determined that they're using this WeChat thing instead of Facebook
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:51.360]   messenger, we need to buy WeChat to make sure that we keep these users in our own ecosystem.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:55.600]   That's obviously an abuse of power. That's something that you can't just write a tree. Instead of
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:40:00.240]   competing with WeChat, you're big enough that you can just simply write a check and own WeChat.
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:08.960]   So what you're saying, Renee, I think is exactly the ideal sort of outcome where when there's a,
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:15.840]   when there is a usually when there is a discrepancy between what the government wants and what the
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:20.160]   industry wants, the best outcome or the usual outcome is a negotiation between the two,
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:24.880]   where we don't have to ask Congress to pass a lot and make what you did illegal. We can just
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:29.200]   make you agree have you agreed that that was a bad thing and we don't want us to bring the hammer
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:34.240]   down on you. No less than we want bring the hand down on you either. The fact that there is pressure
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:39.680]   now from above saying that perhaps you should rethink your app store policy, perhaps you should
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:47.360]   rethink your acquisition of this app. Perhaps you should rethink the idea of again, competing with
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:54.080]   your with your an upcoming competitor by trying to underprice them and make employees in the market
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:58.960]   against them so that you will survive the storm that you create, but your competitor will not.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:04.480]   Once you realize their skin of the game, the way we get down to the basics of is that it's like
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:08.480]   that line from the Simpsons that, hey, we've been trying nothing and we've we tried nothing and
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:14.160]   now we're totally out of ideas. We want we're at the point where we have given these industries
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:23.120]   very little regulation as opposed to just requests and guidelines and we'll get the FDC on you.
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:28.240]   If you screw up, we don't want to have to legislate these industries, but we need to have some pressure
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:33.120]   on them so that you can no longer do whatever you want. You can no longer simply see what is in
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:37.920]   the best interest of Apple. You have to simply say, is this okay for us to do? Are we going to
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:41.360]   make sure that the next Apple, the next Microsoft, the next Google, the next Facebook
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:47.680]   provide an environment which these people can actually create new industries and new markets?
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:54.560]   It's you can't really tell now what but but that's why I point out the Microsoft DOJ case
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:59.360]   because we can look back now and say, you know, it wasn't very popular at the time. People love
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:06.160]   Microsoft and and I remember we put we you know, oh, this is stupid browser ballots in Europe and
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:09.040]   things like that. These are dumb kind of governmental
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:14.640]   and Google was coming anyway and all these. Yeah, but I don't think Google would have been coming
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:19.200]   anyway. There was a really good editorial in the New York Times a couple of years ago by
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:26.720]   Senator Dick Blumenthal and Tim Wu who is really good on this and in it they say the enduring
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:32.240]   lesson of the Microsoft case was that keeping markets open can require a trust buster's courage
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:38.320]   to take decisive action even against a very popular monopolist and you know, they say,
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:43.760]   would we've had a Google? Would we have Facebook? Would we have Netflix? Maybe not with a completely
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:48.880]   dominant Microsoft. So that impressed me so much that I didn't think when it going into this,
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:52.080]   I thought it was a mistake for them to bring all four together at once and I still think it was
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:56.320]   probably a mistake but the thing that I thought was really well done and maybe it was accidental,
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:00.640]   I don't know at this point, was that they showed a common linkage in the areas of concern and that
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:06.400]   is how they treat the third parties who are dependent upon them for marketplace and how they treat
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:13.600]   competitors that are not peers and in all four of those cases that treatment was, and again,
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:17.040]   you can decide based on their size whether it's abusive or not, I'm sure the government will,
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:20.720]   but time after time every single one of them had problematic relationships with the people who
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:24.240]   depended on them and problematic relationships with the companies they wanted to buy or they
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:30.160]   were competing with. That diapers.com story is the textbooks too. Yeah, so
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:35.440]   and you know what the truth is, maybe we're inured to it because we've all known this has been going
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:40.000]   on all along. These are not new stories to us. People were so freaked out that every one of these
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.400]   stories that come out before you were just seeing the receipts that was so damning. We knew and
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:50.560]   we're just now seeing the smoking gun emails but we knew this was happening. So I understand
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:55.120]   everybody's reluctance to get government to weigh in on these things but at the same time I think
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:44:02.080]   there is a place for it and there is a history of this being beneficial. I don't know if you can use
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:07.040]   the AT&T case. I don't know if you can use the US deal case. They're fine. But I have a
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:11.200]   real rose. People are saying the real rose and like because the real rose it made sense for the
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:17.280]   person who was selling Coca-Cola on the train, like you might the station that they eventually
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:22.400]   the train would sell Coca-Cola on the train but they got into every business and took over everything
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:27.040]   until these laws came up. So it's very interesting but it's going to be a year,
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:33.920]   at least a half a year before we see any outcome of this. I actually, I was prepared for the worst.
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:39.920]   Having seen the Mark Zuckerberg Senate testimony, I was prepared for the worst. It wasn't quite as
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:44.000]   bad as I thought it would be. These guys have been and gals have been working on this for a long
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.880]   time. Yeah, there were the Jim Jordan's and the Jim Sensenbrenners. There were the, you know,
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:55.200]   Sensenbrenner accused Mark Zuckerberg of taking down Donald Trump, Jr.'s COVID post and Mark said,
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:02.480]   well, actually that was Twitter. But so there was that. That happened. But I was actually impressed
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:06.880]   by the depth of knowledge. I think the stats that a lot of people who made the cockamamie conspiracy
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:10.400]   theories for the first three rounds and then asked cogic questions for the last round,
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:13.600]   which meant they could have asked cogic questions all the time. That was just an act.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:18.240]   Yeah. But that's the other thing with these televised hearings. There's a lot of grandstanding.
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:22.400]   We've come to expect that. This is just the way the sausage gets made in the United States.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:26.960]   I think it would actually, I thought it was better than I thought it was going to be.
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:31.280]   But we'll wait and see what the upshot of it is. Yeah. It's tough. It's a tough thing to do.
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:39.840]   Yeah. No, I watched all five. Oddly enough, I used Downey to download the video and then watch it
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:45.840]   at 2X speeds so I could watch the entire thing. Smart man. And the most boring parts of it were
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:50.640]   probably the most damning, the most, probably the most exciting things we're put your mask on.
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:54.400]   Put your mask on. Everybody.
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:58.320]   And then those are spots. Talk about mess. Why are we messing this over?
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.880]   Listen to that. This is like a circle. God's sake.
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:04.640]   Jim, put your jacket on. Then put your mask on. Yeah.
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:10.320]   One last story. We'll a little palette cleanser before we get to this.
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:17.040]   It picks SpaceX, the Crew Dragon landed endeavor.
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:22.160]   Very, I know we all watched it on Sunday. I watched it was great.
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:30.560]   Did you know though that the SpaceX astronauts used airdrop to troubleshoot a problem on their way in?
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:35.760]   Did you know that? Apparently they use an iPad mini, multiple iPad minis for their
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:45.760]   spaceflight manuals. And at one point, an astronaut read out an error message on his mini.
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:53.040]   He said, "Krk, a timeline application on my app. A tablet gives me an error message that says,
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:56.880]   see if you've ever heard this one. Safari cannot open the page."
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:02.960]   And then it's got an HTML address because your iPad is not connected to the internet.
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:09.680]   "Krk, krk, krk, krk. Can you confirm the Wi-Fi is off and the airplane mode is on?"
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:15.120]   Asks the SpaceX command. And then the astronaut,
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:18.960]   this is my favorite part. Let's see, it's Bob.
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:22.560]   Bob, it was Doug and Bob. The McKenzie brothers were up there.
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:27.600]   No, it was Bob Benkin. The astronaut says, "Yeah, the Wi-Fi is off and the airplane mode is on.
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:30.800]   If you have display cameras up, I'll try to show it to you." So,
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:36.240]   they tried to show it to the cameras. When you're coming up on the ground station,
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:40.240]   we have this play camera up, drag in SpaceX. Can you bring that a little closer? We've got a good
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:45.760]   image of that. We're going to get back to you. Just to be clear, is this just happening on your
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:57.760]   tablet, Bob? Not on Doug's yet, just on mine? Eventually. I love this. Bob used airdrop
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.600]   to fix it. SpaceX command requested that Doug
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:09.840]   screenshots of his day timeline as a back of a case his app experienced the same caching issue.
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:14.720]   Then each astronaut was instructed to briefly turn on Wi-Fi to enable airdrop
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:21.840]   so they could wirelessly share the screenshots between iPads. Apparently,
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:25.280]   they're storing the mission critical documentation in Adobe Acrobat.
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:30.800]   Somebody's got to use it. Couldn't Elon turn eyes for them? I mean, come on.
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:36.160]   Starlink would have been helpful. That was a little problem.
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:41.200]   It's funny because the year they announced airdrop, a friend of mine, Martin,
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:46.240]   is safe solvent. We were flying back from WWDC. He was our camera person at WWDC. We were on a
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:50.320]   plane, but opposite sides of it. We needed to get some work done. We figured out we'd try it.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:53.920]   We didn't think it would work because we were in the air, but we didn't realize it's just Wi-Fi
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:57.200]   and Bluetooth. We were close enough that we were sending stuff back into the firefly.
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:04.640]   It was workflow changing. I just glad that our airdrop works even in the Crew Dragon.
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:11.920]   Talking about made it back. They're safe, they're healthy, and it sure was fun to watch.
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:19.680]   Airdrop. Let's take a little break when we come back. I think we should get picks of the week.
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:26.160]   What am I going to spend my money on this week? Lori Gill. But first, I better make some money.
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:31.600]   Word from our sponsor, ZipRecruiter. We love ZipRecruiter. We've hired a lot of our staff members,
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:36.000]   got hired by ZipRecruiter. John, you're one of the few who didn't because I think I hired you
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:42.480]   before there was even existed as ZipRecruiter. ZipRecruiter has transformed how we do hiring.
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:46.400]   If you're a company that's currently trying to hire, of course, you're facing a whole bunch
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:51.920]   of new difficulties. But ZipRecruiter's customers are happy and they're happy to tell the world
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:56.560]   housing wire a good example. They need to hire an ambitious reporter to cover news stories in
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:04.160]   the housing markets in the US. Who else? ZipRecruiter to the rescue. That's how Housing Wire found this
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:10.400]   new reporter, Alexandra Roja. Alexandra hadn't really even thought about the fact that she might
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:15.040]   get a job at Housing Wire. She figured there was no way she could get a reporter job while
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:20.240]   everybody's in quarantine. But she created a profile on ZipRecruiter, put her resume up there.
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:25.760]   And this is when ZipRecruiter's magic happens because they use matching technology to match
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:31.280]   the resumes, the profiles they have on file with the jobs people post there. ZipRecruiter
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:37.520]   noticed Alexandra had the perfect degree in writing skills for Housing Wire's reporting job.
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:43.280]   They said, "Alexandra, you should apply for this." She did. Housing Wire got her application.
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:47.920]   All of this happened within four hours of them posting the job. A few weeks later,
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:55.120]   she started her dream career. It's a happy ending for both Housing Wire and Alexandra Roja.
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:59.840]   It's a great story. This is why ZipRecruiter works so well for us. In fact, I could tell you again
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:04.480]   and again when we've used ZipRecruiter, we've got qualified applicants, more than qualified,
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:10.720]   great applicants within hours of our posting. It's kind of remarkable. Let's ZipRecruiter help
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:16.320]   you hire. You'll see why four out of five employers who post on ZipRecruiter get a quality candidate
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:24.080]   within the first day. In many cases, within just a few hours. Lisa posted our bookkeeper job at
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:28.880]   breakfast. She's at by lunchtime. She's going, "Oh, here's another good one. Oh, here's another one.
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:35.760]   We could think we're just rolling in." Try it now for free ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:42.800]   ZipRecruiter really works. I'm testament that we've done so much hiring with ZipRecruiter.
[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:51.920]   ZipRecruiter.com/macbreak. ZipRecruiter, the smarter way to hire. A little program note.
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:57.680]   Twitter after hours is back. This Friday, I'm very excited. We are going to do,
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:05.440]   by Popular Demand. Once again, our Shelter in Kitchen episode, it's Twitch's own live cooking
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:12.640]   show. Friday, 4pm Pacific, 7pm Eastern. Micah Sargent, no longer contested. He will now host.
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:18.320]   However, our winner from last time, Ant-Pruite is back. He'll be faced off against
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:24.160]   Loomaraska from Twiad and Ham Nation's Amanda Alden. The packages containing their mystery
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:29.920]   ingredients have already been shipped to them. And we're bringing in celebrity judges this time.
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:37.760]   Michael Wolf and Matthew Amsterdam Burton, two actual chefs, will be coming on to judge
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:43.520]   the victors and the vanquished. Watch to see who will come out on top and who will flame out
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:53.360]   as those have 30 minutes to cook up three bizarre mystery ingredients. It is always popular,
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:53:01.200]   always fun. Shelter in Kitchen this Friday, 4pm Pacific, 7pm Eastern at Twitch.tv/live
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:08.240]   or on our YouTube live channel. Well worth catching. I'm going to start with you, Laurie.
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:10.800]   That way, I'll have time to order whatever it is I need to buy.
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:20.080]   Not this time. No. Actually, what I wanted to tell everyone about is the YouTube channel by
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:25.600]   Emmanuel Ocho. It's called Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:33.360]   And it's pretty... An old brook pick. Yeah. It's a pretty impressive,
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:39.040]   15 minutes long at the most. They're usually 10 or so minutes long. And it's
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:46.960]   Emmanuel Ocho just really talking about the kinds of things that we as white folks don't really
[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:54.400]   understand. And I think we've heard this all before. We have our one Black friend that we go to to
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:54:00.800]   answer all of our questions. And that's not the way the world works. And Emmanuel Ocho,
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:06.080]   he is our stand-in of that friend. And he says, "You can ask me those uncomfortable
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:11.600]   conversations and I'll try to answer them as best I can." And frankly, from my perspective,
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:18.800]   it's the perfect entry way into understanding the issues with Black culture and with what's going
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:23.680]   on with everything, not just with Black Lives Matter, but with just existing as a Black human
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:29.360]   being. Things that a lot of times I know, I've heard this before, a lot of times I'm surprised I
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:38.880]   had no idea. Issues with what it's like to just kind of like exist. And you can ask these questions,
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:45.120]   yes, but he will just also answer these questions. Even if they seem inappropriate to ask somebody,
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:50.160]   he will answer those questions. He brings them up and he points them out. Even little things like,
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:55.760]   "Is it okay for a white person to have dreads?" Things that you don't think either you ask your
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:59.920]   Black friend and they roll their eyes at you for because come on, they're not the only Black person
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:04.400]   in the entire universe, figure it out for yourself. But also, you might not have wanted to ask that
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:08.960]   of your friend. So he answers those questions. There's some really powerful ones. There's some
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:14.240]   that are lighthearted and fun. I think he also, he interviews a lot of well-known,
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:20.240]   well, not a lot because it hasn't been around for that long, but a couple of well-known
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:28.880]   people actresses and actors and kind of famous people and things like that. Matthew McConaughey
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:36.720]   has one episode. My personal favorite episode though, if you want to sit down and start crying,
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:44.320]   is the episode number, does he, yeah, episode six he does talk about it. It is a
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:52.320]   interracial family to white parents and they have one white-born child or one
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:56:00.320]   blood-born white child and then three children of mixed race or Black children. And the way the
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:06.640]   world is encapsulized in this tiny little family. So it's one that kind of gives you goosebumps and
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:11.200]   makes you cry and makes you really look at things differently. So I do recommend episode six of
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:15.760]   uncomfortable conversations with the Black man with Emmanuel Ocho.
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:20.800]   Very powerful. Have you heard yet the New York Times podcast 1619?
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:25.200]   Yes, I've read a lot of the articles and that project too. The articles were great.
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:34.640]   But the podcast, I liked it because it shows how far this medium can go to really be informative.
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:42.480]   It's the companion to their 1619 piece. The year 1619 was the year the first enslaved Africans
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:50.560]   were brought to the United States 400 years of chattel slavery in the United States last year.
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:58.480]   But the podcast to me was such an eye-opener and so powerful. I really enjoyed it. And yeah,
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:03.680]   those articles are good too. I mean, they did a really nice job. It's just nice to see podcasts
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:07.120]   be used for more than just a bunch of white folks in around talking.
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:13.920]   That expensive computers. Yeah, I'll be looking at this YouTube
[01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:20.960]   series. Emmanuel, don't do it right before you're about to. I know I cry in the 1619. I know.
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:27.920]   I know. I know. I know. It's just painful. But conversations that need to be have had.
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:33.600]   I'm not sure the best way to find this maybe search for uncomfortable conversations.
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:39.120]   Yeah, it's hugely popular. So if you just typed in the world, uncomfortable conversation,
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:44.320]   hands, chances are anybody's search will find it. It's really popular. So it's nice to see all the
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:49.360]   views. It's good. Mr. Andy, can that go your pick of the week?
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:58:00.160]   Last week we were talking about Skype helper. The how why so many resources. And is there any
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:04.960]   way to fix this? And it got me sort of reminded me that I'm not spending enough time looking at
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:10.800]   the processes that are affecting my Mac. And so I downloaded a really cool activity from the
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:17.440]   activity monitor app from the app store called iStitistica Pro, which I tried two or three. And
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:23.360]   this is my favorite one. This looks really good. It's a very, very pretty dashboard for one thing.
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:28.000]   So it is something that you would keep on your second. I keep it. I've kept it on my second
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:32.880]   monitor now for a full week. And I can tell you that the Skype helper app is consuming
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:39.280]   91% of my CPU sometimes the graph goes all the way up to 120 something percent my CPU.
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:46.640]   It's using six gigabytes of virtual RAM. Just when you when you start, it's it's and it will monitor
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:52.800]   pretty much everything up. Your processor memory, disk access, network, Bluetooth, graphics processor,
[01:58:52.800 --> 01:59:00.080]   disk IO, if you download an extra plugin for the app, I will also they you will also give you access
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:05.840]   to the sensors. So I'm gonna my Mac may not can tell you that my CPU is running at 179, 181 degrees
[01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:12.080]   Fahrenheit. The exhaust fan is running at 54, 87 RPM. And it sounds like, okay, great, you're just
[01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:16.960]   rattling off numbers. But this is the sort of thing where particularly when it's being displayed
[01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:22.000]   to you as as graphs, particularly when you get something as cool as the the summary panel that
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:29.520]   really is like one to actually copies the Apple watches, circles, circles interface. You can
[01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:34.000]   actually out of the corner of your eyes, start to see, Oh my God, what's going on in my Mac right now.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:38.960]   We're asked before you see G why are things so sluggish right now? And you might think that,
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:43.040]   Oh geez, I need to upgrade my Mac because I don't know why things are growing so slow. I don't know
[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:46.800]   what I need to upgrade my internet connections. I don't know why my internet connections is so
[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:50.320]   bad. You can actually see that no, my internet connection is really, really good. I'm getting
[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:55.520]   here's the bandwidth I'm getting right now is actually this one app that is sucking sucking down
[01:59:55.520 --> 02:00:01.120]   every single resource of my of my system. It's nice because it's also nice because in addition to the
[02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:06.800]   desktop app, you with during settings, you can flip few switches and get in and get a menu bar
[02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:13.120]   indicators for pretty much anything you want. So I've got like a CPU load on my as a menu bar,
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:16.720]   I click on that and I get to see here's all the apps that are running and what the individual
[02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:22.400]   load is you can remote monitor, you can turn that on and basically get access to these stats
[02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:27.920]   from anywhere else on the network through a web browser. It's just a really, really solid app.
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:32.560]   It's exactly what I was looking for because Apple does give you utilities for monitoring
[02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:39.440]   these such things, but they're kind of wonkish in design. You it's for people who know what they're
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:45.040]   looking for and are real admins. It's not really a consumer sort of product. This, it really is a
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:48.800]   consumer level product. It will tell you as much as you want or as little as you want.
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:53.200]   And it really is two or three different utilities in one.
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:59.920]   Nice. I use iStap menus, but this is this, you know, you got to do something because Apple
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:05.120]   provides you a pretty good monitor for free, but this looks pretty sweet. They also, I'm going to
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:10.640]   check this developer out, image tasks.com. It looks like they have a lot of interesting apps I'd
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:19.120]   never heard of. How much is, how much is iStitica? Free trial. I think to get the pro version is
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:24.960]   $10, I think. Fair enough. Again, available to the app store. Yeah, they do a lot of interesting
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:32.320]   stuff. I, as a new developer to me, Renee Richie, pick of the week. So I, you know, it's always
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:37.680]   impossible to follow Lori Gill on anything. I don't even know why I try. I also picked a
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:45.200]   YouTube channel, but this is very technology focused. It's a channel called Gerald Undone.
[02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:49.040]   There's a lot of really, really talented. Oh, I love this guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:56.400]   And he, yeah, he is. These people. I guess I should say. Yeah, no, he is like high level
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:02:00.160]   nerdery. Like when you like, he doesn't just, he doesn't review the camera at all. He's very
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:04.480]   different than Philip Bloom will take it out and make a movie or, you know, like, you know,
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:10.720]   Peter McKinnon, who will go out some form of off-road chicanery with it from a helicopter on an ATV,
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:15.440]   that kind of stuff. He goes into a studio and he runs tests on it. He's like a Nantec.
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:20.880]   I became aware of him because of last week's review of the A7S III that you were talking about.
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:25.360]   Yeah, that would give you the fantastic review of that. This, and he went and borrowed a monitor
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:31.280]   to see exactly how many steps of, of dynamic range that that camera had, which was phenomenal.
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:35.760]   And he does the same thing here. Like he shows off, this is for the Canon, his latest review,
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:41.440]   was the Sony camera. And today's is the R5 and R6. Oh boy. And he shows because they're doing,
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:46.160]   well, he does cover the overheating for sure, but also they're doing new kinds of, like,
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:52.160]   linear, like a skip line skipping, for example, and how that affects text when you're, and things
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:57.520]   like, like how much it sways when you're moving it, you know, like just all those little nitty-gritty
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:00.800]   things that you don't even think about or you don't even see in a normal review, where someone
[02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:05.840]   will tell you their opinion on, he will do the tests and show you that he shows the work.
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:11.520]   He shows the tests, the equipment, everything comparisons, super detailed,
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:17.600]   super analytical. And by all means, please watch all the fabulous photographers and videographers
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:22.480]   do their amazing reviews. But if you want to know the details of every little bit about it,
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:26.560]   which codecs work with which and which don't and what menus are in the wrong place,
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:31.920]   he reminds me of like a John Syracuse, a reviewer for, for, yeah, this is great. And he does chapters,
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:36.000]   which is really nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Gerald.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.680]   Also a lot of instruction things like you'll explain to you what the difference is between
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:44.240]   mirrorless and mirrored and micro four thirds and full frame and how to do like what all the
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:48.080]   stuff means. Because a lot of people just don't know what all of this thing like exposure and all
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:51.280]   the, they just don't know what they mean. And he explains all those terms. And I love that.
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:57.680]   I love his test of the auto focus. It's it's quite a lot of fun.
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:02.560]   Because some of them vary based on brightness. Like previous Sony's, they weren't or can it,
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:06.960]   I forget which one was no good when the brightness levels changed. So like, so a lot of the stuff
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:12.560]   is pretty quick. It's pretty impressive. Yeah. I'll have to read this. You know, I'm of course,
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:17.200]   drooling at both the R5 and the S3. So I don't know.
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:18.800]   So can I can I tell you what I'm going to do, Leo?
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:23.200]   What are you going to do? Because I have Canon glass and it breaks my heart. But this is not,
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:27.200]   this is a, if you're a photographer, this is a phenomenal camera. If you're a videographer,
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:32.000]   it is not. So I think I'm going to bite the bullet and I have a C 500 mark to
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.920]   from my main camera. But I think I'm going to get the Sony for B roll and run on gun because it
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:41.200]   just it's a better camera for it's not a still camera. It's a video camera. I have the old A7
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:47.520]   S. I also have a seven R's. I have glass for both Canon and Sony. I'm embarrassed to admit it.
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:50.800]   That's the way to do it. That's your business. Like all these, all these camera viewers have
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:55.040]   the same. I just wish I bet we're a better photographer because it's a shame. It's wasted on me.
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:05:01.280]   Oh, can I mention one last thing? The new betas are out and in the latest beta for Mac,
[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:06.640]   Mac OS Big Sur, Apple, another finally has added support for 4K HDR YouTube.
[02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:07.440]   Ooh, ooh.
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:10.240]   Along national nightmares over. All right.
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:18.800]   My pick of the week is going to blow your mind. Here I am using a Lenovo all in one running
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:27.840]   PopOS Linux. Show my screen. That's fine. And watch as I launch something I just downloaded.
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:31.760]   It's a do, do, do, do, do. You could turn up the sound.
[02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:32.000]   Oh, yep.
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:40.320]   I've got Mac OS 8 running on my Linux box. You could also run it on a Mac if you want or by the way,
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:44.640]   did that seem like a fast boot to you? Yeah, Mac OS 8 actually runs better.
[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:50.160]   Here's Oregon Trail. Or would you rather do, let's do Duke Nukem. Dungeons and Dragons.
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:55.520]   Dungeons and Dragons. All right. Can only run in 256 color mode. Let's do that right now.
[02:05:55.520 --> 02:06:02.480]   Here we go. The Duke Nukem 3D. This is, believe it or not, it's running in Electron,
[02:06:02.480 --> 02:06:07.920]   which is hysterical. That just shows you how fast modern computers are compared to
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:13.120]   the old computers that ran this stuff. What's my audio sound like John? Is it not,
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:19.760]   is it not working? Yeah, I heard a beat, but you didn't hear anything else?
[02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:22.400]   Now I'm here again.
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:31.040]   It's interlaced for some reason. I'm not sure what's going on there.
[02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:36.560]   All right. That's Duke Nukem. Let's see what version of Mac OS this is. Oh, look. I've got all
[02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:42.640]   the, remember these, what do they call these desktop desk accessories? Remember these? Remember
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:50.640]   no pad? Wow, I can run no pad and Duke Nukem at the same time. Wow. Look at that simple sound.
[02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:58.160]   And the calculator and the, and sticky. Oh man. This is pretty hysterical, isn't it? Let's just
[02:06:58.160 --> 02:07:06.880]   quit out of that. We'll quit out of Duke Nukem. And there we go. Beep. By the atomic edition,
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:11.760]   I will next time. Simple sound is quit because in air type 12, well, that's pretty good. That's
[02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:18.800]   all right. At least the computer is still running. This is a Macintosh with 256 megs of built-in
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:27.440]   memory, no virtual memory. 56 megs. Megs, megs. Running Mac OS 8.1. Pretty snappy.
[02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:35.520]   Pretty nicely done. This is why I've never been really interested in reassembling a fully
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:41.120]   functioning Mac Plus system or Mac LC system because the emulators are so damn good.
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:46.000]   You never have to figure out, okay, where do I find an adapter for this floppy?
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.800]   This is pretty amazing that it's running. It's all through JavaScript, isn't it?
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:55.040]   An electron. Yeah, it's JavaScript, believe it or not. This is the website, Felix Reisenberg,
[02:07:55.600 --> 02:08:02.000]   Macintosh.js. It's on GitHub. It's a free download. You can play with it and it runs
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:11.360]   on Windows, Mac OS, and yes, it runs on Linux. So from now on, when I show any of the Mac
[02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:16.640]   app picks and stuff, I'll use this. Everything I do will be for Mac OS 8, I'm sorry to say.
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:22.160]   What it was, systemate. They didn't call it Mac OS. Systemate. And this is
[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:25.280]   JavaScript. That's pretty impressive. Well done, Felix.
[02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:33.280]   That concludes this thrilling gripping edition of Mac Break Weekly. Renee Richie is on the YouTube.
[02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:39.680]   He's a YouTube star. In fact, check out his new review of the iMacs just went up today.
[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:45.200]   That's at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie. Anything else? There's not a lot of you yet. It's something new
[02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:50.560]   that I tried. I basically turned on two cameras, sat down, opened up the press release and reacted.
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:54.960]   Oh, it's a real deal. You'll notice when it says like 1080p camera, like,
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:09:02.720]   "Baa!" and no more HDDs. It's not quite that level, but it really was, I wanted to try something
[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:07.680]   more like what we do on Mac Break. It sounds like fun. Yeah, hot takes. Renee Richie, hot takes.
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:15.760]   Take one. So hot. Lori Gill is managing editor at imore.com. She's on the Twitter @appaholic.
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:20.800]   Great to have you, Lori, as always. Thank you. Andy Naco, when are you going to be on GBH next?
[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:25.120]   Looks like Friday at 1 p.m. Go to GBHNews.org.
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:32.000]   Thank you very much, iH. N-A-T-K-O.com. I will be back here tomorrow morning at 7 a.m.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:37.200]   Pacific. Hylio, whatever is happening. I don't know. Nothing I care about.
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:40.480]   Are you getting unpacked? I'm getting unpacked with Samsung.
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:46.880]   We're going to unpack. It's really, actually, Samsung's going to show us new Note 20. It's new
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:51.200]   Galaxy Fold, new Watch, new tablet. I'm really angry. I don't want to spend that money, but it
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:56.400]   looks terrific. That is an expensive, expensive phone, but it looks perfect. The phone, the
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:01.280]   fold. I'm eulium employed, and that phone looks way too good. Well, I may buy it for you, because
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:07.280]   I feel like we should have a fold in house, don't you think? You see, that's going to be good this time.
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:14.480]   Yeah, we'll see. That's the problem with Samsung. We always love. Look out all of the review units
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:19.760]   are disaster. Then like two generations later, you're like, "Holy mother of God, I want that."
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:26.080]   It's time to look at it. There's no point in buying a 5G phone for me. I'll never get that.
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:30.240]   But anyway, we'll watch together. Jason Howell and I will be streaming live.
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:34.160]   The event begins 7 a.m. Pacific 10 a.m. Eastern tomorrow.

[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:47.520]   That's the same place you'll find this show. We do Mac Break Weekly. We try, but it's hard,
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:54.640]   but sometime in the morning, usually, sometimes before noon, sometimes afternoon, sometimes,
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:11:01.680]   but it's on a Tuesday. I could promise you that. Theoretically 11 a.m. Pacific, 1800 UTC.
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:08.080]   That's 2 p.m. Eastern time. The thing is, it's iOS today before that. I know you're just in that too.
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:15.200]   Tune in. It all starts 9 a.m. Pacific. The stream is live at twitter.tv/live. There's audio and video
