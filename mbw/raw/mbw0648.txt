[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.940]   It's time for Mac break weekly lots to talk about of course the rumors are flying about new Mac products
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.720]   We'll talk a little bit about the new head of retail and I think a tribute to Angela
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.780]   Rants and how she's really improved Apple retail over the last five years and there are some serious security flaws
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.400]   Talk about those two. It's all coming up next on Mac break weekly
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.920]   Netcasts you love from people you trust
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.680]   This is

[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.960]   Mac break weekly assemble with Renee Richie
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.920]   leading the charge
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.400]   Andy said I'm not allowed to complain about the snow today
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.520]   He had dibs on that so I'm just gonna say that I ate way too much built on and now I blame Alex
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:00.120]   Alex Lindsay is in studio so he doesn't have to face any snow although it's
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.720]   Unseasonably chilly here in Petaloma and I don't have any built on and there's no built on
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.800]   Dang Alex is with the pixel core and of course Andy and I go you may now complain about the snow Andrew
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.960]   I was being jocular because I had you know I went out to breakfast this morning
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.080]   I had to slog through over two and a half inches almost two and a half inches had had it been another inch and a half
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.920]   I might not have been able to wear my sneakers walking it would have been a block and a half
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.560]   Yeah, okay, then we get the idea
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.360]   You've had snow apocalypse already this year that it wasn't there a big east coast storm
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.480]   I think yeah, but but but we've missed it just went south and missed the whole Northeast
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:47.280]   This is like we are so underserved by snow this season that I we cannot complain about any sort of weather
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.760]   We've had some really really cold weather, but I really can't complain when people are
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.720]   Holding their kids over their shoulders to show you how deep the snow drifts are then no
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.040]   I'll I'll take this snow is a service. That's what we've got to work on and we've had ice not snow
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.040]   I'll big thing this year has been yeah
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.760]   Don't say that Facebook will buy it as a company
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.160]   So I hope you all updated iOS I think this happened after the show last week
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.320]   But you've had a few days to get to 12.1.4
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:26.000]   That was the fix for the FaceTime group dialing bug that's an important one, but there are also
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.320]   two
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.760]   iOS zero days which have already been exploited in the wild
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.200]   This comes from Google's project zero which has become very adept at discovering a security flaws
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.880]   They did not release the code
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.320]   They do have a CVE identifier 7286 7287
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.640]   and they are
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.960]   Maybe I'll defer to Renee to describe how risky they are in one an attacker can exploit a memory corruption an iOS
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.440]   Foundation component via a malicious app to gain elevated privileges
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.120]   You don't like to hear those words the other no impacts IO kit another iOS core framework that handles IO data
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.440]   streams between hardware and software will also give them
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:19.160]   Elevated privileges and an attacker can exploit another memory corruption in this framework via a malicious app to execute arbitrary code with
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.280]   Colonel privileges was when project zero says in the wild does that mean there were apps in the app store that
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.400]   took advantage of this flaw
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   It's hard to say because
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.840]   Just to back up project zero is Google's you know
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.440]   They're very good at fuzzing their way through apps and finding all of this stuff
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.760]   And if they say it's in the wild it's possible that someone
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.800]   Somewhere reported it but there's as far as I can see we don't know the only there's all sorts of things like karma was reported
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.800]   Like was it two weeks ago?
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.880]   Which was a massive exploit used by a nation state using intelligence services to try to get at the messages of dissidents?
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.160]   And we have no idea what mechanics they use or what those gray boxes use so there are there are exploits in the wild
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.680]   We don't know what they are and there are exploits that are discovered and we don't know they're the same ones
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.120]   But hopefully it just they patch everything and then we can live better lives needless to say though
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.440]   I mean with that threat exploited in the wild I would immediately update iOS right if you haven't already and by the way
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.000]   You I didn't get any notice about it
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.440]   Lisa said oh, there's a new update this morning. I said well, I know
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.480]   She said well, I just got the note so so there's two there's three things one is
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.400]   The the patch is only in the release version right now if you're a developer or on the public beta
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.600]   You're waiting for the 12 point to beta three to get that patch
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.360]   But if you don't update or you're on the developer or public beta track
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.480]   Group FaceTime is still switched off for you
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.640]   You have to have the patch installed in order to use group FaceTime now
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.760]   So not at any risk you're just missing out on the functionality until Apple ships that right?
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.880]   If you are a regular normal 12 point 1.3 iOS user
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.680]   You might get a notification today, but it was available what Thursday or Friday?
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.800]   Yeah, they try to stage manage the server load by letting all like the eager beavers get it first
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.640]   And then if they notice you don't have it yet a couple days later, they'll you know when I hear zero day
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.080]   I think it's good to be an eager beaver in this case
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.400]   That means there's no time between the discovery of the exploit and its exploitation. Yeah, yeah
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.960]   So a lot of people are really really big fans of not
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.600]   Since transmitting video and audio that they don't intend. Yeah, it's a big niche. That's a that's a good one
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:28.800]   And then what I'm not clear about is a it looks like both of these other flaws
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.800]   You have to have an app a malicious app and be whether those malicious apps ever made it to the app store
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.520]   We don't know certainly if they existed they're gone now
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:44.960]   So it's so tough like there were two YouTube videos that went live this week that said massive exploit on iOS Apple has to fix this now
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.220]   and one was intended behavior for recovery of
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.360]   two factor authentication accounts and the second one is not an exploit
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.320]   It's that you know like you have to give permission to access your contents or video
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.840]   But after you give that permission some unscrupulous developers will upload your contacts or upload your video
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.760]   So you I'd be it's not just you it's the same as it's always been on the internet
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:13.560]   You have to have really good hygiene really best practices and really be careful who and what you put on your devices. Yeah
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:22.320]   It seems it seems like it's time for us to sort of get almost have like an in-system alert system
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.040]   That says occasionally says here are all the apps you have installed on this device even just in the last month
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.560]   Now that you've had 30 days and you're no longer either drunk or bored at 1 a.m
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:39.040]   Do you want to consider are you still using these and you can do you want to consider removing these right now?
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:45.360]   Because there's so many great reasons to remove any app that you just plain don't use. Yeah, yeah
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.320]   Amongst amongst them the reasons that Renee suggests that sometimes you know
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.880]   You've heard someone has recommended something to you. You're still at lunch with them
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.600]   You install it and you're so eager to continue the conversation about this new app you forget to see
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.160]   Oh, why does it want my phone ID and before you know it?
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.120]   You're really cool
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.760]   Nast you really cool weather app that uses bunnies in the ground to tell you whether it's snowing or raining is now
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:14.520]   Transmitting your any information about nearby Wi-Fi hotspots to a central database that can be then sold on I
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.600]   Have an alarm I said that goes off every two weeks and it says check like check which apps have access to your Twitter
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.680]   I don't use Facebook anymore
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.320]   But I said Facebook all my online accounts and all the apps that I'm installed so that I've I'm reminded to go through
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.480]   Yeah, and remove anything that I'm not using you do that. Wow. Yeah, I should do it more like you know
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.640]   I have to live a life
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.600]   I've trained myself to do that like every six months when I do the usual check the batteries and the smoke detectors thing
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.680]   As a matter of fact when I started doing that actually would write a note to myself and leave it inside this
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.160]   Like on a label inside the smoke detector of all the other things I want to do every six months
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.760]   But then I had to I didn't have to keep doing that anymore
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:56.360]   But yeah every every now and then there are just so many things you just need to periodically check up on to avoid trouble
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   For me my big my big one is I don't
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.120]   Restore my iPhone so I buy a new iPhone
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.880]   Yeah, I install everything I start from scratch and I just put on the things that I'm using so my big reset is
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.040]   Think is so good now that you can't once every other year. It's too easy to sink it. Yeah
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.240]   But I've always done that with my own way too much stuff with my
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.640]   It wouldn't sink and you'd lose like every like game levels
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.520]   You'd lose like a ton of stuff so people would never do it
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.760]   But now so much to sinks back that it's not as onerous anymore to start fresh
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.040]   Well, and I have to admit that my process of doing that on the Mac also is what made me really touchy about
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:34.920]   apps that aren't in the app store because it's those now become painful like I gotta remember where the password I mean where the
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.360]   serial code is and the
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.920]   Install whatever and and so now pretty much if if you're a small
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.080]   Software like you know not less than a hundred dollars and you're not in the app store
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.880]   I'm always like no it doesn't better be really good because it's because now I have to manage it
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.800]   Yeah, no, that's that's why I think it's a great idea
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.400]   Certainly every time you buy a new device whether it's phone or a Mac, but also
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:04.400]   Every year if you can swing it to just make sure that your your device is completely backed up
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:10.640]   And then just restore it to factory settings and then just simply for the next couple of weeks whenever you need an app
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:17.200]   Install the app and then after two or three weeks you will find that the only things that are on your Mac or on your phone are
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:23.440]   Only the apps you actually use and you're like why is my phone suddenly really really fast?
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.080]   Is this just get a really great performance upgrade?
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:34.480]   No, you just removed and 75% of the apps you actually use and as Alex's point the if it weren't for my having to do that from time to time
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.160]   I would not be keeping like passwords and stuff like that like
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.920]   Excuse me registration codes someplace where I can find them. I would completely forget about them if I didn't have to do that
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.360]   So they're they're they're upsides to things. I think that one of the downsides of things like
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:55.040]   iPads being so absolutely 100% reliable or at least in my case
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:01.440]   Is that you kind of forget that there's still computers that still need some some maintenance and stuff like that
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.760]   Like like if you if you have a Ferrari
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.520]   You know how often you need to change the oil and you know how often you need to address these filters
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.920]   And how often you need to have something balanced when you have a toy at a corolla something that's just designed to be as little to work
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:22.240]   Forever on as little trouble as possible. That's the people who come into the shop after five years
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:28.880]   And they've got basically tar inside the gearbox because they've never ever changed their oil
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.760]   My headlight went out yesterday and I thought I had to buy a new car
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.360]   Like similarly though iOS if you didn't install any third-party apps
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.880]   And I think there are a lot of I I hear there are a lot of iPhone users. It don't
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:48.560]   Um, you and he's metaphor would be accurate. I mean you really don't have to do anything about it
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:56.000]   It's the third party apps. Yeah, Renee that timer is not about iOS updates. It's about going through twitter and deleting all the
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.080]   Attached accounts and stuff if you didn't install third-party apps. I think you'd actually be
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.800]   Pretty mainstream. I mean just let it update. They do and you know for the most part for me is true for any computer
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   I mean well for my from my eye for my iPhone
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:14.480]   I know that or I had to lend an iPad to somebody for a show that we were doing and we were one iPad short
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.360]   And I just grabbed one of my second iPads, you know like my little my older one
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.280]   And it was it was like I just realized I don't like the computer there'd be a big
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.200]   No, I just I literally just opened it up and just say reset blow it all away
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.360]   And I just handed it to them, you know fresh
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.000]   You know and took me three minutes and the fact that there's no stress over that
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.560]   I mean I'm old enough to remember that like daddy are resetting a computer and then coming back to it
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.600]   Yes, why I recommend chrome OS for people want desktop operating systems because it's the same thing you got it right or washing
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.040]   Yes, back to normal
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.960]   And a lot of that's because we live in the cloud
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.200]   Right if it weren't for the cloud and the fact that the cloud knows every app you want
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.520]   All the passwords and stuff if we didn't live in the cloud no, that's harder. It was yeah
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.960]   And it's also well, it's also I've been using a chrome book
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:03.760]   Really really a lot for the past several months and I started to experiment with a trick on my max and on my iPad
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.040]   With that has that has worked for chrome OS, which is well
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.840]   What if instead if given that web based apps are so sophisticated now
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.480]   Like if you have a if you have slack as a desktop app, but you also have slack as a mobile app
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.880]   But you also have slack as the web app
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.440]   What if you decide to run as much inside safari as possible
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.360]   because
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.360]   If you buy that well
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.800]   Well, because for the fact that every time you do that they say no you want the app
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:36.880]   You can use reddit safari, but it'll constantly barrage you with oh, it's so much better in the app
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.240]   So it is so much better
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.040]   Yeah, but is it yeah, it's a lot more
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.560]   But the big but the big win is that I find that I'm getting much better battery life particularly on my on my macbook
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.320]   Because because safari is really really
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:57.200]   Arrogant in defending you against apps that want to try to steal your battery life and run processes in the background
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.480]   And although
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.080]   iOS has
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.240]   Certain protections that are supposed to protect apps from doing that to you anyway
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.520]   Sometimes it does really happen. So it's an interesting thing like if there if there are any apps that you can
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.400]   Make that switch where it doesn't wind up annoying the hell out of you by using it in in safari
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.800]   Give it a try and if you find that you like it
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.840]   You that's in one more app you can remove from your femur ipad or from your iPhone
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.560]   And frankly one more one less piece of load that happens on your cpu and your battery
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:33.120]   That's actually my last card and my bill is so small. I lost my credit card two weeks ago and my bill is incredibly small this month
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.920]   Oh
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.600]   Interesting thought
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.560]   I have my new advice on the radio show is install as few apps as you can get away with
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.560]   You know because everything you install is adds complexity
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.000]   Potentially bugs and ultimately security flaws
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.520]   Every single thing and including an antivirus by the way
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.400]   So the the fewer just see if you can get it
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.920]   And that's one of the beauties of the chrome book is in theory everything you need is there
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:05.040]   Because it's seriously no joke our one of our marketing people was complaining that because we had a big meetup
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.920]   All the entire company last week and this guy said my macbook is terrible
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.920]   It's always hot the battery never lasts
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.480]   Which just safari and and use the web apps and not the electron apps. He's like, oh my god
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.080]   It's completely fixed at last for hours. Oh, we're gonna look back electron is the bane of modern computing
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.520]   Yes, and we're gonna look back. It's kind of like what was that adobe technology?
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.840]   Air air. Oh, yeah, so electron brings
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.760]   Essentially a full chrome browser with every app, right? That's part of the yeah
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.640]   So you're using chrome when you're using any electron app slacks over and over and over again
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.120]   You're having multiple crumbs and chromed as we know is not great on macOS anyway
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.120]   Uh, yeah, I I think electron is terror is a terrible
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:50.160]   Solution and he had slack and skype and I forget the other ones, but yeah, like we are them running all the time
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.560]   So that's that's through four copies of a chrome all run chrome with all of the tons of time
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:59.920]   Yeah, it's it's kind of a constant of the universe in terms of digital lifestyle
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:06.400]   Any solution that makes life much easier for developers will make life much harder for users good point
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.360]   Perfectly said as long as we're talking security there is another
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.800]   maybe security flaw security researcher lino's
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.960]   hanza
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:23.440]   Has put up a video demonstration of what he claims is a exploit in mohavi that lets him access passwords
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:29.280]   Stored in the keychain passwords that are theoretically encrypted, but he says i'm not going to tell apple
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.160]   at a protest
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:37.440]   Because the bug bounty program only applies to ios he wouldn't get any money for a macOS flaw
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.480]   Yep
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.760]   So he posted the exploit in on video, but not the information about it and he's not telling apple
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.800]   He calls it problem with this like I I understand this and I feel where he's coming from there
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.360]   Absolutely should be a mac bounty program. They launched the ios bounty program and I know apple's planning one
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.040]   They've said as much they just haven't got it out yet and that's terrible
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.840]   Like it should have come out with the ios but but you know
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.440]   The thing with these x-places you never know who else has them and he's discovered one
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.240]   And yes, he's he's kind of holding apple hostage
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.600]   But he's also holding all of us hostage and i'm pretty sure if he just said I have this issue and apple's terrible
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.640]   They don't give me a bounty sort of like what happened with the face time bug
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.120]   He would have gotten just as much press as anything else and we would have gotten a fix sooner
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.120]   So I feel very conflicted about the the methodology using to get attention
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.520]   remember the other big problem is that
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:31.680]   Uh to in in his defense these these exploits take they're they're almost creative works
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.520]   They take time to figure out and to document and to figure out exactly what's going on here
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:41.120]   And so bugbodies are a way for these people who are security experts to get paid for their work
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:47.360]   And if there's not apple that's going to pay them there are certain government agencies and foreign agencies and private
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:52.720]   Security agencies that will pay him to figure out how to get into some passwords keychain
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:18:00.240]   Because they are the people that the police turn to that corporate security turns to when they need to get at information that is being protected
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.640]   Uh, so if apple doesn't totally agree
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:07.200]   I totally I just don't think they should extort us they should shame apple
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.880]   Like what he's doing now hurts both us and apple and I think he should just hurt apple
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:17.840]   Yeah, I uh, you know remember it was a little controversial apple didn't offer bugbodies for many years
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.080]   Only recently started the iOS billion and the and the I understand apples thinking there
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.240]   They didn't want to drive the price up
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.720]   And bidding wars
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:32.640]   They wanted people to tell them out of the goodness of their heart and out of their interest in protecting everybody who uses the platform
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.280]   Because you can't compete with
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.160]   nation states if south if north korea says
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.040]   Hey, we'd like that. How are you going to compete with them?
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.760]   They're going to offer you millions of dollars apple can't do that
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.240]   On the other hand if you don't do it at all
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:53.280]   Then then you get people like lino's like it's like you offer enough where good-hearted people will take you rather than the alternatives
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:58.720]   And the other and the other problem is that this is a constant refrain in all
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.080]   Big business industries that apple is
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.720]   Apple has the resources to reward people and to pay people
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.200]   But they they want people to do things out of the kindness of their heart
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:16.080]   That's not correct. That's not right. That's uh, it's again
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.960]   It's a if apple were an individual then that would be a very human thing for them to think
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.000]   But to basically say we want you to help us to protect
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.640]   All of our users, but we want you we don't not in a way that would cost us
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.360]   $25,000 every time someone finds this thing
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.960]   I think they're just
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:39.520]   Not paying for mac OS which is done and in a more show my screen if you would because this is the and i'm more in a simple in simple fashion
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.520]   This is the exploit. He's written a
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.880]   program
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:49.440]   Called key steel. He's he's demonstrating that he can unlock the passers without him entering the passwords and from a more
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.720]   Selfish perspective is just that you you want people to be able to dedicate time to fixing your OS
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.240]   Yeah, so by paying them it's it's not a matter of goodness of their heart or not
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:03.200]   They could always make more money with a with a exploit like this selling to a government entity
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.360]   You just want to give them something but but giving them allowing them when you pay them to do it
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.360]   It allows them to spend time
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.200]   Working on it you you've been you have a bunch of people now engaged in
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.680]   I want to you know, I'm gonna
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.720]   I think that there might be something down here. I have an idea and you're not gonna have all those ideas in house
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.080]   You know and having people out out of house trying to come up with them is
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.680]   Not a bad idea. So I I definitely think that apple should be providing a bounty for these
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.080]   So again, they do I mean they totally do they just have for some reason have not done it for mac
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:39.280]   Which is perplexing apparently reason to do it. I I hope he'll relent after a week and just give it to the
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.680]   And do the right thing without figure it out
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.880]   Yeah, maybe it's sufficient for them to figure it out. I don't know
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.440]   I didn't shoot really but other people could figure it out in the meantime to other people already have it and have been using it for years
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.680]   And you don't know about it. That's what we're named would you say that then people should not use a key chain of stir-pass or juice something else
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:03.360]   No, I mean again like for there's always going to be errors in code and a lot of this stuff isn't the fact that exploits exist or don't exist
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.640]   But the threat level to you and most people aren't a high level threat like you know
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:12.720]   As we saw this week if you're Jeff Bezos, then you've got to do an incredible job of computer hygiene and best practices andrew
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.880]   But for most of us. Yeah, exactly totally
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.720]   But from and even he by the way was not in vulnerable to a nation state
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.160]   No, or or this was boyfriend whatever they finally
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.760]   Apparently his experts at this point think say it wasn't a individual hack. It was a hack from a
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.840]   And yeah, but the
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.560]   Boyfriend so I mean like there's so many stories now, right?
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.200]   Don't either like just don't have yet. Don't they
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:42.320]   Know we think it's a nation state. Yeah, but that's the point is once once you've got these nation states going up against you
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.400]   You're probably all bets or sound like the other thing is that you're more likely to get rolled out of story
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:51.120]   I was a girlfriend's brother. I think is the is the yeah, but but brooch Trump brother
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.200]   Yeah, but we could come back to the fact that
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   Don't put anything on your phone that you don't want to have published. I mean you're like and definitely don't send it to somebody
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.200]   I mean come on now. I mean
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.600]   Amazon was
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.600]   Sorry, like
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.000]   He doesn't know anything about the cloud, you know, like it's
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.240]   I'm sorry. I just nobody knows anything
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:10.880]   No, it's perplexed
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.240]   But the thing I was going to say is that most people are much more likely to have like all of yahoo
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.920]   Exploited and their data is just rolled up into that because most people aren't
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.160]   Well, these are crimes of economics and most people it just doesn't make economical sense to go after them
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.080]   But if you are you know concerned about this stuff just keep an eye on it update it when you have to
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.360]   Don't let anybody else on your computer don't download it's all the same stuff
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.920]   We've been saying for years don't download apps from places you don't absolutely trust and follow those
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.360]   Those best practices, but I wouldn't shy away even with FaceTime
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.840]   We talked about this last week if you're deaf or you don't you have other issues
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.600]   Don't shy away from it just be aware of what's going on and do the best you can with it
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.920]   And by the way the teenager who did
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:55.440]   Apparently discover the FaceTime bug before anybody else apple is going to support his education
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:01.200]   They bounty them and they're giving him a sp- they're bouncing the family and giving a specific donation towards his education
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:06.560]   Yeah, I don't think you could give a 14 year old a 25,000. I check so you could it would be awesome
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.480]   I think it's something gave me 20 with peril
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.000]   What would I have done?
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.040]   There's the worst part is is that if he was like me if I had someone gave me 25,000
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.080]   I would have it would have been 1984 and I would have bought a new man
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.960]   50,000 like I would have bought a new because I had an apple to eat
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.400]   That's what they should give him just give him every mac every apple device
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.720]   Yeah, it's not clean in any event
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.320]   And of course apple is going to do better
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.560]   And I think I believe them when they say that I don't believe Microsoft when they say it, but I do believe apple
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:44.000]   Well, they I mean their problem was that it did not go from like you could tell when apple spun up internally and it was not until the nine to five article
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.360]   Which means that all the social media stuff and all the other stuff just did not get to anybody important
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.520]   And they have to fix for that because increasingly
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:56.720]   Nobody knows what channel to use there's going to complain on twitter or facebook or or make a youtube video
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.880]   And they got a monitor for that. It's just hard though. It's not it's not hard
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.480]   No, I also I also I
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.960]   There's there's a there's a there's an app. I mean, I don't know what there was one that that
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.680]   We had access to for a while. It was called radian six that basically it tells you
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:16.320]   Your name is these keywords. These are all your products your brand
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.720]   Everything else are showing up on these social networks
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:24.640]   And there's and then it ranked them by the by the number of followers of that person or and actually not the number of followers
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.600]   But by their reach right so I mean nine to five found it right
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.560]   I mean
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:33.920]   But and that thing was and basically the companies that you can always tell who had radian six like when you know it
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:40.240]   It's like like united you know that has radian six because you complain about you say united and you will get a response in two minutes
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:45.920]   You know because because they have a they have a crew that just sits there and watches all those social networks across the entire
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.560]   Bit and it's very well filtered. There's no reason if someone posts something on social media
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.520]   You should you should be able to react to it in less than five minutes
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.800]   Because you have to be able to for for a brand and apple
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:03.280]   We're not one one thing that's very very positive about apple from all of this is that they have
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.080]   Unlike unlike a lot of companies have their size
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:12.400]   They have learned the lesson that there's a point at which the PR disaster becomes voluntary
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.240]   There's a point because and there's a point at which you know about it
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.240]   So that's there's a point which you have the ceo
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.400]   Basically post something publicly saying we are aware of this boy
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.680]   We screwed up because it should have it should have percolated up into our
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.600]   Level one awareness and it didn't we're gonna try to fix this and by the way
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.400]   We are working on a fix and it will be out very very shortly
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.440]   There are other companies like facebook that will just find more rakes to step on as they
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.560]   Trying to keep trying to move things forward. They don't see it as apple doesn't see it as a PR problem
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:49.680]   They see it as a problem with their hardware and software that they can fix apples apples lawn is a lot cleaner than than everybody else
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.920]   Too. I think that's part of the the issue is is that
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.040]   The front the front yard
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.360]   But the front yard is a lot cleaner
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.800]   There are a lot of like engine blocks in the backyard of the weeds have grown over the
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.080]   Escaping there apple to its you know
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.760]   Sometimes to its detriment is so careful about everything that they do
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.840]   It just aren't there isn't a whole lot of move fast break things, you know in the company
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.800]   And so there's not a lot of uh, there's a lot of like let's test this forever and and try to figure this out
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.840]   So it doesn't mean that nothing's gonna get out obviously but
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.480]   With the other companies when they when you you know
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.880]   There I think that what happens a lot of times is that when they see a string that needs to be pulled
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.920]   But they're like if we pull this i'm not sure exactly what's gonna happen
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.840]   You know because it's just tied to this this spaghetti of everybody else experimenting
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.240]   And so um, you know writing some code and hacking through it and just making it work for today
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:44.240]   And so I think a lot of times when you see this kind of this hesitancy by other companies to to pull at that string
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:48.400]   They just don't know what what is on the other side of that string and what other strings are tied to that string
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.120]   to the level of
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.520]   To the level that apple does because apple just moves a lot slower
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:00.160]   Let's take a little break and more of your comments
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:05.360]   Coming up in just a bit Alex Lindsey from the pixel core at Alex Lindsey on the twitter
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:12.160]   And the naco from boston public radio w g b h i h n a t k o dot com
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.720]   And rene richy
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:19.840]   The man in charge at i'm more dot com also a host of the vector podcast
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.400]   Actually all of them at podcasts will do that later
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.760]   Anybody to spotify offer any of you guys money
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.560]   Not that I can say today
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:35.840]   Daniel x is another half billion right or they have a half hell to spend they've spent
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   230 million on
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.440]   And we don't know how much they pick me up
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:47.040]   We've looked deep within our souls here at twit decided we're not
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:53.120]   No, there's no it's not gonna happen not for less than a hundred million a hundred million that might have to
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:58.880]   But I don't what I actually said is would a spotify ever want to buy us and that's when I realized no
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.240]   They had to be no
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.400]   However, not that smart
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.400]   However, thank you very much for that
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:13.520]   However, I do want you to right now buy express vpn the number one vpn service on tech radar
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.520]   And a great vpn service when you want to protect your privacy
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.640]   The best way to do it is with a virtual private network
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.200]   privacy is in its middle name literally
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:28.080]   The vpn encrypts your traffic from your computer
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:34.720]   To the vpn server somewhere out there in the world and by the way, one of the reasons people love express vpn is they've got servers everywhere

[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.880]   social media sites marketing companies
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.280]   Uh, they're they want to know everything you do everywhere you go a vpn
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.320]   Will protect you keep your browsing history private
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:08.640]   And because express vpn has it and you you can look this up has a great privacy policy

[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:56.320]   It was right at the end of the show last week that we got the
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.840]   Press release from apple that angela arance was leaving
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.000]   Yeah
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.800]   Have we absorbed this a little better? Do we know what's going on? I mean there's been a lot of speculation
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.680]   She spoke she was at a ralph lorin's
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.000]   fashion show
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   in uh, new york on thursday
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.720]   And she said i plan to take the summer off
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:22.960]   Yeah, she declined to disclose what type of job she'd be interested in next she says she plans to enjoy some traveling
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.760]   Before making any new commitments on her agenda
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.440]   Our mission to rahuanda and visiting two of her children in london
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.800]   She said that throughout her marriage her husband has constantly been moving with her to london then san francisco now
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.800]   It's time for him to get it turned that all
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:42.720]   Sounds like a sense sounds like a we know there's just a lot of crazy people on the internet who don't want to don't want to accept it
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.840]   But much rather we've fanfic about oh
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:52.720]   Failures that that seems like the perfect cover story if they're ever nda
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:57.840]   Provencer from telling the truth about what's really going on there at the offices at apple
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:03.520]   Are we gonna take this any I don't think we're gonna take this you know no that i can break really understand it
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.840]   She's tired. She wants to rest now
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.240]   I do think there might be a story to tell about her replacement because this
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:17.280]   Longtime apple executive didro brian is in charge of people. She's the HR person apple
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:22.960]   Which doesn't I mean I know there's a lot of people that work in retail, but it isn't necessarily the kind of person you want leading
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:28.080]   Retail I wonder if that's a stop cap and that they are looking for somebody to go
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.640]   It could go either way because she is amazing like she has been at apple for 30 years
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:38.960]   She helped launch the original apple retail store the original apple online store and she was vp of
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:44.080]   Operations under tim cook for a long period of time before she took on the HR role
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.560]   So she is perhaps uniquely qualified to help continue the progress
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:54.320]   But also shore up a lot of the operational things that people feel have been sliding in apple stores like the day-to-day stuff
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.000]   The customers the lines all of that and she is
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.200]   Really well regarded within the company. There's a lot of retail people seem
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:06.240]   It's a huge base of retail people but for everyone who grumbled there's someone who's really happy about it
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:12.480]   It might be that they get someone else for retail also might be they got someone else for people and just see how far did you reckon?
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.280]   That's good and push the stores. So they've had mixed
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.160]   results
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:25.360]   That was it Tom what was his name ron johnson the john ron johnson then john then john brow it ron johnson was very good
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.360]   he was you know really
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:32.560]   In charge of the big growth of the apple stores then they brought in this guy's from dixon's
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.200]   which is a
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.960]   In great here in england and he did not turn out so well. No
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:44.480]   Can we say that the last five years under errands have been I think very successful. Yes
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:51.040]   She did a couple amazing things like before angel errands the online and the retail were completely separate
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:55.280]   You could not order now but deliver to a store and if you ordered you could not take it back to the store
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.560]   Which was hugely problematic because that's the kind of expected behavior
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:03.920]   Also, they had those huge line-ups, which i'm sure marketing loved but was really bad for customers who you know
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.200]   Frows overnight and then didn't get the phone they wanted because it was sold out and she fixed all that with the pre-order system
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:13.040]   And she got all that working. Uh, she also did all the today at apple launch
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.480]   She worked with lisa jackson all the environmental and recycling things
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:22.080]   So think if there are some people who made those rots ha ha ha i wish i could have gotten a million dollars for not doing anything for five years
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:27.280]   But i think when you stack up her accomplishments they were formidable over a short period of time
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.040]   I'd agree
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:35.360]   We I asked the panel on twit on sunday and the only descent was man those stores are crowded now
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.400]   No one ever goes anymore
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.120]   That is a big problem their scale is a huge issue
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.200]   Yeah, I think that the biggest thing that and has been the problem for the apple stores from day one is
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.160]   I don't even think about going to the genius bar because I just know it's gonna take forever
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.080]   You know and and I and I think that's the problem he was talking about was the issue that
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.960]   Uh, you know, you got to make an appointment, but but they do have a system to do but even then it's like oh
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:01.600]   I got an appointment like four days from now or you know, my computer isn't working and and I had I had two
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.080]   iPads sit on my desk my kids iPads
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.920]   They of course screwed up their passwords and I couldn't figure out how to get it work. I finally figured it out on my own
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.160]   Over a day because I wasn't gonna take it in because it was gonna be so long
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:17.040]   And I you know and I think a lot of people have crazy schedules and the idea of scheduling something six days
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.960]   Six days out, you know, I it's very hard for me to do and so I
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:27.920]   Silverman of the his chronicle was the guy who's who had that descent said what they should do is spin the genius out somehow
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.400]   So that it because the stores are crowded and I have to say they're mostly crowded with look you lose
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.840]   I don't know if they're buying things, but that's a different operation
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:40.000]   I don't I don't agree because I think that's a huge draw to bring people into buy stuff
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   I mean I think the genius bars you want to have I just think you just need to have more more geniuses
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.280]   And you need to have the bars be bigger and I think that I think that the apple today is genius. I think genius
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:55.520]   I think it's it's great. I think that you know my kids have gone to those little classes and learned and they do have good phones
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.360]   The raw scene right I mean you can get phone support right away. That's very good
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:06.400]   Yeah, and I think that I think that that butting I think building up the support so that you really feel like you can just go in
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.600]   That would be good
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:12.640]   You know makes it makes a big difference and if you tie it to I mean because like even now like apple care is so wonky
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:17.440]   If you don't buy it at the apple store that you know, I never I'm after like one purchase on Amazon
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:21.920]   I was like I'm never buying a piece of hardware for anywhere other than apple because it's just too hard to deal with the
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:28.160]   Like I forget and you don't have the thing and it's not automatically attached to your hardware and it's you know, it's too much trouble. So so the
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:31.040]   So I think that apple hat
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.160]   I mean and the stores are great
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.200]   The only only other thing is is that you know that the the the service
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.520]   I mean the not the service but the selection is going to be crap
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:42.320]   You know like you're not going to see a lot of anything you're going to see this handful of little things
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:47.440]   Party stuff for party stuff is always like there are so many cases like there's a whole wall of cases
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.520]   But there's only like one of the you know and and I will admit that I go there
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.640]   I do go to the apple store when I'm thinking about picks for Mac break
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.840]   And I will walk in oh, and I take that's good
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.600]   And I and I look at the wall and I buy a couple things where I take pictures of them
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.360]   And I do some more research, you know
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.960]   On them because apple does pick very carefully and if I feel like if it's at the apple store
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.480]   I should know about it, you know, like it's you know, it's some little new doo-doo
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.480]   That is a seal of approval, isn't it?
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.000]   Yeah, yeah
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.920]   So it's it's a big deal and I've talked to a couple people that you know went from nothing to
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.320]   A product in the apple store
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.960]   And it was like, you know
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.440]   The sun the sun came down from from heaven
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:31.920]   It's true for podcast if apple puts you in the featured section on the podcast that that completely changes your life
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:36.880]   And I talked to a software developer that was that wrote a little app and and he said that they put him in one of the ads
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:41.120]   He went by and like 10 like 10 like a second like just like his look
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:47.920]   He said I went from I remember making $6,000 a month to $250,000 a month in one day
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.920]   Like it was just like a lot of power
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.920]   It just turned around a lot of power. Yeah
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:58.560]   The the genius bar could be a bigger problem that they do want to make sure they solve the problem of crowding
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.800]   So that I don't think it's a problem that people
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:05.200]   Have to make an appointment if they get there and they're on schedule
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.960]   They know that at 1 p.m. They will be seen by genius. Let's say plus or minus
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:13.120]   Five or ten minutes. The problem becomes when they become so overloaded that
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.640]   a
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:21.200]   Difficulty that in the good old days might have required a full hour of attention and care and handholding
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.920]   Is now we got to get these numbers up
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:28.640]   I'm just going to tell this person that this is as much as we can do for them and you're gonna have to go home now
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.880]   I've I I know the value of anecdotal stories
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.040]   But the number of people who've approached me
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:42.880]   Of I'm talking about people in my circle of friends of families a family who have had a bad experience at the genius bar that I thought this is
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.120]   Weird if they were they either the genius bar was having a really off day
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:53.840]   Or this person just got their cat run over and they were in a really bad mood about all of humanity
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:58.240]   Because there's some stuff that if they had taken more that more time with them
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.480]   They could have solved this problem. I think
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.920]   So unless this person is is not giving me the entire story
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:08.480]   This just seemed like a troubling story to hear about an experience at apple
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:14.720]   So they just have to make sure that the level of customer care that they can deliver never goes down if that means making it
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.320]   Making this getting rid of all the dead products that
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:22.880]   That they are definitely not really caring about for the for the immediate future
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.400]   To put in a couple of more genius bar seats. I think that's what they have to do
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:30.480]   And I will say that anytime I've actually talked to a genius. It's always it's always been great
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.320]   Like I've always been taking care of some people say they're not as good as they used to and maybe I'm like
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:38.560]   I've just been lucky but and also it's probably that I'm precise like I come in and I say exactly what's wrong
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.960]   Like I hear this is this is the issue. This is what I tested
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:44.240]   This is you know, so I'm able to get them to where they need to go quickly
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.400]   But but I've always had a great experience with them
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:51.040]   It's just that I'm like, oh, I don't want to schedule six days or I want to just go buy and I think
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.440]   Brian the person that can fix this
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.360]   Again the operation side. She's really good at she worked
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.240]   Tim cluck random really good operations org and if she starts looking down the guy and this is the year
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.240]   Because they have a really good experience
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:08.160]   But they're all these little what I mentioned all those little chips and dents in the experience
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.960]   And if you can start saying we don't we're getting this many customers in this store
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.240]   And the geniuses can see this many customers and do we need a new store here?
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.080]   Do we need it? You know twice as many geniuses?
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.920]   Yeah, we're there were the opening come from they may I mean there may be a shortage
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.960]   A genius sure training them, but they're also like something like my store opens way earlier for the geniuses like they all
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:29.600]   Store opens at 10, but the geniuses start working at eight now and they have like they get people in on a line
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:36.240]   Yeah, I mean it's just but it's scale like apple used to have an i'm a mac and an ipod when they launch those stores
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.480]   And now they have such a range of products
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.040]   And it's a much big and so many more customers
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:46.480]   They went from having to call people in begum to coming to wwdc to selling out 30 seconds or 20 seconds
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.920]   One of the other issues is that all the little mom and pops that used to sell apple
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:54.880]   Aren't there anymore because of the apple stores and so there is not a lot of other places to go
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.840]   You have to go to the apple store to get something fixed
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:02.960]   Unless you're going to send it in, you know to have it have a word on it. That's also part of the issue
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:08.480]   All right, so we should make a list of things we want d-r to fix but
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.840]   On the other hand a lot of this is caused by success
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:17.120]   And I have to say you compare this to any other computer manufacturer or any other retailer
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.000]   I mean or any other the next so far apple is making apple
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.560]   Twice as much per square foot than the next but I just mean from the person Tiffany experience of the user
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:31.440]   Yeah, uh, there's just no question apple support is better than any other company
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:36.560]   Is there there's nobody's always there's more staff in an apple store than I see customers in the microsoft store
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.280]   Yeah, that's true
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.240]   I have never tried
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:46.320]   I've never tried to bring something into microsoft and have them fix it. So maybe they're
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.760]   There's a lot of good people there. There's just not the same foot traffic at all
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:54.080]   No, it's not as busy as it well because they're they're their business to business company
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.080]   That sells on very limited line of products
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.200]   Uh, they they're if there were spots and waste yeah
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:04.560]   Well, then you then you have the problem that like you'd have little rugrats like like I was in the 80s
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:10.640]   Hanging out like at the department store just to play the just to play the nintendo's in the atari's as opposed to oh
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.240]   I suppose you're not here to buy six six hundred dollars worth of upgraded
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:19.440]   That's what games status for you know, I think is if you're listening to the show and you and you own if your company owns more than five or ten
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:24.160]   Max or you know or devices go in and ask to talk to a business rep. Oh, yeah, yes
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.160]   They they
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:31.520]   They told us we should be using the business rep. We didn't even know and it is that you need to get a business rep
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:36.160]   It's like frequent flyer. You know, it's like a fire on on an airline. You really want to
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.720]   Have a business relationship with apple
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:45.120]   Yeah, but if I if I had one other thing besides the genius bar thing to ask for an upgrade to the apple stores
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:48.080]   And I realized this is not this is maybe an ego thing
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.600]   I have had so many times where I've bought like a two thousand dollar laptop
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:56.720]   And I met at the front say oh you're here to pick my laptop great. Okay. You have to get a receipt great
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.560]   Just stand right here. Don't progress any farther and further into the store
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.480]   Right here near the entrance is fine. We'll bring it out to you. It's like great. Here we go
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:09.440]   Go away and I don't want I just I just when I spent two thousand again
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.240]   I realized this made it up make me look like a good person
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.240]   I'm just saying for that amount of money
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.160]   Offer me a chair perhaps a couple of tea
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:24.560]   Like I I appreciate the fact that you're getting this to me really really fast and it might be a convenience thing
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.640]   But it's almost like oh well, we are your credit card is already processed now
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.640]   We need you to stop cluttering the aisles
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.800]   Like that would
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.400]   Places they had for the gold apple
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:44.560]   Every store virtually everybody in that store is spending more than a thousand dollars
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:49.520]   So you got to spend more than that and you got by a gold apple watch if you really want some attention
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:54.160]   But second it's really it's really a problem of scale. Isn't it? I mean they're just too successful
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:44:00.000]   I know and I know it's a petty thing. It's just that's the only thing that was even a tiny tiny bit negative
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.800]   But every time I bought like my my biannual or semi-annual
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:10.160]   Macbook is like oh well, I remember time where it used to be a big deal that I was spending
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:16.640]   The only is literally the only retail store where I spend more than like 400 dollars at a time
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.520]   And it's like oh, I guess I'm just I guess I'm not quite the fancy lad that I imagine myself to be here
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:25.040]   It feels like you should get more I understand
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.760]   I do or a hot towel just
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.920]   For the three minutes while I'm waiting for the left have to come up just something
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:38.880]   There probably are ways to address that just you know faux luxury, you know, I know I think tea would be amazing
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:44.800]   Tea a little chair and a little chair. I give you a nice cream sand a blue bottle a blue bottle and every
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:49.440]   I don't know why they don't have coffee shops at every apple store actually. Yeah. Oh god
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.160]   They already have enough problems getting people to leave that
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.160]   Like great apple
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.840]   Wifi services rather than I mean two hours for the genius. No problem. I'll have a
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:02.560]   Well, well, I will say that the if I wish that more of them look like the one that's right next to apple park
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.640]   You know, have you been to that one? Yes, it's that is the quintessential apple store
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:12.960]   You you have the big ar thing on one side and then you have a great store and then on the far end you have a coffee shop
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:18.640]   It does you can only get coffee tea and chocolate. It's the weirdest many of these it's really good coffee
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.120]   Uh apple but like a
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.680]   You wouldn't even be able to get chocolate
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:28.960]   Healthy for you under Angela errence apple has really upgraded the look of these stores all yeah all over
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.280]   They're just gorgeous. Yeah, right? I think that's her
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:36.000]   Fashion sense came through that if you point to one initiative that's clearly hers
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.240]   So you want to take one of the community hub. Yeah. Yeah, that was your goal
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:44.160]   the like I remember when they opened the one in chicago and I I was doing some work there and I
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:48.320]   Like we came around the corner and you just see this the it's just an incredible
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:53.440]   view of you see that like the top of a laptop and then the glass and then the in the river and it's just
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:59.840]   Especially like picking it and how they built it to fit into those locations except for sweeten evidently, which is
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:04.560]   No one wants them there, but but but the uh, that's except for sweeten. It was
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:09.520]   That that temporary location they have on the fifth avenue store while they continue to rebuild it outside
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:13.840]   The real one inside and that must be killing them every single day
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:20.800]   Because it's not bad, but it's clearly like here is we were able to get the former fio shorts right next door
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:25.520]   So people will still know where to come and scott enough square footage so we can still do it
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:29.600]   But the lighting is not what we want it to be the floor is not what we want it to be
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:32.080]   There is like a big big big
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:36.080]   They've got a staircase that's like made out of steel and cement
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:43.120]   Steel and cement staircase in an apple store. That's got to be killing them in some way shape or form
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:49.440]   Uh, did you watch the grammys this year? No audio problems that I noticed. I didn't watch the grammys
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:55.360]   Yeah, I missed it Leah, but I when I walked in the door. This was playing and I thought oh good on you apple
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:58.160]   uh, this is uh
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:04.480]   George florida georgia line singing some country music in me mojis
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:09.680]   Me emoji app worked like that. I'd use it more well and that's the thing if you go to the end of the ad
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:18.160]   It says professionally animated do not turn this at home. If you ever wanted to imagine your favorite Grammy artists
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:22.480]   Beheaded with their heads on bikes. We've got the ad for you
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:30.160]   Flourida watch on a k music. I'm waiting for the disclaimer. Oh, where was it? It's in there somewhere, isn't it?
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:38.800]   And there's Ariana groddin and callad my I was I was thinking about it
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.160]   I think that my my theory there is that they use the face they use the
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:47.040]   FaceTime or the the front front camera front facing camera to
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:53.600]   Uh capture the the animation and then you just applied it onto there's there's apps now
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:59.280]   That'll do that to cinema 4d or to Maya and then you can do whatever you want or just hire somebody knows what they're doing
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.760]   And they duplicate it because I could I don't know if you could even make us a
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:09.040]   Emoji that looks like that. That's very much. It should make an app that does this
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.560]   Also, why make the job harder for yourself
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:16.160]   You're not if you're not if you're not claiming this is a live demo anyway
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.320]   Well, they and that's the point in the ad they
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:26.080]   Some point they do disclaim the other thing is is all all these drivers what they're you know, they're it's um the way that the um facial capture works is
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.320]   It's capturing
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:32.160]   It's a bunch of morph shapes or a bunch of shapes that are it's pushing between
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:37.040]   The interest so you can you could just sit there and dial them back and fix the interesting if they were using
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.160]   I wish they would say whether they were using the front facing camera to do this or
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:47.760]   That's not to say that once they once they've got the wire frames or once they've got here is the here is what the mimoji styles
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:54.640]   Uh rigging got us wouldn't it be great if we were able to sort of lift lift her left corner up a little bit more here
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:58.560]   Yeah, so it's just it looks like a bunch of little sliders like 30 sliders
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:03.120]   Right are going back and forth during it and you could easily go in there and add delta frames on top of that to
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:08.400]   To kind of tune it up or delete certain ones that are glitchy or those are the kind of things you'd go through and just go through the key
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:13.120]   Frans can't see it on the bottom of the frame, but it is it there mimoji professionally animated
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.680]   Whatever that means. Yes
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:22.240]   Yeah, be nice if they said shot with an iPhone, but professionally animated we paid some 13 year old and Muskegon
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:28.800]   Yes, this is this is how good a 14 year old high schooler can do
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.680]   making of how about that the making of
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:35.120]   Our show day brought to you by hover
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.760]   Love the hove
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:42.400]   Building your online brand has never been more important and the best way to do that is have a custom URL
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.280]   And I want to tell you you go to a registrar to do that
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:49.920]   That's the best way to do it because you then there's no question you own it
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:54.320]   You can go somewhere else for hosting your site whatever but having that domain name
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:50:00.880]   Is the best way to do it and there is no better registrar than hover.com and I can you know, it's not just me all my domains are there
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:07.360]   But steve gipson's everybody buying a domain name for your passion is the first and biggest step to building your personal brand online
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:12.160]   I gave these to my kids is I gave them their names their domain names
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:17.360]   If you got a teenager get a domain name, that's how you're going to be identified on the web forever
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:22.560]   And the cool thing about hover besides the fact that it's straightforward. It's easy
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:25.280]   There's no issue at all
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.360]   with
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:32.160]   Upselling, you know 500 screens. No, I don't want that. No, I don't want that. This is it. You go there
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:40.080]   You buy your domain name every domain name has who has privacy built in and man do they have every extension 400 domain extensions to choose from
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:43.280]   Including dot me by the way
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.880]   Leo dot me that would be good great for a portfolio or showcase
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.760]   But lots more dot ninja dot pizza
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:53.920]   I'm using dot email for my private email server went to hover comm
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:51:00.400]   Hover's great. Yep best in class customer support team. No upsells clean and simple user experience and interface
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:07.040]   Hover connect makes it easy to what to connect your domain name to any website builder with just a few simple clicks
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:12.560]   I moved everything there and it's so yeah, me too. Simple or easier turn on two factor. It's extra secure
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:16.960]   Their service people there, you know customer support people are fantastic. They will handle your
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:19.920]   Issue directly hover comm slash twit
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:26.240]   And you'll get 10 off the first purchase of any domain extension for the for the entire first year
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:32.000]   10 off your new domain for a full year when you go to hover dot com
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.080]   slash
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.400]   Twit actually spent some time talking to the hover
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:39.120]   Technical guys. I don't know if you remember this
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:42.240]   Couple of weeks ago on twit greg ferro went off
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:44.880]   talking about um
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.640]   Dns flag day
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:52.160]   And dns flag day is something that the internet consortium has kind of promoted
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:57.120]   And some say kind of excessively dns flag day dot net
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:01.680]   uh, the idea is that they want everybody to support these
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.280]   uh new dns extensions and
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:09.600]   Uh, if you if I go to my one of my hover domains, it will pass
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:15.360]   It'll be fine it validates, but they'll say but you should get more of the extensions installed
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.560]   So I want I called hover to ask about this. I really wanted to know
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:25.120]   Uh, what's the story there? And they said, yeah, we looked at this and um, there are issues involved
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.760]   And we were really concerned
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.160]   Look, look, our job is to
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.520]   Register a domain name for you. We do offer dns
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:37.520]   But it's really it's an additional service that we offer as a courtesy
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:43.120]   But if you for instance twit if you go to twit dot tv our dns is going even though our name is at hover
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.600]   Our dns goes through dns simple
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.600]   Um, and so we pass uh
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:51.760]   You know with with a green light on this one if you go through hover
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:56.560]   I wait i'm trying to remember what domains i'm using hovers dns for I think this
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:02.240]   No, that that we're using an external dns as well. Yeah, almost everybody with a big with a big
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:06.400]   bunch of traffic would because you you don't you want to run it through a
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:11.360]   So it says minor problems detected and greg ferro went off on hover for this
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:13.840]   So I talked to him and I wanted to find out
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:19.120]   And he said the hover guys said look there are big issues involved with doing these extensions
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.040]   Not it's hard it's not that it's hard for us. It's not
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:25.440]   But we decided not to do it because we don't want to break anybody's dns the last thing you want to do is break
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.800]   Somebody's dns
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:30.240]   And one of the things you should be aware of with these new dns extensions
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:36.320]   It enables dns reflection attacks which we've seen in the past because you can send a massive amount of data
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:41.520]   Back from a simple dns request so they made it they made a technical decision. They said we're
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:45.200]   We're not saying we're never going to do it, but we're not rushing to do it
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:50.400]   If you have a hover domain name registered, it'll come up like this the domain is going to work
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:53.040]   That's the most important point after february 1st
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:57.600]   But hover has decided and I think with good technical merit i talked to him for quite a while
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.360]   not to
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:01.360]   Do the full extensions yet?
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:07.760]   They say minor problems detected on this dns flag they cite. I don't think I don't think that it's is a problem
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:13.920]   It's still completely compliant in fact. It's more compliant with the existing dns standard than these other standards
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:18.720]   These additional standards which are being pushed, you know, frankly by
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.760]   um, this one particular
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.080]   consortium so
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:26.080]   Uh, the isc
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:30.560]   That's who's pushing all this so just I know people were concerned and were worried
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.840]   Greg was up in arms. I think unnecessarily
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:37.200]   Um about that thought I'd bring that up
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:41.760]   Uh, and as I said use hover. I like hover. I'm very happy
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:46.160]   Uh, and I was concerned so I called them and talked to them and they they satisfied me
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.800]   Did you see that the 2020?
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:52.800]   Olympics medals in tokyo maybe partially made out of old iPhones
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:57.200]   And other phones to be fair no bias here towards ios
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.000]   Uh, gold press latinum leo
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:06.800]   The uh, I guess what happened is ntt dokomo the big carrier in japan asked people to hand in
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:12.080]   Old phones when they got new ones. They got five million disused phones and then figure out what to do with them
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.720]   Now let's make some metal 47,000 tons of e-waste
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:20.800]   And as you may know your phone is loaded with precious metals including
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:22.480]   um
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:23.840]   gold
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:27.520]   They met their target of 2700 kilograms of bronze last june
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:34.800]   They're 93.7 towards their goal of 30 kilograms of gold. That's a lot of gold 30 kilograms
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.120]   That's a ton of gold
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:42.240]   Not quite a few times. I know where's the silver and bronze inside my phones where's the bronze especially?
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:46.720]   There's 41 hundred kilograms of silver they extracted so there must be bronze in there
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.360]   Maybe it's in android phones instead of gold
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:53.680]   Right. They didn't want to spend the money. It's a broad it goes. It's motorola is casing material
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:56:01.280]   Uh, they haven't quite hit their gold and silver targets, but they're but they're getting there and they've got all the bronze they could possibly
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:05.200]   Need if there was aluminum metals. They would have been set years ago. Yeah, no kidding
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:08.400]   I think that's a great way to highlight e-waste
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:14.960]   And to recycle those phones. That's great. I have no word of whether they used lem the iphone disassembling robot
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:20.080]   Yeah, I was gonna say I'd love to I'd love to know how much the people who disassembled those phones were paid
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:22.080]   because that
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:29.600]   Recycling a v-waste is usual it has frequently been a job handed off to people with very very very few options and
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:33.760]   Working in very very hazardous situations for very very little pay
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:39.600]   I'm reading the article now to see if they'd say how they did it
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:47.280]   And it doesn't we're gonna get to some point in our in our in this culture where we expect to behind the scenes of everything
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:50.480]   Yeah, we want to know
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:56.080]   Information private well, especially when someone really wants us to know how wonderful they are
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.800]   It's like I really want to believe you
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:02.000]   Understanding like I guess I thought it was slowly becoming
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:08.640]   Well, they never did say whether they had more than one lem or daisy the new one, but it's it's also you just get very
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:13.920]   You know, I was driving to Sacramento the other day and and I and I'm on my way up
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:17.360]   And there's a whole bunch of sheep and they're all tied to hosts
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.880]   You know, like they're all like they all have like a long leash from the from like
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:26.400]   No, they're that's range fed sheep. You're like like I realized
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:29.920]   When they say when they say pasture fed they meant
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:36.000]   The super all on these little leashes that they're all like they're hanging from whatever and they can't really go anywhere and they're all kind of like
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.280]   They bother
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.760]   You know, well, because it's a good it's a good marketing thing
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:45.920]   Just like when they say free range chickens that means that the horrible place where they live has a door where the chickens can go
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:50.960]   I want to just let the sheep one because they because it's I can tell you actually it's um as someone who
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:58.160]   Grew up in 4-H. Uh the more that the the livestock move around the more you have to feed them per pound. Oh, like that was always the thing
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:03.280]   Oh, they're exercising. Hey, you want you want them to walk around a little but you don't want them to walk around a lot because it makes the meat
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.920]   Tougher and it also
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:10.480]   Takes more calories and so you you have as much fat. I didn't have any sheep bite pigs
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:15.680]   Sheep are more fun than pigs. They are more fun. Well, they're a lot less dirty
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:20.480]   I'll take that sheep same goats don't have goats my cousins are like sheep and never about once a year
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:25.200]   They get through the fence and then they were everywhere and then there was maybe that was the issue too. They don't want to escape ease
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:29.680]   It goes they're a lot of fun when they're little not so much older
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:33.280]   We've heard of patent trolls suing apple and others
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:36.640]   Uh this week apple sued a patent troll
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:38.880]   Preemptively
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:45.760]   They filed suit against fundamental they did this last week a fundamental innovation systems international fizzy fizzy fizzy
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:47.360]   See
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:55.600]   Preemptively asking a california court to declare that apple did not infringe upon a number of usb power patents held by fizzy
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:02.960]   Apple said that's uh, that's fizzy's not a real company. It's a patent assertion entity aka patent role
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:08.480]   For the sole purpose of generating revenue through patent litigation they acquired a portfolio
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.520]   of usb charging patents from blackberry
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:17.120]   And they've already gone against lg samson and wah way and in fact
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:21.600]   lg samson and wah way are now listed as fizzy licensees
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:25.840]   pastors switch to usbc they said everything will be better if you did
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:32.000]   Is a usbc supposed to be a standard the whole point in using usbc is that you don't have to put up with this nonsense
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   I don't think this patent requires c because it dates back to the early 2000s
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.760]   So it's just the notion that you might charge over usb
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:43.280]   apple has demanded a jury trial in
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:46.960]   Northern california what normally this patent lawsuits are in
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:52.640]   So whether they're not they're they're not waiting for it to end up in eastern texas. They're pushing it right that's that's a
[00:59:52.640 --> 01:00:00.320]   That's a legitimate good tactic way to do it. Yeah, good good tactic is pull them onto your we actually considered that when the podcast patent drill
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.640]   Right we've considered a number of options
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.160]   Fortunately led pipe they got destroyed by the ff there you go
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:16.560]   Like they also can they also add something to they also apple also add something to the lasso saying that this company is not allowed to use the word
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:23.440]   Innovation in their title in their common daily language. They are not allowed to have any access to the word
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:27.840]   Innovation that's that's what that's one of the many things that steams me about these companies
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:34.400]   They bought somebody's patent exactly. I think I think that I have to admit that I think that
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.760]   Patents should you should have a
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.640]   Protection for the 14 years or whatever that you have protection
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:44.960]   But you should have to do something with it in a certain number of years after you've done the patent or it
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:51.360]   You can't you know, you can't uh, you can't like copy copy right it protects you for the next 14 years
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:56.400]   But you can't use it in in a lawsuit after x number of years if you didn't do anything with a lot of companies though are doing
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:02.480]   Defensive patents their patenting stuff. I think apple has a bunch of you can you can you can do that as a defensive
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.560]   Pat you can't do a sue someone for using your patent if you didn't do anything with anything, right?
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.760]   So it's defensive just you get like five years to do something with it
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.400]   And then you because we just I think that a lot of it both with pat and zan with copyright
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.920]   You know it right now that they've turned into these kind of
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:23.280]   sewage lakes of of we're just not moving anywhere, you know, they're holding up the whole industry
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:32.320]   Because they're they're lasting too long. I would disagree with that analogy because a sewage lake is used to purify sewage and turn into pure drinking water
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.760]   Thank you. Arras
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:39.920]   Exactly lawyers have apps patent litigators have absolutely no function. There you go apple threw a bunch of
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:46.000]   Interesting ideas into its home pod patent including the ability to make gestures
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:55.600]   spells Leo spells expecto home pardronal you know that harry potter games got to be coming pretty soon
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.600]   We might all be making spells soon
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:59.760]   um
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:08.080]   They uh apple had an idea for a future home pod that would offer an emoji version of syria and led lights that could display a variety of useful information
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.960]   Wasn't that doctor who this year? They just had the emoji faced people
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:20.240]   The led could respond and change when you wave your hand in front of it using 3g gesture 3d gesture support anyway
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:24.800]   Uh, that's another example of apples just gonna patent everything they could think of yeah
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:30.000]   But a lot of that has to do with just protecting yourself from right someone else. It's defensive you bet
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.400]   Uh tech and hiding the real patents if you don't patent a million things and know exactly what you're working on
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.440]   Tech crunch points out that
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:46.880]   Facebook and google are not the only people abusing apples enterprise certificate program
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:52.960]   Those enterprise certificates are meant for companies offering apps just for you know internal internal use
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:59.440]   a tech crunch investigation discovered a dozen hardcore pornography apps, which of course apple blocks
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:08.240]   And a dozen real money gambling apps that escaped apples oversight because apple blocks both of those the developers passed apples weak
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:15.040]   This is tech crunches word enterprise certificate screening process or piggyback to legitimate approval
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:20.240]   Allowing them to sidestep the app store. That's an interesting way of getting into uh
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.760]   iPhones of course you'd have to sideload it
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:27.840]   Yeah, but that's it's that's the sort of market that would go for that
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.960]   Someone who's very very highly motivated by either money or access to porn and i'm not making a joke there
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:38.000]   That if you give them a freaky freaky system for installing an app they will still go for it. Yep
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.960]   Yep, I mean safari why bald
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:45.920]   Yeah, so I I would guess that the way this
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:52.160]   By the way to get an enterprise certificate you fill out an online form you pay $299 to apple
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:57.840]   Uh, you have to in this in the form pledge that you're building an enterprise certificate app
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:01.680]   For internal employee use only and that you swear we swear
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.120]   Any skull
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:10.880]   And they have the legal authority to register the business provide a duns business number and uh have an up-to-date mac
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:19.920]   Uh, so it's not so tricky. I would guess that the way it works is you'd go to a website like this boss room
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.720]   Gambling app you'd go to their website and they'd say all right
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:25.840]   Well, if you want to install this you have to download and install a certificate
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:33.040]   And then you can sideload this using that certificate. That's how it works right at rene you you install a certificate on your phone
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:39.040]   Yeah, uh, absolutely and then it lets you distribute it through that enterprise certificate and you don't have to have it signed by the app store
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.040]   It's signed by that company instead
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:45.920]   Tech crunch found thousands of sites offering downloads of side-loaded enterprise apps
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.840]   Um
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:56.720]   Using a standard unbroken unjailbroken iPhone tech crunch was able to download and verify 12 pornography and 12 cash gambling apps over the past week
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:03.040]   So this is fairly wide spread app store of you should just hire john Constantine and dak would occur at this point
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.680]   Yeah, find everything is this constant that did it that wrote this or i don't know
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:11.680]   It's it was johnners act. Yeah, josh has really done a lot of great enterprise
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:16.480]   All those porn sites that they're like they just ruined everything for everyone. I mean like literally exactly
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:23.760]   Uh, what a what a what a nightmare for apple to try to police all of this and i can't imagine developers not getting honest developers
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:28.400]   Not getting caught in the crossfire of this. I mean we've seen we've seen how bad things get when
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:33.120]   Naughty people figure out a way around
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:39.440]   Rules of common behavior commonly good behavior with what's happening with youtube with
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:44.080]   With black mailers figuring out that
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.480]   Youtube doesn't really police its strike system
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.480]   They just believe that if someone says there's a copyright strike against this they'll believe them
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:58.560]   So we'll put two copyright strikes against this really popular youtuber and say unless you give us five thousand
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.120]   Let's give you unless you give us ten bitcoin
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:04.480]   We will file a third copyright strike and you will never get your cut your channel back
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:10.320]   This is the sort of problem that could affect apple developers if apple decides that this is now become such a big problem
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.320]   We're just going to assume that
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:17.920]   One out of every three search certificate users are actually fraudulent at this point because they don't have the resources to police at all
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:24.000]   I don't think unfortunately it looks like a lot of the certificates are actually legitimate companies
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.560]   Who are being or either their certs are forged or stolen?
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:35.360]   So if you see this list, you know, uh, the certificate holder is a freight forwarding company or a us furniture company
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:40.880]   Uh air b and b management company and romania Moscow motorcycle company
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:48.480]   Uh, so some of their it guys younger brother. What is he doing? Yeah, exactly and apple even kind of facilitates that because they have a d u n s look up
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:50.560]   Uh
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.840]   Feature in their application so you can look up in the name of a company that's a
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:58.560]   Difficult one it could be in and some of it may be there being tricked other ones are gonna say hey
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:04.080]   We just want to do this. We want to use this this number. Yeah, here's a thousand dollars thousand dollars a month or a thousand dollars a week
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.080]   And they're gonna sure yeah
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:12.240]   I imagine after josh's story. Well done. Josh apple will uh will make you know, yep, take this up
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:17.120]   All right, that was a patent time now rumor time
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.360]   Oh
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.720]   Yeah, I always say I take this all with a huge grain of salt
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:28.320]   Apples next ipad mini reportedly won't look much different, but it will be faster
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.240]   Yep
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:33.680]   And it will still use lightning and have a headphone jack
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:38.000]   This is from uh, mac otakara and digit times
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.960]   So
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.800]   When would would we see a mac mini? I love the mac mini would we see a mac mini?
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.520]   I'd like to see a pro mac mini to be honest with you, but
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:51.440]   Yeah, the keyboard would be hard. I mean like the little tiny smart keyboard. That'd be fun. I want to see
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.200]   Like that
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.440]   Miss me the robin's I guess yeah, we'll never see
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.280]   It'll be a pinky
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:03.200]   Yeah, but I mean so with the I think I believe the idea with this is to take what what's been so attractive about the 9.7 inch ipad
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:10.720]   Which is as ipad pro prices have increased the 9.7 inch ipad prices have gone down even though apple's been adding technology like apple pencil to them
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.880]   So the ipad mini would be a way of making an even slightly cheaper version of the 9.7
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:22.480]   It should be 7.9 inch but would have apple pencil support and it'd be available at education and enterprise discounts obviously but also anybody who just wants
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:28.560]   You know, I think and you know I have gushed over this previously just once that digital field notebook with a pen
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.880]   It's like the best thing ever
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:36.480]   Super super ipad the I wanted an iphone plus plus plus plus
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:39.120]   I want this and that's would yeah
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.680]   I mean, I if we were gonna see this in 2019
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:47.440]   I would expect to see it sometime before may as some sort of an educational sort of initiative
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:55.840]   Because as great as the 9.7 inches and it is a fantastic educational computer having something that's more manageable and harder to drop
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:04.080]   Let's say by kids would probably be a positive also the it would be it would also follow that the smaller ipad would be structurally a lot more solid
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:11.200]   Just by virtue of the fact that it's a smaller pane of glass you have a higher ratio of aluminum to to create the structural supports of it
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:17.040]   But I think that if they if apple has any intention of making this mostly for the educational market
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.720]   A lot of us are going to be knocking on our our neighbor's door
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:24.560]   Can I borrow just in for an afternoon? I need to take them to a mall
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:31.040]   So that apple will sell me an edge quote educational mini ipad that I absolutely desperately want
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:36.320]   I will buy them a new pair of shoes. Whatever you put on whatever you put on the shopping list for for
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:38.960]   Okay, not serious, but maybe macy's I will buy it
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:42.640]   It's such a great idea and of course one of the subjects it will be
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.160]   There'll be lots of speculation about until next September
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:53.840]   whether the 2019 iphone will use lightning or usb c i'm i'm rooting for usb c, but here's the rumor that
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:59.440]   The next iphone according to again maco kotakara will use lightning
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:04.880]   And the same crappy five-point charger and usb a the lightning cable in the box
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:09.840]   I have the best troll for apple if I was apple I would come out and say we're not going to usb c
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:16.560]   But we're deleting the lightning port and then let everybody gasp and then say but we're putting the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack back
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.160]   That would be a massive troll
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:23.440]   We're giving you a one-quarter and stereo headphone jack
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:27.360]   Use your dad's headphones on this new and i'll use the old shuffle charger like you got
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.760]   You know I was so
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:33.360]   When they took away the headphone jack, I was so abaplectic and I was just like i'm never gonna go to bluetooth
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.920]   And now I have my airpods and I have to admit that I ever I do have some edamotics that I wear
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.240]   Occasionally when my airpods run out of battery
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.920]   And it's so funny how now i've gotten to this point where like this thing
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:49.600]   This is the headphone the line is getting caught on everything and I forgot you know like it's just like this thing that I now have to deal with that I
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:55.200]   Never thought I would ever give up. You know I wear my wire and now my wire is getting caught
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:58.880]   Walked away and my phone flew across the room the other day. It was very embarrassing
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.400]   I didn't remember that was wearing airpods earpods instead of airpods
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.600]   Like i'm sorting things i'm so usually just setting my iPhone somewhere in the room
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:09.520]   And then I just go about doing what i'm doing and then and then the phone rings and I can't figure out where my phone is
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.680]   Like it's i'm wandering around trying to find it
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:16.960]   I won't I won't have this argument again. I'm just saying that I like I like wired headphones
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:21.280]   You plug them in and the electrons know exactly where to go at no point if you say gee
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:25.200]   I wonder why i'm not listening. I'm not hearing it through my earphones phones
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:31.920]   Why don't I just go through a whole bunch of menus to tell it that the earphones that i'm using that are two feet away from the phone or the actual things
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.080]   I actually want to listen through again
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:40.640]   You put you if you if you draw a line in copper from point a to point b there's no questions for the electrons to ask
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:45.680]   Oh, I know I I follow the copper the copper trail road and it works. That's all i'm saying
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:53.120]   If we do maybe a bellwether this would be the new airpods if they come out with new airpods in the spring
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:58.320]   Would they have a lightning connector or usbc connector if they have a lightning connector?
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:03.200]   Then I think we'd have to be that the iphone coming out shortly after that would have to be lightning, right?
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.200]   No, because they crazy i've been all the time leo
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:10.080]   It's like you get an ipad an ipad pro that has usbc and then you think oh, they're definitely going to do the iphone
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.840]   And then like the apple tv has usbc, but then they get rid of it the next year
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:18.640]   It's just they they want they I think there's a whole department that just wants to keep us off balance
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:24.160]   Well, I think there's also licensing issues and control issues that you know the iphone is a much bigger product for apple
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:29.040]   Than the ipad is so right put on a usbc and the ipad it doesn't matter as a good
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:33.120]   I think also intimated that they had all this stuff that they they you know
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:39.600]   They were ready to go with lightning and just the cost of transitioning all of that to usbc at at iphone scale
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:43.200]   Was going to take a while or be really expensive because you have to replace every
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:49.520]   Headphone every you know the plug in the phone also the adapter all of those things and when you make 100 million of them
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.600]   That's a little bit. That's a little bit of cash
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:56.000]   Now for this next story we go to our opera expert and he and not co
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   I had no idea, but apparently this Santa Fe opera
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:07.760]   Did a an opera called the revolution of steve jobs r is in parenthesis? So it's like revolution evolution
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:10.640]   Look at this picture from it. It's a one act opera
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.640]   And it won a grammy award for best opera recording
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.560]   Have you seen this opera and do you know of it?
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:24.880]   Um, I haven't seen it, but the cast this a grammy so the cast recording is out. I've heard it. It's okay
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:32.720]   Uh, it's it's I was I was actually hoping for uh the another candidate to win an opera called great scott
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:35.440]   Which was another brand new opera that was only written
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:41.920]   It's like a couple of years ago, but it's the recording that gets the nomination so the recording actually landed last
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:44.160]   at late last year
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:51.280]   Because I can understand if it were work if there are more conservative because steve jobs is more of a serious sort of dramatic opera
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:55.920]   Whereas great scott is kind of like a screwball m gm musical
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:02.240]   Written as an opera the whole it's it is the the plot line of the of great scott is that uh, uh,
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:12.560]   International opera diva comes back to her hometown for to do like a benefit show of a benefit production of a rediscovered fake opera
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:17.120]   Uh for their reach for the regional opera company and hijinks and sue
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:21.920]   Uh, and it's actually it's one of those rare things you call a funny opera
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:28.960]   Uh, it's also joisty de natto as the returning diva who has her own issues. It's it's pretty funny
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:34.000]   Revolution of steve jobs scene one. Thanks for coming
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.400]   Yeah, see it's
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.560]   I
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:50.000]   Okay, I like opera, but I kind of like it to be in french the town
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.720]   It's hard for us to get into it because we can't this is totally not steve jobs
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:57.920]   Thanks for coming
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:02.160]   Yeah, as as an american you're not exposed part of opera is listening to something you don't understand
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.160]   Yeah, like I don't you know you don't want to hear the
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:09.680]   My mom and dad always used to make fun of these kinds of it's so here's a here's a
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:14.480]   Here's here's one called karma can suck
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:21.280]   There's not a high order bit. I'm gonna be sad
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:25.680]   I find I find understanding the words very distracted
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:36.160]   Your not wrong. Why doesn't mean me selfish
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.640]   Wrong language
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:45.440]   This is
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:52.960]   One button this is called one button turn it on
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:59.840]   I should make fun of this plus is getting
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.840]   button
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:05.680]   And
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:14.880]   Now
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:29.120]   The opera orchestra it is available on I'm sure apple music I'm playing off google music but
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.760]   There you go and uh
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.280]   Available in record stores now if you had a record story you could probably get it
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:44.160]   Spotify if you bought us this is exactly this type of on the spot hip current with the kids today promotion you'd be getting each and every day
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:46.640]   drive time to midnight
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:49.360]   with the breakfast flakes
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.880]   And finally
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:57.440]   Pokemon go I had to do a story for pokemon go yes, by the way, I want to say I am 38
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:01.680]   the lovely lisa's 39 we're closing in on
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:07.760]   Mr. 40 which is the top level you get pokemon go I think lisa and I are almost we believe I are best friends now
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:12.000]   But I think lisa and I are also almost best friend. That's the secret get the best friends. Yes
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.880]   Yeah, I made it to three little level up
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:22.400]   Level three I just gonna give out in case I have I have deleted anybody that isn't playing hard including Anthony nelson
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:27.520]   So if you play hard and you want to be my friend there's my trainer code 3068
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:33.280]   5802 0 0 7 9 I'm the guy in the pikachu hoodie
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:40.080]   Just saying and what I notice people doing lio is that they will put up that code and then they'll hit that little recycle button and get a new code
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.640]   After a while so if you want you can like open it up for a day
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.240]   Then hit the recycle button get a new code and tell another group of people the next week
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:50.720]   And it helps if you have like a high volume of people you know we're gonna sign up and you don't want to swap it all at once
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:56.800]   Okay, okay, but don't befriend me unless you're really gonna play because this is the secret
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:00.640]   We realized to get into 40 is is is putting down a lucky
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:03.200]   Sorry to pour you with this
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:09.120]   Dental lucky egg and then adding the friendship level and get it up and up and up see back in my day
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.120]   You had to catch a billion
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:16.400]   Pigeons and then put on a lucky egg and evolve them and now you kids. Yeah, you can't easy for you kids
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:22.640]   The other day I got to half a million points two two best friends and an ultra friend with a lucky egg
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:25.920]   I was a happy man boom boom like that
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:28.720]   Yeah, it's always too complicated for me
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:34.320]   Well, then you may like this vastly improved ar photo mode. It's coming to me. Okay, mongo very soon
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:41.680]   What is how is this different? I I don't use the ar mode because I just went very limited before like you could only
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:46.160]   Look at the ar mode when you were catching a pokemon and a lot of people just wanted to be able to take funny
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.880]   Like I want to take a funny photo with a duck on leo's head
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:53.200]   But if you don't have anything to catch like you can't do anything and you're trying to catch it
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:54.400]   So it's not in the right place
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:59.760]   So I think the goal of this is just to let you have make all little pokemon you have and put them in the real world
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:02.320]   So you can take cool photos of them. Okay, that's cool
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:07.360]   By the way now that I'm looking at this pokemon it maybe pikachu does have fur
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:09.920]   I don't know
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.800]   It's the detective pikachu trailer all over again
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:16.960]   Yeah, that was the big something amazing about deadpool's voice coming from a pikachu
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:19.920]   I'm just gonna let the internet deal with this is really weird
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:24.160]   I just I will electrocute you with my tail least and I
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:29.600]   Once we get to 40. We're just gonna retire and perfect and enjoy the
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.960]   Enjoy the weather just for 40 and hard
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:36.240]   40 and what number base base 10 base
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:41.520]   Believe it's 40 turns out base. Yeah, it takes you have to get a lot of points to get there
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:46.160]   It's not easy and if we're involving evolving pikachu one by one, it would not be fun
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.880]   No, it was not funny. We called the grind leo. It was called the grind the grind baby
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:55.040]   All right, let's take a little time out gentlemen prepare your picks
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:59.520]   I could tell you my pick right out of the box baby for the last 10 years
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.720]   It's been my pick the first app I install on any new device
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:08.720]   Last pass it's my password manager should be your password manager last pass keeps you safe
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.960]   prevents breaches
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:14.720]   By using a different password on every side of password last pass generates
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:19.920]   It's long strong random and truly unmemorable. But wait you say I need to remember it. No, you don't
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.480]   With last pass you just remember the last pass
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:29.840]   unlock code the vault password and everything else is stored in there last pass is totally secure
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:36.000]   It has a zero knowledge security model because data is encrypted and encrypted only at the device level
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:39.200]   Nobody not even last pass can get your password just you
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:43.040]   And I really like that the reason I install it first on every device
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:48.560]   Well on the iPhone and android devices it auto fills so I just you know set up a new android device
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:53.680]   I put last pass on there set it up and now whenever I get a new app or wow
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:58.080]   You know want to put a new app on there. It just logs me in it's so nice. iOS 12 does that too
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:02.400]   I just think that's fantastic now. That's just the pitch for last pass at home
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:06.320]   It's even more important in your business and that's because your employees
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.480]   Suck
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.040]   You're no they don't they're wonderful lovely people
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:14.400]   But they don't know from passwords and post-it notes
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:20.160]   They are gonna and boy the last thing you want is the name of your company to be featured as a headline in the next
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.560]   Wall Street Journal article about breaches
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:26.240]   last pass protects you by
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:33.040]   Asserting strong password policies at work. You can even make it that the employees don't even get passwords
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:40.320]   They just get automatic logins. You can make it easy to share passwords with password faults. You can actually set over 100 password
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:48.080]   Policies things like master password requirements require two-factor. That's what we do. We oh I should say we use last pass enterprise
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.920]   We love last pass enterprise
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:54.960]   I've been using last pass for 10 years and we started using last pass enterprise when one of our employees posted all his passwords
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.840]   On a public web page and we said oh boy
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:02.960]   We need we need a better way to do this and of course you can restrict access if you have to
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:09.280]   You can I trust it so much I store everything if we as a company store everything in there including database logins
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:12.720]   SSH keys software licenses all the business information
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:19.760]   I store my social security number my password a passport rather my uh my driver's license in last pass
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:27.200]   It's that safe. It's that secure and it's nice because you have it on every platform Mac windows android iOS even Linux
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:32.160]   My passwords are always there in every browser every time last pass
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:37.680]   Don't forget their authenticator app, which makes it very easy for your employees to add two factors
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.160]   They just get an approved and I button that's really nice
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:45.040]   Uh, it's it's it's works with microsoft active directories. So if you're an ad house
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:49.360]   You can use active directory credentials to log into last pass that makes it even easier
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.040]   You're gonna love last pass you need last pass if you've been thinking about it. Do not
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:23:01.360]   Delay go right now to last pass.com/twit. There's last pass for personal use
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:04.800]   That's last pass premium last pass families. That's what we use at home
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:10.400]   If you have a small team 50 or fewer last pass teams and the big boy. We use it last pass enterprise
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:17.840]   43 000 businesses 16 and a half million people trust their most precious
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:24.080]   Possession their passwords to last pass last pass.com/twit
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:30.080]   I'm happy to use it happy to recommend the most useful part of we've been using last pass for
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:34.720]   Well, you have people come ago. So you really have to go and the big thing is is that we
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:37.120]   Uh, the biggest thing is when we volunteers
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:40.560]   Well, we want to give you someone access to something being able to not give them the password
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:44.000]   And just give them an access so they can just log in and just automatically puts it in for them
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.440]   But I don't have to
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:50.320]   Propagate passwords because we have to manage a lot of passwords securely and and it just it's just way easier
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:54.160]   Not to have to you cut things like the door code of the white house. You don't want that to be
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:57.280]   Definitely keep it in last pass
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:01.760]   Andy and ico pick of the week
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:04.880]   My pick of the week is something cool, but kind of odd
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:09.040]   Uh, I was on ollie express a few weeks ago
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:14.240]   And I saw exactly how cheap you could have like really huge
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:18.960]   Photo prints on canvas made and it back up a little bit. Oh, I like that
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:24.000]   So this is this print is full color off of like a really professional
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.960]   I don't know whether it's a cannon or an epsens epsen printer. Uh, it is a print that's about
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:32.400]   Uh, like a meter wide by two feet high
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:35.920]   Uh, and it costs all of 16 dollars. Wow
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:41.920]   And 16 16 bucks is printed on canvas. This was just an image like I happened to have
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:47.920]   This is basically this is based on a jpeg as a matter of fact that I just downloaded off of flicker that I
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:53.600]   For my flicker library. Um, it was so cheap for such a big print. I I have been looking at
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:57.920]   Different ways to get like really really big prints made for a long long time
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:02.480]   Uh, if you buy from like local like united states companies, it's so
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:06.400]   Expensive that it's just not worth the costs or from it for me
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:10.480]   Uh, and when I saw 16 bucks, I said this is probably going to be terrible
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:14.640]   As as probably can take like three months and but for 16 dollars
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:19.680]   I'll very at the very least i'll be able to get a column out of it or a pick of the week out of it
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:23.360]   It's actually really really very good. I'm going to try I'm going to try this again
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:26.800]   Uh, as a matter of fact, uh, now I'm not i'm not
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:31.280]   I'm just recommending go to all the express and search for canvas photo print
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:35.600]   Uh, because I can't say that after what after experiment with one company of this companies
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.680]   Oh, they're the best you should absolutely do it
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:43.920]   Also because different companies have different print sizes maximum available also different treatments you can have it
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:48.880]   Uh, this is just raw canvas. I'll buy i'll build a stretcher for and i'll hang
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:53.360]   Hang somewhere in my in my house, but you can also have it like already on a stretcher
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:59.280]   You can have it on like two on two horizontal bars. You can sort of roll it up like a scroll and it will lay flat
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:02.000]   Uh, and it's I ordered it
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.520]   I ordered it on like a monday and by tuesday night
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.640]   I got I got a a notification that it had been printed and was it was ready to ship out
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:16.720]   And about two weeks later two and a half weeks later it arrived with full tracking and like I said for 16 bucks
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:21.440]   It's gonna it's it's almost cheap enough that you can use it for pranks
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:24.560]   Like find it a really embarrassing photo of somebody
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:32.320]   And make it like eight feet by six feet and just leave it on the side of their house overnight when they're coming back from vacation
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:35.680]   So their most embarrassing instagram is right there for all the neighbors to see
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:42.640]   Uh, so i'll i definitely recommend people try it out. Like I said for just two three weeks for next to nothing
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:46.160]   Uh, it's a really good deal. I will i will say that it's also
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:51.440]   Uh inspired me to engage in a couple of art thefts that have already happened
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:56.720]   Uh like i've been to i've been to uh a museum of the boston area
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:59.120]   uh taken
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:03.840]   Taken pictures with my camera my good camera with a good zoom lens
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:12.560]   Like taken about 40 zoom high detail pictures of each one stitched them together into like a 16 megapixel
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:15.280]   Uh 16 megapixel 16
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:21.600]   Thousand pixel by like 8 000 pixel photoshop and with the intent full intent of having a full size
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:29.360]   Highly detailed copy of this artwork on my wall and that's the sort of boston you can get away with when canvas prints are available this cheap
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.520]   Uh, I do notice so did yours come from china?
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:37.120]   Shiped all the way from china. So I do notice that
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:42.560]   The ones i've clicked on almost all of them say uh estimated delivery time 42 days
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:46.080]   That's all that's just like so they don't get in trouble right it didn't take that
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:49.040]   Yeah, my mind said something like four to six weeks
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.120]   I was expecting to wait that long but again
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:57.040]   24 hours later it was it was printed and in a reasonable amount of time for something to be shipped from china
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:01.520]   I've bought i've bought things from china before and it's about just two or three weeks
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:06.800]   So yeah, my actually my male lady is starting to get suspicious because I get so much stuff from china
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:14.080]   But uh, and I just I got tea from japanets really at this point. It's so easy to ship stuff globally
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:16.000]   Yeah
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:22.720]   Especially when you get like when you're about to buy like neo pixels like for for an arduino project or or a raspberry pi project
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:29.600]   And you see how much they cost like locally then realize that for the amount I was about to spend for 10 like rgb super bright like
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:34.640]   Program addressable pixels. I could get literally a bag of 500
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:38.400]   If i'm willing to wait three weeks to get from china and i'm like, oh
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:42.640]   I know it's it while it was built there anyway
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:47.200]   It's not as though like i'm taking jobs away from neo pixel manufacturers here in the united states of america
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:54.240]   I'd be careful about buying chinese condoms though. Uh, apparently that's the featured fabulous. Uh, no
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:58.960]   A l i s p r e s s dot com
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:28:59.760]   Yeah
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:04.400]   I'll i'll i'll say i'll say one final thing if you're about to like buy something
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:10.640]   That it's it's often a good idea like if you're going on kickstarter or on ebay or something and say wow
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:15.280]   That's a really good deal for an ipad standard. Wow what an innovative idea for keyboards
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:22.080]   I'm just going to go on to aliexpress and do a google search for that sort of thing and oh this kickstarter that they're charging
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:26.640]   $45 for is actually $50 per per book of 20
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:32.960]   Directly from a chinese manufacturer's thing it's an it's an interesting resource because there it is direct
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:37.280]   All this stuff is is practically directly from the manufacturer themselves you can buy
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:42.080]   I'm tempted to get the oscar statue every time i'm on aliexpress i'm like
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:48.720]   One of the chances it's a perfect as it's as photographed. It's a perfect replica of the oscar statue at
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:55.440]   Versus what are the chances that it's too small or it's actually that little dude holding like a laurel branch
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:58.160]   That's clearly not the oscar statue at but it's like
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:01.840]   I would love to have an oscar and then she'll be like an urn one on my merits
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:06.080]   Renee richy pick of the week
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:11.440]   So i've got two quick picks this week one is i don't know if we actually said it on the show or not
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:18.320]   But amazon is buying euro and some people love that because they assume euro plus is going to just get melted right into amazon
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:24.000]   Prime and they'll get twice the service for the same amount of money other people don't want a router
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.360]   That's owned by any big internet company be a google or amazon
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:32.880]   And they're sort of you know, either they're they're looking for something else or they're changing their view
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:37.440]   And they've been asking i think overnight over and over again what else people can get
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.920]   And one thing people might not be aware of is the big one of the big cells for euro is that it was
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:44.880]   created by apple engineers, but
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:50.960]   uh, ubiquity which makes amplify for the home ubiquity for the office was also created by one of apple's very first internet
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:53.600]   Architects and he had this vision for sort of mesh
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:58.320]   Wireless and for systems way beyond that that apple just wasn't interested at the time
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:04.000]   So he left and he made ubiquity so if you're not up with google a few amazon gives you any hesitation whatsoever
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:09.200]   Ubiquity is a really good thing to look at um and the second one is
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:13.040]   So I just lost my place there for a second key con
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:16.800]   Yeah, uh key con and this was this is entirely for andy
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:22.160]   So this is a kickstarter and what it does is it brings you the thinness of an apple keyboard
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:25.600]   But with actual like i don't know if they're cherry or not
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:29.200]   I think they might be but actual clickety clackety mechanical
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:35.040]   Switches for you to tactily enjoy while you're typing on it and I just saw it and I immediately thought of andy
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:37.200]   And I thought I had to bring it up on the show
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:40.240]   I'm not aliexpress to see if it's actually
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:44.400]   You're good. I don't I don't see it. Nice. It's
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:47.520]   key cron and uh
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:50.960]   K-e-y-c-h-r-o-n.com
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:54.080]   Yeah, and it looks badass. I mean it looks like a really cool keyboard
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:59.360]   Yeah, well because they stick up above the the back. That's kind of cool. Yeah, they have this thing called travel
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.600]   That I hear some of you like travel. What is that?
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:07.600]   Alex lindsey pick of the week and by the way, we use the amplifier at the house and it's it's quite nice
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:10.480]   Yeah, that's what's what I cover my my whole house with and uh
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:15.120]   What's what's great is being able to set up all the guest codes and everything else so that you it's very easy to just kind of set
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:17.120]   Things up so many people come in you're not giving them your password
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.600]   You're just giving them the guest password and this week
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:25.200]   uh, we talked on security now about security of vulnerabilities in the ubiquity
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:31.680]   Firmware so something could be aware of it updates a lot
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:34.320]   Yeah, and that's a that's actually it's good
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:39.120]   And it does ask it does ask just you just look over it sitting right next to my mac and so the little the little head unit
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:43.200]   Since next time I just glance over and I'm like am I ready to give up my internet for about five minutes?
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:48.320]   And I just push the button on the front and it just it just updates, you know, so it's it is nice that it's so easy to update
[01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:54.320]   Um, so just turn off uh point. I think it's port broadcasting. It's about half a million ubiquity devices
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:56.800]   our uh
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:02.880]   Subject to this and I listen to steve but I I seem to remember if you uh disable
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:05.600]   uh the broadcast ports
[01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:08.640]   Or there's no reason why you should have
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:10.000]   uh
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.280]   UDP
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:12.320]   ports
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:15.840]   1,000 10,000 1 to 48,500 open
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.160]   so
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:21.360]   Anyway, something to be or I guess that's the number of you devices a bit
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:25.200]   They also make they also make great antennas that go like 10 miles just in case you're wondering
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:30.880]   I haven't yeah, we use those two we you know ubiquity is great. We used them for a long time here the enterprise stuff
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:38.000]   I think we're using ruckus right now, but those enterprise networks are fantastic. Yeah, so ubiquity has yet to patch this device
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.800]   Uh, this issue with some of its devices
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:44.160]   mass exploitation attacks were first spotted last week
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.920]   um
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:53.120]   It's uh threat actors use a service running on port 10,000 1 on ubiquity devices to carry out weak d-doss amplification attacks
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:59.120]   So basically you should just go to a shields up make sure port 10,000 once not open. There you go
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:04.560]   I think that thanks leo. I didn't I heard that one. Yeah, you know, you gotta keep up on this stuff all the time
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:08.560]   Yeah, but we have and i'm sure ubiquity will patch it, but that's a significant we do have steve
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:11.600]   Yeah, we do have steed goodness for steve everybody listens to steve
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:14.160]   So all right now. It's your turn mr
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:20.400]   Alex lindsey, so i've been getting back into coding and uh and getting my kids into coding and and uh, you know
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:24.720]   They're nine and 11. It's about the time I started coding so so I feel like so much fun
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:29.200]   And uh, and i was just looking for some good videos that that are easy to follow and uh, you know
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:35.200]   But I actually like course load that you can kind of work through and I found um code with chris on
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.200]   on youtube
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:43.520]   And it's there's something about how he's put it put together the the curriculum that I think is just just really works well
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:49.840]   So uh, it's it's both it's a mixture of being personal but also being to the point, you know, I get I think I get a little
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:55.280]   I have a little ad so I need to move quickly and I admit that I still watch the videos at two x
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:35:00.720]   Um, but uh, but it really takes you through. Okay. We're going to show you how to build something basic
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:05.040]   Then you're going to build something with a database then you can build something that needs a design and so so those
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:08.080]   You know you kind of work through these courses and they're iOS apps
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:13.280]   It's it's how like you can basically learn how to program swift from nice because i'm interested in just swift
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.680]   I'm not interested in trying to figure out anything else and so I just want to learn
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:19.440]   That's the part that i'm trying to learn right now is I just want to just learn swift
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:26.400]   and uh, and so this will let you if you are interested it's relatively inexpensive. I think it's a couple hundred dollars and um
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:28.880]   uh
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:32.720]   Relatively inexpensive and if you're trying to figure out how you're going to get off the ground
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:39.840]   Uh, and uh and build something and in a month be able to actually because I think that's the hardest part is getting over the hump of I just
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:44.800]   Don't understand how to compile an x code. I don't understand how to do the basic building
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:49.040]   Then after that there's lots of resources that you can go through but getting over that that initial hump
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:51.360]   I think is really important and I've been researching this a lot and
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:55.680]   This is these are the best set of videos that I've that I've found um so far
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:58.880]   And again, I you can see a bunch of them for free on youtube
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:03.840]   So you don't have to buy anything and tell you you know on youtube you can search for code for crit code with chris
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:08.560]   You can watch a bunch of his videos, but the course the courses are even are even better. Nice
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:14.720]   Very cool. I know we all want to write apps. We all have ideas. I'm looking for a de bellas first iOS apps
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.400]   That'll be fun. Well, she's really in the photography. So I actually I'm working on
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:21.040]   Teaching her how to build her own photo app
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:26.160]   You know just simple one that she has the buttons and she can kind of put it together because it's something that that she
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:32.160]   She'll figure out what she wants to do from there and you know, I think malachial probably build a game. This is cool
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:35.520]   Very impressive
