[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly Andy and Aco Renee Rich here.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.120]   We're going to still talk, yes, we can't stop, about the Mac Book Pro.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.400]   Really interesting theory from Horace DidYou at his sim code about why they'll never be
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.960]   a touchscreen Mac OS.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.440]   We'll dig that in, dig that apart, find out why the AirPods aren't shipping maybe until
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.440]   next year.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.600]   And we've got some great picks of the week too.

[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.640]   is here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.520]   He's wearing his Sathulu Burei or something.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.520]   What is this?
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.360]   Yes, this is my...
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.720]   There's a cat company in Poland and I keep buying more of their hats because they're
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.720]   really cool.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.400]   Well, this is like a novelty one.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.080]   This is like an actual bull one that I wear.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.640]   It's like the warmest hat that I actually own.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.800]   So I originally bought it because it wasn't that expensive and looks kind of cool.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.200]   You can get them in actual real person sizes.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.640]   And then like the first super cold day of last winter, I just wore it just out of necessity.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.280]   Oh my God, I'm so warm and I can actually fold it and put it someplace.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.280]   And so...
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.280]   They're handy.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.280]   They're...
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.280]   They're nice.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.520]   Also, I'm now old enough that I'm not quite old enough for the old person sitting by the
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.320]   bench reading a beige newspaper as the Arnold Bully Vardier.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.400]   But I'm getting there and I can sort of pull this off.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   You can pull it off.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   Absolutely.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.640]   Or I can see you drinking absent in a cafe.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.120]   Maybe having some paella.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.600]   Playing the part of the Arnold Bully Vardier.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.720]   I came across that phrase in a book like when I was a teenager.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.200]   Like, "That's my career goal.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.920]   I want to play the part of the Arnold Bully Vardier."
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.920]   No, that was...
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.920]   Pini Woodhouse, Pini Woodhouse.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.120]   If you could just say it, it's good.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.160]   And also with this, he is far from a Bully Vardier.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.600]   But he is in a French Francophone land from Montreal, Canada.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.600]   Renee Ritchie.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.480]   I'm trying so hard not to ask if Andy just joins the automator team at Apple.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480]   Oh, yes.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.120]   It's the South of Goyan hat, isn't it?
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.040]   If this can impart upon me one tenth of the fundamental saleness of South of Goyan, I
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.720]   would be wearing a stack of these to get the full amount of attention.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.720]   Renee is at imore.com or as we say at French.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.600]   And joins us every week to talk about the latest from Apple.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.880]   We're now going to be in that slow season where Apple's announced everything it's going
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.880]   to announce this year.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.880]   I hope.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.880]   Last year they went until December.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.960]   I mean, that battery case came out in December.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.480]   Well, and frankly, we are still left hanging on the AirPods.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.240]   You have had a production model for some time.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.680]   Apple announced at the same time as they announced the new laptops they announced.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.040]   Yeah, we're going to be a little bit delayed.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.960]   How delayed are we on these AirPods?
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.640]   A couple weeks in County.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.000]   I mean, they were supposed to come out in late October and we're now what are the eighth
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   or ninth of November.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.400]   Do you have an ETA of something?
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.280]   No, it's one of those things where it sounds like they're they want to when they say it's
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.360]   not quite right.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.520]   It sounds like there's something they need to fix in them and it'll just it'll go until
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.520]   that thing is fixed.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.880]   I don't think it's white iPhone four bad, but I think you know, they want to make sure
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.880]   it's a great product when it ships.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.080]   This story scares me.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.920]   This is Apple might be delayed until 2017.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.000]   Killian Bell writing this one.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Is this nine to five Mac?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   I can't remember.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Yeah, I'll talk to Mac.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.640]   I'd have to see good evidence for thinking that.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.040]   I would have to think that whatever it is would have to be a absolute show star for
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.920]   them to say that a to blow a to lose a deadline this badly and also lose holiday shopping
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.640]   because there's one thing that they were destined to to sell out of in stuff in every
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.640]   second.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.640]   It's not eight seconds.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.640]   Exactly.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.120]   It's a it's it's an expensive Bluetooth headphone, but as an item with a as a 2016 item with
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.760]   an Apple logo on it, it's dirt cheap and everybody can use it.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.720]   So yeah, everyone was going to be buying this.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.680]   So they're going to do whatever they have to do.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.680]   Blood sacrifices.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.200]   The Craig Federico will put his mortal soul in jeopardy if it involves getting these things
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.480]   of ship actually, or mom will get involved.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.960]   Renee as somebody who has these though, can you pinpoint something that's wrong with
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.960]   them?
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.400]   No, I mean, I again, I have a pre production unit that's on a special build on a review
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.360]   unit phone and it works really well for me.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.960]   There are occasional times when it doesn't take the way it should, but I'd say like maybe
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.400]   one at one out of 20, one out of 30 times.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.920]   I have problems with it, but I don't know on manufacturing end or, you know, on the
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.520]   latest versions of iOS.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.000]   There's nothing in it to me that screams show stopper.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.760]   But like we saw last year, I mean, they changed the tip on the Apple pencil last minute
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.720]   and that was ultimately delays.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.480]   We had a hard time manufacturing the keyboard, the ablated cloth on the Apple smart keyboard
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.960]   and that had delays.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.240]   I mentioned the white iPhone four because it took them a long time to get a coating that
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.000]   wouldn't discolor and also wouldn't obscure the sensors in the front of the display.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.120]   And that I think took them from, you know, that took them I think six to nine months
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.120]   to get right.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.040]   I have no sense that it's any big production problem.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.520]   So I'm hoping that we get it before the holidays.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.480]   Also, you know, they're these, these are Apple is known for not making things that tend to
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.400]   explode at airports, turning it to becoming an international crisis.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.400]   I think I think we all can respect that.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.320]   Hey, if there's something that they think is wrong, instead of no one will remember that
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.880]   it's late if it's great when it ships and doesn't cause any problems.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.880]   That's the issue.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.360]   It may just be could also be just manufacturing issues.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.360]   Could be yield.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.360]   It could be one of many things.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.520]   It could just be an issue with the way it connects to one like a few edge cases that they
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.720]   think are important enough that they have to fix.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.720]   Right.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.960]   So you really have to focus on when you're talking about why something ships and why something
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.080]   doesn't, it's really easy to make 10 copies of something or 100 copies of something or
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.160]   1000 copies of something.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.000]   If you're allowed to throw away whatever doesn't really work quite well, just like
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.880]   when I take 9000 photos and post 80, it's like it doesn't matter that I have to throw
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.120]   away 8000 in order to get to the 50 that are good.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.840]   But when you're talking about the scale that Apple's doing, the fact that they have a process
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.640]   that works really, really well, but there are, but it results in some pieces that don't
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.000]   fit together quite correctly or some wells and solders that don't really that are good,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.240]   but not that they keep failing QR.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.240]   That's one the QA.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:35.080]   That's one of the reasons why, you know, you'll see why the first generation of 4K panels
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.640]   costs and a huge amount of money because they're throwing out one in every 10.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.080]   But after two years when they get the manufacturing lockdown, suddenly you can't buy a panel.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.080]   That's 4K.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.400]   That isn't 4K because now they're not throwing out one in 10.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:57.080]   We talked a little bit on Sunday, Jason Calicanis and Peter Rojas were on Twitch about these
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:03.520]   new laptops, the MacBook Pros with the OLED touch bar and people's disappointment about
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.520]   it.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:12.760]   And I was kind of surprised that the negativity coming from Peter and Jason was essentially
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:20.120]   that Apple had lost it, that this was Apple demonstrating it did not have the innovative
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.120]   chops.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:27.080]   Here's a similar article from "Flods of all of it," the Verge, the MacBook Pro is a lie.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.720]   I think we might agree it's not a professional in the sense that it's designed to be the
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.520]   most powerful laptop possible.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.440]   But I read that and that was, I thought that was a little bit over the top.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.640]   I think that it's a MacBook Pro.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.080]   Everybody who hasn't listened hasn't heard last week's show, definitely because we, the
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.840]   four of us, have a really great conversation about it with a lot of different opinions.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.800]   I think it's a great machine for a lot of people.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.120]   It's just not a great machine for the same people that were attracted to the MacBook
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.720]   Pro in the first place.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.760]   But I certainly wouldn't say this, take this as a sign of any greater failing in Apple.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.760]   In any case, that's...
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:09.800]   I think the most you can say is Apple's made some decisions about what it thinks the
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:15.640]   Macintosh is for, who it's for, and the market's the one that wants to go after.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.560]   There you go.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.720]   I love this one.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.600]   The MacBook Pro is not the root of all evil.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.600]   That's from ZDNet.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.360]   I mean, it comes for me, at least it comes down to...
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.320]   It really is the case where you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't, because
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320]   Apple is boring.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.800]   If they just do a spec bump, they're boring.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.080]   But if they do anything else, they're not innovative.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.520]   If they do anything else, then they've lost it.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.520]   They're not appeasing to me.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.360]   And I actually think that's good.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.400]   I think that when you try something like the Touch Bar, maybe the Touch Bar will be an
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.400]   absolute failure.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.040]   We'll look back in a year from now.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.040]   Like the...
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.880]   Again, I'm going to go back to it, the iPod shuffle with no buttons on it.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.880]   But they're trying.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.040]   And that's one of the worst things that you can do when you're in a company like this
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.040]   is complacency.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:57.440]   It's bringing out the same design every year with a few more specs or fins on the tail
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.440]   or something.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.280]   And this could well end up being fins on the tail.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.840]   But it could also be something that proves to be very useful.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:09.160]   The way a pencil on an iPad Pro might be useful or the way that 3D Touch...
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.640]   Some people still really dislike 3D Touch and some people use it all the time.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.800]   And you can't say it's a slam dunk, but you can't say that it's useless either.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.040]   And I think that doing this at least shows that Apple is invested in the Mac and they're
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.120]   spending years and years with ideas.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.640]   And there's a worst idea piece you're going to get to, I think, in a few minutes that
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.240]   really nails a lot of this.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.600]   And I think that's absolutely true.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.360]   And whether this does, if you are a pro and you were hoping for a computer with 32 to
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.680]   64 gigabytes of memory, the latest Nvidia graphics cards and the highest specs money
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.680]   can buy.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.880]   Apple is basically saying we're not making that computer anymore.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.320]   And I'm assuming they have internal numbers that tells them where the highest value they
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.120]   can extract from the Mac market is.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.920]   And that might sound cold and calculating.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.200]   But it could be they ran the numbers and they said we'll sell 500 or 5,000 of these
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.960]   and we just don't want to do a separate one.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:02.000]   We forget that is it Apple's responsibility to serve every group and niche that it has
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.960]   served up to this point.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.560]   And at some point, every company may disappoint some customers.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.120]   Yeah, that's definitely true.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.360]   And again, I refer people back to last week's show for the really in depth stuff.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.000]   My difficulty when I see something like this is when they do something that seems to be
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.680]   across the entire line that gives Mac people absolutely no choice but to make this a do
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.360]   I go for with a Mac or do I go for with a Windows machine from this point forward because
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.480]   they are again, they are the only suppliers of Macintosh hardware.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.800]   So they make a decision.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.200]   But at the other side, though, however, it sounds as though I'm saying, oh goodness, they
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   have this wonderful powerful monopoly.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.800]   But then you look at the world is the world doesn't consist of just the Macintosh.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:48.440]   The world is not consist of just the United States where Apple only has the Mac only has
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:54.680]   like well under 10% of the desktop market share, which means that if they had any hope of being
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:00.080]   making computers that everybody could make a product line that would cover the entire
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.000]   excuse me, the majority of customers out there, again, not one computer that everybody can
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.240]   use but will make four computers and everybody will find a choice among the four of them.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.520]   They really don't have the ability to sell 90% of the computers that are out there.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.440]   So if they decide as I wish, I'm sorry that I didn't jot it down.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:22.400]   But in the discussion on Twitter, I had with some people, someone made the suggestion that
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:27.240]   the MacBook Pro has maybe they've decided they're going to make the best enterprise laptop
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.160]   mean not necessarily something that you would give to a video editor that's doing multiple
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.240]   4K streams.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.600]   But when you give something that a company will buy 500 copies of because all their executives,
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.600]   they don't want the MacBook Air.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.360]   They want they they're telling their purpose.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.880]   Oh, no, no, I need the most I need the really powerful thing for opening my Google Docs
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.880]   and checking my email.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.900]   And they they want something that's sexy on that when they put it on to the conference
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.080]   table and open it up.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.840]   And if Apple has run the numbers and decide that not not that this is the future of all
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:02.520]   computing, but if there is a world in 2020 in which Apple can still be competitive make
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.500]   a lot of money in the laptop business, it's going to be with a machine like this and not
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.840]   with a machine that's like the 2015 MacBook Pro.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.920]   So that's something that they're they're they're they're they're they're company.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.680]   You can almost say that they're miss their soul mistake was to put the word pro in the
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.680]   name.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.560]   Yeah, I think I think that they call this if they call this an extension of the MacBook
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.840]   airline, then conceptually, I don't think anybody would have a problem with it.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.240]   I think we think, Oh my God, is it wonderful?
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.040]   They made this this incredibly thin and light machine, but that's forever and sakes.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.560]   It's almost as good as my MacBook Pro.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.280]   As a matter of fact, I'm thinking about not buying a MacBook Pro and buying a MacBook
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.280]   Air.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.280]   This thing is so popular.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.480]   But again, there are a lot of people when you get to the pro level, there are lots of
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.320]   different reasons why people want something with the pro label on it.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.560]   I will give you a personal example of I keep talking about how much I love my Olympus
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.560]   OMD EM one.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:55.760]   And it is what has Olympus decided this Olympus is pro level camera.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.680]   And for pro does it mean that it's has the fastest focusing and can shoot 80 frames per
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.120]   second of raw.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.160]   Actually for me, it's the fact that when I dropped it on the pavement in New York City
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.720]   a couple of weeks ago, I didn't even really think, Oh my God, is it broken?
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.000]   It's like, okay, well, I guess I should secure that better the next time because it's built
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.160]   so well that I knew that nothing bad had happened to it.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.600]   And that's why I was spending the extra money for something like this.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.160]   So but but there'll be people who are, Hey, I'm a sports photographer.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.840]   I don't care that it's I'm going to take care of my equipment.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.760]   I want something that will go really, really fast.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.800]   I want something that will that will have a really good focus tracking.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.120]   So when you get to the pro level, there are so many definitions of it that it's hard
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:38.440]   to make a really narrow choice in what you're going to build without pissing off a lot of
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.080]   people and sending a lot of people to your competitors.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.920]   So I don't like it.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.840]   I think I think the problem also is that if they call these anything other than the MacBook
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.680]   Pro, all we'd hear for the next six months is where's the Mac Pro.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.680]   Right.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.560]   And they want to tell people that that there's no other laptop coming from that.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.080]   That's it.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.000]   People are still saying where's the Mac Pro?
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.160]   And now it's with hate and not that was with hate and not longing.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.320]   Part of the problem is that we're still working in a vacuum.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.640]   We don't have them yet.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:12.120]   And so I can't, and maybe you guys can, but I can't tell you if I like the keyboard or
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.120]   not.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.480]   I'm worried, as is Andy, I know about the keyboard looking too much like the MacBook's
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.480]   keyboard.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.720]   We don't know how good the OLED touch bar is.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.760]   We won't even know that for a while.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.440]   We have to use it for a while to really get a sense of what it can do and see what other
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.200]   apps use it and so forth.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.080]   So in a way, the jury's out on this hardware.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:35.160]   All we can look at is the specs and say, and the dongles required and so forth and say,
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.520]   well, I would like an SD card slot.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.560]   I missed the mag safe adapter.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.920]   I'd like to see better graphics.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.320]   I'd like to see a faster CPU, et cetera.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.600]   I'd like to see touch, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.160]   And that's just, you know, that's opinion.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:55.080]   The sad thing is you can't go somewhere else and get a Mac OS computer that fits your specs.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.080]   This is it.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.400]   You get there's a huge Hackintosh community.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.600]   As a matter of fact, used to have before the iPad, I had a Hackintosh network that ran,
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.680]   I think Mac OS 10.4, 10.6.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.560]   When this happened, I went out and looked at the Hackintosh stuff and they've really
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.120]   kept it up to date, haven't they?
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.920]   I mean, it's definitely something you can't expect a consumer experience.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.720]   You can't expect that when there is something will, if something breaks or a piece of software
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.000]   for some reason doesn't work or suddenly hardware acceleration doesn't work anymore.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.640]   It's not, hey, let's listen to a podcast about what to do about it.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:31.240]   I'm more is not going to have a document on how to fix your, how to fix a video acceleration.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.240]   But it's an option.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:38.640]   I tend to think though that if you look into building your own Macintosh compatible, you
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.360]   should also look into switching to Windows because you might have a better experience.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.360]   You might not.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.240]   Well, we should also point out that this is illegal.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.000]   This is a use of the Macintosh.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.280]   It's a free Macintosh operating system that Apple does not, does not, you know, I mean,
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.280]   that's, it's unethical.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.280]   It's unethical.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.280]   It's unethical.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.760]   You have to decide if it's unethical or not.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.760]   I mean, I'm going to say it's unethical because Apple puts a lot of money in everything.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:05.960]   I'm saying that it says the way we subsidize this is by hardware and you're saying, well,
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.960]   I'm not going to buy your hardware.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.840]   I'm going to, I'm going to basically steal Mac OS is theft.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:15.200]   Well, if the feds, if the feds broke break in your house to arrest you for your illegal
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.600]   grow operation, the basement and they see a hack and toss will say, okay, great.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.320]   Plus another two weeks in jail for this.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.720]   Nothing's going to happen to you.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:26.720]   Obviously, shall we take a look at your collection or are we, are we, you know, no, obviously
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.200]   there's no RIA or MP on Apple side.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:35.480]   Well, that's, that's why I use the word ethical because it's, it's, it's stealing.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.480]   It's stealing.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.720]   I'm not that I wouldn't do it, but it's stealing the operating system.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.120]   I, I feel like I could do it because I give Apple a ton of money and buy a ton of hardware
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.120]   every year.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.200]   So having an extra PC and I, by the way, I don't do it because it's a pain in the butt,
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.320]   but having an extra, you have a perfectly good Mac locked in the closet and the copy
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.120]   of OS 10 that's supposed to be running on that is now running on that.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.720]   If you did that, then I would say, oh, that's not unethical at all.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.720]   That's because you want different hardware.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.760]   Well, that's how I used to justify a back, but back before there was comicsology and back
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.440]   before there was Marvel.com.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.440]   I would decide that, look, I have a copy of John Burns entire run of Fantastic Four, not
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.400]   only in the original pulp, but I also have them in trade paperbacks.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.840]   If I download these digital copies illegally, I've already paid Marvel twice for this.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.520]   I'm just saving myself scanning time and electricity.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.160]   I'm saving Marvel the trouble of starting a digital business, which it clearly has no
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.160]   interest in.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.240]   Is there a chance though, isn't there a chance that we're being premature that Apple will
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:35.440]   early next year say, oh, and by the way, here's the new Mac Pro, fully expandable with a
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:41.720]   huge variety of graphics cards and RAM configurations.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.200]   There's a chance that Apple could next spring say, we've heard you loud and clear.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.640]   We've heard our customers, you love your high-end laptops, and we decided we're going
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.680]   to add just one more on top of you.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.440]   Here's a new 15-inch with 32 gigabytes of memory.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.400]   There is a chance also of Apple.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.480]   There's an indicator that they may be doing that because they dropped the cost of dongles
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.080]   by 50% through the end of the year.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.120]   That's not even tacit.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.840]   That's an explicit acknowledgment that people are unhappy about the dongles.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:14.040]   It didn't give the Steve Jobs bumper a fine, here's your dongles.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.840]   Aren't we being a little bit, I mean, Carsten made a good point.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:25.360]   He posted a picture of his 2014 MacBook, which is running a bunch of dongles, right?
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.040]   Dongles are a way of life for most.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.560]   I have card readers.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.320]   I have a variety of different dongles.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.480]   This is Carsten's MacBook, and he has a variety of things attached.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.480]   Time to look like that for a long time.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.080]   I mean, aren't we being a little silly?
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.000]   We've had this situation.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.240]   That's kind of the way it is with computers.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.600]   Well, it comes down to first, take away a dongle.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.400]   You take away one port, and I'm going to have one dongle.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:58.040]   Now you wind up with the MacBook Pro, where again, you're getting $2,000 out of me.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.200]   Two grand, you're getting out of me.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:06.040]   And at least for the immediate foreseeable future, it don't do Jack if you do not have
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.640]   a box, not just like, here's a keyboard.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.440]   Here's a physical keyboard.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.440]   Can't plug it in.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.840]   Here is my hard drive.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.840]   Can't plug it in.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.520]   Here is my monitor.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.520]   Can't plug it in.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.520]   Can't do anything with it.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.520]   Unless the biggest one.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.240]   The biggest one to me is you can't connect the new iPhone.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:29.720]   I mean, you make a device, you know, contemporaneously with your new laptops and your new laptops
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.840]   don't have the port that you'd use to connect it.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.200]   And there's no dongle in the box the way there is on the iPhone.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.280]   One thing that cracked me up, I don't know if you guys saw this, but John Gruber linked
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:42.480]   to commentary on the 13 inch MacBook Pro, where this is a forum post from MacGroomers
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.040]   where it says, well, I'm sure it's going to be attacked for this, but it's got a tiny
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.720]   hard drive, barely enough RAM, not upgradable, no dedicated graphics, only dual core processors.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.520]   It certainly isn't bad, but Apple just took the Pro out of the 13 inch line and come on,
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.280]   it's freaking expensive.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.120]   And then Gruber says at the bottom, this isn't a new comment.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.120]   This was posted four years ago.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.600]   It was sponsored last major MacBook Pro redesign.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.440]   Well, I don't think it makes it all right necessarily that they've done this.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.640]   No, it's like, yeah, you know, we once.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.560]   Yeah, but we are squeezing wheels, aren't we?
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.560]   Well, so long as you know, it's, you can say that as old people always complain, you
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.400]   can say that, yeah, Apple has a problem here.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.120]   They always every four years.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.480]   I'm having, there's something that might be able to show not next week of the week after.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.520]   I am actually building a computer.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.440]   And this is one where this isn't in response to the MacBook.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.840]   This is something that I've had an idea for for the for several months.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.880]   I thought it'd be just a fun project and maybe have something interesting to play with afterward.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.640]   And it's interesting once you get down to, no, there will be nothing in this hardware
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.000]   that I don't want to be there.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.560]   And whatever goes in here is exactly what I want it to be and how it works.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.720]   And the first time I have it, I had it working over the weekend finally in his final like
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.600]   not put together into a box configuration.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.120]   So basically on my drafting table over here, just like all the components and all the circuits
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.680]   wired together and it works.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:03.720]   And even in this horrible, you know, exploded R2D2 version of it, it's like, my God, this
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.480]   hasn't, this doesn't have anywhere near the power of my MacBook.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:11.960]   But look at this, when I travel with this, I don't have to travel with anything but this.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.480]   I can plug things into it and I can have networking plugged into it.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:23.120]   And my goodness, it's like, it's like, you know, it's not an epiphany, but it's like,
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:28.280]   I forgot what it was like to have a computer that you don't need any dongles for.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:33.120]   And it's sort of you realize that you had your will broken, not just by Apple, but by
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.960]   makers of Windows machines because Lord knows that when you have a, you have to, it's not
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.920]   easy to find a Windows laptop that will also have all the ports you want to have on it.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.560]   But certainly, again, it's, there are a lot of different reasons why people are willing
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.720]   to spend $2,000 for a laptop as opposed to $1,000.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.560]   One of them is the power comes in convenience.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.640]   And again, the idea of how many things are to carry with me in order to make it.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.040]   It's like they took three millimeters off of the box, but how much weight and bulk do
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.560]   you have to add into your laptop bag just so that you can plug it into power and plug
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.400]   it into a network and good sales.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:13.200]   According to Apple, it'd been pretty brisk though for this new laptop, right?
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.600]   Yeah, it's hard to, it's hard to parse those because one, there's pent up demand for a MacBook
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.600]   Pro.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.440]   Two, the market for MacBook Pro might be much bigger than the market was traditionally.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:28.240]   And three, you have this online, Apple said in their online stores and that's, you know,
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.680]   that's the type of customer who might be bombarding Apple exactly to get it, you know, as fast
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.680]   as humanly possible.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.560]   So what Apple said was it was, and I, you know, they're very candid about this kind of stuff.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.360]   It was the fastest selling product they've had, the fastest selling pro notebook because
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.040]   it includes things before the MacBook Pro existed that they've ever seen in their online
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.040]   stores.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.080]   And I think that's probably perfectly legitimate.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.160]   We will, we'll find out soon.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:54.800]   The last I've heard were thinking a week from today, they'll start appearing in stores November
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.800]   15th.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.440]   The Apple's not saying, but that seems to be kind of a consensus.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.320]   The one without the touch bars already in stores.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.320]   I fell for that this morning.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.040]   I went to the store saying, because I check every morning.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.520]   Maybe if I can go to run to the store and get one because I'd love to have it for the
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.520]   show.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.960]   I've been using it for the last two weeks.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:11.960]   I'm very happy.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.960]   I'm the OLED one, less one.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.080]   I, so I like the, I just, I want the touch bar just because it's new and shiny and want
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.080]   to play with it.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.480]   But if in a world where it didn't exist, I really like this machine.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.160]   It is to me more of a MacBook Air upgrade because it's like a retina version of the
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.160]   Maxx pair.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.160]   Yes.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:33.560]   $500 more expensive baseline for this version than baseline for the 13 inch MacBook Air.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.400]   But you know, I'm getting really fast.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.000]   It's all PC laptops worth.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.840]   Yeah, but it's Apple money.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.960]   I'm getting the retina.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.360]   I'm getting a P3 retina display.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.640]   And for some people, they could care less about that, but I really have learned to appreciate
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.640]   those.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.680]   The SSD speeds are ludicrous.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.680]   They are beyond ludicrous.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.160]   What Apple's managed to do with that.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.640]   And I read right a lot from those drives.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.480]   So that's, that's great for me.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.800]   And I hate to say this because like with the MacBook, I was going back and forth to my
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.080]   traditional 13 inch MacBook Pro and I never sort of settled on every, on any keyboard.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.320]   And I've just been using this for the last week and a half.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.480]   And I'm really enjoying it.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.400]   It feels like punchy to me at this point.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.640]   And when I did go back to type something on a VPN that didn't have access to, I was
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.680]   like, ah, this is all kind of jiggly and, and, and, and what do you do?
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.760]   And then went back to this one and I'm enjoying it.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.800]   So the brain has a remarkable way of changing its mind on you very quickly.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:25.520]   But and also, and also make sure that you take advantage of Apple's two week return
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.520]   policy.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.760]   So you can buy it with the intention that again, have that, have multiple alerts on your
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.760]   phone.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.160]   And if after two weeks, you're still thinking, I hope I get used to it.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.640]   Don't just take it back.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.360]   Take, get, get your money back on it.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.080]   The, the, the only reaction that I think is offensive regarding the keyboard is people
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.880]   who are dismissing people like me by saying, oh, you're just not used to it yet.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.120]   Or, oh, no, you just, because you, you're, your first keyboard was on an Apple too.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.360]   It's like, no, it's because I like the keyboard that I like.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.200]   And I'm not saying that you're stupid for not, for liking this keyboard, I'm saying
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.560]   that I wish that I had the ability to buy a Mac portable that had a keyboard that was
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.560]   not this.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.560]   It's okay.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.640]   And we should point out that you are a writer.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.920]   So this is your primary tool typing.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.920]   Go ahead, Renee.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:09.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.720]   I was going to say, I, I cannot use the big clickety-clackety keyboards.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.080]   I have many friends who swear by them who immediately go and buy every form of Dasky.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.320]   Like they're searching for the perfect switch.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.040]   I just, I just can't use them, but, but no, I don't at all disagree with them loving those
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.960]   keyboards is a very personal thing.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.520]   I'd like something in, but I have a desk keyboard at home.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.400]   That's my main keyboard on my iMac.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.120]   And I would like, and I have a MacBook and I've tried for a year to get used to it.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.000]   There was nothing wrong with, this is a 2012 MacBook Pro.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.240]   Nothing wrong with a 2012 MacBook Pro keyboard has the right amount of travel.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.240]   It's mushy.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.880]   It's not a clickety, but it, but it does the job.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.880]   I think quite well.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.040]   I would pay for stickers.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.880]   Let's just, and it's wonderful when you put the comic book stickers on it.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.880]   You really can't see what the hell you're doing.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.120]   By the way, that's an issue with the, the OLED.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.840]   Well, I'll tell you what, let's take a break and when we come back, we will talk about
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:06.680]   or as a, that he is, I think quite astute article in, at a Simco, in which he explains
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.720]   why he believes in that Apple will never do a touchscreen Macintosh.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.160]   You can just forget that.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.760]   And I would like to talk a little bit about the, but the issues raised by the, the touch
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.480]   bar.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.120]   If you're a touch typist, you know where all the keys are on your keyboard, including
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.320]   the function keys, take it away and put a touch bar there.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.520]   You don't know.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.920]   You have to look.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.520]   And I think that is a significant check.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.440]   Again, this is all in a vacuum, not having used it.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.320]   But I think that's a significant change in how we use our, our keyboards.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.920]   And I, I'm not sure for the better, but until I get one, I can't tell you.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:41.920]   Let's take a break though.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.800]   Renee Richie is here from imore.com Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:51.080]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from quick in loans.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:56.360]   Rocket Mortgage is a product created by quick in loans specifically for you guys.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:02.040]   People who like to live online who don't, you know, there are still people, lots of them,
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:08.040]   I think, who would like to go to a mortgage broker or a mortgage lender and see them face
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:13.800]   to face who like the physicality of bringing in all the paperwork, the stacks of paperwork
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.680]   and the looking through the loan possibilities.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.480]   And that's just for them, that's something they like to do.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.840]   Not so much for me.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:28.040]   If I'm going to get a loan to buy a new house or refine my existing house, I want to get
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.040]   it over with.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.040]   I want it to be a minimal amount of paperwork.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.680]   In fact, if I could do it all online, I would.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.520]   Well, now you can.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.840]   Thanks to Rocket Mortgage.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:41.480]   Rocket Mortgage takes the mortgage process into the 21st century with a completely online
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.480]   solution.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.080]   It's fast, it's powerful.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.240]   And because it's from quick in loans, you know, it's a great solution.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.480]   I love this little movie they have here, the young couple looking at a house, deciding
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.000]   they want it.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.480]   And literally without leaving the open house, filling out the very quick form, submitting
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:06.080]   pay stubs and the bank statements online and getting approved before they leave and
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.280]   showing the realtor and saying, "Yep, I think we'll take this one."
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:13.720]   And by the way, you're getting approved not only quickly, but for a custom solution that's
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.720]   tailored just for you.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.000]   And boom, you got it.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.960]   Rocket Mortgage on your phone, on your tablet, you don't even have to get up from the couch
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:21.960]   if you don't want to.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:27.240]   I want you to check it out at quickinloans.com/macbreakrocketmortgage as an equal housing
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:34.320]   lender, licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org number 30, 30.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:40.760]   Quickinloans.com/macbreak for Rocket Mortgage and we thank them so much for their support
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.760]   at MacBreakWiggly.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:46.760]   We're really pleased to say they're coming back next year as a sponsor.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:52.560]   And so if you, I know that a lot of you like to support our sponsors, but you may not be
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.120]   hunting for a house right now, just keep in mind.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:04.160]   Maybe when you refi next year, keep in mind quickinloans.com/macbreak.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.840]   So do you have a hackintosh right now, Andy?
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.880]   I have one, but I haven't really fired it up in a long, long time.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.440]   I see you make one with OS 10 Sierra.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:19.840]   I mean, it's, yeah, because there's, remember that every single step in the hackintosh process
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.920]   starts, I think, with somebody finding a security vulnerability that allows them to install,
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.160]   to do stuff to Mac OS.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:35.120]   I was using a Dell really cool, I think it was like a nine-inch netbook before the iPad
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.120]   came out.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.360]   And that was a daily driver and I really, really liked it.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:44.960]   And I was really surprised with how well Mac OS 10.4, 10.6 ran on this tiny, like core
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:50.400]   and maybe not even a core processor, but it had a really tiny, tiny mobile processor
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.880]   for those designed for Windows and netbooks.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.720]   And it was running just fine.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:59.840]   I have, I have, I have one repurposed old, I think it's an old Lenovo that I wasn't using
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:04.560]   just for experimental purposes, but why hackintosh something when you already have a Macintosh?
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.760]   Yeah, there's a lot of people who, there are a lot of people building these things
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.840]   because they feel as though they need the RAM, they need the graphics accelerator and they
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.240]   can't get it from Apple, so they're going to have to build it themselves.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.680]   You know, buy a Mac.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:21.880]   You do need access to a Mac to do the hackintosh because you need to get the operating system
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.880]   from the Mac.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.720]   It's not an easy process, but it can be done.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.240]   It's gotten easier, thanks.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:31.520]   There's tools like Unibese and multi-beast that make it much, much easier, closer.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.360]   It's a rich, rich community, you know.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:38.320]   It's clearly a community, and it's interesting because has Apple made any statement about
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.320]   hackintosh's at all?
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.800]   They sued size star who was actually selling them, but I don't think they've done anything
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.800]   about how they did.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.400]   That's a little blatant if you sell it.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.040]   Before they, yeah, they didn't even really get off the ground before they said, "Yeah,
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.880]   you're not going to do that."
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:55.240]   But I would say to anybody that one of the really cool things about Apple hardware engineering
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:00.320]   is that there's a reason why they don't really put, "Here is the GPU we have, here is the
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.320]   GPU we have."
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:06.640]   They certainly publish that, but they don't really make that the big part of the demonstration
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:14.000]   because it really is about we have this RAM working through this pipeline to this controller,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.080]   to this, this, this.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.440]   You might get performance that.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.320]   You might realize that you don't actually need the hard respects you thought you needed
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.960]   because you're still getting the performance that you wanted to get.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.720]   You really have to wait for these higher end MacBooks to get out in the wild before you
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.200]   can say definitively that this is not going to be fast enough for the work that I want
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.200]   to do.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.080]   That's the other side of this.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:38.040]   If you are a professional and you're looking for a power tool, you're also looking for
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:44.880]   reliability and relying on, well, just the name Hackintosh kind of implies something
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.440]   less than reliable.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:52.040]   I bet you very few, which is why you're hearing all these complaints, very few professionals
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.040]   really want you to ask.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.040]   You cannot take it to the Apple store.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.040]   You can take it to the Apple store.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.040]   You can show it to the Genius.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.480]   The Genius will say, "Oh, how interesting."
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.480]   Next.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.360]   Well, if you go to Hackintosh.com, there's links to everything.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.920]   But Tony Mac seems to have the best TonyMac x86.com.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:13.320]   Again, I'm not advocating it.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:18.200]   What's interesting is there's a very vibrant community that's very active right now and
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.280]   continues to be active on making these.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.280]   Let's talk about-
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.600]   Oh, there was one thing, Leo.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.600]   I thought it was interesting too.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.000]   It was Jonathan Zadarski, who was the one we talked about last week, who was taken aback
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.120]   by people not considering him a professional.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:33.600]   He got one of the new MacBooks and he decided to run VMware Fusion 2 instances, Adobe Photoshop
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:40.040]   with 41 gigabyte 36 megapixel "professional" multi-layer photos in design with a 22-page
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:46.480]   photography extensive product, Xcode, PowerPoint, Word, Mac-O-View, Mozilla Firefox, Safari,
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.480]   Preview, Hopper.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.480]   The list goes on and on.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.480]   Tweetbot, iBook, Skype.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.840]   He says, "The result, I ran out of things to do before I ran out of RAM.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.240]   I only ever made it to 14.5 gigabyte of the system.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.680]   I started paging out so I didn't even have the chance to burn up the delicious RAM."
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.680]   There you go.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.680]   All right.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.400]   When Jonathan's great, I trust his point of view on all this.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:09.720]   Yes, but can it run a web browser with more than nine tabs that are supported by advertising?
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:10.720]   That's the real time.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.440]   Not Chrome, but yes, Safari is fine.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.160]   I want to use Mac OS.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.960]   I really like Mac OS because I get a BSD under the hood.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:26.160]   I get a command line that has a bash shell or I use fish, but that's the point is I can
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.400]   use a real command line.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:35.080]   To my, I've never found a Unix tool that I can't run on OS 10.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:39.240]   I'm sorry, I keep calling OS 10 Mac OS.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:44.760]   You still, so you get all that deep power under the hood, but you also get a very polished
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:51.120]   professional operating system with a great range of applications on it.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.600]   I guess I would love to see more diversity in the hardware.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.280]   I think that's all we're really saying is let's get a more diverse hardware platform.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:02.640]   Just put a higher end machine on top of the stack.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:08.960]   I would, if the option is Windows 10, that's a tough move for me to make.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.960]   Fortunately, Linux is coming along, but without the Adobe Creative Suite on Linux, it's not
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.400]   a great viable option.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.960]   You know, what's interesting is more and more we're doing what we do.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.960]   We can do in Chrome.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.440]   We can do in the browser.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:24.560]   That's what's made Linux, desktop Linux actually viable, I think, is that you can run
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:31.200]   a modern powerful browser and run all the extensions and really do, for most people,
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.480]   almost everything that you'd want to do with this.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.480]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:42.400]   When the Raspberry Pi platform 2016 was a barn burner, it was like, they had a Chicago
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:47.280]   Cubs-type season with things, developments that really, really brought the platform forward.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:54.520]   One of them is that they released a new version of the Raspberry Focus desktop called Confucus
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.760]   easily enough Pixel on the year that Google decided to release the Pixel.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:02.920]   But one of the parts of it is that they have an official port of Google's Chromium browser
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.840]   that ships, when you install the Raspberry in an operating system on your $35 or even
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:10.120]   your $5 computer, it has the Chromium browser.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:15.520]   So it has obviously a, it's the open source version of Chrome.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:22.920]   So you have code that Google has written and optimized for doing Google apps.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.720]   And so YouTube works great.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.720]   All the Google docs work great.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.880]   Google apps work great.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:32.240]   Also all the third party apps that are certainly not going to stress a browser more than Google
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.880]   does also work great.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:38.880]   So if you find yourself spending most of your time on Google Sheets and Instagram and all
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.560]   this other stuff, you might find that this $35 computer will do a really good job for
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.560]   you.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.440]   And for people who can't buy, who have to have to rely on a $35 computer, they now have
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.880]   a machine that will do, I think, 80% of what any computer could do.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:58.320]   Not as fast, but in terms of you list of things that a computer can do for a consumer, I think
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.040]   they've got about 80% of that list covered.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:06.760]   And you know, on my desk in my office, I have been running an iMac and the iMac, as you
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.360]   might remember, I had a problem.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.880]   The boot drive failed.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:14.040]   It was actually a recall and Apple replaced it for free, even though it was a several
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.040]   years old.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:19.960]   But in the interim, I had a very powerful machine I had built for home use.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.320]   I was going to put free BSD on it.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.320]   But I brought it in.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.840]   It has a 4K large 30-inch 4K display.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.120]   It's NVMe, M.2.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.160]   It has four SSDs, very nice SSDs in it.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:42.440]   It has very fast, you know, top of the line, actually a Xion, quad-core Xion processor,
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:47.000]   and a very top of the line, third generation Xion, or fifth generation Xion.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.160]   And then there was a state of the art, as fast as I could build a PC.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:59.920]   And running Linux on that, a great graphics card, running Linux on that is faster, frankly,
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.840]   than that iMac.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.480]   And it feels much more stable.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.240]   I don't get anywhere near the issues.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.840]   It's really the lack of application software that is the biggest differentiator at this
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:11.840]   point.
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.440]   For a long time, it was looks, it was responsiveness of the mouse.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.160]   There was certain magic that Apple did.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.720]   But Linux has caught up quite a bit.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.920]   It has a really good role.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.400]   And it might be old-fashioned.
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:31.880]   Sometimes I think about how trapped that I can get in the idea of, again, growing up,
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.160]   you didn't have just one computer for you.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.040]   We were lucky the house had one computer for everybody.
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:43.640]   And so, not that I'm still living in the 80s, but there is a mindset that I have to
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:48.800]   get rid of, which is that there is such a thing as my one main use computer.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:54.280]   And when I talk about how it wouldn't be sad if I, if this were the last MacBook ever
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.960]   buy, it's possible that in two years time I will realize that even having a MacBook
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:02.400]   is not as important as having a good Mac desktop is having a Mac mini.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:07.240]   And it's possible that instead of every two or three years spending $2,000 on a MacBook,
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:13.200]   that money is better spent on a really good iOS tablet, whatever it is that year, a mediocre
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:18.800]   desktop that could run next door to the really good desktop I bought two years ago.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.480]   So really, anybody who's talking about Gloom and Doom for the Mac platform, anybody who's
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:28.840]   talking about Gloom and Doom for Apple as a species, it's really old-fashioned.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.160]   What about some combos in the chat, or just had a thought?
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.880]   I like this thought.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.680]   Microsoft sells a version of Windows 10, a system builder.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.760]   For people who are going to build systems, what if Apple started selling a system builder
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.840]   version of OS 10?
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.600]   Not cheap, maybe 200 bucks, but that would subsidize their development of OS 10 and allow
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:52.720]   people to make legitimate hackintoshes.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:58.280]   The question would be how does this help Apple to sell more hardware?
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.280]   It doesn't.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.080]   And that's the answer why.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.880]   Also, they're so controlling of the product experience, they probably wouldn't want to
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.960]   make the run hard drive, Leo.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:10.960]   They've always said the only way to make it, you know, make your hardware, software look
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.800]   great is to make the hardware too, and vice versa.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:17.600]   And by doing both, they really control the experience.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.600]   So this gets us-
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.600]   And it's got help over the support, supporting people who buy that.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.400]   It's not a business if I want to be in.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.400]   It's not a business if I want to be in.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.400]   It's not a business if I want to be in.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.400]   It's not a business if I want to be in.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.400]   It's not a business if I want to be in.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.400]   It's not a business if I want to be in.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.400]   It's not a business if I want to be in.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.400]   It's not a business if I want to be in.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.400]   It's not a business if I want to be in.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.400]   It's not a business if I want to be in.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.400]   It's not a business if I want to be in.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.400]   It's not a business if I want to be in.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:46.800]   I can summarize- It comes down to this particular graph on the mobile devices is increasing
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   dramatically.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:52.540]   And he says essentially it's clear that we're going to make a transition to touch first
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.720]   mobile tablets and phones.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:41:01.880]   And that Apple is in a unique position because the question they need to answer is as we
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:05.640]   move into this touch first universe, what is the role of the Macintosh?
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.400]   And it's clear that people still need Macintosh's.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:13.760]   And he said partly that's because the touch first system isn't mature enough yet to solve
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.280]   all the problems.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.720]   I think he believes that it will be at some point.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:23.200]   At some point in one year or five years or ten years at some point, I don't know when,
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.880]   you'll be able to do everything you want to do on an iPad or an iPhone.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.840]   You won't need a desktop computer.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:39.320]   In the PC world, because they never really had a credible mobile platform for Windows,
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.560]   they ended up hybridizing Windows, making it a touch and desktop.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.120]   And that was a nightmare for some time.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:49.400]   I think they've kind of come through on the other side with Windows 10 is actually a fairly
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.920]   good hybrid operating system.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:59.280]   So in effect, Apple suppressed its immune system, allowed a disruptor to emerge in its
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:05.960]   mist, the phone and the tablet and good for them, it's become a hugely profitable product.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:11.440]   But the donor DNA and resources came from the Macintosh.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:15.520]   He says, "The parent that sacrificed for the child."
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.960]   And he says, "That's why the Mac is not treated disparagingly at Apple.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.280]   It deserves and gets respect.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:25.080]   It's preserved but with limited responsibilities."
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:29.000]   So the question is, "Do you make the Macintosh a touch device?"
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.520]   He says, "No."
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:36.720]   He says, "The Mac's job as an indirect input device, keyboard and mouse, is to continue
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:41.960]   to provide those functionalities that the touch first devices can't provide yet."
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:46.200]   The children, quote, are still adolescent and making lots of stupid mistakes.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.720]   They're still life in the parents.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:53.280]   But they have to focus on how to make the keyboard trackpad interface better while saying and
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.800]   believing the future is touch.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.080]   And that's why we're seeing the touch pad.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.440]   And it's why he says, "You're not going to put touch on the Macintosh.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:06.040]   You're going to continue to focus resources on making touch first devices better while
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:13.680]   keeping the Mac alive until such time as the parents can basically hand it off to the children."
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.080]   He says, "It may seem that Apple is pulling punches.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:20.680]   The product could have evolved into the full touch tool screen's pen input hybrid model
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.880]   of windows, but that only makes sense if you don't have a mobile product that's promising
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.040]   the same and tearing up the world at the same time.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.720]   "You've unleashed a disruptive force," writes Deidue, "and now you're supposed to retrofit
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.360]   the incumbent with the tools to compete.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.840]   Why not just let the disruptor grow up unhindered?"
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.040]   The Mac is what it is because it's not alone.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.200]   It's part of a family.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.600]   It's apparent.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.360]   It strives to be better but will not take the future from its child.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.080]   I think that that's fairly astute.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:54.680]   And I'm willing to bet that's exactly the thinking that Apple, that's driving Apple at
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.680]   this point.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.680]   You agree?
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   Renee?
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:01.920]   Yeah, I think it depends on which side of the equation you're looking at.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:06.080]   If they were to take Mac OS, Mac OS, and they've said this before, Mac OS is just not a touch
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.760]   first operating system.
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.360]   And Apple has prototyped the bejesus out of all this stuff.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:14.320]   They have versions of Macs running touch screen, all sorts of things.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.000]   Anything we can think about, they have the money and the luxury and the time and the experimental
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.640]   resources to put behind.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.840]   And the effort it would take, even now when people say that they're ignoring the Mac,
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.480]   it's just that the iPhone is such a big product and even iPad, it's such a big product that
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:32.080]   even if they love the Mac, they deeply, truly love the Mac, they have to ship that iPhone
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.800]   and increasingly they have to ship that iPad.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:39.200]   And it would take so much time to make a touch version of Mac OS that it's probably not worth
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.200]   the effort.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.880]   And so, you're already seeing the iPad go pro and you have an iPad pro with a keyboard
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:47.520]   and with a pencil and it's doing a lot of things in a lot of ways that the Mac just
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.640]   simply can't do by virtue of the input method that it has.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.920]   So rather than sort of go through that awkward windows eight years, and I think they would
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.960]   have to go through that just like Microsoft did, or simply not ship for a long period
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.520]   of time, they're doubling down on improving iOS.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:08.760]   And eventually iOS might supplant, you know, go make 80%, 90%, 95% of people's uses and
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:12.400]   the Mac will still be there for a generation to come just for people who want to do the
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:16.040]   typing and it will get more interesting keyboard and trackpad based input methods.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:19.960]   But I think when they say they're going to keep those two product lines clear, I think
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.640]   they're absolutely genuine about that.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:24.640]   And I agree with what Renee is saying.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:32.880]   The thing is Microsoft has an incredible amount of freedom to make a hybrid operating system.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.920]   And I'm on record saying I think Windows 10 is really, really very good.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.800]   I don't think that doesn't look like something's been grafted onto something else.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.560]   It looks like they really got it.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:47.000]   When I use a Windows and desktop configuration, it feels like it was built as a desktop computer.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.400]   When I use a Windows Surface as a tablet, it feels like it was designed as a tablet.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.080]   But they remember that Microsoft is a software company.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:59.600]   And the fact that I think that they make no bones about the fact that they don't expect
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.040]   to revolutionize the world than any one release.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.600]   It really is about we're going to, not only are we going to release this operating system,
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:09.680]   we're going to let anybody try it while we're developing it for a year beforehand so that
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:14.920]   we can find out what people are doing with it and how our ideas in the board and in the
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:18.160]   engineering room are actually playing out in the real world.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:25.600]   Because they realize that if Windows 8 flops, people are still going to buy Windows machine.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.920]   There's scenes that's going to, they're just going to run Windows 7 on it.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.920]   They're not in the hardware business.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.720]   That doesn't cost them anything.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.920]   So they could really make those, they could spend a couple of years figuring out making
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.880]   a radical new operating system.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.640]   Apple doesn't have that power.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:43.640]   If they screw up the next version of the Macintosh operating system, they don't get a year or
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:47.400]   two off where nobody buys any Mac products waiting for them to figure things out.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:52.120]   That's the time in which they lose that entire slice of the revenue pie.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.560]   So they can't do that.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:57.760]   And so it really does, it comes down to what point does Apple decide we're going to tear
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:02.720]   down all of Macintosh operating system and rebuild it to make it support touch in a very
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.720]   friendly way.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.080]   And the answer is of course you don't.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:10.600]   You wait for the time in which, you wait for the time in which the forward momentum has
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.880]   just naturally found its absolute valley.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:19.040]   And that's when you guide people to hop off the skateboard that's no longer rolling and
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.960]   hop on the one that's taking off.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:26.520]   That's the point at which they will either say that we are keeping Mac OS along as a legacy.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:36.920]   We hope that we have lots of $1,500 iPad options for people who are now using desktop style
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.520]   apps for the Mac.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.680]   I don't think the keyboards are ever going away.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:41.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:46.280]   I don't see a, no one has ever posited to me a version of the future in which a keyboard
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:50.760]   in front of a screen will cease to be not just relevant but important.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.840]   And people who are thinking that, oh, there will always be just, we're moving towards
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:54.840]   everybody doing everything on phones.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:57.440]   But you can have a keyboard with a touch first device.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.440]   Can't you?
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.440]   Mind.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:05.200]   I mean, I have a keyboard and when I really like the keyboard with my iPad, the iPad Pro
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.000]   and the, yeah, you know, that's, and that's actually, it made me the MacBook Pro this year
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.240]   made me realize how much I like the experience, that particular experience of the Microsoft
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:20.480]   Surface where if I want the minuscule thin keyboard for ultra portability, I can get
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.480]   that.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:28.680]   If I want to have a really, really great experience, I can spend $90 for a Logitech K11 and get
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:34.920]   a conventional notebook style keyboard or I can spend $150 and actually get like a compact
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:39.400]   clacky style keyboard with cherry switches, you get to basically decide what kind of experience
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:40.400]   you want to have with it.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:45.160]   Again, I recognize that that's not practical in any way for Apple to do, but I think that
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.560]   I don't think they're going to intentionally hybridize anything.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:52.560]   I think that they're going to continue to make sure the iPad because that's the best interest
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:53.560]   of the iPad.
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:57.680]   They're going to continue to keep touch off of the Mac because again, unless they decide
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:00.320]   that we're going to take two years off, everybody come back in two years, we'll show you something
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.320]   cool.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.320]   They're not going to be able to do that.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.640]   So they're just going to let a nature run its course.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.280]   I think this is true.
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:11.440]   Phil Schiller should stop saying we're not making a touch Mac because it's not a good
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.360]   experience because that's demonstrably false at this point.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.360]   That's embarrassing.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.720]   He puts that in context.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:21.520]   In his most recent interview, he said we have a menu bar in the Mac and it's unclear what
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.480]   the menu bar would be in a touch Mac.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:26.760]   He's talking specifically to the current Mac OS X.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.040]   You can solve.
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.760]   These are all solvable problems.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:36.480]   It's what you really, and maybe he just doesn't want to say we see the world as a touch first.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:43.840]   We see a touch first future and we don't think the Macintosh, we should modify the existing
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.360]   Macintosh as much as create a new platform which we've done.
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.800]   And we just need to get that new platform up to the point where it could do everything
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.400]   a Mac can do.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.400]   And which they have.
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:55.760]   Microsoft's greatest advantage that they didn't win mobile and they could put everything
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.600]   behind making Windows 10.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.120]   Where at Apple, even if they wanted to make a touch first operating system, they still
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.400]   have to ship iOS 11, iOS 12.
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:06.320]   And I don't know if a touch first, do we really want to touch first Mac?
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:11.240]   By the time they can do a touch first Mac, I mean, it was that, look it, there were five
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:13.360]   years of pain in Windows 8.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.600]   That was not a good experience.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:20.720]   Maybe Apple could do better than that, but I'm not convinced they can.
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:27.440]   Taking an indirect input, OS and turning it into a direct input, OS is clearly not as
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:31.400]   good as solution as a ground up touch first OS and Apple.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:34.840]   And where will iPad Pro be in five years when they could spend that time on that?
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:39.080]   So what we really need, and I'm sure Apple's working as fast as their little fee can carry
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:43.640]   them is to make the iPad Pro more and more do the things.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.600]   And by the way, I'm one of the people who's skeptical when I hear you are, you'll be able
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.440]   to develop software and design graphics on an iPad Pro.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:56.600]   But then I look at something like the Surface Studio, which is just really a giant tablet.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:59.880]   And I think, no, I guess, you know, I guess in time I'll get used to it.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:03.440]   I just kind of nostalgic for a desktop PC.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:05.480]   But why do you need a laptop?
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:09.480]   You can imagine an iMac running a big version of iOS that you could fold down and touch
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.480]   and pencil on.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.600]   Like the, that's what the Surface Studio is, right?
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:15.960]   You're looking like this and then you put it down and it's good to me.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:21.640]   It's also good to notice that the all the, as far as I'm concerned, all the real limitations
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:26.960]   of the iPad Pro that prevent it from that, that not that it prevents it from being used
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.800]   as a professional computer, but make it a pain in the butt to use it as a professional
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:30.800]   computer.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.040]   They're all software.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.920]   The hardware is fine.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.840]   The platform is fine.
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:40.080]   All they have to do, all I have to do is find an easy way to get files in and out of it,
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.080]   for instance.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:46.760]   All they have to do is to spend three months dropping acid in an ashram and come out and
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:52.960]   say, okay, here are the rules for keyboard usage, keyboard usage of iOS apps.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:57.560]   And even if they got the deposit for an extra month and come out and say, okay, now we've
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:01.360]   also figured out how you can use a mouse or trackpad with iOS.
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:06.280]   I mean, all these things that are kind of, again, make it difficult to, for, I don't
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.440]   be in LA all next week.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:12.360]   And as usual, when I'm leaving for more than a couple of days, I'm thinking, okay, let's
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.360]   make this decision.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:19.040]   Are we going to risk taking only and only iOS devices or do we have to take a MacBook
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.720]   just to make sure we've got all bases.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.720]   You can do that.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:24.320]   There may not be there yet doesn't mean that we won't get there.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.720]   Oh, no, no, no, exactly.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.400]   But what I'm saying is that that's encouraging.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.680]   I don't think that Apple has to reinvent anything.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:33.520]   Just again, just like the iPhone didn't have certain key features when it was first released,
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:38.560]   it eventually got this bizarre thing called cut copy and paste.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.960]   But they didn't have to release a brand new iPhone to add this feature.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:47.400]   If they, I think that if Apple wanted to, if Apple decided to do something super controversial
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:51.160]   and say, I'm going to drop, we're going to drop the Mac, we're going to make the case
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:54.560]   that the iPad is good for anybody who's using a MacBook Air right now, they wouldn't have
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:56.480]   to create new hardware necessarily.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.120]   They would just have to create new software.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:03.760]   So software is always an impressive project, but it doesn't mean that you have to hire,
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:09.320]   you have to build new factories or train a new build stuff and figure out how to manage
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:12.040]   your component flow in order to do it.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.840]   You just have to ship bits and it will work.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:19.320]   So there's a lot of great future in this.
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:30.640]   It's also Apple following the fundamental tenets of the great thinking of Steve Jobs.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:36.720]   Learn to say no, you don't have to let multiple lines proliferate, focus.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:40.720]   And so yes, of course, Apple has the money, the resources, the ability to make a touch
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:42.360]   first Mac OS.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.880]   That's not the question.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:49.760]   But it does seem like they're following that Steve Jobs tenant where you just focus, say
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:54.400]   no to other products, have a streamlined product line and trust it in the long run you're going
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.480]   to give consumers what they want.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:00.080]   Today they're unhappy.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.080]   Today they're unhappy.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:04.560]   But there's that really famous Phil Schiller slide that they've made into it.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.120]   They since made it into a t-shirt, you can get it infinite loop.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:11.040]   And it's that it's the job of the Apple Watch team to make an Apple Watch so good people
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.480]   don't need their iPhones.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:15.720]   And the job of the iPhone team to make an iPhone so good people don't need their iPads.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.640]   And an iPad so good people don't need their Macs.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:22.080]   And it's a job of the Mac team to make a Mac so good people want it despite whatever
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.800]   the iPad or the Apple Watch is doing.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.560]   And that sometimes jockeys back and forth.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.560]   Sometimes one of them gets a lead on the other.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:31.000]   And I think this is one of those things where they're trying to conceive of what the next
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:36.240]   generation of Mac looks like.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:41.240]   And so I mean, I understand and I want the most powerful laptop money can buy out and
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:46.160]   I want it to be thin and light and have 24 hour battery life.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.640]   It'd be nice to have touch.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:48.640]   Sure.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:53.480]   And again, I'm working in a vacuum because I don't know if that touch bar suits my issue
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:58.360]   with a touch bar as I mentioned kind of alluded to before the break is if you're a touch
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:02.040]   type as you don't look at the you're looking at your screen, you're not looking at the
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.160]   keys and you can't do that with a touch bar.
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:11.360]   So the touch bar is kind of the negative of a touch screen, which is without I mean,
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:14.880]   you're touching something but you don't know what it's going to be until you look at it.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:15.880]   And it changes.
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:16.880]   It's dynamic.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:17.880]   It changes.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:18.880]   So I'm nervous about it.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:21.200]   I have no idea what it's going to be like because I know, you know, I haven't been able
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.200]   to try it.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:23.600]   So it all depends on execution.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:27.840]   I think that if it becomes if if I think that the litmus test of the touch bar is going
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:33.880]   to be they should have a version of this in the engineering room where someone has taken
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:38.880]   a piece of gaffer tape and covered just absolutely covered that touch bar.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:43.680]   If there's something you can't do now, then you need to rethink that piece of software
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:45.080]   because it has to be completely optional.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:48.560]   Like you it's not it's not a problem for touch typists until there is something that
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.240]   I have to touch on the touch bar to make something happen.
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:54.040]   And it has to be something where it's not going to be the sort of where I'm going to
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:58.960]   be naturally sort of leaning back and about to grab my mouse to to find something in a
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:55:59.960]   menu.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.120]   So also becomes a shortcut option.
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:02.800]   I think that there's nothing but upside.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:08.200]   If it becomes I I don't have the ability to look at this section of the keyboard or feel
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:11.080]   this key, then I think that's a point of failure.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:15.240]   And I hope that Apple has put in safeguards to make sure that doesn't happen once this
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.440]   is released into the wild.
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.960]   Yeah, the only thing that's saying me like, so I had a lot I used it.
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:19.960]   I didn't use it long enough.
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:24.760]   And in the time I was using it, it took me a while to get used to it because it for example
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:28.240]   does suggestions the same way your iPhone keyboard does predictive suggestions.
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:30.640]   But on an iPhone, I'm looking at the screen in the keyboard at the same time.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:32.040]   So I don't have to move at all.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:35.200]   And with this, I just I didn't need the suggestions because I'm typing fast enough that the word
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.840]   is finished by the time I noticed that I suggest.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:41.920]   Yeah, but some stuff is helpful for like going through the like it still is the sounds going
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.400]   through the emoji picker was quick.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:47.040]   The escape key being the furthest left key is what saves it for me because that is the
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:51.440]   only function that if it's not a shortcut, like that is an absolute you have to have it.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:54.600]   But because it's a side, you can actually feel where it is like you just know the escape
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:58.120]   key is there doesn't feel like a key, but there's something above this row of keys that
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:59.920]   I know it's going to be the escape key.
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:01.840]   So you can hit it when you need it.
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:04.880]   The stuff that I really liked is the stuff like the pallets where it takes things from
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.880]   Adobe or takes things from Final Cut.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.880]   And it puts them down there because I just don't remember enough shortcuts and they're
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:10.880]   different in every program.
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:14.520]   And I don't use half the I still use the mouse to drag up and look at the menu and type in
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:17.680]   search to find commands because I don't live in one app all day.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:20.600]   I live in 30 apps for different periods of time.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:24.160]   So being able to see stuff that was helpful and suggested there, I just learned to glance
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.320]   down as I was using it.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:26.600]   And that part I really liked.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:30.360]   But it's going to take me a good couple of weeks to decide if I really like it or not.
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:35.360]   So what I really would have loved to see is something that Adobe has been doing with companion
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:40.800]   apps for its desktop apps, which is to say that if you're not using your Mac, you're probably
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.080]   not using your iPad.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:46.000]   So why not make that into an input device for the app you're using on your Mac?
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:52.800]   And if Apple decided to make an OS level solution, so the third party apps that could broadcast
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:58.440]   to the app, oh, by the way, this person has a phone or an iPad mini or an iPad pro that
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:03.080]   is now docked and designated as both an output device and as an input device.
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:08.640]   Now here's an area that you can now put your own tool palettes and your own buttons as
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.160]   controlled by the app.
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.360]   That would be pretty damn hot.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:17.840]   That might even keep me into Mac laptops for a long time more because there are so many
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:21.320]   people who if you've already invested in a MacBook, you probably have a phone and you
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:22.600]   might even have an iPad.
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:27.800]   And one of the reasons why it's a cheap thing to have a dual display thing is that I paid
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:33.120]   a thousand bucks for this iPad pro, but I also bought a really cool 13 inch portable second
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.200]   monitor for my Mac setup.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:38.400]   So that's, that's, it's, I think that the touch bar is interesting.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:44.280]   It conceptually, I think it'd be more interesting to be able to have the second screen somewhere
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:47.280]   that is not going to be, I can drag a window there.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:51.040]   And now that's where my Twitter is, but I can expect that if I want to do something that
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:55.200]   feels like a shortcut or if I want to switch between eight different font styles and see
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:59.640]   representations of those font styles instead of having to pursue a drop down and hope I
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:04.760]   pick the right one, here is a panel that's designed to be my custom keyboard for Microsoft
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:05.760]   word styles.
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.520]   Or here's my palette picker.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.520]   Here's my tool picker.
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.640]   That's the sort of stuff that I would love to see.
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:15.440]   It kind of along the lines of what you're talking about, Renee, I think that the, the
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:20.360]   secret may be a surprisingly useful app is auto correction on the touch bar.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:25.120]   And the reason I'm thinking this is I read an article this morning in the Atlantic.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:28.000]   There was hysterical Chinese characters are futuristic.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.520]   The alphabet is old news.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:35.280]   This is, this is a guy named Tom Molaney.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.000]   He, he's a historian of modern China.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.440]   He has a collection of Chinese typewriters and keyboards.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:48.200]   And he says, in fact, China has an advantage here, even though for years they didn't.
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:51.840]   In other words, in order to send a telegram, look at this keyboard.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:57.440]   To sell a telegram in China, you, you had to send all these, this all, it cost them four
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.080]   times more to send a telegram because you had to send so much more information.
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:06.120]   But with auto correct, and he talks about Chinese T nine, let me see if I can find it
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:12.280]   here, with auto correct, for instance, T nine, which remember the old entering texts from
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.560]   the number pad on your, on your phone.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.800]   There was this thing called T nine, which would predict what you were going to do.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.920]   It turns out it works really well in China because it's stroke based.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:27.360]   And you can see if you look carefully, the yellow strokes on the seven eight nine key.
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:32.560]   What happens is you enter the first few strokes, average Chinese characters nine strokes.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.680]   That's a lot.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:38.040]   But you enter the first few strokes, the phone is very able, quickly able to guess the character.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.600]   And the character is a whole word.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:47.560]   So auto correct in China is actually extremely powerful, extremely sophisticated because they
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:53.120]   needed to solve this issue of having hundreds of thousands of letters of characters.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.320]   And in an average Chinese speaker, we might use 10 to 80,000, you know, really sophisticated
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.080]   of 90,000.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.880]   There's a lot of characters.
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.880]   They solve this problem.
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.520]   They had to solve this problem.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.760]   And auto correct may actually solve this problem for the courty keyboard.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:14.520]   It's actually now less efficient than the Chinese predictive keyboards.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.200]   I've kind of blew my mind.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:21.440]   I don't, you know, it's just the one article, but it made me start thinking about, you know,
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.960]   we've gotten used to having auto correct on our mobile devices.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.920]   What if you had really smart auto correct on your keyboard and you have to rethink how
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:36.480]   you type, obviously, as we have with our mobiles, but it could actually really change the efficiency
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.480]   of our typing.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.720]   It's been on Mac OS for a while.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.880]   I find it works really well unless you type anything that's different than the norm.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:47.400]   Like if you're dealing with any of those, yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:50.920]   And shout out to Dean Hachimovic, who invented both auto correct and the Internet Explorer
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.920]   browser.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:52.920]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:54.920]   That's pretty good.
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.400]   Do you know him?
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:01.480]   No, but I saw him arguing with on Melton on Twitter and it was hilarious.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.840]   Whatever he says, I'd agree with if you've edited that.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:04.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.040]   Actually, it's going to be more interesting to see something like Siri and Cortana and
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:15.400]   Google Assistant as input devices, so to speak, where you now say, okay, insert my address
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:20.240]   or tell them that I reply to this one by saying that I can make it, but I'm going to
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.240]   be a little bit late.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.120]   And it's not, I can make it, but I can be a little bit late.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.280]   It will go through all the stuff you've actually typed to compose things that don't need the
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.360]   personal touch.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:33.520]   The ability to simply say, here is the, here is a message that actually pulls out the information
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:37.080]   you need or something that will pre flag and put on your desk for your signature, so
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.440]   to speak, replies to certain emails.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.480]   That's where, yeah, that's where I, you could start seeing machine learning and auto, auto,
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:46.360]   artificial touch is getting really useful in this.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:51.280]   And that's what Google do does now with inbox and they're doing with the aloe messenger.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.040]   They're starting to offer canned responses.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:58.560]   So I can, aloe messenger is really interesting because I'll get a text from somebody and
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.600]   it will suggest maybe you'd like to answer one of these three things and put a button
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.280]   underneath and it's on canny.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:09.880]   And it's much deeper than just auto correct what's the next word.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:14.520]   It's kind of understanding what the question is and providing response based on your previous
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.520]   responses.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.520]   It's quite good.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.680]   The role of the keyboard has always been not for typing, but to tell the computer what
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:23.880]   you want and what do you want this computer to do for you.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.200]   And now that's such a broad thing.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:33.000]   I was, I was standing outside a American Asian restaurant and they had like a, like a, like
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.880]   a decorative band of flags like outside the restaurant.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.400]   And I could sort of recognize it.
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:42.720]   I didn't know what country represented and took out my phone, my Android phone.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.760]   I was about to Google like what I just, I think they're, I think this is a Korean restaurant.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.760]   So maybe it's the flag of Korea.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.920]   It's a Google for images of the flag of Korea.
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:55.960]   And then I realized that, oh, wait a minute, the camera app in, in, in Android, the stock
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.040]   camera is tied into Google now.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:02.600]   So I could simply launch the camera app, put the flag in the live view, hold down the home
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:07.480]   button, and then four seconds later and identify that this is the flag of the country and here
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.920]   are details about that country.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.920]   So that's what we're talking about.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.200]   We're talking about keyboard replacements.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.080]   It's not just about predictive text.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.280]   It's about, well, what does the user want to do?
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.720]   Is there an easier way to help them out without forcing them to actually, you know, use their
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.920]   language skills?
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.760]   Wouldn't it be interesting?
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:30.520]   I mean, maybe that's the end game on this, on this OLED is to actually become a artificial
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:31.520]   intelligence.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:39.640]   So if that were a dedicated window into Siri, where this is where Siri never goes away and
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:44.000]   it can do things like not have a conversation with Siri and Siri will ask me questions back
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.280]   or give me candidates.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.120]   Well, like you're available at these four times.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.560]   There are buttons for times and dates that can tap that.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:55.840]   If it were less of a here is a screen that can have lots of different things in it.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:56.960]   You don't know what it is.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:01.640]   As opposed to every time you want assistance on something, the interaction is going to be
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.640]   here.
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.640]   This is where they live.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:07.160]   This is the open office door between you and your systems desk outside.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.400]   And when you go, "Bekah!"
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.400]   Where am I going?
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.960]   And to, "Bekah!"
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.960]   It says, "Test marker!"
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.800]   I pay to screen these people.
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:19.040]   Let's take a break.
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.040]   More coming up.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:24.320]   Any anaco Chicago, sometimes for my more dot comments, Renee Richie.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.520]   We're talking Apple.
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:31.440]   And now that you have Thunderbolt 3 ports on your new MacBook, you're going to want to
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:36.040]   start looking at cabling and some really nice cabling from the Kings of Glass.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.960]   Corning, you've all heard, you know, Corning Gorilla Glass.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:42.320]   You might even have some Corning Wear when you were a kid at home.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:47.360]   They sold that division, but they still make high tech glass products like fiber optics,
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.360]   fiber optic cables.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:53.120]   In fact, these great cables from the optical cables from Corning are thinner.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.120]   They're lighter.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.120]   They're stronger.
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:01.160]   And they're flexible than maybe what you used to think of as fiber optic cables.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:05.880]   In fact, I remember the early days, three years ago, when we started putting fiber optic
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:09.600]   cables in the Brickhouse Studio, where it was all sorts of caution, you know.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.960]   They said, "Don't step on them."
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.640]   We actually hung them from the ceiling so nobody could touch them.
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:14.920]   Now, you can step on them.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:15.920]   You could tie them in a knot.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.080]   You could tie them in a bow.
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.840]   I mean, these things, you can crimp them.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.960]   They take a twisting...
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:24.200]   Actually, I should say they take a bent...
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.200]   I have to rhyme, right?
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.520]   They take a bending and they keep on sending.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.080]   These things are amazing.
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.600]   Apologies to John Cameron Swayze.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.960]   So what they've done is they've got this...
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.560]   You see how small it is.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:41.520]   This little at one end at each end, they have this little adapter that takes the thunderbolt
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:49.880]   or USB 3.0 connector, turns the RF, the copper into light.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:50.880]   It's got a sender...
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.160]   I don't know how they got it this small.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:58.440]   So that's part of the innovation is this little tiny transceiver that turns...
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.440]   There you go.
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.440]   That's the insides of it.
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:04.520]   That turns the copper signal into optical signal.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:10.880]   And then it can send it over these very thin, light optical wires at great distance at full
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.120]   speed, no attenuation.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.360]   Cable runs for thunderbolt at 200 feet.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.360]   200 feet!
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:21.440]   That's two-thirds of a football field with no attenuation.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:25.200]   For USB 3, 165 feet.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:29.680]   So it's easy to move noisy space-consuming devices away from your workspace.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.120]   Here I'll give you an example.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.120]   Universal audio.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:36.360]   They make very high-end sound interfaces.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:40.080]   Thunderbolt sound interfaces used in professional recording studios and so forth.
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:44.360]   They use optical cables by Corning to get acoustic isolation.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.360]   They take the...
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:50.600]   They can test equipment and they move the noisy stuff out.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.280]   Instead of investing on multiple extenders and adapters and cables, turn to optical cables
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:59.280]   by Corning to establish the connection you need with one simple long-length cable.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.480]   Now that you've got thunderbolt 3 on your new MacBook, you're going to want some nice
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.240]   thunderbolt 3 arrays.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.240]   But why...
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:08.000]   Put them in the closet.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.320]   They can be as far as 200 feet away.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.560]   Optical cables by Corning.
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:15.700]   You can get them at Apple stores in all major electronics and professional AV retailers
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.160]   Amazon B&H.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.160]   Optical cables by Corning.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.880]   Lighter and stronger.
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.960]   Go to opticalcablesbycorning.com to learn more and we thank Corning so much for their
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.160]   support of MacBreak Weekly.
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:34.520]   I'm going to start working on it and say, "Make these Type C dongle free."
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.400]   But for now, I use them all the time.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:45.160]   I have a Drobo Thunderbolt that I connect to my iMac using the optical cables by Corning.
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.160]   It's awesome.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.160]   It's way down.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.400]   It's a bit of a shock to the desk, so I don't hear it.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.680]   Optical cables by Corning.com if you want to learn more and we thank you so much for your
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:59.520]   support of MacBreak Weekly and for making these awesome cables.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.840]   You can bend it and it's send it.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:05.360]   It takes it twisting and it keeps on spritzing.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:06.360]   I don't know.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:09.760]   Bend it, shim, sit anywhere you want.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.920]   Anyway, actually I'm not going to sing that anymore.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:16.560]   Isn't that a Southwest Airlines is using that now for their ads and you see them all over
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:20.680]   the football and the baseball.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:24.040]   Those people have expectations on the comfort of their seats.
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.040]   Anyway, you...
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.040]   All right.
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.680]   Siri, have you guys tried that now in Sierra?
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.080]   Do you use it?
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.800]   I never find myself using it.
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.080]   Yeah, me neither.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.640]   I use it for things.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:38.040]   What I find that Siri is good for is to help me with my essential laziness.
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.400]   For example, on iOS, sometimes I just don't want to type a lot.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.400]   I'll dictate.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:44.120]   If I want to do an article idea, I'll just dictate it quickly to notes.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.760]   Even if it's not 100%, I remember the gist.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:50.480]   On Mac OS, if I don't want to drill through a directory structure and I remember enough
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:55.720]   about a document that I don't remember exactly where it is, I can just say, "Yo, shindig,
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.720]   find me this."
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.560]   A lot of times it pulls it up or just weather or any sort of bit of information that I'm
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.960]   too lazy to click through.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.080]   It'll provide me in that sense.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.080]   It's persistent.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.280]   What I like is it doesn't go away like it does on iOS.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.720]   It'll stay there and you can reference it.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:11.000]   If I'm typing, I can just say, "Look this up for me.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   Glance at it.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   Keep typing."
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.960]   You can even pin it in Notification Center.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.600]   If you want it persistently to be there, every time you swipe notification, it'll be able
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.640]   to refer back to it.
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.360]   It's still not fully developed.
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.880]   You can't do HomeKit or some other things with it yet, but they did give it some really
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:29.200]   nice, very Mac-centric features.
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.800]   Settings are great too.
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.320]   I don't want to have to go look for a Settings panel.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.080]   I just tell it to toggle the setting.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.400]   The other day I was watching a video and I just said, "Turn on subtitles."
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.400]   My friend was blown away.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:42.520]   It takes me forever to find that every time.
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:45.640]   Those kinds of things it's really helpful for.
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:48.240]   I have now the Google Home.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:55.320]   Of course, I've had Amazon Echoes in every room of the house practically or the dots and
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:59.040]   series everywhere and my phone.
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.960]   I love it, but I just never think of using it.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:08.240]   It's almost you have to train yourself to use it more often.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.880]   That's a problem of a lot of features that have been in software we've been using for
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:14.400]   years and we just didn't know it because we haven't gone looking for it.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:17.480]   We're not in the workflow in which it's relevant.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.320]   Or your muscle memory is.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:23.440]   You press command space and you type in this spotlight.
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:28.640]   It's like because I'm joking about yelling it back in the next room, but I have Alexa
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:29.640]   in the next room.
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:36.400]   For anything that I would typically use a Siri for, I will just let me say, "Alexa, what's
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:39.120]   the weather in New York City in two days?"
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.480]   Because it's just how I'm trained to do it.
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:46.080]   Oddly enough, if Siri could work via the keyboard, I would be using it all the time
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:49.480]   because I use spotlight all the time.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.520]   You can't like type function function or something.
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.520]   You can.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.520]   You hold it down.
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.520]   The same thing as a spotlight.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:58.720]   You hold it down for a few seconds in serial pop-up.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.280]   That's the difference.
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:03.200]   I still have to speak what I want to do.
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.600]   For years, I've been trained in spotlight to search.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.400]   That's my application launcher.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.440]   It's the easiest way to launch anything.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:16.040]   I would easily hit command space and then type, "Do I have any appointments next Tuesday
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.040]   afternoon?"
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.400]   Then just have it simply speak it or read it out to me.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.200]   For some reason, this is my brain.
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.560]   I don't think this is a feature deficiency of Siri.
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:30.280]   For some reason, my brain has not said, "Press command, hold down space," and then asks
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:36.880]   Siri to do something because when I deal with that's how I ask questions of people and
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:43.000]   I don't press on their ear, put your thumb on their nose and then say, "Are we driving
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.560]   together or are we going to be taking separate cabs over there?"
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:47.560]   Then listen for the answer.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:48.560]   I'm just not trained to do that.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:49.920]   I got to try this Carl Argy.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:54.400]   Every year I do an article saying, "Please just conflate Siri in spotlight already,"
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:58.560]   because there was just type on WebOS and Blackberry said something similar and Google Assistant
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.560]   shows it too.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.080]   I just can't speak or don't want to speak.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:04.720]   I should have the same query engine regardless of my input media.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:09.560]   I should be able to type into it, speak into it, do hand signals if I get smart enough,
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.680]   but I just want that to be one system like inquiry.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:16.160]   I've talked to Apple about this and they're really adamant about how Siri is a voice thing.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.440]   It's not a type in thing.
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.960]   I don't know if that's dogma or that's something about how this is created.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.320]   You can do it though.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.160]   If you ask Siri something and it answers, you can go edit what you asked it and you can
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.280]   type in anything you want and it will tell you.
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:30.720]   It takes some code from the Newton message pad, which still works great.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.800]   It's schedule and appointment with Larry at next Tuesday at 2pm.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.800]   I can't do that yet.
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.840]   It seems like I should be able to do that.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:40.040]   You can do it in Siri.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.840]   I don't think you can do it from spotlight.
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:44.800]   There's no way to type it in unless you're using a third party.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:50.720]   Somebody should write a little text to Siri thing of some kind.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:56.720]   Maybe I can do it if this is that rule in which I will have a talk to Alexa and then
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:01.000]   Alexa's schedule something.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.440]   The sound of that is something quite atrocious.
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.440]   That was funny.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:11.640]   RJ said supercalifragilistice, he has to be allodosius to Siri.
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:14.400]   Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.600]   The sound of that is something quite atrocious.
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.600]   He didn't get that at all.
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:31.120]   What did you say that Siri translated that into some crazy, forcalifragilist stickxpialidocious.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.120]   That's...
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:33.680]   I'm little, I'm little, I'm little.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:34.680]   It might be a pregnancy.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.400]   Maybe are you Scottish there?
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:39.520]   Sometimes they have several quippy little comments.
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.920]   That's one of them.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:44.200]   I guess it's just muscle memory.
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:50.920]   It's just training me to press and hold command space a little longer and then say something.
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:55.680]   It actually could be something that the touch bar can help you out with by not necessarily
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:59.680]   always being keys but also being, hey, do you realize that you can do this?
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.560]   Or watching what you're doing and saying, oh, the next time you just say this.
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:04.560]   That would be useful.
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:07.040]   Hey, I noticed you typed this but you know you could ask Siri to do that.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.400]   That would be useful.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:11.680]   I think something does that.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:12.680]   Maybe Cortana.
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:13.680]   Somewhere I've seen that.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:19.200]   Next time we're talking about it, Cortana is one of my favorite things about Windows 10.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:24.600]   Even though I'm not even a daily or rarely a weekly Windows user, just the ability to
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:28.600]   have a window that's here that will just take my questions and do stuff with them and the
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.480]   ability to type into them as well as having voice if I want it.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.040]   That's pretty darn cool.
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.280]   Although I haven't installed it on devices that it's available for.
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.240]   So that says everything about it.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:46.480]   In other news, Apple News, 70 million users, I used it a lot during the election cycle.
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:49.480]   In fact, I kind of miss it on Android.
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:53.920]   I haven't found it kind of funny because I really, really complained about Apple News
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:55.760]   when it first came out.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.400]   But it's gotten better and better I think.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:00.800]   And not because I'm training it but just because I think Apple's gotten better.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.920]   They're investing heavily in it.
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:07.200]   And so now it's a great news aggregator, a first source news aggregator for me.
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.800]   70 million users, that's, I don't know, is that a lot given how many iPhones are out
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.800]   there?
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.720]   I guess it's pretty good.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.880]   It's really pretty though.
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:22.880]   I hope that this is that the future of iOS is going to take us design cues off of how
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.680]   pretty this news app works.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:31.280]   I've been sort of deeply immersive in the iOS, the iPhone 7.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.840]   And so I'm trying to do as much things as possible with it.
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:39.960]   And it's like all the blandness of stock iOS, all of the utilitarian stuff.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:43.160]   My God, it's those things, they're words that are really, really thick and they're colors
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.560]   here and it's very, very pretty.
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:48.400]   It really gets you excited about some of the design work that Apple's putting into their
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:49.880]   iOS apps.
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:53.040]   There's a rumor that someone I had a cues team just has had an idea for this design
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.040]   and they let them go with it.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:57.480]   So all the ADQ apps, which is news and music.
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.600]   And I think home, I'm not sure if at home has the same, the bigger, bigger, brighter, more
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:05.200]   I like it, more beautiful or something design language.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.200]   Rene, how much is a good cup of coffee in San Jose?
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.200]   Seven dollars, six dollars.
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.200]   Yeah, it's a lot.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.200]   Yeah, it's a lot.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:16.880]   However much is, I'll put that money in an envelope and mail it to one infinite loop
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:22.840]   with the person who came up with this design that apparently and enough for a muffin for
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:26.840]   Craig for letting it from with it because I love it.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:30.640]   By the way, 70 million is up from 40 million last year.
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:33.120]   So that's almost doubled in size.
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:40.480]   And now Apple, remember, killed I ads, they have now done a deal weird with NBC universal
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:45.200]   to sell in app ads on Apple news.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.680]   Can somebody explain that to me?
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:50.680]   This comes from a recode publishers who put content on the app.
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:54.440]   Of course, could still sell their own ads and we'll keep 100% of the revenue.
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:59.160]   But if there's remaining ad inventory, instead of Apple selling it, NBC universal will sell
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:04.040]   it and just like Apple, we'll keep 30% of the revenue.
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:07.640]   See, I never, I'm probably out of the loop on this, but I just assumed that that was
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:12.320]   like a Google E being Yahoo sort of a thing and I never even considered that NBC universal
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.080]   would be an ad partner for something like this.
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:16.880]   Well, you know, and when we talked about yesterday and I was today, I said, well, that
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.880]   can't be NBC universal.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:23.400]   It must be Comcast, their parent company, because does NBC universal have a big, you
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.720]   know, division of sales people?
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.920]   Apparently they're going to create a dedicated sales group just for this purpose.
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:29.920]   It's interesting.
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:30.920]   Yeah.
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:31.920]   It's a huge advantage.
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:36.080]   They think the huge advantage news and why we see the uptick is when app news was like
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.560]   this big secret project that Apple and nobody knew about it.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:42.280]   At the same time, they were making this minus one home screen series smart thing and nobody
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:43.280]   knew about it.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:46.880]   So you had news in there, you had news in news, you had news in Safari and they never sort
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:47.880]   of worked all together.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:48.880]   And now it's all unified.
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.960]   So if you go to that, you go to that widget screen, you see the news widget there.
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.800]   If you go to the news app, you see it.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.760]   It's all in one, like it's all sort of one system wide thing now.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:01.320]   And that for publishers, like it's not easy out there.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:02.560]   The ads are getting worse.
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.640]   The revenue from them are getting worse from mobile.
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.720]   It's terrible because a lot of people don't convert on mobile.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:09.560]   Like they'll browse around in mobile, but then they'll still go home on their computer
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:13.600]   and put up 19 tabs and check every single different version of whatever it is they want
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:14.920]   to buy.
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:17.800]   So I don't know if this will be an improvement, but we're getting to a world where we live
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:21.600]   with AMP and we live with Facebook instant and we live with Apple news.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.440]   And we're no longer in control of our own presentation layers.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:27.840]   It's nice to have one button to push and you get the news.
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:32.520]   And they're aggregated because a lot of sources and they're driving a lot of traffic, according
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:36.960]   to Niamen Lab, which studied Apple news readership.
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:42.760]   CNN says it's Apple news content got 36.5 million unique readers in September.
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:46.120]   Now of course, this number is going up because of the election, but that's a big increase
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:53.080]   even from August of 5 million, 5 to 36 million page views increased from 43 million in August
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.320]   to 274 million.
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:20:01.120]   That's partly because of this election, but they also say the notifications started working
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.440]   after iOS 10 redesign.
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:07.000]   And the note I have to admit, I do see the notifications from Apple news and that does
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.360]   tend to pull me into those articles.
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:15.600]   Yeah, I mean, I've been, I've rediscovered it when I used found the news and swipe left.
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:19.280]   And just like with Google now, it will first, it will hook you the first time that it finds
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:21.920]   something that you didn't know about that you're interested in.
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:25.440]   And then that sort of trains your brain to, I'm going to swipe left now to see if there's
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.240]   anything interesting going on right now.
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:28.600]   Everybody is definitely getting better.
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:32.200]   In the news biz though is acknowledging that some of this bump comes from the election.
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:37.400]   And actually everybody in the news business is very worried about tomorrow that people
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.520]   are just going to stop reading the news.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:41.720]   And it's, oh, they'll be fallout for at least a week.
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:42.720]   Maybe it'll take a little while.
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:47.520]   But this has happened in previous election cycles as people get very interested.
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:49.080]   They follow the news much more closely.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.040]   And then after the election's over, it's over.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:52.200]   And don't they run again?
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.400]   I mean, it seems to me the US election takes a good three years.
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.960]   They're going to start soon, I think.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:58.760]   Also, I'll say that.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:20:59.760]   I know.
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:00.760]   They're going to start.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:01.760]   Oh my God.
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:07.760]   Also, keep in mind that like if anybody who is in the news knows that we have an unprecedented
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:13.920]   situation in which if the person who is well behind and can only buy a miracle when this
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:18.880]   election loses, they have not promised they will accept the results of the election.
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.320]   So this is probably going to be a reason for people to deepen that.
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:24.400]   And but they're not just telling you, giving you news about the election.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:27.800]   They're also oddly enough when the things that cut me into Google now was when it first
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:31.440]   said, oh, by the way, I noticed that you've been doing searches on Bob's burgers.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.480]   Next week, there's a new episode like, oh, that's great.
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:34.920]   I thought that was a rerun.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:35.920]   Thank you.
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:41.280]   So, in part, both the New York Times, the Washington Post, I see McClatchy, they've all
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:47.840]   dropped their paywalls for today, hoping to attract a big audience who might stick around
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:48.840]   in future.
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:53.840]   And I admit, I decided that Washington Post did such a good job with its coverage that
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:59.120]   I decided to subscribe to it to support Jeff Bezos, who apparently, I mean, I'm sure he's
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:05.040]   running in a deficit, has just decided, you know, this is my duty as a mogul to support
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.040]   journalism.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:09.320]   And, you know, these billionaires should buy one paper of record and just like, just
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.320]   pay attention with it.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.360]   Not do what Shelley is doing with that.
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:18.120]   Shelley, Sheldon Adelson is doing in Las Vegas, not mess with it, but say I'm going to create
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:23.320]   a firewall between my opinion and your news coverage, but I will support you.
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:28.760]   And you know, Bezos has built a beautiful new offices for the Washington Post gone heavily
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:29.760]   digital.
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:33.080]   It's 10 bucks a month subscription.
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:34.080]   But I feel like, you know what?
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.720]   I want to support, I want to, I want in my little way to do it.
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:40.280]   Bezos has done it in a big way, which is support journalism.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:45.240]   I subscribe to New York Times, but for completely self-refereasons, it's just that it's really,
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.240]   it's real journalism.
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.400]   It's a, you know, immense amount of content.
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:53.080]   Sunday, I am now one of those that's really how I want to get people to it.
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:54.080]   It's like Sunday times.
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:57.840]   Yeah, it's like I get no work done because after I read my morning comics, it's like,
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.760]   okay, let's see what's in the Sunday edition.
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:02.840]   And I'm just reading, reading, reading, reading, reading.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:06.880]   And I can't, I don't think I can afford to pay 10 bucks a month for every newspaper, every
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.840]   magazine that I want.
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:15.680]   But New York Times is, it's not just, once again, I have to change all my credit card
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:21.920]   numbers for a card that, again, I got a new card in the mail after not knowing that something
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:23.680]   had been going wrong.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:27.280]   But it was like, I noticed it because, oh, I can't get access to the New York Times.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:29.480]   I can't, oh, I got to do that right now, right now.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:31.480]   Because I want to read the stuff that's going on right now.
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:33.360]   And I also, I feel like it's almost charity.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:34.360]   No way.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.080]   I have my charitable causes.
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:38.720]   I send money to Wikipedia and doctors without borders, everyone.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:39.720]   And the FF.
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:43.360]   And a little patronage to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:46.200]   Actually, the Journal of Times in the Washington Post.
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:48.840]   If that's the reason why you're doing it, I'm a print journal.
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:49.840]   It's a little bit.
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:54.440]   Hey, if I could, if the Chicago Sun Times, you know, I'd be glad to send them a 10 bucks
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.280]   a month as well.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:00.400]   Bloomberg also benefited from the Apple News update, unique visitors to its Apple News
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:04.600]   content spiked 500% in October.
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:07.120]   And that's also because it got into the top stories.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:08.520]   That's just a german.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.520]   That's the german bump.
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.520]   That's the german bump.
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:11.520]   I think you're right.
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:12.760]   The german bump.
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:13.920]   Wow.
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:14.920]   He's paying for himself.
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:18.560]   I hope Mark got a big deal of Bloomberg.
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:20.320]   He's paying for himself up there.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.560]   I've seen him twice since then and he's was smiling both times.
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.360]   Yeah, but he's smiling.
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.160]   What kind of shoes is he wearing?
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.440]   It just shows, you know, okay, maybe journalism is in trouble.
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:33.920]   But some forms of journalism, Apple journalism, you know, not so much.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:37.760]   Journalism has never been in trouble because it's a product that everybody wants and it's
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:38.760]   only to pay for.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:41.800]   The question is how do you get them to pay for it and what are they willing to pay for?
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:42.800]   That's only thing that's changed.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:46.160]   No, your exact monetization is the challenge, exactly, right?
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:47.160]   Yep.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:50.720]   And it's like people like Rupert and german, it's not like their names.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:56.320]   It's not that their audiences because they consistently do great work, do great journalism.
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.960]   That's why someone like german is going to get hit handed by bloomberg and is going
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.560]   to get a really good offer.
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:07.080]   And that's why Gruber can have Gruber Gruber Gruber country, Frenchbury cereal and send
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:08.160]   out so that they do it.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:11.360]   It's a day if you wanted to because you know, he's just does such a good job of what he
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:12.360]   does.
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:17.960]   A couple of people in the chat are wondering, Carl, RJ and Jenna, why we do not have Apple
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:23.200]   news on the Mac yet or outside the US, UK and that's right.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:27.440]   Only in the US, well, it's English speaking, maybe, I don't know, because the Mac is old
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:28.440]   tips.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:29.440]   Mac is old news.
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.440]   Why do we not get there?
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:31.440]   We got the other apps.
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:34.720]   I mean, it's just it's it's Apple and again, some people hate this about them, but they
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:36.240]   really want to think about the use case.
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.280]   It's like we don't have an Apple TV yet.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:39.280]   And they're thinking about it.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:42.520]   Is it a video only does a strip out all the video from your news feeds and just show you
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:44.080]   that and how do we present it?
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:47.080]   And when it's on the Mac, like it took a while to get iBooks there and they're like, I don't
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:49.800]   think they did a great job bringing iBooks to the Mac, frankly.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.080]   But sometimes they think about like, how are we going to use this?
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.520]   How are we going to present it to you?
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:56.960]   And then whatever development, but did they have it gets slotted into that, you know, that
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:58.720]   pipe and maybe next year we get it.
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:02.280]   In fact, one of the reasons I'm bringing up news and the success of news is to contrast
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:11.320]   it with TV, Apple's Apple TV's TV app, which could it poses the same potential of being
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:13.560]   the place you go when you open your Apple TV.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:17.160]   You just go right to TV because all the stuff you want to watch is there, but they haven't
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.680]   made the right content deals yet.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:23.360]   And you know, you can't see everything you want to watch, so you still stuck going from
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.000]   app to app on the Apple TV.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.200]   And it's US only, which is only like it's a huge percentage of their customers, but it
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:31.040]   wouldn't serve, it couldn't be the primary interface.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.920]   It's like the Siri remote only works in a few countries.
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:35.080]   So in other countries it's called the Apple remote.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.080]   Right.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:40.240]   So it would be a great way to at least get people to get hooked on the news service.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:44.720]   If the screen saver were Apple news, I mean, if the default thing for the screen to do
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:48.200]   when it realizes that I'm not paying attention to it or I'm not in the office, is that I'm
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:53.160]   going to be the lobby key, the lobby screen kiosk that simply says here are interesting
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:56.560]   things that might have might want to grab your attention.
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:00.640]   It's not the reason why I would use Apple news, but I would click me into that app and give
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:01.640]   me a reliance on it.
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.240]   And then maybe trick me to seeing ads.
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:04.400]   I kind of buried the lead here.
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:11.480]   I think the most interesting story of the week was this Steve Jobs email from 2010, a year
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.640]   before his death.
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:17.600]   And it we got it because of the Samsung lawsuit.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:21.920]   This was revealed last week as part of the discovery.
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:29.600]   This is Apple's suit against Samsung over smartphone patents and it outlined his strategy
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:32.880]   for Apple going forward.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:39.680]   And this it turns out was the agenda for Apple's annual top 100 meeting later this year.
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:41.360]   And I don't know if you guys have read it yet.
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.360]   Let me just kind of.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.840]   Yeah, I think it leaked a few years ago.
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:44.840]   Because I remember reading it.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:45.840]   Oh, you've seen this few three years ago.
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:46.840]   Yeah.
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.520]   Well, maybe I take it back then.
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:49.520]   No, I stole it.
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:50.840]   It's a fascinating read.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.280]   2011 strategy.
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:55.280]   One, who are we?
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:56.280]   That's good.
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.280]   I like it.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:59.920]   Head count average age VP camp percent new membership at this meeting.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:02.400]   What do we do?
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.040]   The questions are interesting post PC era.
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:08.120]   Apple is the first company to get here.
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:14.080]   Remember this is 2010 post PC products now 66% of our revenues.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:21.400]   iPad outsold Mac within six months post PC era equals more mobile smaller thinner lighter
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:25.560]   plus communications plus apps plus cloud services.
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.960]   Now this one may be not so good 2011.
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.800]   Holy war with Google.
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:30.800]   He tried.
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:33.120]   He tried all the ways we will compete with them.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.000]   Primary reason for this meeting.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.360]   You will hear about what we're doing in each presentation.
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:40.520]   2011 he declared the year of the cloud.
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:45.320]   We invented the digital hub concept PC is hub for all your digital assets.
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:49.160]   I remember asking who was it?
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:54.720]   I think was Craig Barrett of Intel at a CES 10 years ago.
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:59.640]   What the future of the PC was in a coming post PC era.
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:00.640]   He said the same thing.
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:05.600]   It's and I mean he may not may not be Apple invented this but in probably around the year
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.800]   2005 he said, well, it's the hub.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:10.520]   It's the hub for everything.
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:12.320]   I don't think we see that anymore, do we?
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:15.400]   I don't think that that's actually what the PC is anymore.
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:17.200]   PC now just another client.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:21.080]   His job continues alongside iPhone, iPad, iPad, touch.
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:24.200]   Apple is in danger of hanging on to old paradigm too long.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.320]   I think by which he means desktop.
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:27.800]   The innovators dilemma.
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:31.000]   Google and Microsoft are further along on the technology but they haven't quite figured
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000]   it out yet.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:40.640]   By all of our products together so we further lock customers into our ecosystem.
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:43.360]   And then he got this one off a little bit 2015 new campus.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.360]   It's a sub-suckable.
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:47.360]   Two years.
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.360]   You know what?
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:52.200]   Something that ambitious iPhone 4 Plus is on to.
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:55.240]   iPhone 4 Plus with better antenna.
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.400]   I guess he realized the problem.
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:02.880]   So camera and software to stay ahead of competitors to mid 2012 LTE mid 2012 low-cost iPhone
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.800]   model based on iPod touch to replace 3GS.
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:11.520]   So he's already talking about the bifurcated iPhone strategy that Apple later implemented
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:14.400]   and still does with the SE but the 5C.
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:17.320]   And with the other 5C.
[01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:20.640]   So at this event, this is his agenda.
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.240]   Showed, droid and rim adds.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.160]   Verizon iPhone.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:25.440]   Business and competitive update.
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.440]   5 hardware.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:28.440]   Confidential.
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:30.800]   I guess I don't.
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:32.320]   Is that re-directed or what?
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:33.320]   I don't know what that is.
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.320]   Oh, Siri.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.320]   Siri.
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.320]   Oh, maybe.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:39.760]   And then talking about the iPad ship iPad 2 with amazing hardware and software before
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:43.400]   competitors even catch up with our current model.
[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:45.400]   And they did.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:49.480]   I mean the iPad 2 came out and then the HP touchpad and...
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:50.480]   Garbage.
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:51.480]   Garbage.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:57.320]   iOS strategy, catch up to Android where we are behind.
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:58.320]   And they did.
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:30:59.320]   Notifications.
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.320]   Check.
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:01.320]   Tethering.
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:02.320]   Check.
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:03.320]   Oh, they're a Siri.
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.320]   Speech.
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.320]   Check.
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:06.320]   And leak for them.
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:07.320]   Siri.
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:08.320]   Dot, dot, dot.
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:09.320]   This is...
[01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:13.080]   I love reading this kind of stuff because you know, as we've been following this roadmap
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:16.920]   for the last six years and it's interesting to see how much of this roadmap actually
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:19.080]   was set by Steve.
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:24.240]   How much he understood when it comes to mobile media strategy, catch up to Google Cloud
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:25.720]   Services and leapfrog them.
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:28.760]   Didn't quite do that with photo streaming cloud storage.
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:33.560]   Deeply integrates Google Cloud Services way ahead of Apple, Google apparently, in cloud
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:36.440]   services for context, calendars, mail.
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:39.520]   I would argue still are.
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:43.000]   Make Apple ecosystem even more sticky.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.320]   What was Telluride?
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:47.320]   Was that a hardware or something?
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.320]   I think that's one of the iOS's but I'm not positive.
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.320]   They're all named Dr. Skee Resorts.
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.320]   Right.
[01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:56.600]   This does help out anybody who's about to say, "Oh, well, Apple doesn't care about this"
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:57.600]   or Apple.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:58.600]   They're thinking about all.
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:31:59.600]   Yeah.
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:00.600]   Exactly.
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:03.280]   Even if they don't necessarily translate everything they're thinking about into a working product
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:08.720]   or talk about things, I do think that this is an era in which even if it's against their
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:12.640]   will, they have to talk a little bit more about their plans and why they make certain
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:13.640]   decisions.
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:23.520]   We're seeing a lot like there was a, it wasn't ink but didn't fill, give a long talk to somebody
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:25.080]   about the new Mac book.
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:26.080]   Recently the new Mac book.
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:27.080]   The new Mac book.
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:28.080]   The new Mac book.
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.080]   The new Mac book.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:30.080]   The new Mac book.
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:34.080]   Here's why we had to do the things that we had to do.
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:38.080]   Whereas I think three or four years ago, that would have been much more rare and much
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:42.680]   more of a news event in and of itself because they usually at that time they would let
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:44.920]   the products speak for itself.
[01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:47.040]   But it's no good things.
[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.040]   They can lose control of the story.
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:53.440]   I feel like Phil Schiller talks now they should bill him as an Apple surrogate.
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:57.680]   I really feel like there's a lot of spin in what?
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:58.680]   For marketing.
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:32:59.680]   Well, he's the marketing guy.
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:00.680]   Well, he works exactly.
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:01.680]   That's his title and he works for Apple.
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:02.680]   It's not like he's a journalist.
[01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:04.720]   That would be a problem if you were a journalist.
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:08.000]   I spent the last year investigating the Mac and here's my finding.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.480]   By the way, you did iOS, you did iPhone, you did iPad, you did all of that.
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:17.400]   And then at the end, item seven on the list, Mac, and there's only four bullet points.
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:21.640]   Hardware roadmap, Lionplan, Mac App Store, Final Cut Pro demo.
[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:24.840]   Even in 2010, the Mac comes in.
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:27.880]   The only thing the Mac's higher than is Apple TV.
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:29.280]   She has more list items.
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:32.400]   But I mean, Mac was mostly, oh, tell you right, it was iOS 5 Leo.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:33.920]   iOS 5, OK.
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:36.920]   Anyway, this is in QZ.
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:39.720]   And I apologize if we've seen it before.
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:41.120]   It's the first time I'd seen it.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.120]   It's super fascinating.
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:43.120]   It's very fascinating.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:44.120]   Yeah, it's still fun.
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:48.160]   And this is why, by the way, this Holy War with Google, which then eventually bled over
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:52.400]   into a Holy War with Samsung, is ultimately a bad idea because it's things like this
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.040]   that leak out in discovery.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:55.520]   It's great for us though.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:56.520]   It's great for us.
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:57.520]   Historians are love Apple.
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:00.200]   The Samsung lawsuit showed us all the prototypes.
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:02.440]   We found out so much.
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:05.200]   Apple must have cringed, but just be cringing though.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:06.720]   OK, I keep saying it wouldn't be.
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:12.120]   I hope that even if Apple's not showing off prototypes of undeveloped and of unreleased
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:15.080]   products, I hope that there is like an oral history project internally.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:20.200]   I hope there's a building or an office inside the new spaceship that is just for here is
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:26.720]   a copper lined box you can go into in which you will be, you can say whatever you want
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:31.120]   about the history of this product project and it will be encrypted in such a way that
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:35.080]   I will check that will check the international atomic system clock so that
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:38.800]   absolutely cannot be decrypted by anybody until 30 years from now.
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:43.680]   It's fabulous because we see in your Hertzfeld site that documents the history of development
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:48.120]   of the Macintosh and even there are no trade secrets anymore, but it's just fascinating
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:52.280]   to see the challenges that people have and all the people who are complaining about how
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:55.520]   MacRide can only get seven pages in here and I keep having to switch disks because there's
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:56.520]   only one floppy.
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:01.360]   Gee, they've in modern Twitter, oh, they don't get it.
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:02.760]   They don't even care.
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:08.120]   It's like, no, we had we were so tight on memory inside there that we had a long argument about
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:11.840]   whether the OS should support rounded rectangles because we didn't know if we had enough space
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:12.840]   for the code.
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:13.840]   That's right.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:16.480]   So please don't give us a hassle about seven page limits.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.680]   Are we still thinking the Apple is going to do a display?
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:22.720]   I'm thinking now with the way they're promoting this LG display that they have decided.
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:24.280]   Yeah, this is their display.
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:25.280]   This is the display, right?
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:27.280]   All right.
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:28.280]   They by the way, the price drop.
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:34.800]   I mean, every cell has cinema display, a 5K cinema display under $1,000, but that's what
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.120]   they're doing with the LG.
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:38.640]   That's one of the reasons Apple's not in this business anymore.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:39.960]   How are they going to compete?
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:45.200]   You're not going to make an Apple 5K monitor for 954 bucks.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.760]   A logo alone costs you 500 bucks.
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:49.880]   And they look good, right?
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:51.960]   I haven't got one yet, but they look different.
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:52.960]   Yeah, they look different.
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:55.760]   So the only thing I noticed is when you saw them next to the Mac book, this green was
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:01.360]   matte, so the reflection was sort of glossy, but whatever it is, the Mac books really are.
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:04.320]   They're sort of like a sub-gloss surface, and these were matte.
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:09.360]   So they are P3, they are 4K and 5K, but from a distance they look different than the Mac
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:10.360]   books.
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:11.360]   Yeah.
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:16.240]   Although a lot of pros, a lot of people in general are begging for matte displays.
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:20.800]   Maybe that's the response.
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:25.840]   Today should Apple try to steal time Warner from out from under AT&T?
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:32.640]   There are some people saying they should, according to CNBC, people familiar with the
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:33.640]   thinking.
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:41.080]   People familiar with the thinking at the company are, say, Apple's not interested.
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:46.440]   Current price, $85.4 billion.
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:52.960]   Apple's concern, according to CNBC, is the regulatory issues of acquiring that big content
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:53.960]   company.
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:57.120]   This is from Squawk on the street.
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:58.120]   I don't know.
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:04.520]   It's very tempting to think of Apple acquiring a big content company.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:05.520]   Like John, it's supermanced actually.
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:06.520]   It's in the ear.
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:09.920]   It's just so tempting.
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.680]   But who's going to run it?
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:12.680]   What's going to be the purpose of it?
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:16.400]   How is it going to enhance Apple's whole portfolio?
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:24.960]   And even Google has decided to get out of the wired connectivity business as happy as people
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:26.480]   have been with Google Fiber.
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:28.720]   Google has decided that there's just no...
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:31.080]   We just don't want to be involved in laying cable throughout the...
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:35.560]   And supporting physical infrastructure throughout the entire country.
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:39.520]   We can just figure out what exists about the infrastructure that we can address and we
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:42.120]   can fix and we can improve for ourselves and we're going to do that.
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:47.280]   So I just don't know what... it's the same problems as Apple selling a regular TV set
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:50.480]   or same as Apple creating its own cable service.
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:53.440]   It's like, why would they want that kind of pain on themselves?
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:54.440]   Yeah.
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:56.760]   I mean, Sony bought Sony Studios.
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:58.760]   Right.
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:37:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:01.720]   In your cell, what happened?
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:06.240]   Any credence to the rumor, I'm going to call BS on the rumor that there's going to be a
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:07.240]   jet-white iPhone.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:10.120]   Do you think that'll happen to find a device?
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:15.640]   I wonder because the rumor is also that there won't be an iPhone SE update this spring.
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:20.800]   And I think the spring iPhone was more popular than Apple thought it would be.
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:25.640]   So I wouldn't be surprised because again, as a product gets bigger and as you soak up
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:28.960]   the address in the market, you start to do things to try to increase that.
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:33.600]   And if six months later you have new colors, that's a very common marketing strategy in
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:34.600]   mature products.
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:35.600]   White's hard to do.
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:38.000]   White's hard to do well.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.520]   Although the ceramic Apple watch, I mean, if they made it as ceramic, I'd be really interested.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:45.800]   But it would be pricey, I would guess.
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:50.640]   It's a great conic that a whole thing on producing like the Apple watch is okay, producing
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:51.920]   an iPhone scale.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:55.360]   And maybe it's like a limited edition or something, but maybe like Andy said earlier, making
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.360]   a million or something is really hard.
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:58.360]   Really hard.
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.360]   Yeah.
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:03.480]   But it's an interesting difference because the ceramic Apple watch costs a multiple more
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:07.080]   than the friendly version of it.
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:10.960]   The iPhone already costs a lot of people $800 and $900.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:15.120]   If you were $1,000, well, no, no, no, I'm saying that a lot of those people, if you were
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:20.360]   to give introduce them to a model that was dramatically different.
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:21.360]   Right.
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:25.080]   Like, and you can only and you could charge, let's say $200 more for it.
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:26.240]   That's not just a color.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:27.240]   It's a ceramic.
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:28.240]   It's a ceramic.
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:32.600]   It's a here's the only here is a shade of just offensively blue.
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:33.600]   Right.
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:38.240]   We're going to call it offensive blue that is just tip, not like you see it in the Apple
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:41.240]   store and you're like, that is beautiful.
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:42.240]   Beautiful.
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:44.680]   How much more would this be?
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:46.560]   And the answer is none.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:47.560]   None more blue.
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:48.560]   Yeah.
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:49.560]   So that would be interesting.
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:53.400]   Well, and I think ceramic is a very interesting material because it's a glass.
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:55.040]   So it's transparent to radio waves.
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:56.040]   Yeah.
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:57.040]   It's tougher than metal.
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:00.440]   And they said that Apple has been buying CNC machines at the, you know, like an unbelievable
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:01.440]   rate.
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:05.040]   And, you know, I don't want to say all of them, but they own a vast amount of CNC machines.
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:09.240]   They'd have to buy so many kilns and get so much production wrapped up that it would,
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:11.560]   that supply chain would be leaking like a faucet.
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:12.560]   But nothing.
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:13.560]   Oh, yes.
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:14.560]   So we'd know by now is what you're saying.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:17.720]   Apple fires three million kilns in San Gens, China.
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:21.360]   What do you think the failure rate is on the Apple watch, the ceramic Apple watch?
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:22.360]   Do you think there's?
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:25.840]   I mean, it was an, they managed to ship it and granted it a limited quantity.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.320]   So it can't have been huge.
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:31.240]   But I think a jet white iPhone, if it's even if it's produced in the same alley, and you
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:33.440]   have a very minimum chassis, it would still be a hot commodity.
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:35.120]   People have always liked white phones.
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:36.120]   Yeah.
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:37.120]   All right.
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:38.120]   Let's take a break.
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:42.720]   Your picks of the week coming up on Mac break weekly with Ray Richie from imore.com.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:44.280]   Andy and I go from the Chicago Sun.
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:52.400]   Times are show today brought to you by the place you should go to buy or sell your old
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:53.400]   iPhone.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:54.400]   Gazelle.com.
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:57.000]   You probably knew as soon as I said, buy or sell.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.040]   It's got to be Gazelle.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:01.720]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:04.000]   Gazelle has really made a name for themselves.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:11.320]   It's the place to go when you want to get money for an old device.
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:18.920]   If you go there right now, you get a quote good for 30 days on a variety of old devices.
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:21.040]   Your old iPhone, your old iPad.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:26.200]   By the way, they even buy broken iPads or iPhones.
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:27.640]   You can also sell in bulk.
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:33.680]   So if you're a business and you've upgraded your users and you've got a bunch of old
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:37.120]   blackberries, you should contact them.
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:43.000]   Gazelle is a great place for individuals and businesses to sell their old stuff.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:48.760]   Get a guaranteed 30-day lock-in, which means you have 30 days to decide.
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:51.800]   If you've ordered an iPhone and you're waiting and you know you're going to get it in the
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:55.360]   mid-November or late-November or early December, fine.
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:59.720]   Get a quote right now on your old iPhone so that when the time comes, you get the new
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:03.080]   one you can copy the data over and then pack up the old one.
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:06.760]   Gazelle pays a shipping on anything worth more than a dollar.
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:07.760]   You'll get paid fast.
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:12.040]   You get a check, a PayPal credit or, and I love this, the Amazon gift card, which they
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:14.000]   bump up 5%.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.320]   Now you might wonder, well, what happens to all those devices?
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:21.800]   The very best, highest quality devices, the ones that are in the best shape, the best
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:25.320]   iPhones, the 6s, the 6s, the 6s plus, the iPads.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:30.520]   The Galaxy phones, you can buy on Gazelle for a very, very good price.
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:35.920]   They're certified pre-owned devices, have all been run through their rigorous 30-day
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:40.760]   check to make sure they're completely functional and don't have any major cosmetic issues.
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:44.640]   Although during that check process, they can say, you know, this is, you know, we can
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:47.760]   see a slight, you know, gentle signs of wear, they say.
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:49.960]   So we're going to charge you less for that and you can choose.
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:53.760]   I want one that looks brand new or I want one that maybe slightly owned, but it's still
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:56.440]   in better shape than the one I'm replacing.
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:59.040]   Maybe you break your phone and you're getting a phone for a kid.
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:04.280]   Gazelle also offers financing on devices you buy by a firm, which you can do at checkout
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:09.440]   and get approved instantly, which really makes it easier to get that new device.
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:15.280]   A 12-month warranty also available for cell phones and iPads powered by assurance solutions.
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:19.760]   And these are, this is a warranty that covers not just hardware defects, but water damage,
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.160]   cracked screens.
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:25.800]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E to buy and to sell.
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:31.160]   Gazelle, fast, easy, friendly.
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:35.320]   Give a new life to use smartphones and other devices and save yourself a pretty penny at
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:41.200]   the boot at the time to boot at gazelle.com.
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:43.760]   Time for our picks of the week, Andy and not go.
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:46.160]   Why don't you kick it off this week?
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:47.840]   Mine is actually an oldie, but a goodie.
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:56.160]   I've been using SnapSeed a lot on the iPhone 7 and it's really become my favorite iOS photo
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:57.360]   editor.
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:04.280]   I love how it makes complex series of edits, what it would be really, really kind of complicated
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:12.360]   to do in Lightroom or Photoshop into just swipe left, swipe right in a top down scrolling
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:17.640]   list of effects it can do and then just simply move your thumb to the left or the right to
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:20.200]   adjust the intensity of that effect.
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:26.160]   And yet it's doing an amazing amount of intelligence behind the scenes with not only just the basic
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:30.720]   filters, but also things like it being able to understand that, okay, there's a human
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:31.800]   face in this shot.
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:37.840]   So I'm going to, if he asks me to brighten things up, I'm going to treat the face differently
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:40.040]   than I do the background.
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:43.880]   It's not an app for doing lots and lots of wacky effects.
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:47.880]   It's an app for taking the picture that you shot and making it look like what you remember
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:49.920]   that scene looking like.
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:50.920]   And this is something that I...
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:52.400]   Is this your shot?
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:57.720]   Yeah, I actually shot that with the iPhone 7 Plus.
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:59.840]   And I wanted to share...
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:03.720]   I thought that, well, of course I'll come home and put this into Photoshop and then improve
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:05.000]   it.
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.120]   And then I got kind of like greedy and thought, "Oh, well, I want to post something just
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:10.320]   immediately."
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:13.920]   And I just started going into the library, I went into Snapseed.
[01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:14.920]   And I would...
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:19.520]   If you compared the original of that to what that looks like now, all the elements were
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:24.160]   there, but none of the color, none of the brightness is there, none of the liveliness,
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:26.000]   this is what I remember it looking like.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.800]   This is not what the photo actually is.
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:32.040]   And I was able to do that in about like three minutes.
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:33.040]   It was just so, so quick.
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:35.840]   The other stuff, I just gave you a link to just that one shot.
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:38.120]   The other stuff I may or may not have done this.
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:42.160]   Schlicher at Andy I's, his account on Flickr.
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:43.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:46.320]   But just showing you something that would have assumed that, "Well, I'm doing photography.
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:49.000]   I want to adjust the tone of the tone of...
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.640]   No, this is actually giving me the exact results I wanted.
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:57.280]   And if you have a prejudice against Instagram from a few years ago when it really was all
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:02.680]   about taking a really good picture and making it look like crap, it actually inspired me
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:06.160]   that it went to the gram that, "Oh, actually, oftentimes I will do something on Instagram
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:10.960]   and then try to replicate it in Lightroom because Instagram took me to a place with
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:13.200]   the photo that I really wanted to find."
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:18.240]   Snapsey for me is the equivalent of, "What if you haven't been using Photoshop for years
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:19.480]   and years and years?
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:23.600]   What if you just said, 'I want the lights to be not brighter but just have a little
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:26.160]   bit more contrast and be a little punchier?
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:27.160]   It's more like...
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:31.040]   I have a list of things I can play with over the course of three, four minutes by simply
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:34.360]   just nudging that slider left and right up and down.
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:37.680]   I will stop moving my thumb when it looks like how I wanted to look like and by the time
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:41.480]   you finish going through these filters, you have something that's really, really pretty
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:45.880]   and it's not just for doing screen images, it will handle raw, it will handle pretty much
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:47.120]   everything.
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:51.000]   It's for iOS and for Android and there's keep adding things and adding things and adding
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.000]   things to it.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.160]   It was a standalone app a few years ago, Google bought it and they're clearly putting
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:57.720]   all kinds of resources into it.
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:59.720]   If you look at the...
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:03.320]   They have, unfortunately, the official product page is a Google+ page.
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:04.320]   But that's where they will...
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.320]   Oops.
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:06.320]   I know, I know.
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:07.320]   But that's where they will show you.
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:08.320]   Here's all the stuff that...
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:13.080]   Every time they make an improvement to it, here's the stuff that we've added to it.
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:16.240]   The number of things you can do with this and also the number of things that's doing behind
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:20.440]   the scenes on your behalf, it's like...
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:26.080]   I thought that I'm not quite ready to publish the photo version of my iPhone Plus 7 review
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:27.960]   yet, but I wanted to give you...
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:31.680]   Here's an album of original pictures and then, well, no one just posts original pictures.
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:35.640]   So what if I also show you what it would look like if I were to edit all of them?
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:37.520]   And I thought that, well, maybe I'll do it in Lightroom.
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:38.520]   No, no, that's not fair.
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:42.080]   Okay, we'll use the standard Photos app and that's good, but now I kind of want to do
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:43.280]   it all in Lightroom.
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:48.760]   So I can still say I'm doing this all on the device, but Lightroom, I think, does more
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:51.880]   than the Photos app can do as good as the Photos app is.
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:58.280]   And it's also, I think, fulfills the mandate, the brief of the Photos app better where you
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:04.400]   don't have to know what any of these sliders do, you just can play with it until you get
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:07.560]   a picture that's much better than the one that you originally shot.
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:12.720]   So really, really happy with the snap seed and it's really gone way up in my book.
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:13.720]   Nice.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.160]   I agree with you 100%.
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:19.320]   It's my top photo app on both Android and iOS.
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:23.880]   As a tool for bamboozling people into thinking of more skill and better hardware than you
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:26.760]   actually have, I don't think it can be equaled.
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:29.680]   Lightroom and Lightroom Mobile is coming on strong.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:32.760]   I think in time that's going to be as good as Lightroom Desktop.
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:38.720]   And this is an example going back to our conversation about Touch versus Desktop of an
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:42.280]   app that really is still a critical app for me on the Desktop.
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:46.520]   As it gets better and better on the iPad Pro, it may come a day when I don't need to use
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:49.360]   Lightroom and Photoshop on a desktop.
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:55.160]   It's actually my preferred mode for editing Photos because the ability to simply have,
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:49:00.080]   it's like I'm holding an 8x10 color glossy picture.
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:03.200]   And I can actually make this great change under my hands.
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:06.520]   And I know I've got a screen here that's way bigger than the iPad Pro, but there's something
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.600]   about I'm holding this in my hand.
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:09.600]   This is in my lap.
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.840]   I'm holding a picture and I'm editing it.
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:14.840]   And to say nothing of the fact that I can do this wherever I go instead of just having
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:22.120]   to have a screen and a desk, I'm not as broken up about changes to the Mac Pro as other people
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:28.680]   because if Apple just keeps improving the iPad Pro, there might not be a need for me to
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:30.760]   have any laptop, Mac or Windows.
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:32.760]   Yeah.
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:36.560]   Well, and that's, I think that's kind of the end game or it's becoming clear that's
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:38.160]   going to be the end game for Apple.
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:39.160]   Sad.
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:40.760]   I thought you could buy any damn keyboard you want.
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.440]   Yeah, I love the Mac, but yeah.
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:45.480]   Renee Ritchie, your pick of the week.
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:48.760]   I just want to echo Andy's thing first because I love Snapseed and I love Lightroom Mobile
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:52.680]   and I kind of love John Nax and I think he had his hands in both of those things.
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:53.680]   Oh, interesting.
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:54.680]   I didn't know that.
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:59.480]   You still work in, you, he was the head of Photoshop Pro, Lightroom products at Godobee
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.680]   for years and years and years and then he went to Google last year.
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:03.680]   Oh, okay.
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:05.160]   I moved to Google like last year before.
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:06.160]   Oh, interesting.
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:07.160]   Yeah.
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:11.080]   It's, I've had a lot of conversations about John that makes me think that it's not like
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:12.080]   some sort of love.
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:15.400]   Every time, every time you think, oh, thank goodness Apple is taking this seriously.
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:21.720]   It's like, no, no, no, they've hired someone who is now really the man or the woman who
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:25.040]   you really want to charge this because they are passionate about photography or they're
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:30.000]   passionate about about, I don't know, bookkeeping or whatever.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.920]   Renee Ritchie, pick of the week.
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:36.920]   So I felt super bad about recommending the AirPods only to have them not chip, but in
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:39.560]   meantime, the Powerbeats three have shipped.
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:43.200]   I have the previous version of the East Trinity Caldwell got this version and she's going to
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:47.600]   be reviewing them, but basically this takes the Powerbeats and it puts the W1 chip in
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:48.600]   them.
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:53.120]   So you get the same kind of instant pairing automatic propagation to all your devices.
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:56.920]   So if you pair them with your iPhone automatically paired with your Apple watch over iCloud,
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:59.640]   it goes to your iPad and your Mac as well.
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:03.840]   If you have all those devices, it'll intelligently switch between them depending on which one
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:08.000]   it detects is doing the audio streaming at that point.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.400]   And also for people who just don't like Apple's earbud design because, you know, some people
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:16.960]   really just say they hurt their ears or it's not the right shape for their ears.
[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:18.280]   These offer a real difference.
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:22.120]   These are quasi in ear headphones, but they have the loop that goes around your ear and
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:24.080]   they're really sort of made for working out.
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:27.840]   So you can put them on, throw the loop around your head and I was doing rolling and the
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:28.840]   most wing running in them.
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:32.400]   I did a little bit of like grappling and I'm just to see if I could.
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:34.440]   And they stayed in really, really well.
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:37.600]   And you know, some people like beats, some people don't like beats, but they sounded
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:38.920]   pretty good to me.
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:41.520]   And with the W1 chip, they just work so easily.
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:45.960]   So if you're desperate, if you're desperate for AirPods or you love the idea of the technology,
[01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:49.440]   but you just don't like the AirPods shape, then the power beats for you or something to
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:50.440]   check out.
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:51.440]   Very nice.
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:56.000]   A couple of things for me to mention.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:01.680]   We were talking about Linux and people use Linux know that you can run a lot of Windows
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:06.440]   software on Linux using something called wine, which stands for wine is not an emulator,
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:09.920]   although it basically duplicates the Windows API.
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:14.720]   And many applications, including Microsoft Office, run very well on Linux.
[01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:17.120]   And I've often wondered why isn't there a wine for Mac?
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:22.400]   And I just wanted to point out it's not there yet, but there is a new tool called Darling
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:27.120]   that is the same idea of Mac OS translation layer for Linux.
[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:30.920]   At this point, you know, the project's pretty new.
[01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:33.800]   It doesn't yet run GUI Mac applications.
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:37.440]   So it's not, I'm not recommending at this point as something to use.
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:40.280]   But the good news is somebody's working on this.
[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:44.200]   And if you want to get involved or support it or just let them know you're interested
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:46.520]   in it, I think that would be fantastic.
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:52.320]   If you could run OS 10 executables on Linux, that would be one way to solve this whole
[01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:55.840]   issue.
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:57.800]   So we'll keep an eye on that.
[01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:03.080]   And you had mentioned in the past, I know you both loved Vesper note-tamping, taking
[01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:07.640]   app, which kind of went out of business, sad to say.
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:12.560]   There's an app that I haven't used very much yet on the Mac App Store that is a featured
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:20.960]   app today called Bear that will import your Vesper notebooks and give you a similar experience.
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:23.920]   With some nice features, you can use Markdown if you want.
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:29.080]   We've seen enough notebooks now to know, you know, this is a fairly crowded category.
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:33.800]   It's free, although with the Pro version, you can sync via cloud kits so you can use it.
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:36.440]   It is available for iPad, iPhone and Mac.
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:42.440]   And if you pay $15 a year or I think $2 a month, you have the ability to do sync across
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:48.640]   all your platforms, export to JPEG and PDF and a variety of other formats.
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:52.520]   And then they have some nice themes that you can choose from.
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:56.680]   But there's a free one month trial or one week trial right now.
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:58.760]   And you can do a lot of this for free.
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:02.560]   One of the things I love, I'm a big fan of wikis.
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:05.200]   And this has a kind of a wiki-like feature.
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:14.880]   If I type a hashtag, this is a tag into a document and hit return.
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:17.120]   It'll show up over here.
[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:24.440]   So it's a very easy way to put, kind of, organize your stuff and put tags in it so you
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:30.280]   can quickly jump to a particular part of the writing.
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:33.840]   They say it's for both pros and notes.
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:35.640]   And I think it looks pretty nice.
[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:37.280]   Markdown support.
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:41.640]   It has limited font support, not all the fonts, not all the Mac fonts.
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:44.400]   I think it has a handful of fonts.
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:46.600]   Let's see here.
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:47.680]   I know it's here somewhere.
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:52.520]   I think Avenir is one of the Avenir Next System, Helvetica New in Menlo.
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:56.000]   It's kind of the basic style fonts.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.600]   I don't know if people are looking for replacement for Vesper still, but if you are, at least
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:05.760]   this imports your Vesper files, which would certainly save you a lot of time.
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:07.040]   Have you guys tried Berry yet?
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:09.040]   I think it's pretty new.
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:10.520]   I got sucked into Apple Notes.
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:12.080]   It just was everywhere at the time.
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:13.720]   No, Apple Notes is really good.
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:18.280]   It's actually, especially with the geofencing and things like that, they do a good job.
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:20.360]   Maybe you don't need something like this.
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:21.360]   But here's an option.
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:24.120]   But if you want to have an ear, Apple will not give it to you, so you can go and get it
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:25.120]   from there.
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:26.120]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:30.800]   I was looking with Groover that if they really want to support the app, all they have to do
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:35.520]   is that at one time in-app purchase, $999, you get that font and you will loan.
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:40.480]   You have the only copy of Avenir for Vesper, the only copy of Futura.
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:43.440]   I think they have enough designery friends that they would have easily funded it.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.960]   I like Avenir a lot.
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:49.440]   It's a San Serif, very nice, well-designed, pretty font.
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:56.040]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of this fine episode, Election Day.
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:56:00.640]   I am going to offer you a break now so you can run out to the polls.
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:03.480]   Then we'll continue with the security now in one minute.
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:04.720]   So quickly, go vote.
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:07.120]   Andy, Andy, I have.
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:11.280]   I'm sure Andy has or is planning to if he hasn't yet.
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:13.280]   This is my voted sticker.
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:15.280]   I voted for Sathulu.
[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:16.280]   Exactly.
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:17.280]   It's a right-in vote.
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:20.920]   But if you can spell it, you should get it.
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:22.120]   That's my point of view.
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:25.720]   Andy's at the Chicago Sun Times and also blogs at CWOB.
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:26.720]   Does a lot.com.
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:30.920]   Does a lot of other podcasts on the 5x5 network.
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:35.520]   He does a Google podcast, Material on replay.
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:38.320]   And of course, he joins us every Tuesday and we're glad of it.
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:39.320]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:40.320]   We lay FM.
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:41.320]   But thank you.
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:42.320]   Relay FM.
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:43.320]   Let's say the whole thing.
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:45.840]   I can't remember.tv or .fm.
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:46.840]   So good.
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:47.840]   Relay.fm.
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:52.880]   Thanks also to Renee Richie, who has his own series of podcasts, including the excellent
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:53.880]   Apple Talk.
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:59.040]   You'll find that at iMore.com along with his million word a year writing.
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:02.440]   Guy is amazing and joins us every Tuesday.
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:03.440]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:05.280]   Are you going to get to stay home for a little while now?
[01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:06.720]   All the travel's over?
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:08.200]   I think so.
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:09.200]   You never know.
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:10.200]   I hope so.
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:11.200]   We'll see.
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:12.200]   Technology is interesting.
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:13.200]   Yeah.
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:16.200]   Don't forget CES coming up.
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:18.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:20.200]   I know.
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:23.480]   We'll see everything we're not going to get next year.
[01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:28.560]   We do Mac break weekly every Tuesday, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time.
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:30.880]   That's 1900 UTC.
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:33.200]   I hope you will join us live.
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:34.920]   Visit the chatroom at IRC.tuit.tv.
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:36.560]   But if you can't, we can make on demand versions available.
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:37.920]   Of course we can.
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:39.160]   We have the technology.
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:44.160]   Just go to tuit.tv/mbw for your audio or video download or subscribe.
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:50.160]   That way you'll get every single episode and you can choose iTunes or Stitcher, Slack
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:57.160]   or TuneIn, Internet, radio or the many Twitter apps on almost every platform, including Roku
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:57:59.000]   and Apple TV.
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.080]   So there's plenty of ways to get it.
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:02.840]   But if you subscribe that way, you get it every single week.
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:03.840]   Yes.
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:04.840]   I saw it.
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:05.840]   Zoom.
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:06.840]   It's available on the Zoom.
[01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:09.920]   We can probably take that off now.
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:11.680]   Twitter.tv/mbw.
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:12.680]   Thanks, guys.
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:13.680]   Thanks.
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:14.680]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:15.680]   Thanks to all of you.
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:16.680]   We'll see you next week.
[01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:17.680]   Andy, thanks, Kristen.
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:21.800]   Back to voting and then to work because break time is over.
[01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:32.200]   [music]
