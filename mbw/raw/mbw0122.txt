[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   >> They're available in Turkey, Bob and Brown.

[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   >> We're live, by the way, on the show floor at Macworld Expo.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   We've just got back from the Shiller note, and we're going to talk a little bit
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   about what Phil Shiller announced and about Macworld, the future of Macworld
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Expo. Alex Lindsey is here from the Pixel Core.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   >> Hello, hello.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   >> Good to see you again, Alex.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   >> Scott, I'm surprised you're not in line at the Apple store to buy that new 17-inch.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   >> That's why God made assistance.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   >> Sitting to Scott's right, I'm so glad to welcome him back to the Mac Break Weekly
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   panel. Mr. Merlin Mann, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   >> Hi, thanks for the opportunity.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   >> And you can tell that he's been missed by everybody. Merlin's at 43folders.com
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   and he's the greatest.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   >> I think he looks very nice today.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   >> He looks nice today.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   >> He's an hair product.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   >> I got some hair issues today.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   >> He's the funniest show on the intranet.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   >> The check is in the mail.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   >> To his right, Craig Severson, old friend, good friend, always shows up in Macworld
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Expo.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   >> Thank you.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   >> Craig is an instructional education expert and he also is an educational
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   instruction expert also, of course, the pod grunt, the video grunt.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And he's had some hands-on with the iLife and iWork package, so we're going to ask him
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   about that. And all the way at the end of the panel last, but certainly not least on
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   the calendar of ScreenCasts online.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   >> Thank you.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   >> Thank you.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   >> Who came the farthest today.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   >> Yeah, flew in especially for this, I thought.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   >> So glad.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   >> I was invited to admit the effort and two planes later and five, six thousand
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   miles, I'm here.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   >> We're so glad to have you, Don.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   >> Thank you.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   >> I'm going to see you.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   >> You can tell from us, he comes from Texas.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   >> So, Craig, you've had a little hands-on with iLife and iWork.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   The problem with a demo like Phil did is that a demo can always be crafted to look
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   better than the product really is.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   It was an impressive demo.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   >> Yeah, they're very impressive.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I was working on the tutorials for the products that are now that
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   went live just a few minutes ago.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   So on apple.com, the individual tutorials were different details about iWork and
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   the iLife suite.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So, happily, yeah, I was able to work with them pretty intensely for the
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   past month and a half at Apple itself.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   And it was a part of the team that made these tutorials.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And they are really quite impressive.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   >> The iMovie has taken that leap where there are a lot of features on it that I
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   really hope can translate in some way to the pro apps, at least in terms of that.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   >> Isn't that funny?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   >> That's the opposite direction.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Alex Lindsay, I was sitting in between Alex Lindsay and Chris Burillo, and Alex was
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   getting all excited about that.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   One of the new features in iMovie is the ability to take shaky video and unshake it.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And I was skeptical, but it looks good.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   >> Yeah, this is very new to iMovie, but that stuff has been in motion, for instance.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And a lot of this is what we call optical flow.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   So what it's doing is analyzing the frames.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   There's a long wait period.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   What we didn't see in the keynote or in the film note is that there's a long wait period.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   You have to have it analyze the footage.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Now, you can have it analyze just the footage you need, but you do that and you
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   let it run through that.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And it looks at every pixel and figures out where they're all going.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   >> Wait a minute.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And he did it was in real time.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   >> After you do the calculation.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   >> So, did he previously cook it?
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   >> Yes.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   >> Okay.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   >> He's doing this for under.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   >> So, it'll save all that cash data.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   >> All right.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   >> So, you'll cook it.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I mean, this is what I'm assuming is happening.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I mean, you can--
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   >> I don't know the technical--
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   >> The way the way it gave the impression that it was all rendered in real time.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   >> No.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   He said no rendering because I don't think he was doing output.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Probably like a lot of these things, the renders on output.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   >> Well, but there's a-- and I just know that the way it works in motion and the way it works
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   with most optical flow is what you're actually doing is it analyzes all the pixels and
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   figures out where they're all going.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And that-- and once it's done, everything is instant.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   >> That's great.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   >> So, you'll see that in motion.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   >> Where once it's done cooking, everything is you can slow it down, you can stabilize it,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   all those things, because it now knows where those pixels were supposed to go.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   And it's very, very powerful, and it's really exciting to see it.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   >> And how much was motion when they first started shipping it?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   >> I was like 300 bucks.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   >> Yeah, when they-- when they first started-- but the thing is, this technology not too long ago was
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   big high end.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   >> What about when it was part of the--
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   >> It's a shake.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   >> Oh, well, shake thousand.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   >> $3,000.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   >> It has a funny feel to it, because it looks like stuff's gliding a little bit.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   >> Well, the one thing that you'll notice if it's too shaking is you're going to see the motion-- it doesn't remove the motion blur.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   So, you'll see motion--
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   >> There'll be blur.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   >> So, you'll see blur--
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   >> Without anything moving.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   >> -- without any-- at least what you see in motion, the implementation of motion.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   I haven't-- you know, we don't know about-- I haven't really gotten the "Big Into I" movie,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   but that's what you typically see.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   But for little handheld stuff and little things that are just a little off when you're holding it.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   >> It's pretty good.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   >> It is profoundly good.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   >> What-- so we should just say that $79 for the-- they call it the upgrade, because everybody already has it.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   $99 for the family pack of five-- up to five reviews.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   That's always been a great deal.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   That'll be available late January.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I work as available now, same price.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   >> And the new I work online was also very impressive.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Let's finish with "I Life" and we'll talk about I work online.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   But just to complete a new 17-inch MacBook as well, and some big announcements with iTunes, which we're going to get to in a little bit.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I movie any other points you wanted to make, Alex?
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   I mean-- or go ahead, Merlin Mann.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   >> Just to say, I've started making some videos with "I Movie" using that as just so simple, the existing version of "I Movie."
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   >> A lot of people hated it.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   >> Well, I mean, I like the old one, okay, and I like the new one, okay, but it still is just--
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   for me, mostly it was just light on its feet.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   If you have to do just the most rudimentary bit of titles and editing, it's great, but stuff like the end will have audio run across more than one clip.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   >> Isn't that cool?
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   >> I mean, it's really limiting.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Like, maybe I just don't know how to use it.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   >> But you haven't seen the new one, that's the point.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   >> No, that's what I'm saying.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I'm saying, like, right now it's a huge pain to see titles where you want to bring out audio.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   >> No, I'm with you.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   >> But no, I think it's going to be great.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I mean, it seems like the one theme through all of this stuff is just kind of polished.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   >> Polish and just kind of bringing out more of this, like, little pitta power in the functionality that make you look better without a lot of extra work.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   >> And the strategy to do street edit points is a lot more improved in this new version.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   >> Huge.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   >> That was one of the big problems for me.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   I went back to the old iMovie because I wanted more precise editing control, specifically over audio.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Now the demonstration we saw today over audio, man, that was really cool.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   >> You zoom in and you get really fine control of both audio and video.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   >> The way it works right now, you almost have to think of it like if you go all, if you pull the slider all the way down to where every clip is very tiny, and do the kind of selection where you just select the whole thing and drop it in like a postage stamp, it works great.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   >> Because if you do anything with scrubbing and editing, it's a huge pain.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   >> It's hard.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   It's hard.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Do you use iMovie for Eleanor or your movies of Eleanor?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   What do you, uh...
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   >> Yeah, no, I saw that's all 1080.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   >> [laughter]
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   >> Rolling with the red.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   And when she spits up, I mean...
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   >> Every detail.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   >> Every detail.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   >> Every detail.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   >> [laughter]
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   >> What else?
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   They didn't show up, but there's green screen capabilities in this as well, yeah?
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   >> We mentioned that.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   >> We haven't seen what's there yet.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   >> So we're, hopefully that'll be cool.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   >> If it works anything like photo booth, I bet it'll look really professional.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   >> [laughter]
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   >> I can do it in front of a stucco wall, so it actually has a little bit of movement.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   >> Craig Severson, you've played with this.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Is there anything in there that we didn't see in a demo that we're going to get all excited about?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Any hidden features that you might want to point out?
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   >> I'm moving not as much, but it is, for me, the whole thing is the slow and the experience
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   has just really been improved.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   >> It shows the strategy of tearing it down and starting over, laying a good foundation
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   which everybody hates in '08 has paid off here.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   >> Right, because they have two modes for each clip.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   You can do a, you can trim the actual clip itself.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   This is after you've thrown it into your project.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   And then you have the precision editor, which is the thing that I think is the coolest part.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Which we're talking about now with both the audio and the video.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   It has made it really easy and I'd really like to see that translated into other apps.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   >> One of the things that I think you saw them talk about a couple times, the tip I'm being
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   mentioned is everything is in real time.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   So one of the things we're used to in Final Cut or other programs or even the old iMovie
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   is there's render, render, render, you add a new transition, render, you add this, render.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   >> Render, render, render, render.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   >> Everything, yeah.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   >> Render, render, render, render.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   >> Everything is in real time.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   So when you're doing all those edits, when you're adding all those effects, when you're
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   doing all those pieces, once they've been analyzed, you're always getting a real time feedback.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   And I think what I think that what the direction is is just to keep on growing with the hardware.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   >> So you're always going to have real time and you're just going to keep on getting more
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   every year as the hardware gets faster.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   >> Yeah, but I mean like to be the turd in the punch bowl, how is this going to run on a MacBook
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Air?
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   >> We missed the turd in the phone here.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   >> We don't buy the Air for this.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   >> But I mean it's still a consumer app.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   It's not, otherwise you would be running Final Cut Pro on a giant power.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   >> Like on my MacBook Air, like running stuff like this, I'm just imagining this.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   You know, because when you're doing that, I'm fixing the sheer.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   >> And you're going to fill up your drive in no time.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   >> Right.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Does that, do you think it works for somebody who's got a MacBook Air?
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Is this a good app?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   >> Yeah, I think I bet you a MacBook would probably handle it pretty well.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   I'm not sure about a MacBook Air.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I'm not entirely sure what the difference is.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   I mean like as far as the graphics.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   >> Is there any of the Apple booths and seeing it running on a MacBook or a MacBook Air?
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   >> A lot worse on the MacBook Air.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   >> And then play with it.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   >> Take the processors like opening an app.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   >> They are, they are, ah, red.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   >> Craig, do you know if there's any open geo and used in this?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I don't know the technical details.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   >> Well they did say it requires Leopard or later and I think it's really clear here that,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   you know, once again that Apple's benefiting from 4video and all of these really.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   >> Core animation for sure.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   >> Core animation, this underlying technology that they've been building in slowly into
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   OS 10 is really paying off.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   >> One thing that I was interested in that they haven't gone back to the traditional timeline.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   There was so much outcry with the first version that people really, really missed the traditional
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   timeline and when Phil was saying, well, you know, we've listened to the feedback and we've tweaked it.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   I was, in some respects, I was quite surprised that they'd stuck with the fluid timeline that they have.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   But they've made it better by adding the precision editing in and all these other features.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   And that drop feature whereby you get the context sensitive menu that pops up and you can actually
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   select.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   It's so simple to do that.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   I think that's probably a less district really.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   >> And I think really it's still going to be one of those things that if you want to get into
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   multi, you know, lots of multi-frag and a lot of those controls.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   >> There is Final Cut Express.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   I think that's kind of the, you know, this is where I want to put together simple things really,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   really fast.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   I don't want, and it really is designed for exactly the audience that it's, you know,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   designed for.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And if you, a lot of us have push time, if we were did push time, it would be a lot further.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   But it is really aimed at making their job easier, not necessarily a pro being able to do crazy
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   things in time.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   >> Last thing on NIMO, along the lines of being a consumer app, is there is a new feature that
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   has a cover flow ability to go through all of your events.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   So you can, at full screen, so it enables you to literally go through your entire library
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   quickly without any editing.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   That's really good for consumers.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   So, you know, they upload this footage.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   What have I got?
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Didn't want to edit it.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   >> There's this very nice cover flow methodology used in the full screen preview, which is cool.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   >> I photo looks good.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   I'm a little bit -- >> Oh, yeah.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   >> Finally, we can talk about the cool thing.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   I'm a little -- actually, I'm upset because I'm a big Lightroom guy.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   You're an aperture guy.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   And now I have to keep two copies of every photo so that I can use face recognition and
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   place recognition and all of that.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   >> How many people are interested in geotagging?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Is that a big deal to photo?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   >> Oh, I think it's huge.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I think, you know, we finally found an application that makes geotagging relevant because I was
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   sitting around scratching my something trying to figure out why we cared about geotagging.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   And then I saw --
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   >> Stocking.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   >> I saw --
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   >> Stocking.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   >> Stocking.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   >> I'm going to chase you to make yourself available for stalking.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   >> And then I saw that and I thought, my gosh, that actually makes, for the first time to
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   me, as an old guy, geotagging seems relevant.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And I'm glad to see that my investment in the FBI's facial recognition system is going
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   to finally pay off for me as a consumer.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   >> We don't know where it came from.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   There's a couple of companies.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I remember we interviewed a company in Toronto.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   >> We paid for it one way or the other.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   >> Probably, right.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   >> We did.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   >> Well, but this was a Canadian company.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Maybe the Canadian Air Force is that it?
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   >> Oh.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   >> That will work.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   >> It's pretty cool.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Again, you know, it's a demo.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   I'd be very curious to see how it works in the real world.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   >> Have you played with Jack?
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   >> Sorry.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   It works really well.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Because I gave it a fairly robust trial.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   And naturally, it worked better as the live --
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   >> You shouldered a butt.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   >> That's what you did.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   >> You shouldered like a butt or a cat or something.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And it was -- we just kicked those out.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   >> Hey, wouldn't that be cool?
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   >> I'm not talking about that right now.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   >> Like, you could take a picture of a bug.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   >> A new body.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   >> A butt.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   >> Like, like, like --
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   >> A butt.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   >> Or, you know, whatever part.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   >> I think it's a lot of fun.

[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   When you come back, there's posters of things that are now there that weren't there before.

[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   >> Make sure it has the name title in the year of the thing.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   >> In there.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   >> As it usually does.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   >> Cat photos.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   >> 2008.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   >> It is a great way to store your stuff.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Right now $50 off instantly.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   If you go to that address Drobo.com/macbreak on your brand new 800.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Firewire 800 Drobo with USB 2.0.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   It is a must have for your backup and storage needs.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Thank you, Drobo, for your support.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   I work is also out.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   New keynote.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   In fact, Craig tells me that we'll be doing my presentation on Thursday in the new keynote
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   '09.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   >> I'm excited.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   >> You know it is awesome.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   For keynote nerds like me, the new things are really, really fantastic.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   They have some new alignment guides where you throw down objects onto a slide.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   These alignment guides come up and they show you that you're spacing between objects.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   So once you have all three objects, three or four, in the same space, it goes blank.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   It just shows you how many pixels apart they are.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   I mean, for a layout geek, it's pure heaven.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   And there's also a lot of improvements on the way you do actions and builds on the inside.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   Lots of details that really make it a lot more precise.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   He was making gestures.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   >> What?
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   >> No, I'm not.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   >> Leo's interpretation for my interpretive band.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   >> He's doing my interpretive band.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   >> Sign languages a little bit rough, but I learned that in the ballet.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   >> In ballet or ballet?
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   >> Ballet.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   >> When I was there with the tie-light llama.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   >> So it's cool.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   >> I love the thing that you could do.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   They showed it with cards, but obviously you could do with a lot of things where you have
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   them in one order, in one slide, another order in the other slide, and it will automatically
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   transition and reorganize the stuff.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   >> That, each one has to be an individual object.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   It has to be the same object in the second slide for the tour.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   >> The same object in the second slide.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   It's their new thing called magic move.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   But it's a very fast way to get things to precisely move from one slide to the next.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   It will do a difference in location and scaling.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   All you need to do is make another slide, rescale it and move it, put on that transition.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   >> What I was going for.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   >> That's visual.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   >> Was that the audio effect provided by Bruce Lee?
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   >> That's the interpretive dance by Leo.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   >> Pages which has always been a good word processor, okay word processor, more for presentation.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   You must like Merlin the idea that you can get this blank screen.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   >> Why me?
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   >> We call it Merlin feature.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   >> What was the word processor?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   >> Right, I recommend it.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   >> There's a bunch of the right screen mode.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   I think it's a really neat idea.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   I'm not sure how much people will use it that aren't heavily medicated dorks like me.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   >> The ADD button.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   >> Another thing that strikes me about the I work apps like the I play.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   What is it?
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   >> It's a lot of life.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   >> It's really interesting to me that Apple is constantly, this is a kind of a Gruber sort
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   of point, but Apple is constantly confounding companies who expect them to emulate someone
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   else.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   You look at an app like pages and it's so in your face.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   You know what?
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Here's what we're going to do.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   We're going to make this kind of application that we want to make.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   It must be so confounding to their competitors that they're never chasing the thing that
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   people quite think that they're chasing.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Look at us.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   We come to this thing.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   We come here and they're forever coming up with something, at least in my experience I've
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   never heard of.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   And then they come up with some pages and they pull up this thing and it's been an open source
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   with the full screen mode.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   That's something that's been an open source and kind of shareware apps for a while.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Does that make any sense?
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   >> Yeah, I think the way I would interpret it is it's very difficult to predict where Apple's
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   going to go.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   It's very hard to look at where they are and say what they're going to do next.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   >> They're constantly redefining what the rules of the game are.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.280]   And so they won't compete fairly because they won't have the fight that other people want
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.280]   them to have.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.000]   Microsoft would much rather have them go we're going to really get into macros.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   >> Right.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   >> They're like no we just want this thing to be awesome.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   >> Right.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   >> Macros?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.680]   >> I think this is a really important point.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:17.200]   People might say well we want to see new hardware at Mac world expo but you got to have the software
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:21.680]   and the best way to compete against an IBM PC compatible on Microsoft Windows is to
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.440]   have something like iMovie and say take that Windows Movie Maker.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:30.120]   I mean it just is a very compelling selling point for Macintosh.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.320]   You've got to have the software and the fact that it comes with it is great.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.960]   They also offer a deal on iWork.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.280]   In fact they announced some bundles which are interesting.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:44.520]   My new Mac iWork is only 49 bucks and they have a $169 bundle that's iWork iLife both
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.920]   '09 and leopard so if you have to make if you know you have an older Mac you have to make
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:49.920]   that upgrade.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:50.920]   That's it.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:55.920]   >> You have to have the price of Vista to get the new OS plus all the apps you need to
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:56.920]   really do a lot of work.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.560]   >> Do you think that Apple is thinking about Microsoft?
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.560]   I mean you think that they're trying to compete or is it not?
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.560]   >> Or when they make an ad.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.880]   >> I think the trust is trying to create cool software.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:13.080]   I mean going back to the iPhoto I mean we've all heard how many Macs have been sold on the
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.080]   back of photo booth.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.000]   You know people see photo booth is so cool that it's so cool that it's so much greater.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.040]   >> You show someone that face recognition software.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.360]   >> I mean I'm awfully undisciplined and I've got thousands of photos that I know I must
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.640]   tag but I just haven't just haven't got the time to go through and tag them and now with
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.080]   iPhoto in one fell swoop you know I want to tag things by people and it'll just do it
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.040]   for us so you know people see that in the Apple store they're going to just buy a Mac
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.040]   based on what I want to have.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.720]   >> Every family event every family event when I whip out a computer this got photo booth
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.160]   on it every person in the room is delighted.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.960]   >> I've sold two Macs that way to family just want photo booth on it.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.960]   >> Did you get a commission?
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.960]   >> No they're not very bright either they drink a lot so they buy whatever I tell them.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.960]   >> Oh that's cool.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.960]   >> That's so terrific.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:56.120]   >> I think it's totally right and look at like whatever Guy Kawasaki say what you will
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.120]   about the man today.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.120]   But what did he do?
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.960]   He helped make this platform great by saying that like the reason people are going to come
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.160]   to this is because the applications are fantastic.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.440]   >> It's about ultimately it is about software it's got to be about software.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:11.160]   You know I also was in the nick of time that iFo have came out because had you asked me
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.240]   what my pick of the week was going to be it was going to be the new Picasa for Mac which
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:19.760]   is just now coming out and is a lot better than the old iFo do and all of a sudden Apple
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.040]   leap frogs them with the face recognition and the places.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:29.720]   >> I know as an aperture user I'm really stuck with wow I'm bummed for I use my iFo.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.040]   Now I have to have two copies one in light room and one in iFo because I want those features.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.600]   >> This is what I thought and then you can move it to aperture later.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:41.280]   >> Well my might might you should be my hope and desire Joe Schor in case you're listening
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:47.680]   is that some of these features would migrate up which is an unusual migration path but
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.560]   I'd like to see some of these features migrate up in the aperture.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.560]   >> Absolutely.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.520]   >> It's not going to depend on whether to make aperture a priority.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.520]   >> Was that a pun?
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.520]   It's kind of a photo joke.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.520]   >> Oh I get it.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.520]   >> I get it.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.160]   >> I shudder to think if you're going to make another joke like this.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.000]   >> I can't quite focus on what you're saying.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   >> You keep this up you'll be isolated.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   >> Oh.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   >> Touchdown.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   >> I have a winner.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.640]   >> I shudder to think.
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.880]   >> Ladies and gentlemen the previously unscripted minute would brought to you by.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.880]   >> Backworld.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.880]   >> Backworld.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.880]   >> All right enough of that.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.880]   >> Oh just have to stop it please.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:20.880]   >> I really.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.880]   >> That's good.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.880]   >> Wow.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.200]   >> You guys are a bunch of camera nerds.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.400]   I think the iWork online also looks very compelling.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.640]   Again another shot across Google's bow.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.920]   I mean it's Google Docs that this competes with right?
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:34.920]   >> No.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:35.920]   >> No.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.920]   >> You're not creating documents online.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:37.920]   >> Ah you're right.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.000]   >> That's been Google Docs.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   >> Not yet.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   >> Right.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   >> Good point.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   >> But you have to have iWork to do this and that's a disadvantage.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Although you can share with anyone.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   >> You have to have iWork on the back end though.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.360]   >> Right but you have to create and share you have to start with iWork.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.440]   But then anybody can use it which I think is nice.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.440]   >> And give them it a minute.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.480]   >> It's going to be a fee based service and they didn't say whether that was subscription
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.240]   or whether it's not part of mobile me.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.720]   It should be part of your mobile me.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.880]   >> Well maybe you don't want it to be part of mobile me.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.920]   But given the fact that that battleship is still taking on water.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.920]   >> No come on.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.760]   I mean it's obviously part of mobile me.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.760]   >> It should come with mobile me.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:09.760]   >> It's perfectly for me.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.760]   >> Absolutely for me.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:11.760]   >> Drop box, drop box.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.760]   >> No.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.760]   >> I've turned iDISK off.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:14.760]   >> If it doesn't have the word box.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:21.760]   >> I put a piece of black tape over the screen so I don't have to see the iDISK thing that
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.760]   keeps mounting.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:28.880]   Oh actually you know what I do want you to overwrite all of my contacts I should have
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.120]   said.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.160]   It's Tuesday so what else would I do?
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:37.480]   But don't you think, I mean like it does kind of seem like a pretty straight play at
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.480]   Google Docs.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.480]   You think?
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:45.200]   >> Well Craig made the point and you isn't for creating online but in every other respect
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.400]   yeah and certainly if I'm working you know I was thinking how I could share documents
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.840]   with other people about what we're working on and they can mark it up I think for the
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:57.400]   Craig and I working on the keynote slides that would be a very useful tool and I can
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.240]   see a lot of ways to use it immediately.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.600]   >> More of a push against the acrobat a lot of the acrobat.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.800]   >> We do a lot of that with acrobat.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.800]   >> You do.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:13.040]   >> Acrobat has a lot of markup features and you can put lots of little stars and little
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:18.000]   I used to think that the stars meant good job and evidently you have to click on them.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.360]   It turns out there's a big long note about how bad this is.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:29.040]   So anyway but a lot of those kind of features seem to be available in this network.com.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.440]   >> And the markup ability some pages is improved from the previous version.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:37.560]   >> Have you guys looked at Dropbox for stuff like this?
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.560]   >> Yes.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.160]   >> I mean everything I do now is in Dropbox.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:45.200]   I share a document with somebody and there's revisions every time it's saved and it's knock
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.840]   on whatever this is.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.640]   It's never failed me once.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:52.080]   So I'm just curious because I mean like with that it seems like you could natively open
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.720]   any kind of document.
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.720]   I don't know.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.720]   I mean I'm not sure if this is true.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.920]   >> It depends on the revision capability compared with this.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.600]   I don't know this could be a long shot but one thing I thought was when you open it on
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.640]   the receiving end it looks a lot like pages.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:10.040]   And wouldn't this be masterful of Apple to say those of you stuck using Microsoft Word
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.960]   notice the pretty thing on the left here.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.280]   That's what it looks like in pages.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.760]   Maybe they might say well that's kind of pretty.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.760]   Maybe I prefer to use that than this thing here.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.680]   >> Do you think Apple wants to get into this services business, this web app business,
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.400]   this was kind of a surprise to me.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:30.600]   I heard the rumors and I thought this doesn't seem like something Apple wants to do especially
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.840]   go up against Google and Microsoft by the way is moving into this big time with mesh.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.200]   >> Doesn't really feel like it's a pineapple to me.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.200]   >> It doesn't make sense.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.840]   I mean like they have such a spotty God bless them.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.920]   The people who work on this team are great people but let's be honest the mobile me stuff
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.920]   is so spotty.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.800]   The last thing I would do I mean if they've got holes in the roof at their house and they're
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.240]   trying to build an office building.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.560]   >> Maybe they feel they have to because that's where stuff's moving?
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.360]   >> That's me is like that's not an Apple move.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.840]   >> It doesn't seem like it.
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.440]   This is one where they surprise me and I wouldn't have predicted this.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.120]   I saw the rumors and I thought it doesn't make a lot of sense.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.280]   Google's really there.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.560]   Microsoft's going to be really there and I don't know if it's a good play for Apple.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.640]   >> These are going to be packages or like when you put a document up there what all the
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.720]   images it'll be like you follow what I'm saying.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.120]   I can see this being a very heavy thing to use.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.080]   >> It saves it three ways automatically.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:25.960]   So it saves the native version of PDF and then kind of a plain text or CSV or that type
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.960]   of thing.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.760]   >> Also what about security?
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.640]   >> You set up passwords for individuals who look at it.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.640]   >> Okay.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.240]   >> I guess we could trust Apple with that stuff.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.280]   >> Like I say it's not a creation document.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.040]   It's not a creation engine.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.040]   >> It's a sharing engine.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:46.840]   >> I don't know anything about this whole program but if it's stopped there that kind
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:47.840]   of makes sense to me.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.080]   >> It does accept that it doesn't seem like Apple's not in business.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.280]   I mean this is a business tool.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.480]   >> In a sense but it's still a very handy consumer tool.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.120]   You can think about it.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:01.200]   >> I mean yeah sharing a document is somewhat of a point.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:06.760]   >> I know that this is a perfect application for my wife's parents are constantly having
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:11.520]   her set up announcements for their homeowners association and the other things that they're
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.360]   doing she just needs to lay them out.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.880]   >> So they'll send her the raw text and she'll lay it all out for them.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:17.880]   This is the perfect thing.
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.040]   They don't want to go into numbers or are in order to pay.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.400]   They just want to, she could just post it and they could put little notes on it.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.920]   >> What do you know about me?
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.640]   >> You could do that with mobile me and I web if they'd update I web.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:31.920]   >> I mean how many of you have used photo sharing on mobile me?
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.560]   Anybody in the audience who's photo sharing?
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.560]   Very small number.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.560]   >> Not very many.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.560]   >> You did it one accidently I think.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:41.360]   >> Yeah and that was sort of a very disturbing moment.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.000]   >> Black background it was really good.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.200]   Yeah one of those arms.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:49.040]   >> Well but that's an example though of kind of the same idea and if people aren't using
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.680]   it for photos which is very natural something we're very used to.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.280]   >> Remember photo casting?
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.280]   >> I do remember that.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.280]   >> Yeah there's another one.
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.280]   Photo casting.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.640]   >> I actually use photo casting for my photo for these.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:06.800]   They have a e-starling makes these little frames that can watch a photo cast and change
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.880]   the frames and so I got those for my parents and for my parents in law so that I can take
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:15.040]   new pictures of my son and just put them up on this cast and it changes the frame in
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.680]   their living room.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:21.040]   And it doesn't need to connect to the computer it connects straight to Wi-Fi it looks at
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:26.000]   it can look at Flickr or iPhoto or all these other things and I got to say that I would
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.600]   never send them pictures after having that because they can just get a live feed that
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.600]   changes every week that's appearing on there.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:38.080]   It is useful just that a lot of people haven't started playing with it.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.640]   >> I'm going to take a break we're going to come back we're going to talk about Macworld
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.560]   Expo the future Macworld without Apple without Steve Jobs.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:48.560]   I also want to talk to, we haven't mentioned at all any other vendor it's been an all Apple
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:54.320]   show are there other vendors out there and I think Macware a fusion is here and we'll
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.760]   talk to them in just a little bit.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:00.760]   >> Do you want to mention our friends at audible.com Merlin we missed you we don't have any audible
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.680]   pics from Merlin man I don't know.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:09.200]   >> No that's a really good.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:12.640]   >> I'm just throwing it out there.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:17.560]   >> Audible.com/Macbreak don't say Spartans.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:21.000]   >> I should have scot worn up.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   >> He's a first.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.720]   >> I'm still listening to it.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.920]   I'm into it like our number 27.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:31.920]   >> It is.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:37.400]   >> I keep hearing that guy from 300 doing the voice as opposed to the guy doing the
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.400]   voice.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.640]   >> I wonder where Andy and I go is.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.640]   >> He's a MIA.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.560]   >> We had hope to have him on the show.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:51.880]   >> I'm going to recommend I was which is wasniacs biography not read by Steve wasniac but
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:57.040]   read by a guy with a suitably nerdy voice and unless you know Steve you'll go that must
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.800]   be Steve because he really sounds like him.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:03.640]   It's a great history of Steve wasniac how I invented the personal computer and started
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:10.120]   a revolution it's a really fun book but one of 51,000 great titles online at audible.com

[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.520]   >> It's something that works on a zoom.

[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:13.200]   >> The thing is you have to read it for 10,000 hours before I get it.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:18.160]   I've got some stats on that.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.720]   >> We are going to start talking to some of the other people who are here because Leanne

[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.600]   So they're going to come out now they're not all going to come out this week.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.240]   >> Will you get Merlin to do Tiny Town?
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.200]   >> Yeah I mean I got a phone I want to do this.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.680]   >> Tiny Town, Tiny Town.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.360]   >> Tiny Town looks great this year.
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.560]   >> We got Merlin doing Tiny Town.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.560]   >> What is Tiny Town?
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.400]   >> That's in the back there the cool small booths where it's not.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.560]   >> Yeah it's two tiny towns you got the developer a little highlight zone there and then you
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.840]   got the guys on it.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.560]   >> They're always the best booths always the best people go say hi to them.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:10.560]   >> They deserve it.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.560]   >> They deserve it.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.880]   >> Pound for pound they're the ones who are kind of spending the most out of their budget
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.880]   to be here.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.320]   >> They're always their house to be here.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.720]   >> They're scrappy they're scrappy and they're good people.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.600]   >> Are we not going to talk about the MacBook Pro though?
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.440]   >> Okay MacBook Pro 17 inch.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:28.040]   Scott Warren's going to buy one now has non glossy as well as glossy.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.040]   But.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.440]   >> You make a funny each other.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:36.160]   >> But no removable battery and no temptation from you know they did a big video on why.
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.400]   >> A big video on if your battery runs out your screw.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.000]   >> No that's a spin.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.720]   What they were saying is to increase the battery life they're claiming eight hours which means
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.720]   what four right?
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:47.720]   >> Four in real time.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.760]   >> It means three when you're using motion.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.760]   That's what I know.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:54.200]   >> But that's probably still twice what it was before.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.920]   >> And it was three in one and a half.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:56.920]   >> So right now you're up to four.
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:02.360]   >> I got a 15 inch MacBook Pro and if I run it with the screen all the way up it's gorgeous
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.080]   for like two hours.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.080]   >> Right.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:09.200]   >> I mean that's not completely fair but I mean if you're running that screen as loud
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.200]   as it can get.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.200]   >> I agree.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.200]   >> I think it's going to just not you think.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.640]   >> But when they're saying eight hours when they say up to eight hours I don't think
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.640]   they're running the screen.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.120]   >> No no no no you're running all the way down and you're just not even in the finder.
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:23.280]   You had to put out your literally in the shell.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.280]   >> You're in the shell.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:25.280]   >> But let's compare apples to apples.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.280]   >> And you're not running anything.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:31.800]   >> So they're saying four hours for the MacBook Pro 15 and saying eight for the 17.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.800]   So it'll be twice as much.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.040]   If you were getting two you'll get four now.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.400]   It still should be better.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:41.520]   And in order to do that they'd eliminate all the supporting technology and the door to
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.520]   take it out and stuff.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.720]   They said we just needed the space.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.720]   That's how we got the money.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.120]   >> For people that aren't traveling to Japan back and forth twice a week and don't need
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.880]   26 batteries it's going to be fine.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:55.640]   But the thing is to me it's like the ability to go to eight gigs of internal RAM as a photographer.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.880]   I use a lot of RAM hungry applications.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:04.800]   That's a big deal, the much faster graphics chip the GPU being much faster which of course
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.680]   we now know that core services takes advantage of that.
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:13.360]   So you've got a program like Aperture and even the new Photoshop with OpenGL really hitting
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.200]   the GPU hard.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.800]   Those things being upgraded are significant and the fact that they did all that with their
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.800]   traditional no price increase.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:25.200]   >> Yeah but there was a little bait and switch because they implied when they announced the
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:29.720]   new Mac books that they were going to have a new 17 inch they speed bumped didn't they
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.640]   the 17 inch like in December.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:32.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.880]   >> And so I think probably a lot of people said oh the new 17 inches here bought that
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.360]   and now how do they feel?
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:41.560]   >> Well no I think we advised a lot of people and a lot of people realized what that was.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.320]   >> This isn't really the new 17 inch.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.320]   >> The new 17 inches.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.320]   >> Well the new body.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:53.080]   >> And then the interesting thing about this really striking to me was sort of like oh yeah
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:57.800]   there's a matte display two for 50 bucks like that's almost capitulation on Apple's part
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.960]   because they were like we're going to go all glossy except until we're not.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.960]   >> And Phil didn't like it.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.800]   He said well you have to put a bezel on it.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:07.600]   >> Yeah he was like he had to look like he just eaten a sour tomato when he was describing
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:08.600]   it.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:12.040]   But Alex Lindy for a moment was excited because he's a matte screen guy.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.440]   >> No I thought it was great.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.440]   I tried to put one of those.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.600]   >> He doesn't say matte but he says glare reduction.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:21.440]   >> Yeah I mean I tried to buy one of those matte finishes for your.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.040]   >> Trying to put it on is the thing.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:28.840]   I mean the thing is this giant magnet for dust so as you put it on you start seeing things
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.840]   just like coming from across the room.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:37.760]   And then you just have these big air pockets and so if you don't hit it, if you don't stick
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.760]   the landing perfectly.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.520]   >> I can't get this thing on my phone right.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.520]   >> Right.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.000]   >> I've got like a dime size bubble on my phone.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   I can't even do that.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.520]   >> And it's way more complicated on the screen.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:51.240]   >> So I'm looking at my meat beard in my computer.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.080]   The glossy, all I see is my giant meat beard.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:55.080]   That's all I can see.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.080]   >> What's meat beard?
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.080]   >> Meat beard.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.080]   >> This year.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.080]   >> Meat beard.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.560]   >> For those that don't have a neck beard, you have a meat beard.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.480]   >> Are you taking prednisone again?
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.480]   >> Redisone.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:06.240]   >> Yeah I'm on a course with prednisone to get the moon face.
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.240]   No I hate it.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.680]   I mean like my daughter and I would be sitting there watching a video and all I can see
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.920]   is like us, I don't know.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:15.160]   Does anybody have a success story for making that less glossy?
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.160]   >> I love it.
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.160]   >> Vaseline or something.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.540]   >> Don't put a light behind you.
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.160]   >> Yeah, have the light on the other side.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.560]   >> Well it was really, I have to admit I was underlight.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:28.120]   Extremely frustrated outside trying to manage some stuff in Japan on set and I can't see
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.120]   anything.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:32.640]   >> You know that the option command eight trick.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:34.640]   >> What is it?
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:35.640]   It's option.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.800]   >> And your screen becomes matte?
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.800]   >> Yeah and it'll flip.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.800]   >> No it goes.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   >> It does put a video.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:40.800]   >> It goes to my neck.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   >> It goes to my neck.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.160]   >> So it would have been solar on us.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.160]   >> Not as good.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.160]   >> Okay thank you.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.800]   I just wanted to talk about the MacBook Pro.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:48.800]   >> You feel better now?
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.760]   >> You know what I was thinking Scott, what you could do is you probably get a couple seats
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.080]   already in first class when you fly.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.200]   You should get a third seat and just get a stack.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.200]   Make sure they're fully charged.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.200]   >> No.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.200]   >> And you get like six or twelve.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.200]   >> First of all.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.200]   >> You get your butler hold one.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.200]   >> First of all.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.920]   >> And you could have your footmen and your squire hold another.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:10.320]   That leaves your made open to massage your feet and then change them as you feel so you
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.320]   can get a tap.
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.240]   You can see this one's running low Sally.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.480]   Give daddy freshy.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:19.240]   >> Listen, regarding that entire speech I want it known that I do not have a squire.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:20.240]   >> I'm sorry.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.240]   >> I have a positive.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.000]   >> I do have a solution to Alex's problem.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.720]   I'm simply going to buy two.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.520]   That way when the battery wears out in one I'll open up the second.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.760]   >> The very heavy second battery.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.760]   >> You're thinking small.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:32.760]   You're buying new batteries.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.760]   You just buy another laptop.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.040]   >> I don't keep it a broader definition of battery.
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.240]   It's just got a computer attached.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.440]   >> There is a battery there.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.160]   There also happens to be a computer.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.000]   >> It's just a $4,000 battery.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.680]   >> On Wednesday, IDG and Paul Kent and Mackerel are going to have a town hall.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.680]   >> There he is.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:54.120]   Ladies and gentlemen, body and uncle from San Francisco, California.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:57.360]   Mr. Andy, you're not good.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.120]   >> You missed the audible ad dude.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:03.000]   >> That's all we needed you for Andy Toobad.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.960]   >> On Wednesday they're going to have a town hall on the future of Mac world.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:14.360]   I think an open question kind of what is ahead for Mackerel, when Apple abandoned Mackerel Boston.
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.280]   They had one more show and that was it.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:23.240]   But I have to say, when I come here I really feel the vibe and I really, you don't need headphones.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.720]   And I feel like this is an important part of the Mac community.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.120]   We need Mac world expo.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.320]   We may not need the booze.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:33.880]   We may not even need a keynote from Apple.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.440]   We may not even need Apple.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.720]   >> We need that Mackerel isn't about the frembles and flumbles and flumbles.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.960]   It might not even be about jingles and jingles and jumbles.
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.320]   That was the voices that the Grinch learned today.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.320]   >> That's right.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.720]   It's about Mackerel is coming no matter what day.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.720]   >> It's about love.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.560]   It's about the people.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.560]   So what do we do?
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.320]   >> We absolutely need a podcasting stage.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:55.560]   >> Well, that I'll give you.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.560]   >> Okay.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.880]   Other than that, we really don't care.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:05.960]   >> I think that there needs to be maybe an unconference or something, a bar camp style
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:09.880]   event where people -- but the problem is that you get people from all over the world
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:10.880]   to San Francisco.
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:11.880]   Great city.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:12.880]   Don, you came all this way.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.880]   What brings you to Mac world?
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.480]   >> I think I said it before.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.480]   The keynote is nice.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.520]   It's a big event.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:21.840]   I wouldn't detract from that.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:26.320]   Probably the first time I came over, that was almost gone and see a Steve Jobs keynote.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:30.720]   So once I've done that, it really takes a second step back really.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.760]   It's really the -- it's the people basically.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:37.320]   It's networking with all -- specifically for me, all the other Mac podcasts as we all meet
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.320]   up.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:42.320]   >> I don't like to use the word network because that implies there's a business mode in Mackerel.
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.320]   >> No, no, it's socializing.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.320]   Yeah, yeah, it's very much socializing.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:50.840]   >> The whole reason almost any conference exists in my experience is networking is not
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:54.200]   precise with the right word, but it's an opportunity for a lot of people who wouldn't
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.800]   ordinarily be in the same area to see each other.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.160]   And let's be honest, a lot of the time that's business.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:03.120]   But for me, it's like -- there's always amazing people that I know from the Internet who just
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.560]   kind of congregate here for a few days, and it's an unbelievable opportunity.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:10.640]   I mean, you don't need Moscone and this mini exhibitors to do something like that.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.800]   I think that's kind of what you're saying, right?
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.280]   >> Yeah, I think -- and I think we think we need something.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:18.080]   Anyway, I hope people will go to that town hall and express that.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:22.800]   I hope IDG will listen and say, okay, yeah, maybe we don't need the ProTrack, maybe we
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:28.040]   don't need the booths, maybe we don't need Apple, but we do want to keep doing something
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.040]   where --
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.280]   >> Just the drinks, I think.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.280]   >> The booths would be important.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.280]   >> It's a big attractor.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.840]   >> Well, I think I come actually to see a lot of the smaller booths.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.240]   I mean, the larger booths have plenty of PR.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.720]   They show up in all the magazines, they get all the reviews.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:45.440]   For me, it's discovering these little much smaller things that I'm not going to see
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.440]   somewhere else.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.120]   >> Let me ask a vendor.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.600]   Pat's here from VMware, hi, Pat.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.600]   >> How you doing?
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:55.760]   >> I mean, VMware does Fusion, which is one of the two -- this parallel, I say, and there's
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:56.760]   Fusion.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:00.880]   The two big programs allow you to run Windows or other actually PC operating systems on
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.880]   OS 10.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.880]   Fusion 2 is out, right?
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:04.880]   >> Fusion 2 came out.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:05.880]   >> You're announcing it?
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:06.880]   >> September.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.880]   >> Oh, you're announcing September, okay, but you're showing it here for the first time.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:09.880]   >> We're showing it for the first time.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.880]   >> How important is this event for you as a vendor?
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.960]   >> It's actually a great event for us because people come, like you said, from worldwide
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.480]   to actually be here.
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:20.640]   And even for vendors like Fusion, it's only been out in the market for a little over a
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.640]   year.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.960]   We're still gaining main recognition for the product alone.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:27.880]   There's so many people here you can talk to and touch and whether it's in the press,
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:30.880]   whether it's end users, whether it's meetups, we had a meetup last night for our users.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:33.160]   It was just a great way to actually get people together.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:37.480]   >> It's interesting because I think trade shows in general are kind of failing because
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:42.360]   most vendors like Adobe and Belkin and now Apple feel like we don't need to spend all
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.400]   that money to go to a trade show.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.400]   We've got the internet.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.400]   We've got other events.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:50.400]   >> But you're also saying meeting your users is important to you as a company.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.400]   >> Absolutely.
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.320]   We sell hundreds of thousands of users and you can't talk to all of them.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.520]   But when you come to a Mac world and there's 30,000 people and 1,000 come by your booth
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.880]   at a time, you have opportunities to meet people and you hear about creative ways of
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.680]   using your products that nobody else has done.
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.680]   You go, that's cool.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:04.680]   We can keep that in mind.
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:05.680]   >> All right.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:06.680]   So we can have booths then.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:07.680]   I'll say yes to booths.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.680]   >> Okay.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:09.680]   >> Okay.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.680]   Thanks for coming by.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:11.680]   Thanks for Fusion.
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.680]   I think it's a great product.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.680]   I've been using Fusion 2.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:14.680]   I really, really like it.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.680]   >> Thank you so much.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:16.680]   It says 25% off.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.280]   You're going to give us something here?
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.280]   >> Absolutely.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:24.200]   So for Mac Break listeners, we're having a special promo code till the 15th, 25% off,
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.200]   $20 off.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:28.960]   So say $59.99 for through the 15th of January.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:29.960]   >> Go to VMware.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:33.360]   Vmware.com and what's the coupon code?
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:34.360]   >> Mac Break.
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:35.560]   >> Mac Break, easy to remember.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.560]   Thank you.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:37.560]   That's very nice of you.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:42.480]   Thank you, Pat Lee, from VMware.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.480]   Lisa Bettany is also here.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.400]   Lisa, stand up and say hi to the microphone.
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:49.720]   I want to say hi, Lisa, because this is her first Mac world Expo.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:53.120]   So you don't have nothing to compare it with.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:56.480]   >> No, no, except for other conferences I've been to Blog World.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.920]   >> You've been in a lot of conferences.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:58.920]   >> It seems so.
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:01.000]   >> So what do you think of Mac world?
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.320]   >> It's a lot bigger.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.160]   And I think that definitely the energy is really positive.
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.320]   >> It is, isn't it?
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.320]   That's what I like about it.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.320]   It's the feeling.
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:14.360]   In fact, when I was walking up yesterday and just that feeling is you're walking up, it's
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.360]   like, oh, it's exciting.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.360]   It's a Mac world Expo time.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:22.200]   >> I was sitting next to a 16 year old boy who could just, oh, you shut up.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.280]   >> He was the guy who kept saying shut up.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.280]   >> Shut up.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:29.360]   >> Every time Phil would say something new, he'd go, shut up.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:31.360]   Oh my God.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.360]   >> I'm shaking.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:33.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:40.200]   >> But okay, now you've never seen a Steve Jobs keynote or you've probably seen it on
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.200]   a video.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:46.880]   >> To be here and to be excited about Mac world and then for him to say it's the last, like
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.160]   he officially said this is the last.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.160]   >> He did.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:53.560]   He kind of said it in a way is like, this is the last Mac world if you pay attention.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:54.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.560]   >> I thought that was slip though.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.000]   I don't think he actually meant that.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.560]   But I was quite surprised to come out because I still sort of had a thing that they still
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.800]   might do a keynote next year.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.640]   But he did come out and say, nope, that's it.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.200]   That's the last Apple keynote at Mac world.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.440]   >> Yeah, that was his meaning was the Apple's last Mac world.
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:10.440]   >> Yeah, not definitely not the last Mac world.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.040]   >> But I'm sure he just lasts Mac world.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.040]   >> No, no, no, no.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.040]   Well, he doesn't have the power to say that.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.040]   >> No, no, no, true.
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.040]   >> So.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:19.720]   >> Well, I think there's just a lot of stress that comes with having something right after
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:20.720]   Christmas and New Year's.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.920]   I know we did a booth last year and it nearly killed us.
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:24.920]   You know, to be ready.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:25.920]   >> It really killed me.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.920]   >> Yeah, nearly.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:27.920]   >> It really nearly killed me.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:28.920]   >> It really so.
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:33.080]   >> And it was just way too much coming right out of Christmas.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:37.400]   I can definitely see how the company as a whole would prefer not to have to come up with
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.960]   a new release or a whole bunch of new releases.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:45.320]   >> Yeah, I think that's what I liked about it is that I was sort of expecting a new fan
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.440]   dangle iPod or something.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:53.440]   And I liked that it was about the users and sort of brought it back to what Mac's always
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:54.440]   been about.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:55.920]   >> So you didn't mind that he didn't have some big announcement?
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:00.200]   >> No, I mean, I've sort of got what I need in terms of my own computers.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:04.880]   So I'm just looking at more functionality and the stuff with iPhoto is great, the stuff
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.840]   with iMovie like finally iMovie.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:08.840]   >> Right.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:09.840]   >> You do a lot of video.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:16.520]   >> I do a lot of video and I've sort of moved to final cut and aperture with photography.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:20.640]   So I don't know if it'll lure me back to doing something, but like Merlin was saying when
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:24.840]   you're doing something really, really simple, you really just want to be able to sort of
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:28.040]   drag and drop, add music track or something.
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:32.720]   But what it was doing before, you weren't able to separate video and audio.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:36.640]   >> I feel like a creature with giant hands in the cut.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:39.320]   >> I will move video down.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.560]   >> You had no control over anything.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:43.040]   It was really painful.
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.400]   >> So I think that's the story.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:49.160]   >> Would you come back next year if there's no Apple, there's no keynote, would you still?
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.480]   >> Are you going to be here?
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.200]   >> I'll be here.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:54.840]   >> Yeah, I wouldn't miss this.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:55:01.160]   I mean, even if it's 100 Mac users at Gillian's, I wouldn't miss it.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:04.920]   >> I think one thing, one thing is very distinct about Macro.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:07.840]   We are offices about a block and a half from here.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:12.480]   And so we see all the conferences going through the Oracle conference which shuts down the
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.480]   entire street between North and South Hall.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:15.480]   >> Much bigger shows here, yeah.
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.960]   >> All these other ones.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:20.720]   What you end up with is a lot of people who are in business and it's a very kind of a
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:25.480]   cold conference and most of the conferences are very, people are here on business trips
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.720]   with business money with whatever.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:32.600]   And the difference between that and Macworld is that at Macworld you have a lot of enthusiasts.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:37.400]   I mean, real users really on the ground, spending their own money off them for the most part
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.400]   to come here and see this.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:42.080]   And it's a much different energy than you see, I think with just about any other conference
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.280]   that you see in Moscone Center here.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:49.320]   >> Lisa is at mostly lisa.com and you can watch her on Macbreak.
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.400]   How many episodes are you going to do?
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.400]   >> 30.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.920]   >> They're going to come out all through January.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:58.000]   So they're going to start coming out this week and then we're just going to keep on
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   flowing and what Lisa's going to be.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.400]   >> And definitely at me on Twitter.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:04.200]   If there's something you want to talk about like, or teachers.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.200]   >> Ask her questions.
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:09.800]   >> If you want to see Tiny Town being more spotlighted than another big news.
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:10.800]   >> We could do more of them.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:11.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.000]   >> At L-I-S-A-B-E-T-T-A-N-Y, right?
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   >> Like Paul, Paul Bettany.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   >> Who's Paul Bettany?
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   >> Do you ever go to the movies?
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   >> The one from the Beatles, right?
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   >> The bass player from the Beatles.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   >> Apparently not.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:30.200]   >> So when I hit the street, you're going to have her, Justine, Dr. Keke, three beautiful
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:33.080]   women and Fred.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:34.080]   What's wrong with that picture?
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.280]   >> It's a good looking guy.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.280]   What are you talking about?
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.280]   >> I wouldn't know Leo.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.280]   >> I'm Merlin too.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.280]   >> I totally want to do this.
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:44.520]   If you want to tag team on Tiny Town, I will tag him on.
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:47.080]   We will go and we will do some Tiny Town.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.080]   >> I'm ready.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.080]   >> That's the best part.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:52.520]   >> There's a sound in the back as people are fleeing the Tiny Town.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:55.480]   >> Run for your lives.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:59.040]   Andy and Aco, we haven't had a chance to talk to you.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.040]   It's nice to see you.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.200]   >> Sorry I'm late, I had to file.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.680]   >> Of course.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:05.080]   >> Chicago Sun Times.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.080]   >> Yes.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.080]   >> What did you file?
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.080]   What was the lead?
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:10.240]   What do you feel was the lead story from today's keynote?
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:13.320]   >> The lead story from the keynote was that it's the first one in which we successfully
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.480]   predicted every single point, except for Tony Bennett.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.680]   Give it up for Mr. Tony Bennett.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.080]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:25.160]   >> And it did really have the feeling of an ending rather than a beginning.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.680]   So we're going to have to wait a year for that beginning that we all have been waiting
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:28.680]   for.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:29.680]   >> That's an interesting point.
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:30.680]   I think you're right.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:31.680]   It was a little illegi-elegi-elegi-giacal.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:37.880]   >> Yeah, I mean, I'm embarrassed to say that my- the lead in this piece was that maybe
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:43.400]   it's somehow significant that I didn't attend the keynote this morning.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:47.080]   Because now I had a couple problems with my hardware this morning in about five or ten
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:48.080]   minutes.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:51.320]   I need to go to room 134 to set up a little private network so I can start talking about
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:52.800]   networking and so the network was-
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.680]   >> Yeah, problem with your hardware last year.
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:57.280]   >> Well, because I don't really test before I go.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.160]   >> So- >> That's why we had to give you a copy of the
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.160]   operating system.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.160]   >> Well, that was a hard run.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.560]   >> Oh, you're talking about your thing that you're going to do with it.
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:09.600]   >> Yeah, at one o'clock I'm giving a session on how to share everything on your Mac.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:13.040]   Things weren't quite working and I had the choice of either waiting two hours in line
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:16.320]   to go see the keynote where I felt as though I knew everything that was going to happen,
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:20.960]   that the work can be any surprises, or I could fix this problem, start working on my
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:24.480]   piece, have it filed, but before I leave, and let's see how horrible that goes.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.560]   >> And they're really weren't any surprises.
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:26.560]   You didn't get disappointed.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:28.080]   >> And there weren't any big surprises.
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:30.240]   Again, it's- >> Would you point to any one thing
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.000]   as being important or exciting or?
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.080]   >> The most exciting thing was dropping DRM on the iTunes store, which is something that's
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.080]   always been rumored.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:40.040]   We haven't said anything about that and that is a huge story.
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:44.800]   Now, the bad news is that it meant that it's an indication that Apple has had to sort of
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.600]   take some leverage in addition to applying some leverage because now we're going to see
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:49.760]   some tracks that are more than 99 cents.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:53.440]   Yes, we're going to see some tracks that are less than 99 cents, but that seems to be a
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:58.480]   significant data point that Apple caved on the point of every track must be 99 cents,
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.480]   no exceptions.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:02.160]   >> That was the first thing that Alex Lindsey was sitting next to me at the keynote said,
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:03.160]   Steve Blinked.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:04.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.560]   >> Steve Blinked, because he did not want to do that, that tiered pricing.
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:11.080]   >> No, I think that I don't have a problem with paying a little bit more if I'm going
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:12.080]   to get DRM free.
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:14.360]   The thing is I had stopped buying on iTunes.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.360]   >> Yeah, I do.
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:20.520]   >> I had bought everything on Amazon because I had too many times where I had a conflict
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:25.120]   with I moved to some computer or even I don't even know some tracks worked and some didn't
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.560]   and I got to a point where I was just like, this isn't going to, I'm not going to buy
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:30.680]   any more tracks with DRM.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:36.000]   And I argued with Merlin about it and then totally caved and became an Amazon user heavily
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.600]   and I'm glad I get to go back to iTunes.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:43.560]   >> I do, I mean for too long iTunes has been my last stop in the cascade.
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:45.720]   Something, something, something happens, doesn't have it.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:51.640]   It's like I go to Amazon and iTunes for me was always groaning like, because I have the
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:55.240]   same problem and it's not, I don't think it's a corner case kind of problem.
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:58.320]   I think people run into the too many computers thing all the time.
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:02.000]   >> Will you change your habits right away?
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.640]   Will you start going to iTunes first?
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.360]   >> Well, I mean, I don't know.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.680]   It certainly is easier, I mean, Amazon is not difficult to use.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.240]   >> No, but iTunes already in iTunes.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:13.080]   >> Yes, and if it's the same quality and it's unprotected.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.080]   >> Yeah.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:18.120]   >> They said 8 million songs right now and ultimately 10 million songs will all.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.720]   >> Can I go back and trade in my old ones?
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.040]   >> You can, but you pay a price.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.040]   >> Yeah, great beat.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.040]   >> Really?
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.040]   >> Wow.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.040]   >> How much is it?
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.040]   30 cents per song.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.040]   >> 30 cents per song.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.600]   >> What's neat is it's automatic, you press a button that goes through everything you've
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:32.480]   got and it says we have these unprotected.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.960]   It will cost you this much money.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:34.960]   Would you like to go ahead?
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:38.120]   >> That's going to be an interesting, cognitively, that's going to be an interesting test of
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.840]   how much I really like something.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:40.840]   Whether I would do that.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:43.600]   >> Whether you'll spend an entire 30 cents on it.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.600]   >> Well, but it ends up-
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.640]   >> Well, but I mean if you bought a lot of stuff that ends up.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.360]   >> It can be hundreds of dollars.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:52.720]   >> To me it's more of a guess as to a gamble on what are the chances I'm going to find
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:56.480]   a phone or a music player or a media server that I like better than something that iTunes
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.480]   compatible.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.640]   I'm not sure that's worth 30 cents.
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.800]   >> It's one part where Foxy is weak, I have to say.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:05.600]   I mean iTunes just creams it on so many music features right now.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.000]   >> Foxy is a little unstable too, right?
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   Are you pretty-
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   >> It's an alpha.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.840]   >> Maybe it's because I'm running on an Apple TV.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:12.840]   It's probably better on the mini.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.840]   I can't imagine that.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.520]   It's like having a dance around a wheel.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.520]   >> It's a little bit of a struggle.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.520]   It's kind of a struggle.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.840]   It's like every time I launch it I go, "Oh, come on, Foxy, you can do it, you can do it,
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:21.840]   you can do it."
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:22.840]   Crashed.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:23.840]   >> Wow.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.840]   >> All right, nice to see you, Andy.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.840]   >> Sorry, I'm leaving early.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:31.640]   >> Make sure you go to his demonstration, how to share everything with everybody.
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.480]   >> Do you have some thoughts?
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:36.680]   >> Andy and I go Chicago Sun-Times and a great friend.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.240]   >> He's like Bob Hope on Johnny Carson.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.240]   >> It is.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.240]   He was off there in the other studio.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.240]   I thought I'd stop in and say hi.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.240]   >> That was good.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.240]   I like that a drop in.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.240]   Leanna LaHua is here and we just want to say hi to her because she's feeling fit and
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.240]   fine and looking great.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.240]   >> Thanks, Leo.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:57.160]   >> So what's the status of your shows?
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.640]   Are you going to go back and start doing them again?
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.440]   >> Yeah, we're going to bring them back.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.640]   We have the Switching Networks as well where we were running.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.640]   >> But DaSka went out of business.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.640]   >> Yeah.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.640]   >> DaSka did.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:09.040]   >> With about a lot of shares of mine.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.040]   >> Down the tube.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.440]   But you had left already.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.880]   >> I left in July, but that doesn't mean my shares left.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:14.880]   >> It was a shock.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:18.320]   I got a lot of email from people who got the email from Padango saying December 31st, we're
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.320]   pulling the plug.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.760]   Your files get them off now.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.560]   >> A million and a half shares here, a million and a half shares there.
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:24.560]   >> And all that's up.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.560]   >> That was tough too.
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.920]   We had about five days to pull all of our stuff off.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.920]   >> Oh boy.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.920]   >> Yeah.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.920]   But we're moving network.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.920]   >> Good.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.920]   Do you know yet where or?
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.360]   >> Actually, we're going to sell posts and we're going to go through probably maybe time
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.360]   to time.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.360]   >> You slip center, son.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.360]   >> Or lip center.
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.360]   >> Yeah.
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.840]   And so it'll be the same feed URL where we will have to change URLs.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.800]   >> No, we'll have to change it.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.800]   We couldn't recover it.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:46.800]   So, all right.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.800]   >> That's kind of a drag.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:51.240]   So, people want to see Girls Gone Geek or what are the other shows?
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:55.720]   >> We're going to bring that one back and think I might bring Apple Phone Show back.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:56.720]   >> Right.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:57.720]   >> Yeah.
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:58.720]   We love the Apple Phone Show.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.720]   Bring it back.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:00.720]   >> Yes, thank you.
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.560]   But I just want to say thank you to everybody.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.720]   I got a lot of tweets and emails and everything from everybody.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.920]   I don't know, Leo was updating online and Alice was emailing me.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:12.600]   I was literally off the grid for about a month.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.600]   >> We were so scared.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.600]   >> They wouldn't let me.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.600]   I appreciate that.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.600]   Thank you, everybody, for your support.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:20.600]   The only thing I did have access to was they wouldn't let me allow me to have my iPhone
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.280]   or laptop or anything, right?
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.840]   But they did allow me my iPod.
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.280]   So, actually, that was great.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.640]   I finally got through Spartans.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:34.720]   >> You know, there are advantages to getting sick, aren't there?
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.480]   As long as you've got your iPhone.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.480]   >> Yes.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.480]   >> Thanks for stopping by.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.480]   >> But thank you so much.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.480]   It's nice to see you.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.920]   Leanna LaHoo, she's feeling better, looking great.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.920]   Girls gone geek.
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.920]   >> Can I say one more thing?
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:46.920]   >> Yeah.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.320]   >> By the way, also, I just wanted to just, I don't know if he's going to like this or
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.680]   not, but I'm going to out Scott.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.160]   Because every day I was in the hospital, I was in ICU and I couldn't actually answer the
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.160]   phone.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.800]   But the nurse came in every day and said, "Oh, Scott called you again today."
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.400]   And he was calling to find out how you were and to let you know, you know, you guys need
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.400]   anything.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.400]   But thank you.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.400]   >> Thank you for giving us updates.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.400]   We didn't want to bug you.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:11.880]   I know Alex called you too, but we thought maybe Leanna will get better and not pester.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:12.880]   So that's good.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:13.880]   So that's really great.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.880]   It's nice to see you.
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.880]   >> Yeah, the nurse every time I'd call you.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.880]   >> You, I get it.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:22.360]   Now tell me, exactly what they're in, they should be to mistake.
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:28.680]   Did I mention that I used to be the nurse at the taco?
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:29.680]   >> Come right up to the microphone.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.760]   The ultimate, I always say ultimate.
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.760]   Unofficial.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:33.760]   >> No, it's the unofficial apple.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.760]   I always say ultimate.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:35.760]   I should just say TUA.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:41.320]   >> TU-A-W or TU-A depends on the context, but you know, TU-A.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.320]   >> TU-A.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.320]   >> TU-A.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.320]   >> TU-A.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.320]   >> Christina Warren's from TU-A.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.600]   So what's your reaction?
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.620]   I mean, how many Mac rules you've been to many?
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.440]   >> No, I'm a Mac rule version.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.440]   >> What?
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.440]   >> Or I was.
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.440]   >> You've got all the Apple logo where and everything.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.440]   >> Well, now.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.440]   >> Well, you're not from around here.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.440]   >> No, I'm from Atlanta.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.720]   I mean, I've gone to other conferences.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:01.640]   I used to go to contacts all the time, you know, be free, but I've never been to Mac
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.640]   world.
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.640]   >> I think it's great.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:07.320]   I mean, again, it's kind of bittersweet, like other people have been saying, you know,
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.480]   it's a little bittersweet that it's kind of the last big Apple show.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.480]   >> You just discovered it and now it's-
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:15.480]   >> Well, I've been a fan for such a long time that I've never been able to go.
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:18.480]   And so it's kind of a, but it's still great to be able to meet people that you only know
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.880]   online and congregate with people who are obsessed with the same stuff you're obsessed
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:23.880]   with.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:26.240]   And so it's a great place.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:29.880]   >> And I've been, compared to other trade shows, there's no better vibe in the world
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:30.880]   than the Mac world expo.
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:33.200]   I've been to a lot of other trade shows, a lot of other expos.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.480]   This is clearly the most, you know, it's a community of people.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:39.800]   It's truly, you're around people that are like you, so it's cool.
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.800]   >> Yeah.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.800]   A bunch of people like us.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.800]   There's nobody like us.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.400]   >> It's nice to see you.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.400]   Thanks for coming.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.400]   What's, where can we read your byline where-
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.840]   >> I'm a @film_girl on Twitter.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.840]   >> @film_girl, G-I-R-L.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.840]   >> Yeah.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:55.840]   >> You're kidding.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.840]   Oh, okay.
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:00.720]   >> And I'm Christina Warren.com, but I'm with the unofficial Apple Web log.
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.720]   >> Okay.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:02.720]   >> Thank you very much.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:03.720]   >> Nice to see you, Christina.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:04.720]   >> Well, I think we're going to wrap this up, gentlemen.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.960]   It's been a lot of fun, but they're going to kick us out of here in just a couple of
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.400]   minutes.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:14.640]   I think it's such an important show at the Mac world expo.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:19.040]   And I'm really glad that, you know, we could have be a part of it for the last few years.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.160]   I haven't missed one since it started.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:25.240]   And I hope we come, I know we'll be back next year, but I hope we keep coming back and
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.280]   we can keep doing this.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.280]   And maybe who knows?
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:33.360]   You know, it'll be up to us as users to keep Mac world expo alive, certainly the spirit
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.920]   of Mac world expo alive.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.320]   >> Don McAllister is at screencastsonline.com.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.120]   It's great to see you, Don.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.120]   >> Thank you.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.120]   >> See, that's why we need this.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:42.640]   Once a year, we get together, right?
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.640]   >> Thank you.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:48.400]   >> Craig Severson is the pod grunt and anything you want to plug, Craig?
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.440]   I mean, I know you're not doing the show anymore, so.
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.440]   >> Right.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.440]   >> No.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.440]   >> All right.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.440]   >> It's kind of floating around.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.960]   >> Watch for his great slides at my keynote presentation on Thursday.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.600]   >> I've seen a preview of those because he was actually doing some of them on the stage.
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:00.760]   >> I am very excited.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.600]   I decided I'm not going to try it myself.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:03.600]   I'm going to go to the best.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.000]   There's nobody better than Craig Severson.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.600]   He just does a great job.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.360]   >> Merlin, man, we missed you.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:09.360]   Wasn't it fun?
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.360]   Don't you want to keep doing this?
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.360]   Come on, yeah.
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.360]   >> It's nice being here.
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:13.360]   I like you guys.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.360]   >> Yeah, we love you too.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.360]   MerlinMan43folders.com.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:18.680]   And don't forget the great You Look Nice Today podcast.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.480]   He does with Scott Simpson and Lonely Sandwich.
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.520]   >> They're going to be milling around.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.520]   >> Are you going to do anything?
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:27.000]   >> You can see a really, really good looking guy in a blue sweatshirt.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   That's lonely.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   >> Yeah, very tall.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   Kind of angular.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   >> Scott, yeah, he's kind of a gangly guy.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   >> Gangly.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   >> Tiny little torso.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.840]   >> Mr. Scott Born, the man in the Drobo Vest.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.760]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:42.920]   >> Twipphoto.com.
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.160]   >> And on the Twitter, it's Scott Born.
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.160]   >> Oh, yeah.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.760]   Everybody should announce their Twitter.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.760]   Don your--
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.760]   >> Yeah, Don McAllister.
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:49.760]   >> Don McAllister.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.760]   M-C-A-L-O-I-S-T-E-R.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:51.760]   >> Yes.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:52.760]   >> Yes.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:53.760]   >> Think about it.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.760]   >> When the only people say M-A-C, but no, it's M-C-A-R.
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.280]   >> Craig, are you seversing here?
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.280]   >> What's Twitter?
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:59.680]   >> Oh, good man, I like that.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:00.680]   >> Here we go again.
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.160]   >> Merlin is hot dogs, ladies.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.160]   >> I'm not on Twitter.
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.160]   I don't even look for him.
