[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.760]   Hello, Laurie.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.160]   Hi, how are you?
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.680]   You got your bags packed.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.760]   Do you know the way to San Jose?
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.720]   I have my bags packed and I do not know the way to San Jose.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.720]   I'm taking a train.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.720]   Just go south.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.720]   Oh, isn't that nice?
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.720]   You could take the train.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.120]   Yeah, Ant-Pak goes straight there.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.800]   Sam Sacramento to San Jose.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   That's sweet.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.800]   What's fun?
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   That'll be.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.320]   Andy Inaco, who's been known to take a train or two in his time, that's because he lives
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.480]   in the great Northeast.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.240]   He is a Northeast Quarter.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.200]   Northeast Quarter up there.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   Yep.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.280]   And he contributes to a Boston public radio, WGBH.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.200]   And visit at knockco.com, H-N-A-T-K-O.com.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.160]   Did I read somewhere that Boston has the sexiest accent?
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.480]   I think I read a headline that said that not long ago.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.760]   Only if you're in the movies.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.760]   How many movies?
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.160]   Every actor wants to do the best in accent.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.960]   Oh, well, it's, yeah.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.040]   And it's fun to see.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.280]   They start in like Lowell and the accent keeps going.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.280]   It migrates.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.680]   More and more South and winds up in Queens by the time the movie is over with.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.960]   Here's the Boston accent trailer from Saturday Night Live just so you.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.920]   Oh, no, you're not getting my sound either, John.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.640]   Do I have to reboot?
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.200]   Oh, well, you can imagine.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.200]   Don't might.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.120]   I have to imagine.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.320]   See, I have like a bastardized version because like my mother was from Boston.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.160]   My father was from Western Pennsylvania.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.600]   So he really hits his R's really hard.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.520]   He's got that Atlantic accent.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.720]   But fortunately, one of my best friends, his father was like, is the every time that I
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.080]   need to relocate my Boston accent.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.880]   All I have to do is remember being like 16 and like he finds out that we're going to
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.400]   be driving to somewhere and because he was a short haul trucker, whatever, wherever route
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.280]   that we were going to take was the wrong route.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.760]   No, no, see, if you've got, if you've got, okay, first of all, you're going to be hitting
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.260]   the four o'clock.
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.760]   That's when the Polaroid plant goes.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.120]   Let's also what you want to do.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.680]   You want to start off on one or two, but then after one or two, you.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.920]   Oh, Lord, I've been there.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.720]   I don't know how I lived in Providence, grew up in Providence and did not get the worst
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.000]   accent of the whole Pacific Northeast, the Cranston accent.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.040]   I somehow missed out on.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.720]   I wish you'll beat it out of you.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.440]   You have radio beat it out of me.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.440]   It's true.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.440]   Montreal accent in the house.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.120]   Renee Richie, the home of the Montreal bagel.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.120]   Hello.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.120]   Yeah, Renee.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.520]   We got exciting news, Leo.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.640]   They're going to do a remake of Brooklyn nine nine set in Quebec in Quebec.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.600]   No, I don't know if it's going to be called like la vadnef neff.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.960]   Oh, that would be so funny.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.320]   It is going to be the best thing since the Quebec version of the office.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.320]   It's a great show anyway.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.720]   Is there a Quebec version of the office?
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.920]   They did like two seasons of a version of the office setting Cote de lais near the airport
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   with rival paper companies.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.280]   And it's a word for word translation because apparently the British comedy didn't play in
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.640]   either America or France, but was perfect word for word translation.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.440]   It's a bit of a Boston trail.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.520]   A loyalty is king.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.200]   What's the line between right and wrong is blurred.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.240]   And justice is anything but blind.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.160]   One thing, reign supreme.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.560]   You all know me.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.400]   I'm not just a cop.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.480]   I'm a seven.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.280]   And above all, I'm from Boston.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.640]   Boston accent.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.360]   Critics are calling the film Boston accent gritty, emotional, and the movie with the most
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.160]   Boston accent is here.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.640]   The politician with the upscale Kennedy type Boston accent.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.320]   I am the mayor of Boston.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:38.320]   It's all set in my own.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.320]   Kevin White.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.320]   Bro, don't tell me that you're right.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.320]   I don't know where you live, bro.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.320]   I know where you work, bro.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.320]   I know what you drive, bro.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.320]   I need to sign Maxima, bro.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.840]   The heart knows detective played by a British actor who's trying his best, but doesn't quite
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.840]   have it.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.840]   I know he thinks he's wick his smock.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.840]   He is the same.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.840]   Wick his smock.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:13.680]   I'm going to go park the car in Harvard Yard.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.800]   All right.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.920]   That says my great brilliant thou.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.120]   Let's move on because there's big Apple news today.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.000]   New iPod is announced.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Newish.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Newish.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.960]   They decided that they're going to honor the DNR order.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.840]   Do not resuscitate order, but they're not going to pull the plug.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.280]   My thought on this, they haven't updated the iPod touch in four years.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.920]   My thought is this is the last iPod ever.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.360]   Probably, but I think it's more like this is where they start to transition.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.100]   They start to change it from this is the all in one music device to this is the thing
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.000]   that you buy your kid after you buy them the game subscription and after you buy them
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.320]   the TV subscription.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:04.440]   I think that their services push has made this at least worth upgrading the processors
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.160]   to make sure it will work with the the newest operating system and the newest systems.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.660]   And I think that if this goes if we see a revived iPod next year where they actually
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.440]   upgrade the screen, get rid of those bezels that I'm sure lots of people are complaining
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.440]   about.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.820]   I'm saying that that's called the mini.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.860]   That's called the iPad mini.
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.380]   I can't put it in your pocket.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:38.460]   And also it's like I think the iPad mini is affordable, but it's not quite let your kids
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:43.740]   drool all over it and drop it in a toilet just to see what would happen.
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.140]   See that's that's still the Kindle fire for 50 bucks.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.940]   You're going to buy like five of them and just give the kid a new one every time they
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:56.880]   magic marker all over it for $200 for $400 not so much for an iPad mini.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:04.180]   So 200 for the 32 gig version 300 for the 128 gig and there is a 256 gig model for 400
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:08.780]   bucks and they do highlight the fact that it will support arcade.
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:15.980]   But the key here is it is it is really an iPhone seven grade processor and a 10 processor.
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.900]   And a yeah, no, that's absolutely it.
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.220]   A long time ago when I was talking about the iPhone SE, their line was that there were
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.660]   some people who just loved that device and that form factor and they wanted to allow
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.380]   those people to keep on loving it for at least a few more years.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:36.380]   And that was the same line when they updated the iPod touch in 2015 same form factor.
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.140]   We just want to make sure that it lasts if you really love it.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.500]   It's not a huge market for them.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.660]   But if you really love that device, they want to make sure you can keep using it.
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.260]   And this feels like the exact same thing.
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.980]   It's like the minimal viable update.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:53.260]   It's a new processor, no chai-d, no face ID, no apple pay, no bigger screen, no liquid
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.340]   retina, no OLED, no anything that any modern iPhone or iPad has had in the last three,
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.340]   four years.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:04.020]   But if you just love if you were going to buy an iPod touch, no matter what, now at
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.100]   least you can have one that will last for iOS 13, 14, and probably 50.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.260]   You could probably get a used iPhone seven for less and just take some people just don't
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.260]   want the radio.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.620]   They just don't, they don't want their kids to have the radio.
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.620]   They don't want it.
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.340]   They just want like a very, and also a bunch of people told me that in the accessibility
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.140]   community, they use it as a screen as a very low cost screen reader.
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.140]   Yeah.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.700]   So they get this and also schools who are doing coding projects, they get the kids a bunch
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.820]   of iPod touches to run their sample apps and things on.
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.060]   I'm looking at these uses, but very.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.700]   I'm looking on swap.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:41.820]   For instance, at an iPhone seven, a hundred eighty five dollars starting.
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.700]   That's probably for this 32 gig.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.700]   So it's comparably priced.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.820]   This in fact, it looks just like the new iPod touch.
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:54.860]   So, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:55.860]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.060]   So I get, and if you took the SIM card out, it would be functionally similar.
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.660]   I mean, it'll harass you.
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.660]   It'll harm you.
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:09.220]   It's something though that this is definitely Apple's entry level device to get into its
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.220]   services.
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:16.020]   If you're an Android user, let's say, and you kind of want to check out what this whole
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.820]   Apple arcade thing is all about, you're interested in it.
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:25.620]   Maybe kids or no kids, I think you could see yourself spending $200 on an Apple device
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.380]   so that you can check out the services, but it's a little harder taken than yourself to
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.380]   buy a brand new even iPhone seven about, I think, what are they?
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.140]   $450 for the cheapest one.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.140]   Yeah.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:42.420]   So it's a brand new device from Apple that it's the absolute cheapest way that you can
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.100]   get into the systems.
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.500]   So it's, you know, I mean, if they seem to be focusing really hard on services, and this
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:53.140]   is a great way to get people in that don't otherwise want to spend the money to get in.
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.140]   Yeah.
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.980]   Another thing that occurred to me, it's been so long since I've even used an iPod touch
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.660]   that is it compatible?
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:04.340]   Can you use it as the iOS pairing for an Apple watch?
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.540]   Because if you could use that as the thing that would give you the sort of services that
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:13.540]   you want from the watch without necessarily having an iPhone as your main thing, that's
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.420]   something that I'm trying to say.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.420]   Interesting.
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.220]   I came so close to buying a series three watch over the weekend when they came down to something
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:28.500]   like 200 bucks because Android Wear is just boy, it's just not, it's, it's, it's, it's
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.620]   it's like the kid that is like waiting for their parents to pick them up from soccer practice
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:38.700]   and it's, and it's starting to wonder if they even remember that they have a son.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.700]   That's how Google is treating Android Wear at this point where you're, if you own one,
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:46.460]   you're kind of ready to realize that maybe they're never coming for me ever.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.140]   And maybe I should just get an Apple watch and a second hand iPhone.
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.140]   Bad news.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.140]   You have to get an iPhone.
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.860]   There's no Apple watch app for the iPod touch.
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.180]   I think they're missing a trick there.
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.420]   I agree with you.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.940]   That would be a very interesting.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.300]   I've always thought that even if you could just pair it with an iPad or a MacBook, I think
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.620]   that would open things up so much, but I'm sure there's something enough to just the
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.180]   iPhone people.
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.420]   Okay.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.620]   I still think you could make a note of this.
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.740]   We'll talk, talk again in five years.
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:24.100]   I think this could be the end of a much heralded technology line, the last iPod.
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.100]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.740]   I don't, I just don't see four years.
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.580]   I mean, it's four years to do this.
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.900]   Are they going to do four years from now?
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.460]   Are they going to do another iPod touch?
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.460]   I don't, I just don't see it.
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.820]   I mean, the only slightly awkward thing is it keeps a four inch screen on the market for
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:40.140]   another three, four years, which means developers have to support it for three, four years.
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.900]   And how long is Apple going to want to make sure iOS works on it?
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:50.340]   I just feel like maybe they'll make a smaller iPad if they really, if they sold a million
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.260]   of these, maybe they'd make a small, I don't even think they're going to sell them.
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.860]   But it's such an interesting idea though.
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.860]   Like, unfortunately, Apple is in the company that likes to have lots of different projects
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.860]   going.
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.060]   They really, as we've discussed before, like the reason why a certain feature isn't available
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:09.060]   for even the Mac or the iPhone is because there's one person who's responsible for it
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.620]   and they've been pulled off to work on something else.
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:16.220]   But when it be great if they decided that the iPod name is right now, they're not really
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.780]   using it, but that means that they can sort of re and they could sort of take the same
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.980]   principle that Steve Jobs had when he introduced it, which is to say that, yes, it's a music
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.740]   player, but we're not going to call it the iPlayer.
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.740]   We're calling it the iPod.
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.940]   It's just a container for digital stuff that's in your life and a screen and an audio jack
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.580]   and a couple of buttons that let you access it.
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:38.060]   It wouldn't be interesting if they were to take that concept and say, we are now free
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.860]   to not necessarily make it look like an iPhone.
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.500]   We're not, we're free to put extra buttons on it.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:49.020]   If we want, we're free to even make it a larger square screen if we wanted to.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:53.940]   I would love to see the designers at Apple just really go for this and decide that there
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:14:02.020]   is room for something that is more focused and more specific than a phone, but still
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:06.100]   not requiring you to find room for an iPad mini or something.
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.580]   Yeah, I love that idea.
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:13.900]   This like kind of crazy mix it up, start over from scratch design idea, especially since
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:18.940]   it's not tied to any other things that we need on our phones.
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:19.940]   It's not a phone.
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:20.940]   It's a gaming device.
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.340]   It's a listening device.
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:28.220]   Yeah, it's, you could go like a square iPod touch would be pretty fun with no buttons
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.020]   on the front, but a bunch of buttons on the side.
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.020]   Yeah.
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.020]   Did you see that?
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.980]   I'm sure someone knows the name of the company, but they're releasing a new game platform
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:42.460]   that's a black and white screen and it actually has, it actually has a hand crank on the side
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.860]   of the name of the company is it's the legendary panic software.
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:46.860]   Yes, yes, that was it.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.860]   I'm a new transmitter.
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:48.860]   I'm a new transmitter.
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:49.860]   Yeah.
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.300]   It's one of the great Mac software developers.
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.300]   Weirdly getting into hardware.
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.300]   There it is.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.180]   That's a bunch of other play date.
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.180]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.220]   And that's what makes me so excited about it.
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.780]   The idea that, well, we don't have to make something that looks like a phone.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.100]   We're going to, we, we, we have for 150 bucks and with, we're going to find an audience
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.540]   of people that are going to think this is interesting enough that I just want to see
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:11.540]   what they do with it.
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.540]   And then when you give developers, especially game developers, hardware that says, oh, by
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.380]   the way, we have a mechanical hand crank on the side of it.
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:23.420]   And also, by the way, we will not be approving any fishing games.
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.660]   I don't know if they've done that.
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.660]   No, they should.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.660]   They should totally.
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:31.220]   I'm saying, I'm saying, but that would be like a chopped basket that is like your, your
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:37.180]   dessert basket includes pie shells, chocolate pudding, cream, and a carton of cherries.
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.660]   Like, no, it'd be so obvious that everybody's going to be like, I don't want to do a fishing
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.940]   game instead of the first game that the one of the fugens they announced, they use the
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.580]   crank to like move time forward and backward.
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.180]   But that's the sort of thing I'm talking about when you allow a designer to say, we're going
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:54.620]   to create a piece of hardware that is not tethered to any legacy that is not completely
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.780]   locked down to any one use case.
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:01.940]   We just want to make something, make something that as soon as that, just like that, that
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.100]   game, as soon as you see it, it's like, I have $150.
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.460]   I'm going to make it $150.
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:13.260]   And I don't know what I don't, I approve of its basic mission, but I just want to see,
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:18.020]   I just want it because it's such an interesting plot.
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.380]   I immediately signed up.
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.620]   They haven't yet started taking orders for it.
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.580]   It'll be $150.
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.500]   It includes a game a week for the first 12 weeks.
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.900]   It's kind of an e-ink screen.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.260]   It's a black and white screen.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:37.700]   It is a very odd product, but it has absolutely captured the imagination of geeks.
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.300]   Brianna Wu was on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.460]   She's a game developer running for Congress.
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.660]   So I don't know how much development time.
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:47.340]   She's going to have going forward if she wins, but she says it works.
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:52.180]   You write games in Lua and she says, that sounds like fun.
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.140]   So I think it would be kind of fun to do this, wouldn't it?
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:00.180]   And the crank, who knows, you know, although it reminds me of the jerk.
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.220]   Remember Steve Martin invented that movie?
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.220]   The Optigrab.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.220]   The Optigrab.
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.380]   You could take your glasses off in the middle and turned out he got sued by everybody because
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.380]   it made you cross-eyed.
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.380]   I have a feeling there's going to be a carpal tunnel issue with the game that requires
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:17.020]   you to do crank all day, right?
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:21.300]   Apple hooks, millions of kids on crank.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:26.460]   The crank came from a company called Teenage Engineering.
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:31.220]   This was the product design company that came up with the crank.
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:35.740]   And they are quirky, shall we say.
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:36.740]   They have other--
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.740]   Edits yellow.
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.740]   Yeah, it's yellow.
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:39.740]   Nice yellow.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.740]   Play.date if you're interested.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.740]   Play.date if you want to sign up.
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.060]   We'll have one.
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.700]   They say it's going to ship early next year.
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.860]   So the minute it ships, I'll be cranking my life away.
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.540]   If you go to the website, you can tap a button and get the AR version right now.
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.380]   Put it on your desk and take a photo.
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.100]   So all your friends think you have it in the studio.
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.100]   Is that true?
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.100]   Are you making that up?
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.660]   No, if you scroll to the bottom, I think--
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:06.660]   Oh, nice.
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.300]   --you can go back up a little bit.
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.420]   I think you'll see a button for-- oh, maybe it only works.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.340]   If you are the press page at the bottom on your iPhone, it's going to be the link saying
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.340]   AR.
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.340]   And then it pops up in--
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.340]   Yes, probably only on iOS.
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.340]   --and on iOS.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.340]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.340]   Oh, I'm getting that.
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.340]   Fool your friends.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.860]   Oh, yeah, I got my play date.
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.220]   I got an early version.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:31.180]   Don't you also love the idea that it's kind of like comes its own version of Apple Arcade
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.620]   where we will-- we will load it.
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.780]   We will create a game every week.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:37.780]   We won't tell you what the games are.
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.660]   There will be just a flashing light on the device to tell you that there is a new game
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.740]   waiting for you.
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.740]   Isn't that fun?
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.460]   It's $450.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:50.500]   I don't know if I'll ever use it after I play those games, but I kind of just-- but that's
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.900]   like the cost of a theater ticket.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:56.780]   And it's like I would enjoy just having a summer of this weird device in my life in
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:57.780]   which--
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:18:59.780]   It's kind of--
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.340]   Put it on your table.
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.700]   I'm sure it'll be sold out.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:08.500]   I mean, I just-- every geek I know wants one, even though-- you're right, though, Andy,
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:14.860]   that what that shows is there is space for kind of quirky oddball stuff in the world.
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.340]   All right, I'm going to get the AR right now.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.460]   We live in a time of manufacturing wonders.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.140]   Yeah, I know there's--
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:24.140]   And Apple used to be known for, wow, we've never seen anything like this before.
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.140]   It blows our minds.
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.860]   I would love them to do something like that again.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.860]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.660]   See, I don't-- I wouldn't hold that hope.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.900]   Apple's gotten a little more button down in the old days.
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.460]   We've got technology now so the cable can make one.
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:42.100]   Well, in a way, that's why it's exciting to see Andy Gogo and kick-started and all this
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.100]   stuff.
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.100]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.660]   And it's also why I have to block my credit card when I go to this.
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.660]   Yes.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.380]   Because I fall for it all, right?
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:57.660]   Speaking of invites, did you get an invite for the WWDC keynote?
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.660]   Yes.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.900]   But apparently I didn't answer back as fast as Laurie Gil, so now she's a new star.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.900]   What?
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.260]   You mean you're not going to get to go, but she is?
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.260]   No, IRSVP.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.260]   They're like, great.
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.260]   Thanks for making it.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.260]   Laurie did it like 20 minutes ago.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.260]   Oh, man.
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.260]   They're cold.
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.940]   Well, they didn't even send me one, so I don't.
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:19.260]   Did you get-- is your Animoji a unicorn or do they have a variety of Animojis?
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.260]   I got a unicorn.
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.260]   Mine must be Animoji.
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.260]   Okay.
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.260]   So this is the one and only.
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.260]   They're not doing the multi-thing.
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:30.180]   But my thank you for replying was the sunglasses emoji, and I saw some people get some different
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.180]   ones for that.
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.740]   Oh, well, that's because a human probably said it.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:40.140]   This is a nice neon sign with an Animoji unicorn.
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.540]   I guess we could do a little Kremlinology on it.
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.300]   Why is there a gem, a diamond right there?
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.260]   Why is there a bug in its ear?
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.100]   And there is a bug in its ear, okay.
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.100]   The other ear.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.100]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.220]   The other ear has a bug coming out the top of it.
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.180]   What's the asterisk?
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.540]   Some of these icons I recognize, but yo, there's the bug.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.540]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.540]   What's the bug to--
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.620]   Maybe it's a good sign that they're showing that we pulled the bug out of our butt that
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.220]   prevents us from doing really, really--
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.220]   No.
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.660]   It's for developers, obviously.
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.060]   A lot of these things that, you know, there's the Swift Sparrow or Swift.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.460]   Is that a question, Mac?
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.260]   I think we're going to see a Mac Pro, aren't we?
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.500]   So let's talk about WWDC.
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.980]   We will be doing a live stream as we always do, 10 AM, Mega Maroney and I.
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.580]   Monday morning, 10 AM Pacific.
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.460]   That is 1 PM Eastern time, 1600 UTC.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:36.540]   You can watch live as we, you know, mangle the keynote with our stuff.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.620]   We will have our robot puppets making snarky remarks.
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.060]   We might have to have robot puppets.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:46.180]   Last time we did this, Apple pulled us off of YouTube Live.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.180]   I don't want to take a chance doing that again.
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.300]   Could we do that?
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:55.500]   Could we actually buy some puppets on eBay or Amazon and create-- just put it on Black
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:03.020]   Stage and I'll be listening to Tim and I'll just simply say, we did that.
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.020]   We did it.
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.020]   We did it.
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.580]   I still have the puppets left over.
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.700]   What did we do that for God?
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:09.700]   But we did it once.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.700]   Yeah.
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.460]   And I think we still have a maze hook.
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.660]   And bears commenting that you still have not been invited back to any other--
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.060]   That is a matter of what I do.
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.340]   There's no way I'm getting invited to these things.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.820]   Truthfully, that's fine with me.
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.780]   So let's talk about what we know and what we don't know.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.900]   Let me ask you, Renee, MacPro.
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:38.820]   I mean, they clearly putting out the new Macbook Pros and the new iPod Touch ahead of
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.500]   time was the way of clearing.
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.500]   That's what Jim said last week.
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.860]   Jim Dallerable said it was clearing the decks for the conference.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.860]   You see, they'll mention a MacPro.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:48.860]   I have to.
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:58.620]   I mean, if it is able to ship before the evening of December 31, 2019, I expect we'll see it
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.140]   on stage because that's what they did with the 2013 MacPro.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.380]   Phil Schiller was up there.
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.820]   That's what they did with the 2017 iMac Pro when John Turnus was on stage.
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:08.820]   They showed them off.
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:14.460]   They gave them the big, very dark, very rock and roll intro and then they had one backstage
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.060]   that you couldn't touch.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.420]   And I think that if that's ready and then you pro display, which we're hearing more and
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:22.860]   more about, I think you, Rambo, a couple of days ago, said you're going to be able to
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:27.700]   control it from your device, not just your computer, but your iOS or your Mac OS device,
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:32.020]   control everything, save the presets, reload the presets on the other devices, true tone,
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.900]   all those sorts of things.
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.140]   It sounds like both of those are going to be ready, at least ready enough to get a demo
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.900]   and that would be like I'm in the mentality where Apple just has to ship because the iMac
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:48.140]   Pro and the MacPro came out real, real, real late in the year, even after being shipping.
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.340]   But I think this is a big developer event and that's the big developer machine and that's
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.500]   the thing that's going to make people happy at the show.
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.340]   Let's watch Phil Schiller from 2013.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.340]   It's a sneak peek.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:02.500]   Oh, and the crowd went crazy.
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.500]   Little did they know.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.500]   It was going to be a...
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.500]   Video editors.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.500]   Terrible eyes.
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.060]   I bought it immediately.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:14.740]   Graphic designers count on products like MacPro to get their work done.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:15.740]   That's still true.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.860]   And our most advantages is just want to get their hands on the fastest, most expandable
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.780]   Mac we make.
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.780]   But this won't be expandable.
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.780]   We didn't want to just make a non-reformative...
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:27.780]   I'm a thunderbolt.
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:28.780]   A single, thunderbolt.
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:29.780]   ...of my idea that everyone's having.
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.780]   Like with MacBook Air.
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:35.060]   We wanted a computer that could be fired from a potato cannon when you get really, really
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.060]   upset with it.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.060]   Not just a little today.
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.060]   And what could be possible...
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.500]   A future of the Prodespa.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.300]   What is it they said when they brought those journalists in?
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.300]   We made a mistake.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:50.260]   Yeah, that they thought that the future would involve multiple graphics cards and it'd be
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.620]   more of an open CL, mass compute future.
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:57.420]   And the industry decided to go towards single multi...
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.100]   Like single very massive GPUs instead.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.860]   And because it was built in a triangular design, you had to have a CPU and two GPUs that would
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:09.340]   have roughly similar heat patterns so that it could create that sort of thermal venting
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.860]   that was on the top of the machine.
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:15.100]   There was just no way to take out the two GPUs and stick in a single GPU and no real
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.100]   reason to...
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.900]   No real room.
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.220]   Like there was no thermal.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.900]   They painted themselves into a thermal corner.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.540]   There was just no way to update that machine given the way the graphics cards went.
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.220]   They bet entirely wrong.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:30.700]   Here's the 2001 space odyssey introduction.
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.180]   Turn up the music.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.180]   Oh my God.
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.020]   It was in movie theaters.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.260]   I saw this in movie theaters.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.260]   I remember it.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.260]   Yeah.
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.260]   Yep.
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.620]   I remember it at this point, nobody had seen it.
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.660]   So everybody's going, "What?
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.660]   What?
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.660]   What?
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:45.660]   It's round?
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:46.660]   What is this?
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:51.900]   I think Jim Dowerbold shows the world music.
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:56.340]   Wow, that is rocket roll.
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:00.140]   It's piano, glass, liquid.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.580]   And it was glossy.
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.580]   Oh man.
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.500]   It makes me weep to this day.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.380]   I don't remember what I spent on this thing.
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.860]   Everything, yeah.
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:13.860]   Yeah, a lot.
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.660]   It's probably $5,000 or $6,000.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.220]   And they had it without the case nine in front.
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.220]   It was beautiful.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.220]   It was beautiful.
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.220]   It was beautiful.
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.940]   But this is an example of falling for apples.
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:27.300]   By the way, this is now going to be taken down on YouTube, I'm sure.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:34.420]   This is an example of falling for apples kind of showbiz.
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.700]   And I constantly pinch myself, "No, no, no, don't, don't, don't."
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.820]   I managed not to buy the MacBook Pro last week.
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:42.820]   Nice.
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.660]   I'm very proud of myself.
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.860]   I'm in a 12-step program for it.
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.900]   We love you, Leo.
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.820]   So I am with you and I have a buy button problem.
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:53.820]   I have a buy button.
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.740]   And the thing is, Apple, you saw that.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:00.540]   It's a masterclass in marketing.
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:06.500]   And Phil is very good at saying this is the thing we've ever done.
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:11.980]   But the single biggest strength and weakness that they have is that they really buy into
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:12.980]   this stuff.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:13.980]   They believe in them.
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:14.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.660]   When they talk about that Mac Pro, they talk about the touch bar.
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.620]   And the other problem is that they're always told they're wrong.
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.580]   Like, "Oh, the AirPods are stupid.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.540]   The Apple Watch is ridiculous.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.780]   Even the iPhone is done."
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.420]   And they're just like, "Okay, wait a few weeks.
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.740]   Wait a year."
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.660]   And then oftentimes, the AirPods turn into a huge success.
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.100]   And they think that, "Oh, people, the touch bar is new.
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.100]   It's weird.
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.100]   People are going to have an address to do it."
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.900]   But a year later, it's going to be indispensable.
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.540]   And oftentimes, that's true.
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.740]   But even under Steve, that wasn't always true.
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.140]   And the ones that aren't always true, they sort of don't hear the criticism because they're
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.740]   still in that mode of, "It's going to take a while to seep in.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:51.740]   It's going to take a while.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.340]   You'll see that we're right."
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.620]   And then when they're not, it's like doubly hard for them because they have to first
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.020]   understand they aren't right and then start reversing course.
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:02.580]   So they're kind of subject to the same reality distortion field we are.
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.380]   Well, but that is admirable.
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:09.220]   There's so few companies that say that they have the sort of cushion of billions of dollars
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.820]   and also can be able to contribute the ability to control their market.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:17.140]   So if they really do believe that this is the way to go, they don't have to ditch something
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.740]   just because it's not an immediate success.
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:27.180]   They can keep a design that's controversial around long enough for either A, the rest of
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.620]   the world to catch up to it.
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:34.380]   So that if the problem is that this isn't a USB world, this is not a world in which you
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.660]   can have a computer that doesn't have a floppy drive.
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.060]   Eventually, the rest of the world will catch up with you.
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:44.100]   And/or we will figure out how much of this problem is because this is so different that
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:48.380]   people are rejecting something that is really different without giving it a chance versus
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.580]   how it was the chance that we've actually made a mistake here.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:56.140]   So that's why they don't have to do a big hat and hand me a culpa after a year.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:02.780]   They can keep the Mac Pro going to see as can we make an adjustment, can we make an expansion
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:03.780]   for it?
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.700]   Because it really was a very, very cool design.
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:10.660]   It is exactly what I hope to see from Apple from time to time, which is we don't necessarily
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.860]   have to make it.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:15.180]   We don't have to make a computer that's a box that has angles to it.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:19.540]   Although maybe if you are selling specifically to pro users who like to put their own cards
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:23.260]   in and like to swap drives in and out, maybe that is a good thing.
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:28.700]   But I can't complain that they decided to go that far into space when they were designing
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.700]   something.
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:30.700]   Yeah.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.700]   Well, we'll see.
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.700]   We'll find out.
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.980]   I do think they're going to say something.
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.900]   They have to say something about it, whether they'll show a design.
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.900]   I don't know.
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:41.980]   And I will be looking for one, and I don't think I'm alone for something somewhat expandable
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.900]   like the cheese grater Mac, something similar obviously than a Mac.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.220]   So what do they mean by modular?
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:50.820]   That's going to be the big thing because is Apple going to do all you want is the cheese
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:51.820]   grater.
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.860]   We're going to give you a new cheese grater or is Apple going to go, we're Apple.
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.380]   We can't just do the cheese grater.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:01.180]   We've got to try to think of what the next generation of modular really means and either
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:05.660]   make something you never knew you wanted and now love completely or you're going to curse
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.020]   us for another five years saying why didn't you just make the cheese grater?
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.660]   But maybe you'll have a crank.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:19.700]   That's how you get an extra 43 minutes of battery life off the new Mac Pro.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:24.180]   But that's another thing that Apple does really well.
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:28.740]   When customers en masse tell you that this is a feature we really, really, really want
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.100]   and need, they're giving you valuable information.
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.060]   They're not crazy, but what their needs are.
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.860]   What Apple does really well is instead of just saying that, all right then, we will give
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:43.180]   you a five position game style D-pad on the Mac mini.
[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:47.460]   Instead they will ask themselves and ask the people, well, why do you want that thing?
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.100]   What problem would you like us to solve?
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.500]   They might find a better way of solving that problem than giving you explicitly what you're
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.500]   asking for.
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:31:02.140]   Yeah, there's definitely a fine line of giving us what we want and innovating because if
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:06.380]   you were to go, just here's the new cheese grater version, then there would be a lot
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.500]   of cries for the Apple's not innovating.
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:14.140]   But if you give us a new trash can, then we're innovating, but they're innovating in the
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.540]   wrong direction.
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.140]   There has to be this fine line, which I mentioned this before.
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:22.860]   The Mac mini, in my opinion, was Apple's, that's evidence that Apple can do that, that
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:30.100]   they can give people what they want and not go crazy and not kind of take away from what's
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.780]   most important to the user base.
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:36.820]   I think the Mac mini gave those people who love Mac mini exactly what they wanted or
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.300]   at least there's close to exactly what they wanted as they could.
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.660]   This is what the Mac Pro, I think, is headed toward.
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.420]   They listen to a lot of people.
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.860]   They've been spending a lot of time in research and development.
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:51.220]   I think when they finally do present it to us, it's going to be a lot like the cheese
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:55.500]   grater, but maybe with a little bit of innovation, a little bit of both.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.860]   But I don't think they're, I think they learn their lesson and they're not going to do that
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.260]   again this time.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:05.820]   Honestly, if you think about the Pro, correct me if I'm wrong, if you think about the Pro
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:10.460]   market, design is secondary to them, right?
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:13.820]   Functional design is super important, aesthetic design is not as important.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:14.820]   Right.
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.460]   So they want it to be able to easily do those, yeah, like those hard drives, we're a thing
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:19.460]   of beauty on the cheese grater.
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.660]   You could just pull it out, no cables, nothing, shove them in.
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.500]   That was incredibly fun.
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.780]   My only, my biggest hope here is that that Pro workflow team that they started building
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.140]   up two years ago.
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:33.980]   There are some really well-known, really famous, completely unidentified people on that team,
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:38.300]   people who have cursed at Apple loudly in the past for not doing what they wanted.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:42.140]   And my hope is that those people have been cranking at this machine for two years on
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:46.540]   the software, on the hardware, on the integration, saying no better, why is this dialogue not
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.540]   launching faster?
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.100]   How come I can't access this?
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.660]   And my hope is that Apple was smart enough to just let them like from the video people
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:57.700]   to the photography people to the audio people, just let them work, shut up as much as they
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.180]   can from them, and then make the machine that makes them happy because I think of their
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.180]   happy will be happy.
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.980]   Absolutely, I agree 100%.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:12.940]   And I think if anything, this is a failing of Apple that sometimes they overemphasize
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:16.700]   design, as you said, aesthetic over functionality.
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:20.060]   I mean, clearly that's what the trash can Mac did.
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:24.300]   And they admit it, but will they learn that lesson and make something that is truly fun?
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.060]   And then they don't, like the battery case, and people would say that they've lost their
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.060]   spirit of design, and Steve Jobs is dead.
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.060]   And I'm not hiding it.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.860]   Yeah, there's, well, to be fair, to be fair enough, Steve Jobs is dead.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:35.860]   That's true.
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:36.860]   It's a fair enough.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:37.860]   It's not incorrect.
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:38.860]   It's not incorrect.
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:39.860]   Yeah.
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:40.860]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:41.860]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:42.860]   Absolutely.
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:43.860]   Funny story.
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.980]   This is somebody in the chatroom just posting this probably scooter X. Yes, scooter X. They
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:52.500]   interviewed Justin Long on nine to five Mac about the I'm a Mac ads.
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:56.100]   He says, we made 300 of them.
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.420]   Steve Jobs rejected almost all.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.500]   Three hundred.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.460]   So perfect.
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:06.620]   These great John Hodgman, Justin Long ads.
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.580]   Actually, this was on people TV's couch surfing.
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.500]   He said of the 300 commercial shot, only 66 ultimately aired.
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.260]   He said some of the funniest ones never aired.
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:20.660]   Zach, Zach, is a drunken Santa Claus.
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:22.660]   Put that on TV plus.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.460]   I would watch the crap on that on TV plus.
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.460]   Yeah, put it on.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.460]   Yes.
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:30.420]   He said, Jobs was concerned that they would be too funny.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.460]   He says, basically Steve Jobs preferred they weren't super funny because he thought that
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.380]   would detract from the point of the commercial.
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.380]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:37.380]   That's good point.
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.100]   I've seen commercials that are super funny.
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.100]   Yeah.
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.260]   But you don't remember the product.
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:44.500]   Don't be mean.
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:48.300]   Don't tell us that there's these super funny things out there unless you give us a hug.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.300]   I know.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.300]   That's so mean.
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.300]   So mean.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:55.420]   And my question is, does John Hodgman have 300 corduroy jackets or is that maybe a
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.420]   he does?
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.420]   Maybe he does.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.420]   Worduroy.
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.420]   It was a digital.
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:00.420]   It was a digital.
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.420]   You know what?
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.100]   This is the tech columnist part of my brain working.
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:12.380]   But John Hodgman has like actually like sort of prove symbolize the evolution of Microsoft
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:19.340]   and Windows where now he's got a really, really cool beard and really, really cool classes.
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:23.700]   And now Windows is, wow, you mean that it's a touch screen and you can fold the screen
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:24.700]   back?
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:28.740]   And actually, I kind of, I would kind of like to hang out with John Hodgman right now.
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:32.660]   And it is just a long look like right now.
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:38.460]   So let's, let's bring those commercials back and, and just let them talk and see if it
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.460]   happened.
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:40.460]   Let them air.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.940]   So Harry McCracken, good article and fast company, what we could expect and not expect
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.140]   from WWDC.
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:52.140]   He says, I don't know if I grew this without a doubt, the star of WWDC will be iOS 13.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.140]   iOS 13.
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.660]   Maybe from Apple's point of view, iOS certainly is their most important.
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:58.060]   I mean, iPhone is the most popular and people care about it.
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:01.700]   And my guess is that dark mode is going to be as popular as an emoji bomb.
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.340]   And we know how popular.
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.100]   People just love the idea of dark mode.
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.780]   Leo, they could just say dark mode, send everybody home and people think it's a rousing
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:09.780]   success.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:10.780]   Yeah.
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:11.780]   No, well, it's true.
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.780]   It's easier on the eyes.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.780]   I think once you use dark mode for a while and you go back to light mode, it's like, wow,
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.300]   that hurt anything you don't have that you want that desperately.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.780]   And we finally give it to you.
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:19.780]   It's like, yeah.
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:24.580]   Renee, when you do your review of iOS 13, I want it to be two words.
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:25.580]   Dark mode.
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.300]   Dark mode.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.300]   Mic drop.
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.300]   Nothing else.
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.980]   I was joking with Lori because like my favorite review I ever did was in 2011, I reviewed the
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:39.300]   iPod Touch and the entire review was this year it comes in white.
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.860]   Your review this year will be even shorter, by the way.
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.540]   This year, well, this year it comes in.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:47.260]   This year it has an A10 and an up to 256 gigabytes.
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.700]   But I just, if I can say this year it has dark mode, but I have a feeling Apple's going
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:50.980]   to add a couple of new features.
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:58.660]   I am excited about the potential of making the beautiful iPad Touch something more than
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:03.020]   just a giant iPhone and that would require some specific features in iOS 13.
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:09.780]   We've heard they're coming including multi-window displays, stackable windows, multitasking,
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.260]   three finger gestures.
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:12.260]   Mouse support.
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:13.260]   Mouse?
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.260]   Yeah.
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.260]   Support.
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:20.460]   But let's find out if that's accessibility only or whether that's accessibility, but clearly
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:27.020]   a precursor to getting developers used to incorporating an external pointing device so
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:30.900]   that in a couple of years when they figure out how to adapt the interface so that it
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.820]   makes sense for all apps, it'll do that.
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.780]   I wonder though, I understand is that it's just like you flip the switch and accessibility
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.220]   and it just works.
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.180]   And it's weird that they would put it under accessibility.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:45.780]   Maybe that's just because they're religiously allergic to admitting you need a mouse on
[00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:46.780]   iOS.
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.940]   But my understanding is you flip that switch and then you can use the pointer.
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:50.300]   So we'll see how that goes.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:57.740]   See, I think Apple is so dogmatically behind touch that they don't want to admit people
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.660]   would want to use a trackpad or a mouse.
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.660]   They make us hard.
[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:01.660]   Keyboard.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.860]   I mean, they've already broken that wall.
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:04.860]   Yeah.
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:10.100]   And also, it sounds weird, but I was actually using a mouse with my Android phone last night
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:14.420]   for reasons that would make sense if you're seeing what I was doing and why I wanted
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.420]   it.
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.820]   At some point, I decided I'm sick of reaching up to touch the screen.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:22.860]   And I was reminded of how non-intrusive when you have a really well-designed touch
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:28.300]   interface, which iOS definitely is, if all you do is you just throw a mouse pointer on
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:33.060]   there and you just simply allow people to make those clicks and those drags by having
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.220]   an external device, that's enough.
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.180]   That really, really works.
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:42.540]   Maybe the way that Apple thinks is that they couldn't do that unless they really baked
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.220]   external pointing devices into the user interface.
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:50.660]   But given that the only thing that does not, the only thing that a mouse cannot possibly
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:56.020]   work with is 3D touch and that's either on its way out or it's still very, very optional,
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.580]   I don't see that it would be a huge hindrance.
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:04.140]   And even imagine how Apple is though, like they're not going to allow something like
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:10.420]   that across the board until they're sure that it has a really great user experience.
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:16.900]   And even if it has just the slight awkwardness, they're not going to release that, they're
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.220]   going to work on it and perfect it.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:25.980]   They're going to bake it into the system better because if you just give a mobile device
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:31.300]   pointer capabilities, you're not the best.
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:35.460]   And Apple wants to be the best at this stuff and that's why they hold off until everybody
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:38.820]   else does it and then they perfect it.
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.500]   That's their MO.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:46.620]   So in this case, making it accessible, making it an accessibility feature allows them to
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:52.660]   give you that option without claiming that they've somehow perfected using a mouse on
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:53.860]   a mobile device.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:40:02.300]   It's giving you what you want while not making a less awesome user experience.
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:05.380]   It's your choice if you don't want that user experience to be awesome.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.780]   That's a great observation.
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:13.660]   I might be a little weird because I use e-max but when I'm on the keyboard, I just want
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:14.900]   to be on the keyboard.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:19.340]   I notice that I put this bridge keyboard on the iPad and I use touch much, much less.
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:24.460]   I'll even use keyboard shortcuts to go home or go into search.
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:28.820]   But I think that that's correct that if your fingers are on the keys, you want to stay
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.020]   on the keys as much as possible.
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.860]   What you don't want is switching modes all the time.
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:34.860]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:40.500]   Well, one of the hindrances is that if you're using an external device, you can actually
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:45.020]   see the tip of the pointer as you aim it towards the thing you want to click on.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:48.980]   Whereas when you have your finger, your finger always gets in its own way.
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:50.980]   So for some things, it's like annoying.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.340]   For like an eye and stuff, you're right.
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:53.340]   You'd want it.
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.340]   Yeah.
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.340]   Yeah.
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:41:00.220]   Not only that, but there's some parts of a user interface where they, right now mobile
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.260]   apps are complicated.
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:07.580]   Some mobile apps are so productivity useful that they really can't streamline the interface
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:08.580]   all the way down.
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:13.660]   They do have to have a hamburger menu or something where there's kind of more of a desktop paradigm.
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.700]   And it becomes more difficult to aim your fingers to navigate this interface.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.700]   But I think that Laurie had a really great point here.
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.220]   I think that feels like a failure though.
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:23.220]   I agree with you.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.220]   You have to.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.220]   But that seems like a failure.
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:26.780]   You should be able to touch.
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:27.780]   Not a failure.
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:34.700]   Sometimes all designers chase the perfect solution for so long that they deny people
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.700]   a good solution.
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:40.420]   And I think that Laurie's suggestion that Apple will not have to necessarily support
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:46.660]   and defend and build out a whole pointer-based interface if all the just people like she
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:51.780]   and me and Renee and you are pointing, hey, by the way, I started using a mouse with my
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:54.420]   iPad and it's just totally, totally changed my life.
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:57.980]   They can let us bear the burden of user saying, but that doesn't really, really work well
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:58.980]   with this thing.
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:41:59.980]   Well, I didn't say it would work with everything.
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:00.980]   Yeah, but you told us.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:01.980]   I'm sorry.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.420]   We didn't say it worked well.
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:05.420]   We just promised.
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:10.180]   People want touch screens on their Mac and they want track pads on their iOS devices.
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:13.020]   And they sound mutually inconsistent, but it's exactly what you said, Leo.
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.500]   You just don't want to change context.
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.460]   So if your hands are up, you want to touch things.
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.900]   And if your hands are down, you want to move things and you want to have both options.
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.140]   And if you don't, it always goes like something's broken.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.140]   Yeah.
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:28.060]   I just feel like the operating that the device should tell you what you're using.
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:33.780]   And it's why really honestly, the iPad could be a little confusing if it has a keyboard
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.460]   and a mouse.
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.940]   It really should be a touch only device, I feel like, but maybe I'm wrong.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.340]   I don't know what I'm saying though.
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.900]   Yeah, it's just confusing because you have both modalities.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:44.900]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.300]   I mean, your brain is thinking two different things.
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:48.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.980]   Especially with the bridge.
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:50.980]   I know exactly what you're talking about.
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:54.940]   I actually look for a trackpad when I'm using the bridge keyboard because there's that space
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:58.940]   down there that makes it so familiar to a laptop.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:04.780]   So and then my brain also sort of resents me using that keyboard when I have to reach
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:05.940]   up and touch the screen.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:06.940]   Yes.
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:11.380]   But my brain is like, it has to switch modes to touch when I'm if I'm using any kind of
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:18.580]   keyboard and in the reverse, if I've been using an iPad a lot and like got used to touching
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:22.780]   the screen, if I switch back to my MacBook Pro, I'll reach up to touch the screen for
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:25.780]   things sometimes like our brains don't want to do both.
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:30.760]   Our brains only want to do touch or they want to do the keyboard and mouse or track
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.500]   pad mechanics.
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.260]   10.15.
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:38.620]   God, I hope they don't call it 10.15.
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:40.420]   Mac OS next.
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.740]   It'll be Death Valley or will it be Joshua Tree?
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.740]   Oh, I like Joshua Tree.
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:48.140]   Can we just call it Mac OS 11, please?
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:51.500]   Well, I think the 10 is superfluous at this point.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.420]   We're just at Mac OS 15 now.
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.420]   Oh, okay.
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:57.140]   Yeah, because it is Mac OS 10.
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:58.140]   15.15.
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:43:59.140]   Yeah.
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:00.140]   So confusing.
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:07.780]   Anyway, Martsipam will be one of the big stories, the ability to put iOS apps on the desktop.
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:14.340]   We talked to Greg at Agile Tortoise this morning on iOS today about Martsipam and he says,
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:18.380]   you know, it really will depend on what capabilities Martsipam allows Mac OS developers.
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:21.540]   It might be considering and his app is as unique.
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:25.980]   It uses an app and he said, yeah, pretty much use every API except talk minute reality.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.220]   I don't use ARKit, but every other API.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:32.060]   You could put it in the about screen if you cared that much.
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:35.980]   But ARKit of that screen, Greg, that's all.
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:36.980]   That's right.
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.140]   His about screen is wild in Peacock.
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:48.220]   Anyway, he said that maybe a problem with Martsipam and plus it only works with the latest
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.060]   versions of Mac OS.
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:54.980]   So it might make more sense for any developer who has a Mac version in which he just created
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:59.860]   recently for drafts to stick with the traditional way of coding versus Martsipam.
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:00.860]   So that'll be the best.
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:01.860]   Just that they don't know it.
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.940]   I think that's the whole point is that there is a whole bunch of iOS developers who have
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:08.460]   no either sort of like Paula Dodd, they just don't like app kit, even though they've been
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:11.060]   using it for years, or they don't want to learn app kit.
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:16.180]   And if they can just bring where it makes sense, from big companies like Netflix to small
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:20.620]   companies like people who are like Greg, but who don't want to bother with the app kit
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:21.620]   stuff.
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.340]   But like Marco maybe, for overcast, they'll just be able to take.
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.900]   It's not really iOS apps.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.420]   It's UI kit apps running on the Mac.
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:29.980]   And it's apparently way better now.
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:30.980]   They've redone a ton of stuff.
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:34.500]   They're going to have a lot of affordances that make sense on the Mac like multi window
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.780]   and menu bar and it's going to hook right into the system.
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:41.860]   And they'll be able to make something that looks like, you know, maybe not a traditional
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:46.020]   app Mac app, but a next generation Mac app for a bunch of software that we would have
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.380]   had to put up with like an electron app before.
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.380]   It'll be way better.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.100]   Oh God, there's so I have so many electron copy people.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.340]   They keep freezing my computer.
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:01.420]   There will be a new TV app on Mac OS and that's been confirmed by Apple.
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:04.540]   That's of course for the Apple TV plus stuff.
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:06.460]   But also I guess, I mean, that makes sense.
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:10.420]   I think a lot of people use their laptops for watching TV.
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:16.020]   A lot of young people, especially why buy a TV when you have a laptop.
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:21.460]   They're going to separate the podcast app away from music just as they have on iOS.
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:23.580]   That's good for, I guess, for us.
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:27.260]   Music won't be Marzipan. It'll be based on iTunes so that it should still have all the
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:30.420]   stuff. People worry they're going to lose a bunch of iTunes functionality, but it sounds
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:35.620]   like a stripped down iTunes, not a port it over iOS.
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:39.660]   So going forward, you'll have iTunes music and podcasts, three different apps.
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:43.060]   iTunes, I think they're going to bury in a folder for legacy people who want to use one
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:46.940]   of the five obscure features that only they really want to use.
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:49.940]   And they'll have music for the mainstream use.
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.220]   That's very it.
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:55.020]   So reminders and books will be revamped.
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.260]   I guess I use reminders.
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:01.900]   I think he Rambo posted some screenshots this morning from iOS 13.
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:02.900]   Nice.
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.140]   Plus his deconstructives heart.
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:08.180]   Watch OS six will be out.
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:11.940]   The wearable will, according to one rumor, gain its own app store.
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.140]   That'll be interesting.
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.140]   Yeah.
[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:18.060]   So you can buy apps right on the watch.
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:19.060]   Okay.
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:21.820]   You still have to have the Apple Watch app on the iPhone.
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.940]   So that was interesting because I asked you about that.
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:27.700]   And his thinking is like now as a developer, you have to make an iPhone app if you want
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.400]   an Apple Watch app.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.460]   You can get around it a little bit with messaging apps, but pretty much you have to make an
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.460]   iPhone app.
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:37.460]   And if they have just a way to make dedicated Apple Watch apps that don't have to have a
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:40.860]   companion, like if it makes no sense to have an iPhone app.
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:42.700]   And also it's another step towards independence.
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:45.380]   You know, one day I would love that you can just log into an Apple Watch.
[00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:47.620]   You don't need to have an iPhone that have any phone you want.
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:50.340]   You just log straight into your Apple Watch and its own thing.
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.860]   The way that the iPhone became the iOS 5.
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:54.620]   I think a lot of people would love that.
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:48:00.140]   It took the iPhone until iOS 5 to go PC free and the watch is way more highly constrained.
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:04.260]   So if it takes into like iOS 6 and 7, sorry, watch a West 6 and 7, I think, you know, take
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:05.260]   those steps.
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.460]   And this is one of those steps.
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:07.460]   Three news.
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:09.380]   I think go ahead, Laurie.
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:12.420]   Apple Watch has really suffered in the app game.
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:16.780]   When it first launched, there were a lot of people that were trying to kind of, well, first
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:20.900]   when it first launched, anything, any app that you had on your phone, it had to be a companion
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.020]   to your phone app.
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.580]   It wasn't really its own app.
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:28.740]   It was kind of secondary to the thing that you had on your phone.
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:33.140]   And then they were able to kind of create these dedicated apps for the Apple Watch.
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:39.140]   But they're more like companions still where you've got some functionality on the watch.
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:41.780]   But if you want the deep functionality, you have to go to the phone.
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:45.860]   And I like the idea of an app store on four dedicated to Apple Watch.
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:53.220]   It's on Apple Watch because it might help developers kind of conceptually come up with
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:57.260]   something that they think works dedicated to just Apple Watch.
[00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:00.300]   And of course, you still right now, you still need your iPhone.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:06.540]   But if this could allow for that separation, just like Renee is saying, apps on Apple Watch,
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.940]   just they're not winning right now.
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:14.700]   And I would love to see some innovation that kind of brings a reason for me to use my Apple
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:17.220]   Watch other than just for my notifications and messaging.
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:21.940]   Because right now that's all I do for it, even though I have probably 100 apps that show
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:26.340]   up on Apple Watch, I don't use most of them unless it's for notification stuff.
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:30.860]   Well, Apple is going to add three health focused features to Apple Watch.
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:33.700]   I'll probably only use two of them.
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:37.860]   One will, I think this is great, will tell you if the noise around you or the volume
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:42.540]   in your earphones is loud enough to damage your hearing, that's fantastic, a warning
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:44.380]   that it's really loud in here.
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:45.820]   I think it would be great.
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:51.740]   A new cycles app for tracking menstrual cycles and a new doses app that reminds you to take
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:52.740]   your medication.
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.420]   That does all make sense, I think.
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:50:03.820]   Yeah, I think there's a lot of fitness tracking companies that are adding women's health to
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:04.820]   their tracking stuff.
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.940]   There's a big privacy concern, though.
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:13.220]   We learned that at least one menstrual tracking and pregnancy fertility app, at least a couple
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:17.340]   according to the New York Times, are sending information about a woman's cycle back to
[00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:21.620]   the home office and maybe even to Facebook.
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:22.620]   Which is bad.
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.060]   So if it came from Apple, I think people would be more comfortable, don't you think?
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:26.060]   Exactly.
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:30.580]   From my perspective, in fact, not long after that article came out, there was quite a
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:37.580]   few where they were sharing our personal information on that.
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:44.460]   From my perspective, it's not a big deal because we all do it, but it feels so private to me
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:50.500]   that it feels more private to me than you knowing about any of my other daily activities
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:53.220]   where I walk, where I eat, how often I go to Starbucks.
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:58.220]   That to me just felt more invasive and more intrusive.
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:05.020]   So app developers, they were contacting me, "Oh, we've got this new women's health tracking."
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:07.100]   And I thought, "Nope, not going to touch that.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.100]   I don't know.
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.100]   Don't trust it."
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:14.700]   And this idea that I can track my women's health stuff right on my Apple Watch and that
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:20.180]   it's not going to be shared with other people unless I choose to.
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.180]   It feels a lot better.
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.180]   It feels a lot safer.
[00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:25.980]   I feel a little more protected with that level of privacy.
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:34.200]   It's no different than my lung health or my eyesight health, but it felt more intrusive
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.900]   for some reason to hear about that.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:41.940]   So it's going to be my favorite addition to the health app, for sure.
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:42.940]   You need to...
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:47.460]   That's one of the many areas in which an app that's not the project lead.
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:51.260]   If the project lead and most of the developers aren't women, what's the point of it?
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:52.860]   It's probably you're probably not going to get it right.
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:54.020]   Good point.
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:57.700]   We need more women in development, that's for sure.
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:03.620]   We asked James Thompson when he was on last week on iOS today, creator of PCALC.
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:08.120]   If he was worried about being Sherlocked because there's a rumor there will be a calculator
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.200]   app on the Apple Watch.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.880]   PCALC doesn't already.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:17.800]   He said, "Well, I don't think Apple's going to do a hex to decimal calculator for the
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:18.800]   watch."
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.640]   So I think he's safe in that regard.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:26.360]   Also voice memos app and I do use something called just press record to record directly
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:27.360]   on it.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.520]   I think we all use just press record on our Apple Watch right now.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:33.680]   I don't think they'll be Sherlocked either and this is actually what Greg said from Agile
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:40.400]   Tourists today is Apple usually does like 70% solutions, which means if you do the 100%
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.280]   solution, you still have a shot at a moment.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.880]   The good apps, Moriarty Apple.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.440]   I like it.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.440]   Nice.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.440]   You've been Moriarty'd.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:56.440]   But Apple Watch is an interesting platform in that I wonder how many people use it for
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:01.600]   an app platform as opposed to the central thing of I want to know what time it is.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.640]   I want to get notifications.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:07.640]   I want to be able to reply to those notifications if necessary.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:11.640]   And otherwise, I really just want to fitness watch.
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:17.160]   I don't know if there's a whole lot of apps out there that are, "Oh my God, this makes
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:20.560]   no sense to use this on the phone or on the desktop or as a service."
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.880]   Thank God that there's a wearable that can finally implement this thing.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:25.440]   I think it's mostly health tracking.
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.280]   You're right.
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:31.680]   And that's why I'm hoping that this App Store on Apple Watch would bring about this sort
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:36.920]   of innovation that, "Oh wait, we can come up with an app that doesn't make sense anywhere
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.000]   else except on your watch.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.920]   That's what I'm hoping for because you're right right now.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.200]   There really isn't anything like that.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:48.040]   And there's so much money in so many people's pockets waiting to buy custom watch faces.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:54.560]   It's like this huge, like five gallon water bottle that people have been putting their
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:55.560]   loose change into.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:54:01.160]   And now, after all these years, it's got like $1,000 per person that I will spend this money
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:04.920]   and look how much money Ray spends on bands alone.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.080]   Now, if I can just get the right watch for the right face for the right day.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:11.040]   Yeah, you're going to have to hire a bunch more reviewers to get rid of all the Calvin
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.880]   and Hobbes faces that get submitted though.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:13.880]   That's going to be fun.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:17.160]   The one thing that occurs to me though is that I don't know.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.720]   I don't think it's going to be an app market.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:22.360]   I think we're going to look and there'll be sort of stages across apps.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:26.240]   The Mac will still be the place where you do massive amounts of data entry and editing
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:32.040]   and the iPad will be ideal for casual data entry, but for a lot of aggregation and reporting.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:36.200]   And the iPhone is going to be great for triaging for things to let you handle lots of stuff,
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.400]   but very quickly sort through it.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.600]   And then the Apple Watch will just be all about glance ability.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:45.400]   It won't need full apps, but it'll be based on extensions or features or functions pulled
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:49.200]   out of apps that just give you splashes of information when you need them or take really
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:51.200]   quick interactions on the go.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:55.640]   And I think Apple put the app store on there because to them everything, they had a hammer,
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.520]   everything looked like a nail.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:01.020]   And they didn't have an app store ready to go on the iPhone and that probably still
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.320]   stung a little bit.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.600]   So they really forced apps onto the first Apple Watch.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:08.960]   But I think over time, we'll see the Apple Watch condensed down into very, very simple
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:09.960]   things.
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:13.440]   And then I'm really eager to see what AirPod kind of apps look like in the distant future.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:16.440]   Like are they complete audio AR experiences?
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.440]   Are they something else?
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.880]   But we're going to get there too.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:24.240]   Yeah, I think the superstar of Apple Watch software isn't Watch apps, it's Watch complications.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:29.600]   Because if you just sneak that one little, that one little piece of data onto the watch
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:34.400]   that you never have to touch a button, that really that takes care of at least $80 of
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.680]   what you spend on it to make you happy.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:37.680]   >> The Raptors won, yes.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.360]   And then you can just go back to her.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.160]   >> Not so fast.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:42.000]   >> Sorry, sorry.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.040]   >> Canadian boy.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:48.020]   >> I think my warriors are going to have something to say about that.
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.520]   >> I think it's going to be the best interest that this ends quickly enough for Eddie Q to
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.760]   actually make it to WWDC maybe.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:59.840]   >> Or talk for those of you who aren't sport ball fans, Canada is in the NBA finals for
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.180]   the first time ever.
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:03.360]   >> We invented the game and we finally made the finals.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.360]   >> Really?
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.520]   Basketball was invented in in Canadian?
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:07.520]   >> Yep.
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:11.420]   >> That's the one with the Apple basket and they put a hole in the bottom.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:14.560]   That's the guy, I forget the guy's name, but it's a famous one of those Canadian heritage
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:15.560]   moments.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:16.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:18.560]   >> Let's get up there, Eddie.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.660]   Was that a boot?
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:21.660]   All right.
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:27.060]   >> Well, you didn't invent Steph Curry, although maybe it did because I think Steph's, doesn't
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:28.540]   one of Steph's parents come up?
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:30.300]   >> All good things are a little bit Canadian-leo.
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:33.500]   >> I think Steph has a Canadian roots as well.
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:34.940]   But anyway, I think his mom's from Canada.
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:37.940]   >> You were born under a Nor Easter, born under a Nor West, or your partner?
[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:39.500]   >> Mom's from Toronto, as I remember.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:40.500]   >> Oh, awesome.
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:41.500]   >> Yeah.
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:44.660]   >> So anyway, that begins Thursday.
[00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:46.260]   So we don't have to talk about it now.
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:47.260]   >> Yeah.
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:50.080]   >> Our show, we're gonna take a break, come back with more.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.160]   Great panel, as always.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.600]   This is our regular, these are our regulars.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:56.440]   For those of you wondering about Alex Lindsey, hey, we are too.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.880]   >> We are in contact with him.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:01.040]   He's not missing or anything.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.040]   >> No, no, he's not missing.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.040]   >> We have proof of life.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.200]   >> But he refuses to tell us what he's doing.
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:10.940]   And he says, whatever it is that I'm doing means I have to recuse myself from Mac Break
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:11.940]   Weekly.
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:12.940]   I believe that's what I'm saying.
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:17.780]   I guess that he's already standing in line for the Mac Pro because Apple knows however
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:22.100]   many Alex Baez is a canary for how successful the product will be.
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:24.260]   >> You know he's gonna buy a hundred of them, right?
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:26.940]   >> No, if he buys one, the product is not gonna last long.
[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:32.340]   If he buys ten, it's good if he buys a hundred, that thing is a classic.
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:33.340]   >> Yeah.
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:34.340]   Let's see.
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:35.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:39.380]   Steph Curry lived in Toronto for two years while his father, Del Curry, played for the
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:40.380]   Raptors.
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:41.380]   >> What?
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:42.380]   >> What?
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:43.380]   >> What?
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:49.380]   >> And that's of course from the star, so I don't take it with a grain of salt.
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:54.380]   >> You know, Canadians will lie about anything including inventing basketball.
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:57.340]   >> No, just do it.
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.500]   That's fun.
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.380]   That's gonna be a lot of fun, I think.
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:01.380]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:02.580]   >> I showed it a brought to Owen.
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:03.580]   Did I say Renee Richie?
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:04.620]   Did I say Laurie Gilded?
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:06.300]   Did I say Annie Naco?
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:09.260]   That's the panel that makes this show so good.
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:14.540]   And someday it's possible Alex will come back, but then we'll just have five people on the
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:15.540]   panel.
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:16.540]   >> Will it all come back?
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:17.540]   >> Yeah, 'cause I am not.
[00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:20.100]   No, no, we're not putting you in the cage.
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:22.460]   Two will end it, only one will emerge.
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:23.980]   >> I will be a nerd.
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:25.820]   >> No, Laurie stays.
[00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:28.580]   Laurie stays out of care what Alex says.
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:34.100]   >> I am officially on record and I will never get tired of saying it that I am in support.
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:37.460]   I will do everything possible to make sure that Laurie is a permanent member of this
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:41.340]   panel just short of meeting fire to make room for her.
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:42.340]   >> No, there's room.
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.340]   We have room.
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:44.340]   I could squeeze one more.
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:45.340]   >> I'll make a part-time fire.
[00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:47.340]   >> I could squeeze another monitor in here over this over next to Renee.
[00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:48.980]   >> Yeah, we just have to pan out a little.
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:50.700]   We can all do it, but I will fight Alex.
[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:51.700]   I will take him down.
[00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:53.220]   >> We can go to two rows, Leo.
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:54.580]   We can go to two rows of monitors.
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:57.220]   >> I suspect you would actually take Alex down more.
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:58.740]   >> But I should blow the bands.
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:58:59.740]   >> I should blow the bands.
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:01.740]   >> Alex is surprisingly strong.
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:02.740]   >> Yes.
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:06.140]   >> Well, I have been lifting, so, you know, I got my games.
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:09.660]   >> Oh, now maybe we shouldn't have a cage match.
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:11.860]   Now I'm interested.
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:13.580]   Are you sure they brought to you by Gazelle?
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.380]   If it's time, you know what?
[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:22.620]   If you're looking at this new iPod Touch, before you buy, go to Gazelle.com.
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:27.180]   Gazelle is the best place to buy a certified pre-owned device, and I'm going to give you
[00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:31.060]   10% off, which will make it even more attractive.
[00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:34.940]   So Gazelle is a place people go to sell, but it's also a place people go to buy.
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:38.420]   And of course, if you think about it because they're a marketplace, they've got a lot of
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:39.420]   new devices.
[00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:43.980]   They take the very best, they cherry pick them, and give you an opportunity to buy them.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:49.260]   Certified pre-owned devices, they have three different conditions, fair, good, and excellent
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:50.260]   conditions.
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:54.300]   So you can choose, depending on your price point, all of them work perfectly.
[00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:55.460]   This is important.
[00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:59.020]   They actually have a very detailed 30-point inspection.
[00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.020]   There's no major scratches.
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.380]   You know, I mean, and it works perfectly.
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:07.820]   And of course, it's always backed by a 30-day return policy with no restocking fee and free
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:08.820]   shipping.
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:10.300]   So it's completely risk-free.
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.140]   They have everything from an iPhone 6 through a 10.
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:16.300]   They have Samsung Galaxy phones, MacBooks, Air and Pro.
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:18.740]   They even have iPad, Standard Air and Pro.
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.260]   So they have a lot of great stuff.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:24.620]   Certified quality, no risk to buy them.
[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:30.060]   I'm going to guess that if you're looking at an iPhone 7, you might want to look at getting
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:34.300]   more storage and getting it from Gazelle for the same price.
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:38.140]   I mean, an iPod Touch, get an iPhone 7 for the same price.
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.340]   Financing's also available on all devices.
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:45.220]   They use a firm, which means you do it at checkout, and you can get instantly approved.
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:50.380]   Gazelle has a really great selection of quality pre-owned devices, a great choice for students,
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:55.340]   for kids, for people that, you know, blues a phone and can't bring themselves to buy
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.500]   another brand new one.
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:59.300]   It's always a better deal to buy used at Gazelle.
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:00.860]   You know that.
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:03.980]   And if you don't know what to do with your old devices, check out Gazelle for competitive
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:06.220]   offers on your used phones, tablets and computers.
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:09.340]   In fact, a lot of people, it's a dual transaction.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:13.820]   They get rid of all their old stuff at Gazelle, and they buy the next generation.
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.420]   Level up with new tech from Gazelle.
[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:22.260]   Gazelle.com/twit to buy a certified pre-owned device and get 10% off your purchase.

[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:27.460]   Don't rush to buy that new iPod Touch.
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:29.700]   At least check out Gazelle first.
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:33.660]   And with 10% off, that's a good deal.
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:35.420]   You might even save money.
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.420]   Gazelle.com/twit.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:40.220]   I had a iPod Touch.
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:41.220]   Huh?
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:44.220]   You want an iPod Touch?
[01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.220]   No, you don't.
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:46.220]   I already got one.
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:47.220]   You got the old one?
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:48.220]   I did.
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:49.220]   No, I just ordered it.
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.220]   Really?
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:51.220]   It's on Thursday.
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.220]   Yeah.
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:53.220]   Why?
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:54.220]   Why?
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.220]   My iPod Touch is old.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:56.220]   Mine is like 4th gen.
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:57.220]   Don't you have an iPhone?
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.220]   I have a couple iPhones.
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.340]   I don't know.
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:02.340]   Honestly, I don't know.
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:03.340]   It's a disease.
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:04.340]   It's an apple disease.
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:09.460]   I think we all have it where you just buy crap from apple even if you don't need it.
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.180]   We just want to support a lot of about need.
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:13.100]   It's about want, Leo.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:14.100]   I am going to really.
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.220]   I like that pink color.
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:20.340]   I'm going to have to work really hard to not buy a Mac Pro if they don't.
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:24.580]   But if they talk about it Monday, they're going to say coming in December.
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:25.580]   December.
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:26.580]   Yeah.
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:27.580]   It's a 12th D.A.P.M.
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:28.580]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:33.300]   So I'll be safe.
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:36.020]   Huawei's chairman says, "Apple is my teacher."
[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:42.500]   I don't know if apple should celebrate that.
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:47.700]   He's saying if the same thing could happen in apple, China could ban apple.
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:48.700]   What would happen then?
[01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:54.260]   I had Ben Beherin on vector earlier this week and I asked him the same question and
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:57.700]   he gave me a really interesting answer because he's done a ton of research on topics like
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:58.700]   that.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:04.100]   He said that if you go down to Senzhen and Guangdong so much of their employment, their GDP is
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:07.980]   based on apple's business, all the manufacturing, all the parts, all the suppliers, that it
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:13.780]   would be incredibly difficult, harmful and damaging for China to mess with apple because
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:16.420]   it would be literally just tons of people unemployed.
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:19.940]   That didn't stop us from messing with China.
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:21.140]   But we don't have the same problem.
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:22.940]   We're not completely dependent on China.
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:23.940]   It's quite being farmers.
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:24.940]   Yeah, those things.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:28.980]   But the manufacturing industry, apple display, and even if they try to stop, we're tariff
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:34.260]   to high apple phones, apple stops making them that again increases unemployment in provinces
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:38.060]   where China is desperately trying to increase the economy and increase the employment.
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.500]   Trade war has collateral damage everywhere.
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.500]   Yes.
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.500]   It's a nasty thing.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:43.660]   It would hurt a lot of people.
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:48.940]   And I just hope that there is a reason for banning Huawei that has to do with national security,
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:51.980]   not trade, that it's not a political decision.
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:56.860]   Although the president's really muddied the waters because in one sentence, he said,
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:59.860]   "Yeah, it's because we don't trust Huawei.
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:03.300]   But if they made a trade deal, we would trust him again."
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.420]   The two things aren't so the way I look at it.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:09.900]   There are two things you have the people who do info sec, and they are very serious about
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:13.260]   the fact that by the time you detect a backdoor, it is already too late.
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:15.020]   It would be pervasive.
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.780]   And all of that is one thing.
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:21.540]   But then you have the politicians who look at the very real security stuff and use that
[01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:24.060]   as part of their leverage and negotiations.
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:28.460]   And they can choose to believe or disbelieve or implement or not implement what is very
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:32.260]   real security information depending on how they want to go politically.
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:36.260]   So I think they're both separate facets.
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:44.020]   >> And for the record, the worries about Huawei and their level of involvement with the Chinese
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:48.340]   government, including possible partial ownership from the Chinese government, that's been going
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:49.340]   on for 10 years.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:53.180]   It's not just something that the Trump administration has latched onto.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:58.260]   So I can't speak to their specific motivations for taking this particular action at this
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.060]   particular time.
[01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:02.380]   But this has been something that's been discussed.
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:06.900]   This has been a what should we do about this company problem for a long, long time.
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:10.740]   >> And much of what you say about Huawei, you can say about any Chinese company doing
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:11.940]   business in the United States.
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:13.500]   You're going to cut them all off.
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.500]   It's pretty selective.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.300]   They pretty much shut down ZTE last year.
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:18.300]   They're about to shut Huawei.
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:23.540]   >> Well, the big problem is that there are only three companies that are competing to
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:26.500]   build out the worldwide 5G network.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:32.700]   And because Huawei has both incredibly good 5G hardware technology, and it's much, much
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:37.540]   cheaper than what you're going to get from like Erickson.
[01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:48.100]   If there were an optimum time to settle this issue and stop Huawei from creating as Renee
[01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:55.860]   said, the possibility of a hugely compromised worldwide network, this would be the last
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:57.700]   window in which to pursue that.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:58.700]   >> True.
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:05:59.700]   I don't know what to say.
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:02.020]   Remember, and it's not just 5G at this point.
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:06.300]   Now they're really killing Huawei as a phone manufacturer as well.
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:09.700]   >> The arms thing, I mean, they can engineer around Android, but as far as I know, they
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.060]   cannot engineer around ARM.
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:12.060]   >> Right.
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:14.340]   So ARM's pulled out, Qualcomm's pulled out, Google's pulled out.
[01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:17.860]   Here's a three month time period of time.
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:19.700]   I think there probably going to be a lot of P20.
[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:24.180]   I think there are a lot of P20s and other Huawei phones on eBay right now, very cheap
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.580]   if you want to pick one up.
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:26.580]   >> More than me, 10 like this.
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:28.620]   >> You're never going to get updates again.
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:32.300]   >> We were talking to our Android Central team and they said that it's completely unknown
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:36.340]   whether this ban applies to the May 10 because does it apply only to phones that were shipping
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:40.100]   as of May 15th, whatever the deadline was, or phones that have been announced by then.
[01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:43.500]   And they're going to have to go to court to figure out what can be shipped and what can't
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.500]   be shipped and that's horribly messy.
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.300]   >> It's messy in general.
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:53.540]   And JP Morgan said today that one of the consequences will be a severe drop in iPhone
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:59.300]   sales in China because they expect, because one of the reactions from the Chinese people
[01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:03.140]   is kind of circling the wagons around Huawei.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:09.060]   They expect Huawei phone sales to go up considerably in China, which will cause sales according
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:13.380]   to JP Morgan of less than half of the iPhones sold in 2015.
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:16.460]   So a big drop, potentially a big drop in China.
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:21.420]   So there's lots of collateral damage with a trade where I agree with you, Andy, security
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:22.420]   is paramount.
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:27.020]   And the problem is I don't think anybody has enough except people in the administration
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:29.620]   and the defense intelligence community.
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:34.140]   I don't think anybody else has enough information to know whether this is about security or
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:35.300]   about trade.
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:37.780]   It's just unclear.
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:44.380]   And at some point, the problem is much more than just one company in China, and that's
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.100]   the other issue.
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.180]   I don't know what we do at this point.
[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:54.580]   I really don't.
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:57.220]   So interesting article in the Verge.
[01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:05.780]   You may remember about six months ago, Apple and Amazon cut a deal, which meant that Apple
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:08.300]   could once again sell on Amazon.
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:14.300]   But according to the Verge, this has killed all the little sellers.
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.180]   They've disappeared from the Amazon marketplace.
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:20.300]   And then more recently, I think it came in yesterday that Amazon has stopped buying
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:23.540]   from small vendors in general.
[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:30.420]   So there is a big shift going on at Amazon and it's going to hurt resellers on the Amazon
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:33.780]   marketplace of Apple gear.
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:40.460]   This is an interesting side effect of this particular trade battle.
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:45.900]   For end users, that means parts and old stuff will be harder to come by as well.
[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:53.860]   Yeah, is that something that just happened because nobody wants to buy their Apple products
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:57.660]   that's not from official Apple channels through Amazon?
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:04.780]   What is this because Amazon has started to ban or restrict third party sellers?
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:09.820]   I think Amazon is because of yesterday's shift in buying habits.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:14.180]   I think it's pretty clear Amazon now because of the counterfeit issue, if nothing else,
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:18.780]   and it's very concerned about buying from small or reselling stuff on the marketplace
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.180]   from small companies.
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:25.060]   And so I think you're going to see a very big change overall in the stuff that you can
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.780]   get on Amazon.
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:31.900]   And if you're buying Apple gear, it will be from Apple through Amazon.
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:35.380]   That's definitely an unfortunate side effect of this situation.
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:38.940]   It's great that we can buy Apple products on Amazon, especially because you can sometimes
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:43.820]   find them at 15 or 20% off when you can't on Apple.com.
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:50.620]   But I know people who own businesses and who have little Amazon market places and during
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:54.620]   certain times of the year, they've literally kept their business alive by selling on Amazon.
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:10:00.900]   So if that's taken away from them, some small businesses could lose everything by not being
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.620]   able to sell on Amazon anymore.
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:09.300]   It ties in to the right to repair movement because you might buy an old MacBook for the
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:10.300]   parts.
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:13.300]   I mean, there's all sorts of reasons you might buy that.
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:19.500]   The Verge quotes a reseller named John Bumstead, who has for years refurbished and sold old
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.700]   Mac laptops.
[01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:25.020]   And he's a big right to repair advocate.
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:29.780]   He says, "I'm selling something they've completely stopped manufacturing and don't support anymore."
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:37.660]   He can't understand why Amazon is worried about these or Apple for that matter is worried
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:40.260]   about people like him.
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:41.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:43.380]   It's one thing.
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:48.660]   If there's third-party sellers trying to sell the brand new iPhone XS or Tenar, but
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:51.140]   if it's just selling old...
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:53.460]   Yeah, who cares if he sells an iPod?
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:55.140]   That's like a 60...
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:58.620]   You know, one of the old iPods with this scroll dials wheels.
[01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:00.780]   Apple doesn't make it and sell it.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:01.780]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:04.580]   And as we've...
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:11.580]   I was only able to fix my 2015 MacBook Pro when it's SSD went south because I was able
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:20.060]   to buy a little cheap $12 plastic edge connector adapter that would allow me to use an M2-type
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:27.780]   modern Samsung storage module with the 2015 MacBooks proprietary, not really proprietary,
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:30.180]   but not modern compatible thing.
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:36.020]   And it would be a really provocative gesture if Apple were to say that the only source
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:42.500]   of ever repairing or keeping an old Apple anything afloat is through genuine Apple parts,
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:47.900]   genuine Apple service, that would be, again, a provocative act that would demand revolution
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:49.060]   and rebellion.
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:50.060]   Yeah.
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:54.940]   Bumstead says, "I've had a number of friends go out of business.
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:12:00.820]   It's hard to say Amazon is the cause, but it's sort of a death by a thousand cuts situation.
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:06.820]   He's gone to eBay basically and his personal website to sell the stuff he can no longer
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:08.380]   sell on Amazon's marketplace."
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:09.380]   Yeah.
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:11.620]   There are people that can take the classic...
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:17.540]   Someone, a kid dumped a whole glass of water into the laptop and actually fix it and bring
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:18.540]   it back.
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:19.540]   Yeah.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:20.540]   So it's...
[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:23.740]   And for less money than it costs to replace a three or four year old MacBook with a new
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:24.740]   one.
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:29.500]   So again, this really does seem like Apple would be putting a thumb in people's eyes
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:32.540]   for absolutely no compelling reason.
[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:34.340]   So I hope that this is...
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.060]   They find a balanced point between this.
[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.860]   All right, let's take a little time out.
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:39.380]   We'll get back to the show.
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:42.460]   Lots more to talk about, but first a word from our sponsor.
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:43.460]   Now get ready.
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:44.460]   It's going to make you hungry.
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.460]   Hello, fresh.
[01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:47.260]   My mouth's watering already.
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:49.380]   Hello, fresh offers home cooked meals made.
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:50.380]   Simple.
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:51.380]   We had the Dijon chicken.
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:54.060]   The other night it was so good.
[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:55.060]   Delicious meat.
[01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:56.860]   All the ingredients you need to make an incredible meal.
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:58.740]   It's America's most popular meal kit.
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:02.300]   And right now you get $80 off your first month.
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.300]   I'll tell you how in a second.
[01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:07.980]   I love the choices you have with Hello, Fresh.
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:14.060]   Delicious ingredients, just the right amount, delivered, packed in a very eco-friendly way
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:17.820]   and a very easy way to distribute.
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.780]   But they also have choices.
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:22.020]   You can have three meal plans to choose from.
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:25.300]   Classic, Veggie or Family.
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:29.420]   And then they also have some fun menu features like dinner to lunch, which gives you a dinner
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:32.420]   and leftovers for lunch or 20 minute meals.
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:36.620]   If people are in a hurry or the gourmet meals, those are really good.
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:38.980]   Actually it's fun to work your way up to those.
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:43.500]   You're going to get great new techniques, great new ingredients and delicious meals.
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:47.500]   The One Pot Wonders are great for people who don't like to wash dishes.
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.020]   Mmm, mmm, man.
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:52.300]   Now see I'm really starting to get hungry.
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:53.300]   Hello, Fresh.
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.980]   Make deliciousness.
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:58.140]   A part of your week every week.
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:00.140]   And here's how you do it.

[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:11.660]   Take back cooking.
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:12.860]   There's nothing like it.
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:18.660]   And if you've been eating out or microwaving meals, set an example for the kids.
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:20.100]   They need to learn how to cook.
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:24.940]   We're going to have a Hello Fresh session with Michael's friends next week.
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:31.740]   We're going to teach them a few key cooking skills, including making a bolognese sauce.
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.740]   HelloFresh.com/macbreak80.
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:40.180]   Use the code MacBreak80 for $20 off your first four boxes, $80 for the first month.
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:42.420]   HelloFresh.com/macbreak80.
[01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:49.700]   Thank you, HelloFresh, for your support of MacBreak Weekly and for making me hungry.
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:52.020]   Lunch time soon.
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.020]   Very good news for you.
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:57.540]   Renee Apple has started collecting map data in Canada.
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:58.540]   I know.
[01:14:58.540 --> 01:14:59.540]   It's so good.
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:03.100]   I finally know where I live.
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:04.100]   It doesn't say.
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:06.540]   I've never seen an Apple Maps van.
[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:08.380]   Has anyone seen this?
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:11.100]   I have and I've seen a Google Maps.
[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:12.380]   I've seen a Google Maps van.
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:15.340]   Whenever I see the Street View car, I moon it.
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:18.340]   It's a good way to be excluded, Leo.
[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:21.580]   I guess they probably would blur that out, wouldn't they?
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:25.900]   I was lucky enough one time I was standing outside in front of my house, not the one
[01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:30.340]   I live in now, but a different one when a Google van drove by.
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:32.140]   My partner and I were sitting there.
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:33.140]   We just waved at it.
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:35.140]   We stood there like this for about six months.
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:36.140]   That image was what you like.
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:37.140]   Oh, man.
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:38.140]   You're absolutely crazy.
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:39.140]   Nice.
[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:41.060]   Did they blur your face out, right?
[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:43.060]   Yeah, they blurred our face out.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:44.340]   Yeah, but not your night.
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:49.300]   So that's why when you moon them, make sure that your face is seen as well.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:52.500]   That way, maybe the only blur half of it.
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.580]   Any identifying tattoos?
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:58.180]   As a matter of fact, yes.
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:59.180]   Yes.
[01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:02.220]   That twint logo is not going to add to itself.
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:04.220]   You got that on air.
[01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:05.220]   Oh, God.
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:10.060]   Unfortunately, I can't see it, but others.
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:11.060]   Yeah.
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:12.060]   Let's see.
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:17.540]   iPhone 11 could let users send music to two Bluetooth devices at the same time.
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:19.780]   This is a rumor from nine to five Mac.
[01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:20.780]   That would be cool.
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:25.700]   So if it's two AirPods or two power beats pro, that's four people with one ear each.
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:27.700]   Just think about that.
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:28.700]   Oh, that would be.
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:34.340]   Or even like headphones and an AirPods, you know, or home.
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.340]   Or home.
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:36.340]   Speakers and headphones.
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:37.340]   I love this idea.
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:39.860]   Power Bluetooth and AirPods.
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:42.460]   Is this coming from somebody like Steve Troughton Smith?
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:45.140]   Is this going as from Maco Takara?
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:47.140]   Maco Takara.
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.140]   So it's in Japanese.
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:50.500]   I assume Steve is already installing all betas.
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.300]   That's why we haven't heard from him today.
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:53.300]   He's busy.
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:54.300]   Are there new betas today?
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:56.540]   No, but I'm sure Steve has them.
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:59.420]   The betas came out today.
[01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:02.660]   Did I get I saw 1213-1?
[01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:04.740]   When did that come out?
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:06.340]   Did I just got that?
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:07.340]   1213.
[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:10.420]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:11.420]   That what is it?
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:13.140]   It's for Apple Card.
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:14.140]   Apple Card.
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:15.340]   What's Apple Card?
[01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:16.340]   Apple Card.
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:20.060]   Oh, well, this will I be able to use the Apple Card now?
[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:24.460]   I think when this launches, I think on and around WWDC, you'll be able to request your
[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:26.140]   titanium Apple Card.
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:28.500]   Add that to your checklist of things.
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.500]   You know, they're bingo card for Monday.
[01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:31.500]   Apple Pay.
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.820]   Just imagine what goals I could do with those titanium cards, Andy.
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:35.660]   And it just doesn't go for it.
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:39.100]   No, I still have the only metal Apple related card that matters.
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:40.100]   That's Waz's card.
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.660]   I've got the Steve Waz and the App Business card.
[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:48.700]   You can, in fact, Steve does cut stake with it on their point if you ever need to.
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:51.140]   That's one of the things Waz is famous for.
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:52.180]   That and his $2.
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:53.740]   His pad of $2.
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:57.980]   Those dots look like dots, but they're actually basic from the original Apple.
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:01.940]   No, no, see, again, it's the classic cheese grater.
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:04.980]   When you got a design that works, you stick with it.
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.860]   If you feed that in, that is basic.
[01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:08.020]   You got the whole language right there.
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:10.140]   I bet you can also use it as a lockpick.
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:12.260]   I'm just guessing.
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:13.260]   Just guessing.
[01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:15.700]   Free from the server.
[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:16.700]   Let's see.
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:18.100]   Oh, it's got...
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:22.340]   So 12.3, 12.3.1.
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:23.340]   Apparently also...
[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:24.340]   I mean, this was...
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:29.340]   We only got 12.3 a few, like a week ago, right?
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:36.900]   Also includes messages, fix, and vault-y fixes, voiceover LTE.
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:40.620]   It fixes an issue that could prevent making or receiving calls over LTE.
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:46.380]   Also, an issue that could cause messages from unknown senders to appear in your conversation
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:48.740]   list.
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:53.980]   Even if you've turned on filter unknown senders, so it's just a mistake in the filter, I guess.
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:59.020]   Fishes, fixes an issue that could prevent report junk link from appearing in messages, threads.
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:01.340]   Okay, so it's just a bug fix release.
[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:05.260]   Didn't even go out in the beta channel, I think.
[01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:07.340]   Just, you know, we're going to fix this.
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:09.980]   They're getting ready.
[01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:15.100]   The ECG app is now on its way to Canada, so if you would like to have a atrial fibrillation
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:17.420]   Renee, you can.
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:18.620]   Now you can.
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:26.100]   Yeah, that was a weird thing because Health Canada kept tweeting everybody who mentioned
[01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:28.740]   it that Apple hadn't submitted it yet.
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:32.420]   Even though they know full well that submitting it to Health Canada is the end of a process,
[01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:33.420]   not the beginning of it.
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:36.700]   You have to get like everything in order with all the supporting everything and then give
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:37.700]   it to them.
[01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:40.980]   And then they put it up on their website saying that Apple had submitted it before Apple said
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:41.980]   anything.
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:42.980]   So there's even more questions.
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:47.460]   So I think Apple just went to the Canadian newswire and said here just fine, whatever.
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:48.460]   That's the way.
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:49.460]   There you go.
[01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:51.100]   It's on its way to Canada.
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.780]   What is on its way means soon?
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:56.500]   Yeah, I just they have to get through the red tape and then as soon as it possibly can
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.500]   be go live.
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:01.540]   So that just play means the next update that like when 12th up for goes live look alive
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:02.540]   with it.
[01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:10.980]   I am hoping that on Monday Apple will announce a bug fix for its abacus emoji.
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:14.380]   This is so it's great and it's fun.
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:16.140]   But man, is that nitpicky?
[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:18.340]   Nitpicky.
[01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:24.060]   So if you really care, there's a long piece on the verge by Chaim Gartner.
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:25.060]   A long.
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:33.340]   Well, because you know why you have to explain why the four dot two vertical horizontal arrangement
[01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:35.580]   is not right.
[01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:38.180]   If you're Michael Gartner works on you have a lot to live up to.
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:39.180]   Yeah.
[01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:42.420]   I mean, the research is great.
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:48.500]   He actually interviewed a mathematics professor Loyola and abacus historian, Professor Eli
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:55.580]   Mayer, who could not recall an abacus with a four to bead arrangement, except perhaps
[01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:57.580]   as a toy for more.
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:00.580]   Well, it's fair because we were all over Google when they got their beer and their
[01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:01.580]   cheeseburger wrong.
[01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:03.620]   Well, but that really was wrong.
[01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:04.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:05.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:06.620]   Okay.
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:11.180]   The giant the Chinese would typically use two beads at the top and five at the bottom.
[01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:17.740]   The Japanese one at the top and four or five at the bottom, but never on its side and never
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:21.140]   four and two left and right.
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:23.620]   So actually it's not.
[01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:26.060]   And then I am right.
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:30.620]   In the name of fairness, some abakai from different phone manufacturers are also off,
[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:33.180]   historically speaking, but apples is the worst offender.
[01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:36.180]   I know this because I went and checked them all.
[01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:37.820]   Google, my radar.
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:38.820]   That's important.
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:41.860]   Our Google Microsoft or Facebook are the leaders in this field.
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:47.060]   All three have mathematically and historically correct abakai.
[01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:50.100]   On the other hand, Samsung, Twitter and WhatsApp are also incorrect.
[01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:55.380]   All three brands use the Western style abakai, but with six, seven and five beads respectively,
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:59.460]   making them little more than depictions of a toy.
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:03.780]   But you really couldn't do anything at all with the sideways four to arrangement.
[01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:07.260]   Great national abacus nightmare is still ongoing.
[01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:09.540]   I am not a nitpicker.
[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:10.540]   I am a pedant.
[01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:14.140]   There's a difference which I will now explain to you in a 2000 word.
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:16.620]   Using an abacus.
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:22.740]   I would like to make fun of this, but I'm the person pointing out regularly that look,
[01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:24.860]   the lobster emoji is red.
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:25.860]   It's red.
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:30.300]   If you want to say this is a living creature that was boiled alive, that's fine.
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:34.220]   But maybe you want to change it to look a greenish brownish blue.
[01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:35.220]   So true.
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:40.420]   What is there kind of something about the squid emoji too?
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:42.580]   Oh, it has too many legs.
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:45.900]   Or I think it's facing the wrong way.
[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.940]   It's technically upside down.
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:54.700]   A new video mural on displaying San Francisco from the artist JR.
[01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:56.780]   It's called Chronicles of San Francisco.
[01:22:56.780 --> 01:23:03.940]   I know about it because Tim Cook tweeted it because there's an iPhone or two in it.
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:04.940]   Is there?
[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:05.940]   Where's the iPhone?
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:06.940]   I don't see it.
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:07.940]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:11.020]   There's iPhone integration.
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:15.580]   You can use the JR murals iOS app to explore the mural.
[01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:17.300]   Oh, I get it.
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:18.300]   Wow.
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:24.740]   So let's just here it is at the Museum of Modern Art, the SF MoMA.
[01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:30.340]   The Chronicles of San Francisco mural is a moving masterpiece by my good friend JR art.
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:32.420]   Tim Cook's good friend.
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:35.140]   And is it AR that they're using?
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:37.340]   He's going to hold up an iPhone.
[01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:40.900]   Wow, it's kind of a neat mural.
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:44.580]   So JR is showing us here what you do.
[01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:45.580]   Turn up JR's audio.
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:46.580]   Let's hear what he's.
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:50.220]   Look at this opening and people are going to say it.
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:51.220]   Oh, look, they're plotting.
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:55.060]   The best part is you can listen to the story of every person.
[01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:56.820]   I think he must be French.
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:23:58.860]   I watch, I don't watch the book.
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:23:59.860]   Yes.
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:02.260]   And I go on the phone and I grab the app.
[01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:03.260]   Yes.
[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:04.260]   Which is free.
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:05.260]   It's called JR murals.
[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:08.740]   When you click on it, it's going to let you explore the mural.
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:09.740]   Oh, exactly blue.
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:14.300]   And when you explore the mural, it basically recognize the piece even on the cover here.
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:20.060]   But if you grab the whole mural and you look, for example, at those guys on stage that
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:26.180]   are right now, you can listen to them and listen what they have to say also.
[01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:32.020]   If I click on, I don't know, this woman even here that she don't see her face, then you
[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:33.020]   can hear her story.
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:34.020]   Wow.
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:37.700]   And you can get up all over the city.
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:39.500]   Wherever you actually see her.
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.500]   This guy put a lot of work into this mural.
[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:43.340]   I'm going to walk even in the book.
[01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:44.340]   Look at that.
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:47.140]   She can't be person here.
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:49.300]   And then I can hear.
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:51.140]   My name is Ian Tuller.
[01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:53.340]   That's kind of cool.
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:54.340]   So there you go.
[01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:59.820]   That's the go to the San Francisco mama and bring your iPhone when you look at the chronicles
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:02.980]   of San Francisco exhibit.
[01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:08.500]   There's a lot functioning.
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:15.460]   Apple one with unique accessories sells for $471,000 at auction.
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:18.700]   Andy, did you bid on that?
[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:20.700]   Yeah, look at that.
[01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.300]   The brief, maybe, look at that.
[01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:25.460]   Yeah, it's like you forget that there wasn't a standard case.
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:28.140]   So people would build it into whatever they wanted to build at that.
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:34.260]   Although I'll say that monitor was like the less object for geeky kids because it meant
[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:35.740]   that I don't have to plug it into a TV.
[01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:40.100]   I actually have a screen that does nothing but show video from my computer.
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:42.740]   Oh, sweet.
[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:50.020]   So the most Apple one is sold for is almost a million, I think, like $800,000.
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:55.500]   But they've also gone for considerably less.
[01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:56.780]   So there you go.
[01:25:56.780 --> 01:26:01.260]   So that's kind of in the middle of the price.
[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:08.140]   I just hope that they're going to like museums and places where people can see them publicly.
[01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:13.820]   It's just like when a really brilliant piece of art goes from when the Salvador Monday,
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:20.580]   Monday, like as goes, when I'm newly in our picture, gets bought by private hands and
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:21.740]   then it's an investment thing.
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:26.740]   So it's just in some sort of deep underground storage lockers somewhere in Switzerland,
[01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:30.540]   whereas if it were bought and put into a museum, now everybody can see it and everybody can
[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:31.540]   enjoy it.
[01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:35.220]   I think that historically significant computers like that are going to have the same sort
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:38.980]   of cache that this is what computing was like.
[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:46.140]   This was someone who even if you were buying a computer instead of building it from scratch,
[01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:50.340]   you were essentially just buying a board that you then had to sort of build and make useful
[01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:51.980]   somehow.
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:27:03.580]   There's a great museum in Tokyo that has a lot of this older and kind of odd technology
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:06.220]   in it going back many years.
[01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:07.660]   I wonder if I can still have my picture.
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:10.460]   Let me see if I can find the picture I took.
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:13.740]   My favorite one was an abacus calculator.
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:15.660]   Oh, yes, yes.
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:17.340]   Yeah, I showed it.
[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:18.740]   Yeah, it was a calculator.
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:19.740]   Here it is.
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.500]   It was a calculator.
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:22.500]   I think it was sharp.
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:26.220]   Yeah, the Sharp EL 428 solo cow.
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:31.180]   But no, they got the abacus correct with the proper orientation, the single B to the top,
[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:33.860]   the four below.
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:35.340]   But also a calculator.
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:38.220]   Just, you know, excuse me.
[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:41.260]   Skeumorphism had a statement, but it has no place in marketing computing.
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:44.140]   But we call it transitional object.
[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:48.820]   So yeah, but to second your point, Andy, I think all this old stuff should be acquired
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:54.320]   by museums and stuff because, you know, they're probably not useful to anybody except for
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:58.740]   nostalgia, but they are historic pieces in many ways.
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:05.180]   And if they want to buy my old iPhone, I'm glad to sell them, or my old iPod.
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:06.340]   I think I have the original.
[01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:07.340]   Classic.
[01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:08.340]   Yeah.
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:09.340]   Do you have the classic?
[01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:15.260]   I have the original, the day one iPod with a firewire connector and everything in my museum
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:16.260]   back there.
[01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:17.260]   Sounds great.
[01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:24.580]   I posted a picture of a set of Lisa computer that I have.
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:28.980]   And I recently got like a message from someone saying, yeah, I have a Lisa one with the revision
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:31.900]   B ROMs that can only work with that.
[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:33.420]   I'm trying to write an emulator.
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:34.420]   Can we talk?
[01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:35.420]   Oh, okay.
[01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:36.420]   Let's talk.
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:37.420]   That's awesome.
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:38.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:39.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:40.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:41.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:42.420]   It's fun to have that old stuff.
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:46.460]   I still have the, my music was on there too, including the Britney Spears and the Backstreet
[01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:47.460]   Boys.
[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:50.500]   So that's part of the fun, isn't it?
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:54.340]   You have these, you have these things in the drawer and then like eight years later, it's
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:57.780]   like finding a box of your mix tapes from, from junior high.
[01:28:57.780 --> 01:28:58.780]   Yeah.
[01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:02.820]   Before we get to your picks of the week, folks, it's time to hear from our fine sponsor Atlassian.
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:05.620]   Atlassian has a lot to do with getting this show on the air.
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:09.060]   Our entire IT team runs on Atlassian.
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:15.180]   You know what Atlassian, a collaboration software company that powers IT teams around the world
[01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:17.540]   is famous for their software.
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:23.780]   Of course, everybody knows JIRA, but what you may not know is JIRA is not just for developers.
[01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:28.900]   Atlassian offers an affordable, reliable set of tools for all teams of all kinds and all
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:30.140]   sizes.
[01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:34.140]   If collaboration is at the center of your world and we know that IT is at the center
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:38.580]   of our world, you need to know about Atlassian.
[01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:43.100]   It gives you the tools to let you plan and execute faster than ever.
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:46.980]   IT is at the center of this complex cloud-based world and you know what?
[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:51.660]   In business critical workflows, failure is not an option.
[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:55.620]   We use JIRA to keep track of who's doing, what projects they're working on and what
[01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:57.700]   stage the projects add.
[01:29:57.700 --> 01:30:00.100]   We use confluence to document what's done.
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:01.100]   That's really important.
[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:04.860]   In fact, one thing I would say about Atlassian is not just collaboration within the team,
[01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:11.580]   it's also communication outside the team to colleagues, clients, customers, stakeholders,
[01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:14.820]   everybody who needs to know what's going down.
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:17.220]   If you've got code, you need Bitbucket.
[01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:22.180]   If you have ops, you've got ops-genian status page so you can better detect incidents,
[01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:26.500]   coordinate response issues, efforts, resolve issues faster.
[01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:31.340]   Of course, as always, with everything, keeping stakeholders up to date is really important.
[01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:33.300]   The boss ought to know what you're doing.
[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:37.140]   It's good for you and trust me, good for them, boss.
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:43.380]   Atlassian is for all teams of all sizes, from DevOps to Agile to IT apps to ops and ITSM,
[01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:47.700]   whatever's next, Atlassian's got your back.

[01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:26.900]   Now let's kick off our picks of the week.
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:27.900]   Lori Gill!
[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:31.780]   What am I buying this week, Lori?
[01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:34.220]   You might actually want this one.
[01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:38.740]   This is the latest and greatest coming out of 12 South.
[01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:44.540]   They finally updated the bookbook case for the iPad Pro 2018.
[01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:45.860]   Oh, I love this one.
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:46.860]   It's so cute.
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:47.860]   I love this.
[01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:49.140]   It's a cute little thing.
[01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:52.420]   I think it's not just cute though.
[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:56.700]   So yes, it looks like a book, which is just adorable.
[01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:58.780]   But it's leather bound.
[01:31:58.780 --> 01:31:59.940]   It's leather stitched.
[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:00.940]   It's book stitched.
[01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:05.660]   It's not just the image, but they actually do book stitching on the outside of it there.
[01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:07.420]   It feels like it's really cool.
[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:08.420]   They're telling this one.
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:09.420]   It really does.
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:10.420]   Yeah.
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:11.420]   Yeah.
[01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:12.420]   And they're calling this one volume too because they did update it.
[01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:13.740]   They added a couple of things.
[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:19.660]   There's a little pocket on the inside so that you can slip some papers or actually my idea
[01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:23.820]   would be to slip in one of your super thin keyboard cases.
[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:28.340]   I think Logitech makes that ultra slim keyboard case.
[01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:30.820]   You can slide it right in there.
[01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:34.380]   There's room on the top so that you can put your Apple Pencil right on the top so it'll
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:36.620]   be charging the whole time.
[01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:38.620]   And it does have camera support now.
[01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:44.220]   So they put a hole on the back so you finally can use your iPad Pro with the camera on the
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:48.620]   backside, which I don't think any of the rest of them have the camera support.
[01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:50.300]   So yep, that's my pick this week.
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:51.300]   It's a beauty.
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:53.220]   I don't actually have it yet, but it's coming soon.
[01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:56.660]   So I'll be able to write a full review on it and a little bit and tell it.
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:57.660]   Yeah.
[01:32:57.660 --> 01:33:00.780]   Mega had the volume one and it really, it's really neat the way it looks.
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:03.500]   And it would fool anybody if you added your backpack.
[01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:04.860]   They say, I don't want that old book.
[01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:07.260]   What else can I steal?
[01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:09.260]   So there.
[01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:11.340]   Andy, pick of the week.
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:15.100]   Well, we were talking about old Max and kind of a running theme for the past couple
[01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:18.460]   of months have been the computers up and buying at the MIT flea market.
[01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:25.620]   I am now two for two for buying a old laptop with the idea of using it as like a primary
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:27.180]   Linux machine.
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:32.260]   One of the last month, the month before I bought a 2008 white MacBook that is going
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:33.900]   to be with a Intel Core Duo.
[01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:35.420]   So it should be really good for Ubuntu.
[01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:38.500]   So I've been looking at a whole bunch of different Linux distros and I found one that
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:41.300]   is really quite interesting that hadn't heard of.
[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:43.580]   It's called pop OS.
[01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:46.940]   And what makes it interesting is that it's Ubuntu, which means, which is sort of like
[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:54.780]   the Mac OS slash Windows of Linux, meaning it's a real absolutely desktop quality professional
[01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:56.100]   OS.
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:34:02.220]   But with pop OS, the people who are creating this version of Ubuntu have made lots of tweaks
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:05.780]   to it to make it really, really, really starter friendly.
[01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:11.700]   So the problem with Linux has historically been that you will install like Ubuntu and
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:12.980]   it works fine.
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:16.260]   But then to make it work the way that you want to, it's going to take you a couple months
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:18.140]   to add the right windowing manager.
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:19.940]   Then yeah, I really miss having a doc.
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:21.380]   So I really want to have this doc here.
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:24.340]   No, I don't want the Windows style doc with a Mac style doc.
[01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:29.300]   But I really like thinking about pop OS is that it really works like a consumer level
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:33.140]   Mac friendly OS right out of the box.
[01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:40.540]   It really is the driving issue for it when they were designing it was that we want something
[01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:45.180]   for people who are creating stuff as opposed to people who are just interested in Linux
[01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:49.180]   or people who don't want to spend money for a Windows license.
[01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:50.980]   And I'm really liking it a lot.
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:53.820]   There's sort of a sidecar recommendation to it.
[01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:58.620]   One of the nice things about Linux is that you can, part of the culture is the tech culture
[01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:01.340]   is that you can boot off of a thumb drive.
[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:07.060]   You can have a live CD, live USB thumb drive so that you don't actually have to wipe your
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:08.820]   hard drive to try it out.
[01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:13.900]   You can just install the entire Linux boot system and file system on a USB stick and
[01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:17.180]   then simply boot off of that external device.
[01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:20.620]   So that's how I've been testing it on my old Mac book.
[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:25.420]   And there's a really cool Mac utility called Etcher that will make that really, really
[01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:26.420]   simple.
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:29.940]   You just download the ISO file which will have the installation stuff and the boot stuff
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:32.940]   from whatever sources, packaging or Linux.
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:39.740]   And then on your Macintosh you use that to basically install that ISO into the USB stick
[01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:43.380]   to make it into a bootable Linux USB system.
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:45.940]   And you know it works at the very very end.
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:49.580]   The Mac says the device you've just inserted is not readable by this Macintosh.
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:52.860]   That means that it really is all prepared.
[01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:56.780]   And then if you simply reboot and then tell the Mac or tell the Windows machine or whatever
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:36:01.580]   it is to boot off this USB thing, you will have a completely functioning Linux desktop
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:03.900]   or completely functioning PopOS desktop.
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:07.860]   And if you don't like it after a couple of days, you haven't changed anything to your
[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:08.860]   main system.
[01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:13.900]   If you do like it, then you can install the full system onto your internal drive directly
[01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:14.900]   from the USB drive.
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:20.340]   It costs you nothing to sample these other versions of Linux even if you have a perfectly
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:21.340]   good machine.
[01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:23.300]   Some of these will even let you dual boot stuff.
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:25.180]   So it's worth checking things out.
[01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:29.340]   And if you do have an old Mac somewhere in the closet that's not doing anything useful
[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:33.860]   for you, maybe this is a way that you can sort of refresh it and revitalize it, particularly
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:39.220]   if as with my 2008 MacBook, you can't upgrade it to anything above Lion.
[01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:43.740]   So I'm locked out of a lot of reasons why a Mac is so good in 2019.
[01:36:43.740 --> 01:36:48.100]   So historically, it's always been difficult to install Linux on top of MacBooks.
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:55.220]   But is PopOS now to the point where it works pretty much out of the box for most old Macs?
[01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:57.060]   I got it working and it works fine.
[01:36:57.060 --> 01:37:00.500]   I've seen a lot of people saying they're using PopOS on Macs and it kind of blows me
[01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:01.500]   away.
[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:02.500]   Yeah.
[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:06.180]   This is my Linux of choice these days because it works with so much different, so many different
[01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:07.180]   hardware solutions.
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:08.180]   Yeah.
[01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:13.340]   And the other thing is that like I was starting off with a version of Ubuntu called X Ubuntu,
[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:14.860]   which is kind of like stream.
[01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:16.580]   It's very, very low intensity.
[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:17.980]   It doesn't require a lot of resources.
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:19.580]   So it's really good for old machines.
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:25.460]   But it has sort of the sticking point that kind of frustrates me, which is the app that
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:30.620]   you use to install apps from doesn't necessarily have all the good Linux apps.
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:36.020]   What I like about PopOS, like a couple of other Linuxes is that it's not really dogmatic
[01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:41.340]   about entirely being comprised of free software.
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:45.780]   So you can get the Google Chrome browser if you want to run Chrome directly from the
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:50.180]   quote app store and quote, you can get other software that is not completely open source.
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:53.420]   It does have some proprietary copyrighted stuff.
[01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:57.940]   It's still free, but a lot of the most polished stuff like you can install Slack, you can
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:37:59.900]   install Skype directly from the stuff.
[01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:04.180]   When you're on other versions of Linux, sometimes you have to do install from the command line.
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:07.500]   And then that's another whole kettle of fish because we'll say, oh, well, this package
[01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.540]   requires the following other dependencies.
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:14.500]   So now I have to sudo install this, sudo install that, sudo install that, and then I can install
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:15.980]   Skype or whatever.
[01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:21.700]   So it's when I'm not looking to create an adventure for myself in Linux, I just want
[01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:26.740]   to be able to use this cool old hardware that I spent $10 for in the case of the old Mac
[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:32.260]   or $45 for the case of the old Windows machine and make it into an absolutely credible daily
[01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:33.540]   driver machine.
[01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:36.340]   And PopOS is a really good way to do that if that's your goal.
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:41.620]   Yeah, I mean, the technical story is they add PPAs for a lot of non-free stuff, including
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:44.900]   you can get Nvidia drivers, which is going to help you with a Mac.
[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:49.820]   But so there's a lot of non-free software in the PPAs mean it's automatically updated
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:51.260]   and so easily installed.
[01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:53.260]   So that is a big deal.
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:57.700]   PopOS comes from a company called System76 that makes Linux laptops and desktops.
[01:38:57.700 --> 01:39:00.260]   And I have a number of System76 machines.
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:01.860]   I've always liked them a lot.
[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:07.660]   And I think they've done the most amazing job taking Ubuntu, which is based on Debian spinning
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:13.420]   Ubuntu to PopOS and making it, I think the easiest Linux I've ever seen to install.
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:15.860]   I mean, it's it's perfectly simple.
[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:16.860]   Yeah.
[01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:18.340]   And again, it's just super super attractive.
[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:19.660]   I'm very, very happy with it.
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:23.780]   And as the only the only warning is that is it is still Linux.
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:27.580]   So it's possible that depending on which laptop you're installing it on, you'll find that
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:30.660]   the trackpad doesn't work for one of my machines.
[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:33.700]   And I did have to plug in the mouse and after doing a Google search, fine.
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:37.820]   Oh, well, here's here are two simple command lines you do to tell the snaptics driver,
[01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:41.340]   here's where my here's where to find my touchpad.
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:45.700]   So it's not it's not 100% click and go out of the box for everything.
[01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:50.900]   So as I often say, if you are not intimidated by the idea of doing an oil change on your
[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:54.260]   car, you will have absolutely no problems with Linux.
[01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:58.220]   If you are if you don't even want to check the oil in your car, you still might want to
[01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:02.020]   have a seeing eye nerd helping you get this thing get something installed.
[01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:07.580]   Yeah, I'm I've I had for years recommended a version of Arch called in Terego.
[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:08.820]   So they've stopped doing it.
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:12.820]   Unfortunately, but Papa West is easily the best solution.
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:14.980]   I haven't I haven't even heard of it.
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:18.020]   So I'm really grateful to someone Instagram that recommended choice.
[01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:19.900]   Very, very good choices.
[01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:20.900]   It's interesting.
[01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:23.900]   I'm seeing it spread almost virally.
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:26.140]   So that's really very exciting.
[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:29.220]   It makes it makes it hold of first impression and it makes it sticks in your mind and you
[01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:30.340]   really want to recommend it to people.
[01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:32.780]   Yeah, it's easy.
[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:34.940]   Renee Richie, pick of the week.
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:39.900]   So mine is a little bit self serving because my channel vector got included in the initial
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:44.060]   release, but there's a new video watching app called Nebula.
[01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:45.500]   And I believe it's a partnership.
[01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:47.460]   I know Dave Whiskis is working on it.
[01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:53.820]   CPG gray, Karukazak and a bunch of mostly educational video producers.
[01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:57.860]   And it's an attempt to do something a little bit different than YouTube where maybe you
[01:40:57.860 --> 01:41:02.860]   watch one video on the science of the Mariana Trench and then you get Megalodon videos in
[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:07.980]   your recommended list for like a year afterwards.
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:12.460]   So what this does is I couldn't find a way to get to all the videos.
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:16.100]   So I put a bunch of different links in the show notes, but there's all of Karukazak stuff.
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:17.380]   There's all of CGP gray stuff.
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:18.820]   There's all of legal ego stuff.
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:20.140]   I think Captain Midnight.
[01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:24.100]   I just a whole ton went over half as interesting.
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:29.820]   So some of the most popular educational is music, education about film, education about
[01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:32.180]   all these things have videos in there.
[01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:35.620]   And they're also producing original series because everybody is producing original series
[01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:36.620]   now.
[01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:37.860]   And that's the thing that's really cool.
[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:42.580]   They're putting together projects that really may not make sense given the way that YouTube
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:44.140]   or another one of those services work.
[01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:50.100]   But when you do services like this, you can afford to experiment a little bit.
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:51.100]   There's a free trial.
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:54.580]   If anyone just wants to take a look at it, test it out, try it out.
[01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:59.420]   And then if you really love it, it's five bucks a month and you can watch all of this
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:02.460]   sort of really smart, really sassy educational content.
[01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:04.660]   Hey, congratulations for being included.
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:05.660]   That's awesome.
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:06.660]   Thank you.
[01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:08.980]   I don't know how I smuck in there because I'm kind of techy, but I try to educate.
[01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:09.980]   So maybe.
[01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:11.260]   Oh, that's good.
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:12.580]   You know what?
[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:15.860]   This is always the challenge with starting something like this is getting a lot of really cool,
[01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:16.940]   cool, good content.
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:18.700]   So that's what they've clearly know.
[01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:19.700]   You're great.
[01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:20.700]   Watch nebula.com.
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:21.700]   Interesting.
[01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:22.700]   Yeah.
[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:29.260]   Renee, can I also ask that you know that you are you not do you now have your official?
[01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:32.340]   I now have my 100,000 YouTube subscriber plaque.
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:37.100]   And now I've got my 100,000 subscriber lighting because your lighting is awesome this week.
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:40.140]   Oh, you got the button.
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:41.140]   Nice.
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:42.780]   Very nice.
[01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:44.220]   That's the 100,000 button.
[01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:45.220]   Yes, sir.
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:46.220]   Very nice.
[01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:49.380]   50 million brofist like PewDiePie, but I'm getting it.
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:54.300]   Yeah, they have some higher levels, higher awards.
[01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:55.300]   That's really cool.
[01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:56.500]   I'm looking at all the people on here.
[01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:59.020]   They've got a great, great bunch of people.
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:00.020]   That's cool.
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:03.620]   I love that it's really like a stem and it's you know, it's it is sciences.
[01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:04.620]   It is geography.
[01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:08.020]   It is all the subjects that you should learn in school, but it's way more interesting when
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:10.020]   people make super cool animated videos about it.
[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:12.620]   And they give you some of that subscription fee I present.
[01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:13.620]   Yeah.
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:18.380]   I don't think I'm going to generate most of the views by any stretch of the imagination.
[01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:21.300]   But I assume like some of the really popular ones are going to do pretty well.
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:22.300]   Yeah.
[01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:24.340]   So they do it like Apple does.
[01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:28.140]   They base it on views.
[01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:31.620]   You know, honestly like Dave, Dave just pained me and said, can we do this?
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:35.620]   And I was so excited that I have a real talk about doing this for work because yeah, because
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:37.940]   like compared to them, they all have like millions of subscribers.
[01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:39.380]   So that really wasn't my concern.
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:40.380]   Yeah.
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:41.380]   But I'm sure.
[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:42.380]   Yeah, I'm sure the details are all in there.
[01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:47.380]   Here's the opportunity, my friend, to make it to the big time.
[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:49.540]   So it's like when you are the big person, you worry about that.
[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:52.460]   When you're the little person, you just try to hold on as long as you just everywhere.
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:53.860]   I just want to be everywhere.
[01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:56.020]   That's all I don't care.
[01:43:56.020 --> 01:44:03.620]   We I recently read actually this morning an article by by Mache Chiklowski, who is the
[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:05.620]   hardest name in technology.
[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:07.420]   He's a guy who does pin board.
[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:11.580]   But what I didn't know about Mache is he has been going around as a volunteer with other
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:18.540]   security experts, trying to teach congressional campaigns how to not get fished and hacked.
[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:22.140]   He's been doing security training, started in 2017.
[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:27.980]   And he has a lot of notes in here about how hard this is to take normal people and teach
[01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:28.980]   them.
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:33.020]   He says, I don't even I don't even bother to try to set up a password manager.
[01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:35.620]   This is like I get an hour.
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:43.500]   So he says it's key, it's key to come up with simple recommendations that they can remember.
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:50.460]   And he says, so the main thing I tell him is get the blue key, the Yuba key for two factor
[01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:51.460]   authentication.
[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:55.940]   And I thought that was really good advice because there's only one blue Yuba key.
[01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:57.580]   So it's easy to remember.
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:58.580]   It's cheap.
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:44:59.580]   It starts at $20.
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:02.220]   And if you get more than one, it's even cheaper than that.
[01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:09.500]   And it will add hardware second factor authentication to almost every site, certainly Google.
[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:14.380]   I don't know if Apple uses it for iCloud, but Facebook does, Twitter does, a lot of
[01:45:14.380 --> 01:45:15.380]   places do.
[01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:20.780]   And then I notice there is going to be a new Yuba key with look at this dual ports, a lightning
[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:22.980]   port and a type C port.
[01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:28.020]   So I will absolutely when they this that's not out yet, but when they come out with that,
[01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:32.940]   you can sign up for updates, the Yuba key for lightning will be great.
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:35.180]   Yuba key does support RFID.
[01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:40.540]   And so now that the iPhones allow RFID, that will also be a good choice.
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:44.900]   You can see it's, I think it's using not RFID NFC, it's using NFC with a blue key.
[01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:49.180]   So that probably is adequate for iOS as well.
[01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:56.380]   Good, a great article which I recommend on, on Mache's blog, which is idle words.com,
[01:45:56.380 --> 01:45:59.820]   how to secure a congressional campaign and a really good.
[01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:00.980]   Yeah, look at that.
[01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:04.380]   These are all the blue Yuba keys he brings to the event.
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:10.620]   He says also write your, write your name on it because they all look the same.
[01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:14.260]   He also says in many congressional campaigns, they have multiple people using the same Twitter
[01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:15.260]   account.
[01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:19.740]   So he recommends putting the Yuba key on a hula hoop and hanging it on a hook.
[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:22.820]   That way it won't get stolen or lost.
[01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:23.940]   See it's valuable.
[01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:25.820]   It's valuable.
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:28.420]   Thank you ladies and gentlemen for stopping by today.
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:33.660]   This is, this is the end of Mac break weekly for this week, but not, not for long because
[01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:37.980]   again, we'll be back on Monday with WWDC coverage and then the following Tuesday, the
[01:46:37.980 --> 01:46:42.340]   next day to get this panel's opinion on what it all was.
[01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:45.660]   Renee Rich, you'll be there at WWDC, which means you probably won't be on the show I'm
[01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:46.660]   guessing.
[01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:50.980]   No, sadly, they keep us real, they keep us real busy now.
[01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:51.980]   Good.
[01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:52.980]   They should.
[01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:53.980]   Same for you, Laurie.
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:56.580]   Oh, you're muted.
[01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:59.020]   Laurie's talking.
[01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:02.780]   She's looking great, but we can't hear a word she's saying.
[01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:03.780]   Unmute.
[01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:05.460]   There you go.
[01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:06.980]   All right.
[01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:07.980]   Sorry.
[01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:11.220]   You know, I try to keep quiet so that if I'm coughing when someone else is talking,
[01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:12.220]   they can't hear me.
[01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:13.940]   I just forgot to put it back on that time.
[01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:14.940]   No problem.
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:19.060]   I was saying, I don't know yet because they're not going to keep me as busy as they're keeping
[01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:20.060]   Renee.
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:21.580]   So I have to find out for sure what's going on.
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:26.540]   I might be able to show up and say hello after the event.
[01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:27.740]   We'd love to get your thoughts.
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:28.740]   Yeah, on Tuesday.
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:29.740]   That would be great.
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:31.300]   Andy, you'll be here.
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:33.620]   I will be here manning the Eastern Control Post.
[01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:34.620]   All right.
[01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:38.220]   And thank what library should we thank for today's show.
[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:41.140]   Apparently Andy is doing the show from the public library.
[01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:45.700]   Yes, one of the many resources available to you at your local public.
[01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:50.740]   Not only that, but they have like, I guess they're thinning out their DVD and CD collection.
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:56.660]   So while I was setting up, I got about 10 CDs for quarter each and four for what included
[01:47:56.660 --> 01:48:00.620]   including a Blu-ray of like the latest James Bond movie for a dollar.
[01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:03.140]   So check out your local library.
[01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:05.660]   This is it's I can't and you know what?
[01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:07.340]   This is a great place to do a podcast from.
[01:48:07.340 --> 01:48:10.100]   I'm going to tell people this from now the bandwidth was perfect.
[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:12.020]   This couldn't have been better.
[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:14.140]   Again, I might.
[01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:16.420]   It's certainly a lot better than like trying to keep my office tidy.
[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:19.500]   That's all just going there every week.
[01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:22.300]   But if they want to plug or whatever, we'll be glad to thank you.
[01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:23.300]   There you go.
[01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:24.300]   Yeah.
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:26.100]   And the tax of property tax override.
[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:27.100]   You'll fit worth it.
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:30.380]   You'll find him also once a week at WGBH Boston.
[01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:33.740]   What day are you this week?
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:34.740]   Looks like Thursday.
[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:35.740]   It might be Friday.
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:41.660]   I don't know yet, but go to my Twitter feed at an not go to I H and A T K O and I usually
[01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:44.500]   announce it like a day or the morning of easiest thing to do.
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:45.500]   Follow him on Twitter.
[01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:46.900]   Thanks Andrew.
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:47.900]   Thanks to Lori Gail.
[01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:51.300]   I'm the managing editor and I'm more alcoholic on the Twitter.
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:54.820]   APPH, APPA H O L I K. Thank you.
[01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:55.820]   You got it.
[01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:57.580]   And thank you, Renee Richie.
[01:48:57.580 --> 01:48:59.580]   Go Raptors not.
[01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:00.580]   I'm more.
