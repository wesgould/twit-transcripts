[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.360]   It's good to be here looking gorgeous as always why thank you by which I mean you're not you but you know your shot
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.080]   That's Annie and I go got him to laugh
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:37.360]   Laughter because that was funny, but also an appreciation for very few people who are not like Italian mothers
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.880]   Can really get the combination of a compliment, but then I check back in the head. I'm well trained. I'm well trained
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.560]   I really am WJ you know the age of us, you know, you should wear that suit jacket more
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.720]   It really makes you look like you're not a totally out of shape blob of love
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.960]   To be that you could just say oh that suit really looks good. You don't look nearly as heavy
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.360]   You look you look so presentable
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.400]   That's it. I people tell me you clean up good. That's the one where I go. Mm-hmm. Okay fine
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.720]   Okay fine also Jason's and now
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.560]   Who has his very own fortress of solitude, you know, I there are two cats here. I am not in solitude
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.520]   I have two cats with me cats in your garage. It's totally not just me
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.480]   We have a cat now
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.760]   That whenever we sit and watch TV gets up in front of the TV and doesn't look at the TV like a like
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.880]   I could make a good video out of it, but no looks at us like why are you watching this? Yep
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.440]   And then after that for a little while she goes and sits on my head
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.960]   Which Lisa then posts unmasted on and then my whole life is over
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.920]   Welcome all three of you speaking of
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.360]   Twitter where we
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.280]   Elon has apparently declared war against apple. This should be fun. Get the popcorn kids
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.520]   I did not know this but apparently apple represents 48%
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.720]   Of the advertising. Oh, I don't know. It's I don't it's that much but that would be I think it's 48 million
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.040]   I'm sorry. Maybe I get the 48 wrong. It's not because I think it would be 2.5 billion if it was four that would be really ridiculous
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.240]   That would be insane, but um, but apple is a big
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.880]   Big advertiser. I think the biggest am I am I miss yeah, it's the largest largest single advertiser
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.680]   So so the funny thing is a lot of people have stopped advertising
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.840]   But but apple is the one that he decided to pick on because it's a really and by the way
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   I could tell you as a
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.600]   As supported network myself. I bet you'll agree with me Jason Snell the worst way to get advertisers to come back
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.000]   Is to whine about them leaving
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.160]   Right. Yeah, apparently
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:58.280]   Uh, there's a strategy at work here where elon actually has gone to a bunch of advertisers and harangued them about dropping their advertising
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.560]   Or reducing their advertising and you're like, well, why would you make them angry?
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.440]   But the the other story is that a bunch of other advertisers have decided not to do it right now
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.960]   Because they don't want to be bugged by elon musk and they're like just
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.520]   Give him their give him their money and and I don't want to get his phone call
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.280]   Which is kind of a is that a strategy, but I guess it is also it's not a personal thing
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.400]   Uh, the verge got got got got a look at uh, got a look at a an email or an advisory from
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.520]   Uh a group called the omni comm omni comm media group
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.920]   That uh, they have clients including apple that they advise for for advertising
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.640]   And they're telling all of its clients to quote pause activity on twitter in the short term unquote
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:46.760]   Uh speaking that there's their concern about impersonation layoffs and layoffs safety issues resignations
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:53.480]   Of people who are responsible for ftc compliance. So may, I mean, it's if if elon thinks that he's so
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.680]   The king of the world that this could only be a personal vendetta between apple and elon is opposed to
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.760]   Hey, I got an email from this company that we trust to keep us out of trouble when we advertise
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.240]   We are one of the many companies that they told hey, you might want to back off of twitter
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.640]   We decided hey, that's not that's not gonna hurt
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.120]   That's not gonna hurt us if we drop their advertising and they did it. Oh, that's all that happened
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.680]   uh elon uh yesterday
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.760]   launched a
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.760]   multiple tweet storm
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.360]   He said apple has mostly stopped advertising on twitter. Do they hate free speech in america
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.160]   That's an interesting conflation
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.880]   Uh, he's gone very much
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.000]   He said he should might as well just say apple have you stopped beating your wife? Right? Yeah, it's one of those
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   It really is exactly like a joke. Yeah, uh, he said
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.920]   Tim what's going on here at tim underscore cook remember phil shiller did
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.200]   Close his account on twitter
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:55.720]   Um, uh, he is responsible for the app store and for that reason elon is also tweeting
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.480]   apple has also threatened to withhold triddle twitter from its app store
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.360]   But won't tell us why these all came within minutes of each other on twitter yesterday
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.920]   Um, so it's it's like you're declaring war right it's but apple
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.320]   quite reasonably
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.080]   Being a almost two trillion dollar company just ignore just whatever
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:22.840]   That's all you do something down there. Something's kicking my shin. I don't know what it is like. It's just but it's only it's only a little irritating
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.520]   I might you know, I got too many other things to think about
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:34.040]   No, it's it's yeah, exactly. No, it's when you when there's someone a neighbor on your block or a co-worker in your in your neighborhood
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:41.800]   Is just being an irrational crazy idiot making making allegations that you know that almost nobody is going to put any stock in
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.560]   Why would you want to join why would you want to jump in and mud wrestle with that idiot and now we are
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:53.080]   I'm just I'm just baffled that someone who well, I could tell you why so much money
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.360]   Without without without investing in some sort of a pyramid scheme and losing it all I could tell you why
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.000]   Elon thinks apples just like him
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.160]   And he would never let such a thing stand right
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:13.080]   And so he just assumes that apple somehow is going to tim cook is going to be like him and tweet back which would be very good for uh, not a professional, right?
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.520]   Yeah
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.680]   You're right. It's 48 million dollars according to the washington post in the last quarter
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.280]   In the last quarter the top advertiser
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:31.160]   On twitter. I'm sorry the first quarter of the year. So multiply that times four is a not a significant amount of money. I mean
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.280]   It's not billions four percent of twiver twitters revenue and q1
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:45.480]   Yeah, I mean, I think the the other issue is I think a lot of times people get really successful because they did the right thing at the right time
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.480]   And then they map
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.200]   Their success onto that they do the right thing all the time
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.880]   And so so they get there in this kind of I think he thinks that what he does because he had these big companies
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.440]   He picked the right time to do a lot of great things
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.440]   Um that the that the world was waiting for and he's become very wealthy doing that
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.200]   But I think he's equating that to his other decisions are smart too
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.720]   And that you know and I think that that he just you know
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.680]   So of course he's he's looking at it through that lens and I think it's a hard lens to look through because um, you know
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.800]   He's gonna
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.840]   Somebody somebody got to him because he's pulled down a lot of these he uh tweeted a meme
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.760]   That he wants to go to war with apple, which is I can't show you because it's now gone
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.400]   Well, he took a picture of a gun
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:32.360]   Like well, he showed his between this was very weird his bedside table
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.080]   Which had firearms and four
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.280]   Consumed diet cokes. We said someone said you can't you can't have the ceo
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.680]   Taking pictures of guns and coke. That's
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.880]   Oh, I get a guns and coke. I get it
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.960]   Lawyer his guns and money. He's doing a warren zvon thing maybe
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.960]   I don't know um anyway. He also tweeted. Do you know
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:59.320]   apple puts a secret 30 tax and everything you buy through their app store
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.280]   The response was like
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:09.000]   The response to it was so funny because people were posting like steve jobs literally put this into a presentation
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.080]   Here's the slide
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.240]   You know so
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.480]   What he's probably referring to I would guess apple as you remember
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:26.120]   Uh took parlor off its app store because they didn't have adequate content moderation parlor responded and it came back
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.120]   I presume
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.560]   That's what
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.800]   By the way apple has done nothing publicly
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.520]   But maybe he got a secret message
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.880]   From tim cook saying hey, you know if you don't get the content moderation under control. We're gonna have to yank you
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.920]   I don't know or maybe he's making it up at this point. No one knows what the hell he learned is going on in that
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:50.680]   He probably he was like why are we only getting five dollars and fifty cents for every person upgrading they're like well
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.000]   There's a there's a third e person tax
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.280]   So, but well, but he chose that because he chose to make the blue check only available on ios
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.720]   Because I think he didn't I don't know if he fully understood what that would mean. No, he no come on. He's not that is he that's
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.760]   Or or he or he simply just
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.400]   Or he simply didn't have this company simply does not have the resources anymore
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.440]   To make that rollout system wide on the same day
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:22.120]   Given the with the with the staff that they have left over and on the timeline that he's demanding said we can do it in the app
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.640]   Uh the iOS app you line. He said okay do it. That's exactly what happened
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.840]   Yeah, and maybe he didn't think about the 30 percent. Maybe he's looking in at the at the check showed up
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.400]   And he's like this calculation with this much money
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.720]   What happened more
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:42.600]   He's like that 15 year old the fruit gets us first gets us first check from from target say wait a minute
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   What is feichen? Why do they
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:52.600]   20% of my money exactly that's exactly it. So, I don't I really uh, you know, uh, you know, obviously
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.160]   spoken more than enough about elan twitter, but it is an apple story now because
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:02.600]   You know, I mean of all the silly things he's done declaring war and apple is one of the silliest
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:08.760]   If apple were to take well, I don't know there are plenty of third-party twitter apps on the app store
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.840]   Would they all would they all go to?
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.160]   Yeah, there are a lot of deck chairs in the Titanic. Let's fill them all
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.680]   I mean, I don't I don't know. I don't know. I don't know
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.280]   I don't know plus you can still do it on the web regardless, right?
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.600]   You can even make it a you know put it on your home screen as a twitter app. I don't
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.840]   I don't I think this I think his issue is I think his really big issue is that he
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:38.120]   He wants to turn this into a marketplace for for a variety of different bitcoin-like things
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.200]   You know, he wants blockchain and he's and he suddenly realized because he said this
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:48.280]   I mean there's some quote of him talking about the fact that he thinks that twitter can make more money on blockchain than they will
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:55.240]   With advertising the province then he suddenly realized after this little this little thing that apple's gonna get 30% of whatever that more money is
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.960]   And um now he's upset
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.120]   Kind of has a point. I mean apple does
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:05.800]   Take their their big out of every single thing and not always 30% sometimes 15
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.440]   on subscriptions and stuff
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.840]   And they also seem to enforce it
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.920]   A little haphazardly amazon. I think has a as a pass
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:22.440]   Not not to lose money. So I you know, I just don't I I don't want to take his side in this but I do think
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.480]   He probably sees a soft spot and he likes to poke at soft spots for sure
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.560]   Problem is he's making so many enemies so quickly. Yeah, if he pokes at that soft spot
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.560]   It might actually make it a hard spot
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:39.960]   You know, he may be taking it exactly the opposite direction that epic would like him to take it because if he started
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:47.880]   You know sometimes you don't want certain allies, you know going it also says he also tweeted apple should publish all censorship actions
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:53.160]   It has taken that affects its customers. It's true apple is kind of a nanny state. I mean
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:14:02.200]   Has the time come where they don't have to stop us from seeing nipples or I mean that was Steve jobs idea
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.480]   I guess do people do people
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.520]   For that that it's that don't contents are defined
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.600]   I think they are argument that they have is that it's not it's not really slowing down their business
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.360]   Why would they change that like why would you take it?
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.880]   Yeah, you take the risk of making people upset when you're doing just fine without it like there's no
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:23.720]   There's just no upside and for those who want to see things there's plenty of ways to see plenty of places twitter though
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.760]   Is I mean notoriously laden with pornography in fact?
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:33.240]   It's a problem because over the weekend when chinese protests were going on the chinese
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:38.520]   propaganda machine spun up and managed to effectively
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.480]   DDoS all the cities and hashtags by putting porn
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.280]   On all of them. So if you were to search for you know a hashtag about the chinese protests
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:56.040]   You would find at least half of your content would be pornography. That was it's presumed to put up there by uh chinese authorities who wanted to
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.200]   You know, yeah, flood the flood the field with with garbage
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:05.400]   Elon tweeted this is a battle for the future of civilizations. Oh, please
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:11.160]   If free speech is lost even in america tyranny is all that lies ahead
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.240]   I think and it was right after the apple thing. So i'm thinking change
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.480]   It's right after you're gonna change twitter to red white and blue like we have to get this like, you know
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.480]   Like this has got to be a there's got to be like a flag somewhere in this thing
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:31.080]   Honestly, what how much is how much damage is being suffered by himself himself as a brand and as a as a respected
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:38.120]   however much respect he had I have to say that really it wasn't my respect for elan musk was
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.920]   at a very very
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:45.480]   moderate level because I do believe that he's very good at putting money in where
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:49.400]   To companies at a point where companies could really use an influx of money
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:54.840]   And I think that he's taking a he takes a lot of credit for steering companies to greatness or having the great ideas that
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.640]   That really take this thing into into space literally
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:04.760]   But now we're seeing if he has this much time a seo has this much time on their hands to spend this much time
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.320]   preventing beefs that person
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:13.400]   Everyone who was invested in these companies anybody works for these companies anyone on the boards of these companies needs to ask themselves
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.440]   What could they be doing that would actually be working to help the company?
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:23.800]   Well, he is being sued by shareholders of tesla over his 56 billion dollar a year compensation package
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:28.120]   And I think that this is part of the ammunition is elan you tweeting all this stuff
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.600]   Are you are you paying any attention to anything else?
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.480]   Anyway, this isn't the elan musk show kernel kurt is gone up river
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.200]   Thank you on us for making giving us an apple angle so that we could
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:46.440]   Story again looking looking forward to that elan phone that you suddenly decided you're gonna move on
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:52.520]   But I do think that in some ways that's his it was less just like Donald trump like he doesn't really care
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:59.080]   Uh if it's animosity, he just wants to get the attention right and so I think this is all attention getting
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.880]   I mean that seems like a two-year-old but that's but kind of
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.360]   But the difference is that trump doesn't have a source of income other than his personal brand
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.120]   That's a good point. Oh, very good point
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:13.800]   He needs people to donate he needs he needs his reputation to do business deals that certainly are probably not going to work out
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.280]   Well, but that's what he's got so it really isn't his best interest to do this sort of thing elan musk at the
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.320]   But at the end of the day he needs people to build cars for him
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.480]   He needs people to build rocket motors for him. He needs
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:29.960]   He needs customers to buy those cars and to buy those rocket motors none of this is helping any of his businesses
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.360]   Jean Munster said elan is the latest chapter in a push to make app store fees lower
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:39.560]   And this will resurrect a topic that's been fairly quiet over the past six months friend to the working man
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:47.480]   Yeah, he's he's looking for something to grab onto because he's just flinging mud at this point because I think in the bottom line is that
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.720]   He's angry about apple
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.880]   Uh and the advertising part of it because it's a large amount of their revenue and maybe he's
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:59.160]   Looking at this everything app idea and realizing that apples rules will stay have their finger in that file
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.040]   Yeah, but you know, he's flailing and that's just and I agree. I
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.560]   Looking at his other businesses. I mean the fact is space X has
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:16.440]   Revolutionized access to space it really has and tesla is probably single-handedly responsible for driving the rest of the car industry toward electric
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.600]   Much faster than they would have otherwise. However, you you got to look at it now and think
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.000]   Uh, and there have been some reports from people who've worked at those companies who've said, you know, basically
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.480]   They built the whole structure to channel elan's interests in very particular ways
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.960]   And so that he felt like
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:38.520]   enthusiastic and fulfilled in what he was doing while behind the scenes everybody else was basically managing up way up
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:46.120]   And getting the actual details done around him and the problem with twitter is that uh, that doesn't that's
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:51.400]   Nobody there to do this. He's just rattling around inside a big empty building and this is what you get. Yeah
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.040]   Uh, here's kim.com
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.040]   Joining in think different and you will be deleted
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.480]   Uh, who else but tim swiney of epic games?
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.080]   He jumped right a piled on dog pile on apple
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.640]   uh, uh swiney, uh
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:14.200]   Said apple blocked fort right in response to elan apple blocked fortnight within a few hours of epic defying their policy
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:21.160]   With a nuke twitter spotify facebook netflix at what point does the whole rotten structure collapse?
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.720]   Tim you lost your lawsuit just go away
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:29.080]   Just just go away. It was a it was a good try. It made sense. You failed didn't work out the way you want to do that
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.160]   This is actually okay last thing
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.760]   And profits
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.600]   This is though exactly what uh elan has been doing all along which was
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:44.040]   In effect dividing a wedge saying things that w there's one group that's going to go. Yeah elan and another group go
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.720]   And uh, and I think that that's elan's overall strategy
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:57.800]   Uh, is to and that's what twitter frankly. That's how twitter made it for so long. Yeah is is generating that kind of outrage
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.480]   so
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.440]   Maybe he's just following the jet or playbook
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:07.160]   I think it's a great engagement strategy and more people are talking about right twitter and what's on twitter
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.640]   Then certainly since trump was removed from the platform
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:14.840]   But I don't see how it's a business model is the problem like if there is a theory out there
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.920]   And I think it's true. He didn't want to buy them
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.640]   He kind of got forced into buy them and he has a lot of people whispering her into his ears about
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:27.240]   free speech and restoring all the people who got banned because they were you know transphobic or racist or whatever
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:33.480]   And you know saying no no it's good because free speech and that's all true. But like what is the business plan?
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.040]   What is the business model here? I don't think he ever had one
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:42.200]   I think that maybe he figured he could just kind of slide in and make some pronouncements and use his mitas touch
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:47.480]   And it would all work out and that didn't happen and so like I don't know what the end game is here
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.960]   It has he finally just embraced the fact that it's all about just trolling and engagement
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:57.880]   And he's not really worried about it because he's got several dozen other billions in the bank that aren't related to the billions
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.480]   He spent on twitter. I don't know he did lose a hundred billion dollars this year
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.400]   Which is it's amazing. Anybody had enough money to lose a hundred billion dollars and still remain
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.320]   Yeah, hate to see it in the richest list uh apple
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:15.000]   You know way pre-responded tim cookin interview with cbs this morning earlier this month
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.120]   Uh was asked whether there was a risk twitter could be removed from the app store but before all of this
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:28.200]   He said twitter would be continued to be distributed according to the new york times and praised its commitment to moderate abusive to moderate abusive content
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.320]   Quote, I don't think anyone wants hate speech on their platform
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.720]   So I'm counting on them to continue to do that very moderate mr. Cook
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.600]   the final tweet
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:44.360]   I certain this is for me line. I certainly hope it does not come to that but yes if there is no other choice
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.000]   I will make an alternative phone
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   That's worked out for so many people bravo bravo jeevan jesica jeff bezos couldn't even do it
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.680]   But bravo man just go go to tai i'm going to take on apple build a better iphone
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:03.080]   So they're build a better better operating system. I'm sure that'll oh that's easy
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:08.920]   I keep kind of know that this absurd and this is just uh just to stir up the pot
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.720]   Scott. I that's all I can think of it. I'm all i'm all i'm saying is that every single week
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.000]   I
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.720]   I stray farther and further and further away from the conclusion that oh he's just a quirky guy who's not used to push back
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.760]   And he's he's oh he's an open my open mouth in an open spirit
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:31.080]   I am now I am now starting to think that maybe he really does have some delusions here that are going
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.120]   That's going to get a lot worse for it gets better. He's i'm just i'm just
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.880]   I'm just a little like a little like a little like a little like a little like a
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.240]   That what you're saying he's going he's going a little bit. Yeah a little bit. Yeah
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.840]   That's sad only without the musical talent
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.000]   Yeah
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.360]   um
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:51.640]   China china is the big story to some degree uh and apple's getting quite a bit of heat
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:58.520]   Uh, I'm wondering well, let's take a break and then we'll come back and i'm wondering what you think i'm going to give you time to to ponder
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:08.200]   Uh about apple's pushing 16.1.1 on the iphone with a special feature just for chinese made iphones that turns
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:14.280]   Airdrop off airdrop to everyone off after 10 minutes right before
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.480]   These big chinese protests
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.520]   It says is it a smoking gun or is it a coincidence but first
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:27.400]   I feel like I feel like
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:33.880]   This is like um, you know one of those news round table shows. I feel like the question. Yeah. Yeah
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.080]   Question I say you're morten konfrocky
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.760]   Uh
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:45.000]   Anyway, let's take a break our show today brought I just have to tell you about my eight sleep
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.160]   I have to tell you about my eight sleep. It's brought to you today by eight sleep
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.440]   Which makes the most wizzy scientific
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.920]   Technol, I mean sometimes technology really
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.960]   It's home
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.280]   In the case of eight sleep, it hits my bed
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:05.720]   And it's incredible and the more I use it the more and we've had this now for almost a year
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:10.840]   The more I use it the more I think I don't know how I lived without it. What is eight sleep?
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.880]   It's a tech leak. We have the eight sleep pod, which you can get a mattress that does this too
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.280]   They they make a mattress. We just got the cover
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:22.200]   It's a tech layer that fits onto your mattress kind of like like a fitted sheet
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.920]   Uh wood and then you see that unit right there that that is feeding the pod
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.520]   And it uses it's liquid cooling it dynamically cools
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.520]   And heats this what's cool about it each side of the bed
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.640]   To maintain the optimal sleeping temperature for your
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:43.960]   Sleep for your body with the pod you can sleep as cool as 55 degrees and I can tell you that's chilly
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.160]   Or as hot as 110 degrees and I can tell you that's hot
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.040]   What's interesting is there are times you want both?
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.240]   This past summer when it got really hot like it was a hot, you know
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.240]   You hate those those sweltering nights, you know, you're sweaty and you can't cool off
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:02.040]   Then you got the fan on and you got the windows open and you still there's no way to get cool
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.480]   Imagine
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.000]   Getting in bed and it's cool. It's like an air-conditioned bed
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.880]   It feels so good and then as winter comes and now it's cold out
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:17.720]   I can turn my bed up. In fact when I get in bed now, it's nice and toasty. I love that
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:22.680]   It's it's kind of I don't have to turn on the air conditioning or the heating it saves me money
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.520]   It just changes the temperature on the bed
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:29.000]   But then it's more than that because they have a sleep doctor that monitors your movements
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.840]   The temperature of the room
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:36.840]   How deeply you're sleeping and it eases you into a deeper sleep and that's what really makes
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.760]   A difference clinical data shows that eight sleep users experience up to 34 more deep sleep
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:49.560]   If you're getting a half hour more deep sleep every night you wake up feeling great confident
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:57.800]   Your mind and body are moving through the restorative sleep stages vital for physical recovery hormone regulation mental clarity
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:03.480]   It's just awesome and because each side is different lisa has different temperatures than I do my wife
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:09.480]   Uh, we both sleep comfortably the only bad thing about the eight sleep is then when you stay at a hotel, which we did the other day
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:14.200]   It's like where's my eight sleep? This is the bed's all the same temperature. I don't like it
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.680]   Give me some arm blankets
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.440]   It's really fantastic if you've ever woken up in the middle of night too hot or too cold
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.960]   You're gonna want the eight sleep. It's not a holiday miracle
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.080]   Although it sounds like one if better sleep is on your wish list
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:33.160]   Look no farther than the new pod three. They just released it. We just ordered ours. I'm very excited

[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.080]   China
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.080]   and I
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:50.520]   So complicated I our hearts uh go out to all the people who are
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.560]   So bravely standing up to president she
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.560]   To the chinese communist party say we want freedom. It was stimulated by
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.880]   Excessive lockdowns during covid, but there's been more the fox con plant
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.520]   Was offering a $1400
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:12.200]   Recruitment bonuses which they neglected to pay people protested they they exited on mass leading to a big show slowed down and
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.480]   iPhone production about a 30 percent production loss
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.760]   Um, they're holding up blank sheets of paper to show
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.320]   um, you know censorship
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:27.960]   Um, and what happens apparently I did not know this it happened. It's happened previously in china is airdrop is used
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   For instance, they used it in hong kong
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:35.960]   For chinese nationals coming into hong kong they would airdrop them information
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:41.720]   People had not read because of censorship in china about the hong kong protests
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.160]   So they would airdrop them on mass to people in the trains
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.720]   Uh coming in
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:53.720]   And of course chinese 30s. How does that work like I was looking at that. I was like how do you I don't even know how to airdrop it to lots of people
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.360]   Well, it's the everyone thing right so you obviously have to do a onesie toosey
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.360]   But if you get a hundred
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:06.920]   Protesters, you know hundred activists standing in the train station and then just and they see people have their airdrop
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:12.520]   Open to everyone because it has to be open to everyone that will just send them the the protest materials boom boom boom boom boom
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.680]   Um
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:20.280]   Apparently was effective. I know i'm just going by reports out of hong kong and now out of mainland china
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.040]   apple is saying it says we're going to turn this off for everyone
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:31.400]   But they turn it off with 16 1 1 in china for chinese only phones earlier
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.040]   Uh this month
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.360]   I wonder how I wonder how that played out
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:42.760]   We've talked about this briefly last week. I know and I I said at the time that I think that this is a good idea because
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:49.240]   For it's a good default to have a a timeout a timeout period for
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.280]   A reasonable security thing. Yeah, right because you would you would turn it on not because hey
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:58.920]   I want complete strangers on the train to be able to just drop stuff with me on my phone anonymously
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.080]   You do it because you just you're in a group of people you want to swap some stuff and that's it
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:07.240]   So it is it is a smart thing, but I think that with apple's track record
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.800]   We really do have to ask is this a feature that maybe was on the back burner. Maybe was suggested
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.920]   Maybe it was on a whiteboard somewhere. Hey, maybe we should do that sometime and then there was a request that said
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.720]   Yeah, let's put this let's bump this up to number one priority
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:25.160]   Basically at the request of the chinese government, but we don't know and that's the problem. We don't have that smoking gun
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:30.920]   That apple does say it's going to come to every iphone later in a year
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.720]   sometime past year
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:39.960]   They did not trump it this change they said quote this up as usual this update
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.720]   Includes bug fix bug fixes and security updates is recommended for all users
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:50.280]   But it did come november 9th exactly a week before the protests started to really break out
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:57.080]   I don't know, you don't like it. I don't buy it. I mean the thing is is that it's again
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:01.400]   It's not they're not making up a new feature. It's a feature that they said that they were going to roll out
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:06.440]   Um, I also you know the the thing is is this happens all the time where they pick certain regions
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:12.040]   That are probably you know, and they just start testing it, you know on on those on those regions and and so on so forth
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:17.560]   I don't you know, how like how would you know that? I don't know thinking that the protests are going to be 10 a week away
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.560]   Maybe maybe you somehow knew that but I
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:24.200]   Like the attorney airdrop the governor probably knew it and said this is the said to apple
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:28.600]   Hey, turn that off now. We need I'd have to see I'd really have to see a smoking gun before I would
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:33.480]   You know a lot of times we build it's easy for us to build conspiracies about things that we don't know enough about
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:38.600]   And and so i'm not going to say that this is a conspiracy until until we see some like emails from china
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:46.200]   I need to see some this is uh from uh from courts a picture of a bridge man who lit a fire on baging
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.200]   Kind of the new tenem and tank man to draw attention to the protest banners
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:55.240]   Which read go on strike at school and work remove dictator national trader shijin bing
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:03.480]   References to the banners are quickly censored across the chinese internet, but photos still made their way through private channels vise reported bridge man's messages
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.720]   We're spreading on the shang high subway via airdrop
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.960]   so
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.440]   uh chinese government surely knows that this is
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.240]   This is you know, what's going on?
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.800]   I don't think they're turning off any of the senate's down to ten minutes, right?
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.560]   So you can keep on opening up shutting it right if you're sitting there. It's not like you don't have it
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.120]   It's not like they just disabled it. It just means inconvenient
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:28.680]   Yeah, I think I think I do think it's a good feature but the question is that we've
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:34.120]   A big thing is what is your credibility? What is your track record? So when apple
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:40.520]   When apple it turns out that apple has been actually collecting private information through through the app store
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:47.480]   In a way that they didn't say that they were doing so apple has such a good record track record on privacy that i'm willing to wonder
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.640]   Was this just a bug was this something that but with this something that they really didn't intend
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.840]   I'm not willing to believe given apples track record that
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.440]   Excuse me without hard hard evidence that this was hey
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:04.440]   We intend to deceive people into thinking that this is a privacy safe place and it is actually not however
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   At the same by the same rule
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.720]   Their track record with china means that i'm not going to dismiss the idea that this was done
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:18.600]   We're moved to up or expedited at the request of the chinese government given that they have a really cozy relationship with china
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.920]   We've talked about it a lot. We don't have to talk about it all over again
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:25.640]   But I have to really i'm not i'm not saying that this i believe this to be the case
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:30.760]   I'm saying that i'm not going to be skip i'm going to be skeptical about it, but i'm not going to dismiss it
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.600]   This is something that apple i think would definitely do it's quite a coincidence
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.680]   Let's just put it that way
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.840]   Also, these protests has been boiling over for a couple of months now
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.200]   Well, that's the point bridge man was october 19th or in october
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.000]   So it was after bridge man after
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.720]   trains in shang-hy you know subway in shang-hy was airdrop was used so
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:56.360]   You know it was probably at that point i'm it doesn't seem unreasonable to think that chinese government might have gone to apple and say
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.240]   Can you suppress this court sports out their app was removed
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.840]   from china at china's request
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.640]   At the height of the 2019 protests in hong-kong because we don't need
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.680]   We don't need any thoughts about like advanced notice
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:16.360]   Obviously bajig knows that this stuff is going to keep happening and they probably saw
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:22.920]   It being used in a certain way and went to apple and said, you know, we have a problem with this and we're going to make this a
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.120]   uh, you know, we're going to make this a rule or you're you're going to be
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.000]   Out we're going to be unhappy if you don't do this
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.760]   My guess is how it went down is that apple said, you know
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.000]   Actually, this feature doesn't make sense the way it's built and we have an idea
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.200]   We just to let it only be on we can't turn it off permanently because that doesn't make sense for our users
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:47.880]   But we what about a timeout and we'll put that in the next version of the os is probably how it went down and then
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.880]   My guess is then china was like how about you put it in now
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.280]   And they're like, uh, okay
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.640]   We'll put it in now for china, but everybody else we're going to test it and work on it more
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:03.320]   And that's my guess is that it was not about presaging anything other than knowing that inevitably something else would come up
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.640]   And that this will be an issue and so
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:10.440]   Probably it's something like that that it is the weird thing is only in china right now
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.800]   Right because it does make sense actually as a feature change, but
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:20.760]   Why did it get rolled out in china faster? And my guess there is that china said, uh, we don't want you to wait
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.840]   We want you to do this now. Yeah
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:27.640]   Uh, and and it just points out how difficult it is to suppress dissent
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.640]   Uh because there are other ways to send is like water and there will be other ways
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:36.840]   It's too bad that american companies are cooperating with the chinese regime in this but yeah
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:41.160]   Our government has not exactly stood up to say we support you either
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:47.720]   You know, it's a very delicate balancing act. I think that china is also, you know, they're they may be at their peak
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:51.080]   Like i got i hope so i hope so i hope so
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.800]   The thing is is that they're you know and this comes down to i mean
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.640]   It's just a i think it's going to be really fast than anything to see over the next 10 years
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.800]   Um, and hopefully not horrifying because china may come apart
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   You know like it may come apart that could be bad
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.080]   A lot of people could be bad
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:10.040]   There's a lot of groups of people that don't like each other that they've held together with growth and force, right?
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:15.080]   And when that growth, you know stops, which is about what what it's about to do
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:21.880]   I mean they're overtures towards taiwan their issues with covid. They're all those things are pushing country companies
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.960]   Out of the country, you know, and so it's this isn't something that's going to happen
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.120]   I mean they're having protests right now
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:32.760]   But the the idea of putting all your eggs into a chinese basket is
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.680]   Over like, you know, like no one's no one's thinking that that's a possibility anymore
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:42.520]   And everyone's thinking about how do we diversify i mean even even cook has said we don't think that this is an optimal situation
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:45.320]   Three years from now we'll be sitting here and it'll be clear
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.320]   That you know it took a while but they moved out it's going to take a decade
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.160]   But and i don't think they're going to move out completely
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.200]   But i think that they are going to get to a point i think that everybody knows
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.840]   With what we saw in Ukraine and what we what we're seeing in taiwan that everybody knows nobody
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:04.040]   Once all their eggs in that basket and that's going to be very very expensive for china for people for them too
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:08.840]   You know, it's it is a uh, it's as much it's it's as foolish a move that taiwanese
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:13.320]   Move is as foolish for china as elan musk's is towards apple and bine twitter
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:20.280]   Is that they're just they're burning themselves up for no reason, you know, like, you know, and and that it's just a really it's a crazy thing to watch
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:26.520]   When i was in china in 2009 touring around i talked to our guide who spoke english but lived in china
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:33.160]   And i said boy i really feel like this is going to be the chinese century that china is uh is doing everything right
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:40.280]   They said oh no no you don't see the economic problems underlying all of this and he was right 10 years 12 30 years
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.280]   Yeah, their population is so upside down
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:46.360]   They don't have any because the whole thing one child per couple the one child thing was
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.160]   Potentially the most disastrous thing that any government has ever done in the history of governments
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:55.800]   Because they really underscores these whole things i know centrally manage this stuff, right?
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   It doesn't work every time you have a five-year plan, you know, uh, we're gonna produce grain here this much
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:07.320]   There's many tractors there it always fails one child only it always fails the the uh, the
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.720]   COVID the zero-covid policy
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.320]   Has been a disaster it turns out it seemed like a good idea at the time
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:17.160]   But central completely central control seems like a bad idea in the long run
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:22.600]   I mean the talking about the zero-covid thing which has really killed the that's what killed the apple factories
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:28.200]   Uh, is that policy both in in the spring for the mac and now for the iphone pro but
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:35.560]   The the underlying failure there is in the chinese health care system because the truth is without the zero-covid policy
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:41.720]   So many people would get covid that because so many people in china still haven't been fully vaccinated
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:45.400]   Well and the vaccines that they were riding are not effective. Yeah, they're
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:50.360]   They would have a disaster a human humanitarian disaster if they didn't have the zero-covid policy
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:53.400]   But the zero-covid policy is causing people to be upset
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:39:00.440]   But the truth is that it's the underlying factor is that their health care system and they're and getting the vaccine out to people
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:06.280]   Has completely failed and then you know, again, you're a centralized planning nation and uh
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:11.080]   For whatever reason that didn't happen and now they're caught between civil unrest
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:15.640]   Because of the policy and potentially, uh, you know, a mass
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.640]   death
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.240]   in event
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.480]   If they let uh if they loosen the strings a little bit so that's it's they're in a bad situation now
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.360]   Yeah
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:29.160]   Yeah, and and i bring the conversation back to apple a little bit this really puts
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:33.080]   No, no, no, no, no, please
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:39.240]   Because because if i if i keep it really if i keep talking about the situation in the human rights situation in china
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:43.000]   It's going to be for our show, um, but but only that
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.120]   The now we're now we're getting video and reports of fox con protesters being beaten by cops
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:52.200]   Uh, and this puts apple in the situation where?
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:56.200]   Okay, we have they do have to to to an extent
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.720]   They what they keep saying as their fallback excuse is true
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.760]   They have to follow whatever the rules are of the countries in which they operate
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:07.160]   But now they have the government that they are very cozy with our beating
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:15.160]   Workers who are assembling their phones who are protesting because they were promised pay that they did not receive and they were put into hazardous situations
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.560]   apple is
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:23.400]   I've I would be very very disappointed in apple if they let this pitch just sail right by them. They have to they
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:30.200]   This is this is this might be the moment that i've been talking about and wondering about for years now
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:36.360]   At what point does apple cross that line and say that nope? We can't we're not speculating about this anymore
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.760]   We're not wondering about this anymore. We're not talking about a nuanced problem in which there are other
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.600]   In which they are actually also helping economy and helping the workers blah blah blah
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.320]   If they are so if it turns out that
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:55.800]   People who protest at their factories who have limited who have legitimate beefs are being beaten and hurt and rounded up and disappeared by the government
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:00.440]   Apple has to say something about that apple has to say that no this is not so this is not
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.880]   This is not an area in which we feel as though we can ethically do business
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:07.800]   They might not have to say it explicitly like that, but they cannot be silent
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   We can't let them get away with apple will say something in a few years when they have the capacity to make
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:19.480]   Elsewhere and then a lot of times they'll wake up and say oh, that was terrible. We could say I mean
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:25.080]   A lot of times that you know you make moves over time not not a while, you know, and it's
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:28.040]   Um, you know, I think that uh, I know I think that that
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:35.720]   What apple will most likely do I mean it's it's a really uncomfortable position for apple and I think that what apple most likely do is reduce china's
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:39.960]   Output for their goods down to less than 30 percent in the next 10 years
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:46.280]   From almost a hundred, you know, so it's gonna be it's gonna cost china billions, but I don't think apple's going to
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.160]   Uh, wave any any flags while they do that
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:53.240]   When you're trying to sneak out of the out of the building we're trying to sneak out of the building with
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:59.080]   Sports you don't yell at them. You just go. I'm gonna go over here for a minute and then you're gone. So according to
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:03.720]   I just go ahead. I just quick quickly. I just hope that they are
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:11.080]   As interested in protecting the lives and the safety of the people who assemble their incredibly successful product
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:16.520]   As they are about protecting their supply chain. So yeah, I agree that the you're absolutely right there
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.200]   They're gonna make sure that they're gonna be minimizing production in china
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:24.760]   Possibly as a part of a legitimate being upset about human rights abuses, but
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.560]   That turns out that would turn out to be oh well gosh
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:35.160]   We're we're selling 10 fewer iPhones than then we then we would have october in November december because of all this one rest
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.160]   We have to diversify a little bit
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.600]   At some point it's gonna hurt so bad that they're at some point
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:45.560]   I hope that apple would say that look we don't we we want to apply pressure on the government to say
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:51.480]   We don't ever ever ever want to see here or one worry about our workers being beaten up for
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.480]   Any
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:58.520]   And I don't think we I don't think I don't think that we should assume that apple is not having those conversations
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.760]   I think that they're just not having them in public
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:05.640]   Yeah, there's a lot of a lot of stuff happens by private is a point there's a point where you have to have these conversations in public
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.280]   You have to make your statement you can't have people wondering
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:13.560]   About what your intentions are whether you were actually on the side of right or wrong
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:19.400]   There's a point which you have to give people who are protesting that courage that strength to say that look we are not
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:25.080]   We are not we're not fortifying your oppressors. We are on your side here. We are going to try to work
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.640]   We don't like this. We're making that displeasure known
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:32.680]   We are using whatever diplomatic and commercial economic pressure we can make to correct the situation
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:37.160]   You are not you are not fighting in a vacuum. You are not surrounded all sides
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.040]   You have friends and from your friends work at apple
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.500]   Ming chi chu
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.640]   says
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.640]   That wow
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:55.000]   iPhone 14 pro max shipments alone for the holiday quarter will be 15 to 20 million units lower than expected
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.080]   And of course apple orders, I'm sure pretty good at predicting demands
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:03.160]   So that's 15 to 20 million people who would want one that aren't going to get one
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:08.840]   Uh quo has cut a shipment prediction for the iphone lineup by about 20 for all models
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:14.280]   70 to 75 million units versus the market consensus of 90
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.920]   85 to 90 million units
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:22.680]   Uh the average capacity i'm quoting now from nine to five mac which translated to quos
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:30.440]   Note to his customers the average capacity utilization rate of jenjo phone iphone plant was only about 20
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:36.120]   In november 20 it's expected to prove to 30 to 40
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.600]   November that's a huge drop
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.920]   jenjo is called iphone city
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:47.080]   Because that's where most iphones are made pegatron and luck share ict have obtained about 10 percent of the
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.040]   Pro and pro max orders from fox con respectively
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:54.040]   But mass shipments will not be until late december at the earliest. So there's scrambling
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.680]   To find other producers
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:03.240]   According to the production recovery progress of the iphone 14 pro series shipments in december was still significantly
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.880]   lower than expected
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.040]   He says most of the demand for the iphone 14 pro series will disappear
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:18.520]   because uh of recession and so forth he says that as a result and of course this is what he is an analyst
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:24.600]   So he's talking to people or investors. He predicts iphones apple's iphone revenue in the fourth quarter of 22
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:30.280]   May be significantly lower than the market consensus by 20 or 30 percent apple did warn
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.000]   That this quarter would not be good
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.760]   Um, I wonder if though it's worse than they thought it's well
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:41.800]   It is they they they made their first warning and then the thing happened and they did the news release that said
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:47.000]   We're gonna be down maybe the estimate. Yeah, like six billion even more than they thought they were gonna be
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.200]   Why watch watch the stock market then flea apple, which is so funny
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.040]   Because that's just like oh well, I don't get out of apple quick
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:00.520]   It's so silly. Maybe an annoying opportunity for people who like apple. I think
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:05.400]   Yeah, and and I think that the the hard part is is that they make such good phones
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.600]   That if things get a little tight, you can go. Oh, I can just go another year or two
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:15.320]   Exactly. Well, I have a good phone. Yes, like my kids have my kids have 12, you know, like, you know, and it's it's fine
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:20.280]   You know, it's a little phone and it's I don't you know, I like having the new one come on the show
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:24.040]   So I like having a new phone to talk about but but I gotta say it's not
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:28.440]   Significantly crazy better, you know, then I like the 48 meg
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:33.800]   Camera it's quite a luxury, but it is it's a nice luxury
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:39.640]   If you can afford it. It only went well the latest iPhone. Yeah, it just feels
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:43.960]   It's terrible thing. It is. It's great. But I'm just saying that the hard part you have when it
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:49.560]   Resessions, though. I skip it easy to go. Oh, I'm gonna get it's not like there's a feature that'll kill you, you know
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:54.120]   In exactly wait for another year or two wait wait through the recession. So that's that's the hard part
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:58.840]   They're gonna have it's both that they're so good and that frankly there's not a whole lot more you can
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:04.360]   Right, it's just like this. These are all gonna be incremental improvements from now on until we come up with the VR
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:08.680]   Glasses or whatever the next thing is that's why they're working so hard on this
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:13.560]   Right, we're folding phone that people would actually normal people would actually want to buy and not as a luxury item
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:17.000]   You know, I really liked the Samsung flip
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.240]   Uh because it wasn't that I was unfolding a tablet
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:25.560]   It was that I was unfolding a little pocket square that became a normal sized phone
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:31.000]   I if apple made that I would buy in a heartbeat the only reason I don't use that is because it's an android phone
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.960]   It's a Samsung. Yeah, it is. It's funny. It's funny. Andy carluccio who who we were up with you know
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:39.160]   He's got that one of the flip loves to see he has a Samsung folding phone
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.360]   I'm not sure which one it is but every time he opens it up. I'm like, okay, that's kind of cool
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:47.560]   It's like that ad where the woman says I love my iPhone and she keeps seeing people flip their phones
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.680]   And then everywhere she sees flipping and she says I have to have flipping
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:55.720]   I don't have to like I keep on telling myself that screen's not gonna last like I just keep on going like I can't
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:00.360]   Like it can't get over as I just keep I'm letting I'm just letting Andy just they're a little more delicate
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:04.040]   They're a little more delicate. I had the flip phone. I gave it to Stacy Higginbotham
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.800]   I don't know if she fully appreciates it. I have to ask her if not I'm gonna take it back
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.480]   Yeah, almost
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.800]   But that was last years but it it lasted
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:17.560]   Yeah, it lasted a year with but not with like always because I still had the iPhone so it wasn't my number one
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:21.400]   Phone I had problems with the fold which is the big one
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.920]   Uh the the the laminate peeled off and stuff there was stuff with that that
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:31.320]   Yeah folding screens are still not perfected, which is I'm sure why Apple doesn't make them
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:34.040]   The latest generation is really really good
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:39.240]   Um, but I still not I agree. I I still not it's not an it's still not a mainstream thing
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.480]   you have to have a that combination of
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:49.640]   A lot of money to spend on a phone a real interest in having something that's new and wonderful and third a very real use case for gee
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:54.440]   I want I need a phone that also becomes sort of something like a tablet but not quite a tablet
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:58.040]   I'm I'm just saying that if apple just if apple really made
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:02.360]   Uh a an iPhone that flips out into an iPad mini
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:08.680]   And it was anything close to affordable like for me when that would be $1,800
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:11.960]   That would be like above a thousand and under a 1500
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:16.760]   That would that would that would that would that would make me have to sit back and think hard about
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:19.320]   Whether I really really want to eat
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.040]   Meet a name brand
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:29.640]   You know that uh that generic cereal is very nearly as good as captain cranks and those plastic bags are so easy to pour from
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:34.760]   You know, it's called cap and crinkle for a reason half the money goes is the marketing budget seriously
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:38.600]   Just keep telling yourself that Andy just keep
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:43.480]   If I can have a folding iPhone folding mac mini iPad mini, I will do it
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:47.160]   I will I will eat the the I will eat the happy o's cereal for a year
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:51.880]   I just think somebody's there with a test phone opening shredding opening shredding opening shredding like that
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:55.400]   Just that's what they do all day to see like if this is actually oh, you know, they're doing that
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:50:01.160]   And even at apple just trying to figure it out. Yeah, is it only Samsung that makes those screens probably huh?
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:03.640]   Thanks for you, but that's right. Yeah apple
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:08.680]   Sources a lot of iPhone parts from Samsung. It's not not the end of the world. I think they'd make their own
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:14.760]   Somewhere else get corning to do it maybe and apple that they don't make they don't make their own panels anywhere
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.960]   Do they know they use what do they use now? Samsung's I think
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.400]   Yeah, I don't know. I think I do for some stuff
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:31.960]   This is a sad story. I don't somebody I didn't put it in but you guys
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:37.000]   You live out there in near hingham. Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about. Yeah, I put that in
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.280]   uh
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.280]   Unknown so
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:44.360]   On monday 10 45 a.m
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:50.120]   Uh, this was last monday, right? I mean it was oh, yeah, you're right. It wasn't this monday. It was no
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.760]   20 20th, you know, 21st
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.920]   Um
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.920]   And I didn't do the story then
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:00.440]   But it's very sad a car crashed into the apple store in hingham
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.160]   Uh one person died 16
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.480]   injured
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.800]   Kevin Bradley 65 in new jersey
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.760]   Was the guy who died?
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:11.720]   Um
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:14.040]   There's some question about though whether it was intentional
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.800]   Um
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:16.840]   the the
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:21.080]   investigation investigation is ongoing the person who crashed into the store claims that
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:27.240]   Uh, this it was a runaway or basically stuck accelerator or he and he's tried to he tried to stomp on the brakes
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:30.840]   But he couldn't but nothing happened. He got he
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:36.680]   Drug drug alcohol test was was clear. Uh, he certainly hasn't said anything about how
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.640]   He sees he claims it's an absolute accident
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:45.400]   Uh, and so it for now it does seem to be just it's it's the story is in one of those like sort of like
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:53.480]   Park moles that that that started. Yeah, I mean, it's not like the road ends at the store front you'd have to write so turn into it
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:59.960]   Yeah, so again, maybe he got the petals mixed up or or something like that. That's not unheard of but yeah
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.080]   I mean 16 to 20 people 16. I think we're it was full
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.560]   There's a full store imagine it was it was a full store
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.280]   um and the and the only the only
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.920]   The
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.920]   I did pay I did put it in as an update because
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:19.160]   Uh, I thought I was really really impressed and pleased with this with tim cook made a special trip out to the store
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.000]   to basically
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.920]   You know talk to people about what had happened and make sure the employees are okay
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:29.720]   Uh, I think that's appropriate. I'm really glad he did that. Yeah, I mean, that's and that's that
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:37.400]   A. That's not something that all CEOs will do because as a good CEO his time his or her time is so valuable down to the like
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.240]   Down to the five minutes
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:43.240]   And the fact that he that he put time on a schedule to fly out here
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:49.960]   And spend spend a day here. I think that's a very very human and healing thing for him to do and I
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:54.520]   That's the apple that I that I have faith in there's a go fund me
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:53:01.640]   fundraiser for uh, Kevin Bradley who was the man who died very sadly
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:05.400]   Um, he wasn't was he an employee or is he just visiting?
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:11.800]   Uh, he was a semi he was a contractor who's working doing some part of a company that was doing some work on the store
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:15.960]   Uh, and so he wasn't he some early reports as claimed that he was an apple employee
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:21.480]   But no, but he was he was there in a professional capacity you can search on go fund me for kevin
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:24.680]   Bradley and hang him and I think you'd find it pretty quickly
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:28.280]   Uh, my guess is is that knowing apple though within
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:36.040]   One to two years and any apple store that would have it's anywhere near a road will have some kind of barrier in front of them
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:38.840]   Like just like that like it'll it'll look that way to look really well designed
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:43.480]   You know, we have a point here, but it'll be things that are hard enough to stop cars like they they tend to
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:49.000]   Make those adjustments. Yeah, easy to fix probably not easy but fixable. I guess
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:55.960]   As a matter of fact, I think that I think the town government was actually moving towards that about having some some sort of a rule about having ballards
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.680]   In front of in front of stores exactly like that
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:04.440]   And there were a couple articles about hey jesus had this had passed like a year earlier or have been in fact right now this wouldn't have happened
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:07.000]   Um
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.320]   It is being investigated as a there is a criminal investigation. He has been charged
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:16.120]   Uh, the driver has been charged as you said he said his foot stuck
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.840]   But that's pretty easily provable
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:23.480]   If there's a problem with the accelerator, so yeah, he's charged a reckless homicide
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:27.000]   It's it's I I hope there's a very thorough investigation
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.920]   But this this is the sort of thing that is absolutely frustrating to try to figure out because there are so many cases of
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:35.240]   The person had their foots
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:39.480]   That's foot their foot down on the gas their foot slipped or because of a
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:43.960]   Wrinkle in the in the floor mat or just bad does bad user to
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:48.440]   Bad design bad shapes of these petals it's easier to get the two mixed up
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:52.840]   And because he thinks he's got his foot on the brake. He just stands it down harder
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:56.360]   Yeah, because because oh my god, it was like I need to I need to break it's a runaway
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:00.520]   And he gets in a state of panic. He doesn't stop assess and think what if I'm
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:03.160]   Putting my foot down on the wrong thing. I'm not saying that's what happened
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:05.720]   But there are a lot of things that have to be considered
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:11.560]   At least we've ruled out at least we rule out that it but it doesn't seem to it doesn't have this wasn't drug or alcohol related
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:15.960]   Right if for an act for an active for an active deliberate if it were an active deliberate violence
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:21.560]   You think that he would have said he would have made such a statement or such an education. He has not done so as yet
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:24.760]   That's true. So good point. It's happened here twice
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:27.880]   in last couple of years on our main street
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:31.880]   That's a driver has plowed into a storefront
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:37.880]   So maybe it's more and again as the same situation where you'd have to turn hard right maybe yeah
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:41.320]   And then and then do it but in both cases it was an accident
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:45.560]   So I guess it it does happen and it is devastating when it happens. I mean it just destroys
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.400]   The place and if there's anybody in there, it's a bad place to be
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:55.880]   Also, right it makes it makes it into a traumatic space for people who have to go back and work there who probably can't afford to
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:56:01.160]   Like just simply quit this job. So that that's why I thought that was a very very human thing for Tim Cook to do
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:03.480]   I was very very proud on him for doing that
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.960]   Let's take a quick break
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:10.120]   More to come with our wonderful panel Andy and not go Jason Snell
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.520]   Alex lindsey
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:17.720]   And while you're watching I hope you'll enjoy now john ashley. This is your opportunity to show off
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:21.720]   Our new tech tricaster to elite or show they brought to you by
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:24.760]   The tricaster to elite
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:27.800]   Uh, the most complete live production system on the planet
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:34.760]   We use the tricaster to elite right we use about one 80th of the complete capabilities
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:38.920]   I'm just a tiny tiny amount this thing is kind of mind-boggling they pushed out
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:46.680]   An update late last year that made it even more powerful. No new tech. We've used tricasters since day one new tech
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:54.440]   Uh literally since we started doing video. I shopped around looked at all the different ways of doing it tricaster was the most affordable most flexible
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:57:00.200]   A way to get what we do done and we've used tricasters ever since there's a full line
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.560]   And no matter which you select tricaster puts an entire suite of media production capabilities
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:08.200]   At your fingertips the tricaster to elite
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:13.640]   Our little baby is more than a live video production system. It's an all-encompassing
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:16.120]   digital media solution
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:18.920]   You can use to create content for the internet mobile
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:27.240]   TV in most cases it's better than the broadcast system television stations are using I see them in schools and churches
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.720]   I see them everywhere
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:36.680]   The the much loved live call connect feature now supports with this update that just came out facebook all year ago now
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:39.160]   Facebook messenger whatsapp facetime
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:46.840]   So you can use those as live inputs to any production in addition selectable audio and video return enables tricaster to elite operators to
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:54.680]   View an audio return like any other output allowing greater flexibility. There's a new neural voice isolation tool that cleans audio
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:58:01.800]   Using AI canceling or reducing background noise automatically detecting voices maintaining all important production quality
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.520]   Uh, you know, we we're kind of a very static setup
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:13.240]   But a lot of people are using tricasters and in evolving situations in new situations and and churches and stuff and it's great to have all of these capabilities
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:19.800]   To make your production that much better no matter what happens increased power and flexibility and simplicity
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:24.200]   Have driven some of the exciting new capabilities with variable support and macro
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:29.800]   This by the way, I know they use for me because I I switch my own stuff
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:34.120]   Uh in my office and they've got it all down to macros because they don't trust me
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:42.360]   So so I just push this button Leo. Oh it works the system thanks to these macros offers a dynamic and powerful tool
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:46.520]   You can nest macros now to deliver complex production is more easily
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:51.240]   We actually have set it up so that we could actually even use this I can use a stream deck
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:55.080]   So they've got macros attached to stream deck elgato stream deck buttons
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:58.760]   So I can control a tricaster through the stream deck. It is so flexible
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:05.880]   Tricaster to elite now supports encoding three channels and anything from hd to uhd at the same time
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:08.840]   That's a lot more power a lot more flexibility
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:13.240]   They've got the live panel builder now, which was a standalone. It's now in the tricaster
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:15.960]   Which means you can create bespoke user interfaces
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:18.920]   Customize each preset within the user interface
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:24.280]   So your distributed workflows are simpler more cohesive never compromising on quality
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:28.120]   I mean I can go on and on they've got the ndi gen lock tool
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:31.160]   Which is fantastic. You've got a common sync pulse
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:35.000]   So all the users can know exactly when to send a frame of video
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.080]   Perfect for remote workflows app operators can now send alpha channel
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:45.080]   Through one of the mix outs bringing post production closer to live users can use the keying on tricaster
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:50.680]   We don't use it, but but man, you can you can feed what we use a little bit sometimes to feed graphics
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:58.760]   Realtime 3d creation tools. You'll probably see when we do our holiday stuff the little leo elf on the shelf swinging my legs
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:03.480]   We'll use that that's tricaster. Let's just do that. It's really a cool effect
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:09.720]   Since it's arrival in 2020 tricaster to elite has offered incredibly powerful live production system
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:16.120]   We love it the very latest updates put even more power into the hands of storytellers everywhere
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:24.600]   Really, it's more than we need, but we're really glad to have the tricaster to elite. It's transformative. It's setting new standards
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.840]   It's better than broadcast
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:31.080]   You might also look at the tricaster one pro. That's also evolved
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:38.680]   Incredibly to support modern storytelling for producers and content graders and publishers with future ready capabilities
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:46.680]   It's a streamlined live video production system got the live call connect 4k uhd switching support live streaming recording
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:51.400]   Data driven and really I have to say over the years. We've used tricaster now for 15 years
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.120]   Just gets better and better and better and better
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:01:00.120]   Export of the latest in the tricaster family. Go to new tech their website any wte k
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.720]   Just this is the url to get you right there

[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.680]   That's where you'll find an interactive guide that lets you choose which tricaster is right for you
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:17.080]   So there's a whole line of tricasters at different prices
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:25.480]   Everybody should have a tricaster go dot new tech dot com slash twit dash tv and new tech is any wte k
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:32.440]   We love new tech. We love the tricaster. We're so grateful to have it go dot new tech dot com slash twit dash tv
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:40.440]   It's really the kind of the central tool in our in our technology toolbox that makes everything we do possible
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.760]   Thank you new tech
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:45.720]   The oceanic plus app is out who's going diving
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:49.240]   Put it on your old not it not it
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:55.240]   Not it now i want to i want to test it i want to see what's going on i got to do
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:02:00.520]   Remember when they when they announced the uh the uh apple watch altar they said and coming soon oceanic plus
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:03.080]   Well, it's out now
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.240]   Excellent. I I wish I could test it
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:12.200]   Is for it's a dive computer on your wrist. I mean it's not like okay, maybe there's more professional
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.720]   But it you know it does all the things that you need to know depth
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.880]   uh
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.880]   Uh, no decompression time
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.440]   Water temperature
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:26.360]   Uh, you don't need to use a touch screen. You could set compass settings using the action button that
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:30.280]   I mean you have an ultra you kind of feel like you have to feel like I should install it
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:36.760]   Just die thing I when I did set it up. I mentioned this that it does ask you would you like to know water depth and temperature?
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:40.680]   Uh should you fall into the water? I guess and I said yes
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:48.440]   Uh, but it would be actually by you know an accident. I should probably also it should also have a button that says and then should we call the uh the authorities
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.760]   This was unintentional
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:55.400]   What do you think is I always had this picture of my pool being nine feet deep and um
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:59.480]   And then I went down to the bottom with the watch and it popped up and it showed me that it was 6.9 feet
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:03.160]   Deep. That's so cool. I was like the watch is off. You know, that's so cool
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:07.880]   I was like the watch is very accurate because this is nine feet deep and it says 6.9
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:14.120]   It's 6.9 or you know 6 and 9 inches or whatever and then I measured it and the watch was right the watch is right
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.800]   Okay, no idea what i'm talking about
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.360]   Basic
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:20.520]   A oceanic plus functionality is free, but you'll want to pay $10 a month
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.560]   Or $80 a year if you want to track decompression
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:29.800]   I always worry about the bins when uh when i'm swimming. So yeah location planning other more advanced features
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:36.840]   There's a family plan $129 bucks five people you do have to have watch iowa watch sos 9.1
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.920]   As well as an iphone eight or later using ios 16 one and of course
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:47.640]   You need an ultra apple is quick to caution that oceanic plus is not for professional scuba divers
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:51.080]   For instance, I won't tell you how much air you how many professional
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:57.160]   Fashion with divers does not support transmitters that connect to your tank although although there was a piece
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:01.000]   So there was a great piece on tech crunch about this by a scuba diaper and they
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.520]   They suggested they said it was really great by the way and that um makers of dedicated
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:12.920]   Dive computers should worry because this feels like one of those things that's just going to get subsumed into technology like apple watch
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:19.560]   But what they said is they went apparently on a like scuba thing that was kind of a demo that included people from apple and from the dive computer
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.560]   Software company and all of that and they suggested that the oxygen
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:32.440]   Monitoring thing like there they got the distinct impression even though nobody would say something on the record that they are working on a solution for that too
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.040]   It's just not out there
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:38.200]   So this it seems like that that was just not something that they had ready but that they're working on that too
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:43.720]   So it's interesting if you're i'm not a scuba diver, but it sounds like this is one of those things like um
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:49.160]   The tech crunch article likened it to standalone gps devices where like we used to have those and uh
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.800]   Now we don't really because everything's got a gps in it and that uh for dive computers for
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:59.080]   Divers and snorkelers and everything else that that's all going to get put in our watches instead
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:04.760]   There's a scuba diver observing the target 30 minute dive time alarm has been reached
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:09.880]   Yeah, it's a really great piece. It's it's akin to those like talking to a backcountry hiker about the
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:16.680]   Yeah, other features. We got a bunch of divers who and and that that's this is the person to listen to right like they actually know what they're talking about
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:21.480]   Yeah, not us. There's a dive computer. Uh the suntos zoop
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.280]   That's a big old thing. Yeah
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.880]   Um
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:29.160]   You want big letters, especially especially when it's sultan right? I think
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.320]   Yeah
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:39.160]   Uh, this is this is definitely a product where you appreciate it like Jason's Jason says people like us who've i've i have a grand total of like
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:44.920]   52 minutes of dive time. I should not be reviewing something like this. It's this person who has at some point
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.400]   You know almost said okay
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:51.960]   Has gone to the back of the surface of the water saying wow. I almost killed myself down there
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:55.560]   I'm not going to do that again. Those are the people with the knowledge that should be reviewing this stuff
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:00.680]   So we're going to claim the watch uh ultra is en 13319 compliant
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:04.200]   European standard covering functional safety and testing
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:10.040]   For depth and time measuring devices. So you can't trust it to measure your pool depth Alex
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.680]   Uh
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.680]   See see
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:17.560]   Oceanic plus is from hoish we shout doors
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:23.560]   Uh, they make other uh scuba stuff. So pretty cool
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:28.120]   So a lot of retired pool installers are about to get a lot of crap from a lot of people
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:30.840]   Who have money for a thousand dollar watch? Okay
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:33.800]   I uh
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:39.000]   I've gone scuba diving twice kind of recreationally once on the great barrier reef
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.960]   Uh and once in hawai just for fun. It would be nice to i mean obviously
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:49.160]   I I went with a dive instructor who's got probably a zoo right and they're no and they're paying attention
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:54.600]   They're only let me down there for 15 minutes anyway, but um still I would kind of be fun to have that on
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:57.960]   Oh, yeah. No, that's all right. I got mine. Uh, no problem. Yeah
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:01.160]   Especially since the gear is the gear is so expensive
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.560]   Yeah, and and like the idea of
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:07.400]   For certainly for a novice diver who's like, okay
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:12.920]   Now you need to dive now you need a dive computer and a dive watch like oh or you can get this really cool amazing
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.160]   Apple watch the best that they make the most expensive apple watch they make and you can wear it all the time
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:20.760]   And people would say wow. Do you are you diver? You can say well, I yes, I am a diver
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.840]   You see that's why I have this expensive dive watch
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:26.360]   Yeah, and then maybe then maybe as you get more experience like yeah
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:31.400]   I need more not going to kill my soul features than that a piece of that an app that runs on a phone
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:35.640]   I feel like over the next year you have to take if you have the ultra you do have to take pictures
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:40.280]   You have to take somehow take little pictures of your watch underneath the water your watch at the mountains your watch
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:45.080]   You're watching the desert like i'm actually doing something with this watch that made it worth buying it. Yeah
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.720]   Yes, well, I can look good. Well, but also
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.920]   Now that it's been shipping for so many people
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:55.160]   I love seeing so many pictures from people who are like no, I'm not I'm out near I'm in construction
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:59.240]   I am I am actually like moving rocks like 12 hours a day
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:03.240]   And this is the only thing that this is the first watch this is my first opportunity to have like a real
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:09.800]   Like digital real a computer wearable computer because they're all the ones all the other ones are not going to survive this
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:14.440]   And this is survive fine. If anything, it's got character. It's got it's got good honest wear now
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.920]   so when uh
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.920]   rob mackalini and
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:25.720]   And uh deadpool bought uh rexam. How much do they pay do we know to buy their own little personal football club
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:30.440]   I i'm guessing they didn't pay uh seven billion dollars
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:35.080]   But that's the uh the asking price for man united
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:39.960]   2 million pounds for rexam's rexam's a lot cheaper
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:43.880]   Why they are they are four levels down. Oh, okay
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:52.920]   It's and it's been honestly happy. Oh, it's of the other premier league honestly the uh the the rights to the uh the cable series probably paid for it
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:59.080]   Oh, yeah, absolutely just just you know, absolutely apple is currently not planning to purchase
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:04.440]   Man you congratulations. There's the story general lissimo frances africo
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:13.000]   Dead uh british tab like her the daily star claimed that apple had expressed an interest in the seven billion dollar purchase
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.240]   but uh
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:21.320]   according if i were if if i were selling trying to sell man united i would i would definitely spread that rumor spread that rumor
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:26.520]   According to rossen y'all writing writing for mac rumors our source of the direct knowledge of the situation
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.080]   Says the report is false
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:33.160]   However, the glacier family is planning to sell it
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:39.960]   So, um, and now we all and now we've all spread that information and christiano ronaldo is leaving
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:45.560]   So i think that should cut the price a little bit. Yeah, what why would apple but want to own a club?
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:51.720]   They wouldn't they wouldn't because what they want are the rights and the individual club doesn't really hold the rights there
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:58.680]   It's not the business that they are particularly in so the i mean, would they would they want to buy a like a league or something maybe
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:01.000]   like they
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.760]   Just buy the whole league. Yeah, buy it. But um an individual team like this doesn't really make any sense
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:14.360]   They are battling esp and according to apple insider for the rights to stream the dutch soccer league
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:18.600]   Is that a big one is that a big league is that a good one?
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:25.160]   It's available leo it's a right or available. Okay, soon you have apple apple is gonna corner the market on soccer
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:30.520]   They're just starting to actually it's not it's not a bad strategy, right?
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.760]   Like they get mls over here. They get the dutch league over here
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.400]   They they pick up some smaller leagues that are a little bit cheaper
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:41.160]   And then they sort of like build a home for soccer in their streaming app and and they just kind of like build it up from there
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.240]   It's not a well, not a terrible idea
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:48.840]   And there's a lot of efficiencies in doing it in multiple places because if especially if they're going to use new technology
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.240]   Um to do it doing it for one league is one thing but doing it for more more leagues
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.800]   You're going to use the same central technology for a lot of different ones
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:58.440]   So I could see them definitely trying to expand
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:02.200]   And i know jason you're a football soccer
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:06.360]   Slash football fans. I'm going to let you answer this question
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.120]   um
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.120]   I watched as uh
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:13.320]   England in the united states
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.480]   battled
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.720]   For an hour and a half to nothing
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:23.720]   It's true. They'll nil draw. Yeah, the most boring game i've ever received was not was not boring is very exciting
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:25.400]   Actually, but it was a very exciting game
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.400]   But scoring is not scoring
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:32.760]   In soccer most of the exciting things do not despite everything do not lead to scoring
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:38.200]   And then sometimes they score and then they say no actually a thing you couldn't see means that they didn't score
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.400]   There's a lot of that this is the kind of excitement jason's talking about
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.480]   He's getting close. He's getting close. Oh, he missed
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.560]   Well, I mean
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:49.880]   Oh, he missed I shot more at soccer than I do at football american football
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:55.400]   But there but yes the american football. It's like ah touchdown and in soccer. It's like oh
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:59.640]   A lot of high
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.640]   And they're like this ticket cost me $130
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.600]   You don't pretend you heard I don't care
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:09.320]   I will drop this knowledge on you the the Dutch the Dutch league seems so totally obscure
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:12.120]   It is the sixth highest ranked in terms of quality
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:17.000]   Uh soccer league in the world way more than major league soccer, which ranks 15th
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.880]   So it's actually it would be a step up for apple and there is
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:23.080]   That interest in that right so here in american it's not just in the netherlands
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:27.240]   We think oh this little Dutch thing compared to mls. It's bigger than mls by far
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.840]   espn says 1.2 million people subscribe
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:36.520]   Uh to the matches that they expect that the price will be 150 to 200 million
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.440]   euros
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.200]   next year
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:43.400]   Um, so yeah, so there is a market for this. Um, yeah
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:50.440]   And the players are so international that you're going to get appeal because they're going to be players from lots of different countries playing in the dutch league
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:57.080]   Okay, so that's another that'll be watched around the world. It seemed like like at least a third of the players on the american team
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:00.760]   Were actually played for england english soccer teams
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:05.800]   So it's very it's like what I don't understand what makes them an american soccer team
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:09.720]   They play for english soccer teams because they're from america, but that's the number one
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:14.440]   That's the goal is yeah the english english league is the number one league in the world if you can make it there
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:17.800]   You are among the best in the world and so that's that's why
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:25.080]   You know you sort of start in mls and then it's still the case that eventually you graduate to the boondace league in germany or
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:30.200]   Or seria in italy or the premier league in england, which is really number one so
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:33.480]   And it also seemed like a half the team was an american
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:41.000]   Um, and that's why nationality nationality is weird right like there's that one there's the one american player who's
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.760]   Has an american parent an english parent but grew up in england and the fact is
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:48.840]   You know he gets more playing time in america than he would have on the english team
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.720]   So he chose to do that. It's kind of like the olympics right where there is real story
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:58.920]   You know your nationality can be flexible a lot of people's nationality is flexible
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:04.840]   I know we can't just sock on right now because anybody who cares is not watching this show so
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.640]   Leo i'm not watching this show i
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:11.160]   I got the hockey i've got the soccer right here right i'm not gonna show it
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.880]   I had a feeling down but i got it it's right here
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.920]   I had a feeling but the the but i would say as a hot
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:22.040]   A lot of Canadians in the hockey in the american teams and you know in the internet it's true
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.320]   A lot a lot of long he's getting close he's getting close. Oh
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:32.200]   Well, so that's that's the funny thing about about americans talking about soccer is that we're so used to the leagues in our country being the best
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:35.800]   In the world and right it's just not the case for soccer and so where do we win?
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:40.680]   But it is like i said 15th best strongest league in the world but
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:45.960]   It is which is which is below the second league in england by the way the the championship
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:49.320]   That's the next one down but it is an international sport and apple strategy
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.880]   Which is why i think this is very interesting apple strategy
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:57.000]   They want to this is why they're having problems with the nfl right because the nfl wants to do like us rights
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.080]   That are very limited and apple really likes the idea of rolling this out everywhere
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.880]   MLS is going to be available everywhere
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.960]   And if they make this deal with the dutch league the dutch league will be available worldwide
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:12.520]   And so if you're a fan in indonesia who has an indonesian player playing in the dutch league
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:19.240]   You're going to be able to watch his games because apple's going to put it on everywhere with different multiple languages and the whole thing
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:24.040]   Like they're gonna they're gonna be able to do that and that is better than a league that only has
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:28.120]   Appeal in one little place and i'm going to again show my provincialism by saying
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:32.360]   It feels like after watching the u.s. england game
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:35.880]   There is a lot apple could do to make that a better
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:39.800]   Television show for instance. Oh, yeah, most of the game is shot
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:47.000]   At distance from one side. They never show it from the other side of the pitch. Why is that? That's weird. That's pretty
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:52.200]   That's actually pretty common. The problem really is if you start putting cameras on the other side of the field now we
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:56.920]   We even do a line problem, right across the line and oh, yeah
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:03.320]   We're going left to right. Do you remember the reverse angle replay that they used to have that was they had to actually call it
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:08.760]   They had to brand in the NFL with the reverse angle replay because it was like they're not going the other way people
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:15.080]   Makes sense and they can't do a lot of close-up shots because it's so much is happening so fast
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:17.720]   They tend to be to stay on the wide shot
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:21.000]   Whereas american football it feels like a football tv
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.120]   Uh, there's a lot of up close and personal
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:26.360]   stuff
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:30.200]   I don't know. They do some of that. It's just it's it's so much more chaotic, you know, like yeah
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.360]   I mean, I mean, you know
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.520]   Football in the rest of the world is got so much
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:38.200]   It's like hockey in the sense that it in basketball that it doesn't really stop
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:45.400]   It doesn't really slow down and it's moving around the field so much the the big thing that makes american football american football is they stop every play
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.480]   And they wish for advertising
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:52.680]   Well, but it also it's also perfect for every place and replays and and contacts
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.840]   You can't do this. You can't do this
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.480]   American football is is not as popular as
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:04.920]   Football around the world, but it is it's much more of a tv game than than than soccer is
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:09.320]   Other football because it's four years ago. I watched the world cup with great interest
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.120]   I'm a little less interested this time because it got dark, but
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:16.360]   That I but I thought oh, this is gonna. This is gonna take over the u.s
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:19.080]   And now tedd lasso. This is gonna take over the u.s
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.080]   And we are resistant
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:25.160]   There's not enough bars that serve a yards of beer. I mean, I really think of that
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:30.280]   I mean, I gotta tell you I watched I watched people when you're singing at games more
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:35.400]   Right. That's what we do. I watched it. I watched I watched some some matches in of fife
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:39.320]   in like 2005 or something in in Zimbabwe at a bar
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:44.600]   Drinking yards of beer and I gotta tell you it was great. It was it was really fun
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:49.400]   Like it was it was just a really great experience even better than going to a stealer bar which was a small
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.880]   Is it just a matter of
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.760]   Not enough drinking but also not a drinking none of yelling
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:59.560]   Knowledge of the game to Jason like we need to we just
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.240]   We need to grow up with it, right?
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:05.480]   It is it is something that yeah, you have to I mean when I started watching soccer
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:08.760]   It's like I don't even know what I'm looking at here and only now am I even vaguely aware
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:11.320]   I always say I'm like a fake american fake soccer fan
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:15.560]   But I understand it more now and I see the appeal of it and I think it is a lot of fun
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:19.720]   I know the rules I play soccer in high school. I mean I I know the rules
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:23.960]   I know my problem is is the off sides. I'm always like I don't understand
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.520]   I mean although there's a piece actually
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:30.600]   There's a piece I linked to 538 did a piece this week about the ball that our tech
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.400]   If anybody is still there
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.880]   Well, we're talking about sports that our tech nerd fans will like
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:40.200]   The ball has ultra wideband in it. It's got a an accelerometer in it
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:46.600]   Every single ball being used in the world cup and they have also like Hawkeye technology where they've got the cameras mounted everywhere
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.120]   So they've got a 3d
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:55.400]   instantaneous 3d view of the players and where they are on the field and they know up to like 500 Hertz like a 500 times a second
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:59.800]   They know where the ball is with precise positioning. They've got little this ultra wide band was
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:04.360]   Somewhat controversial right because the computers were going to make off sides calls
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:08.040]   Yeah, and that has been the case in fact during our recording in the us
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.600]   Iran game the
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:13.000]   us had a gold disallowed and they actually showed he's
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.760]   They showed it. Well, they had a gold disallowed so it doesn't count and it doesn't matter
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:21.800]   But they showed the off-side call and they actually were able to put up a 3d representation of the player
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:27.240]   And the plane that that he's broken in order to be offside and they know all of that because of this tech
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:32.680]   So they are making some very interesting strides to make the offside call at least a little more understandable
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:41.800]   But as we know as americans adding instant replay and technology to baseball or basketball or football does not reduce the frustration level at all
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:47.800]   Yeah, even if it gets the calls better and one of the interesting things with streaming that's going to happen with apple is that you could
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.880]   It's much easier to build
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:56.040]   Many different versions of the commentary so you can do different languages, but in hls you can just have another
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:03.160]   You can have not a selector that just said the beginner version of the show the advanced version of the show the super nerdy version of the show
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:08.520]   I just want the mass american and dancers to do it in english because they're the most interesting
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:12.040]   And I just love how they they're so excited
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:15.400]   It would be fun to
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.800]   I know that they did it in mexico city that they did it with the
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:25.240]   Great during the the nfl game in mexico city. They had the esp and de port guy come out and call a touchdown
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:27.640]   It was a whole different thing
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:35.560]   I have heard from a lot of people who especially if you if you have any spanish at all interestingly
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:41.080]   Uh fox has the english language rights in america to the world cup but p-cock cat and in telamundo
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.320]   Have the spanish language rights and
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:50.200]   And basically what i've heard is if you know elica spanish you should watch it on p-cock or telamundo because it's a much better broadcast than the fox broadcast
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.080]   so
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:56.760]   Apple's kind of betting. I think apple's betting that soccer is going to become
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.400]   Well, uh a
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:03.800]   Pure sport with the nfl. Yes in america in nba here here
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:07.560]   It's growing fast. It's cheap now and it is very popular
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:11.480]   Internationally and they want to have global reach there's a lot of school programs
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:13.560]   I mean almost every kid
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:16.040]   Especially girls grow up now playing soccer
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.760]   um, it's very very popular
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.440]   Well, I mean the the as a parent I can tell you that there was absolutely no pressure
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:28.280]   For my son. My son is becoming a lineman like he's taller than I am now
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:33.640]   So he's a big guy. Yeah. He's a big guy and in the first thing are you gonna last play pop Warner though?
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:36.120]   No, no
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:39.800]   No, no, no like like like there's no pressure on him in fact. I don't know
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:44.520]   No, he played pop one for a year and it was a scariest year of my life
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:49.080]   It was terrifying because you know, I had uh these kids play hard and people get injured that
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:53.640]   I didn't even play pop Warner and I had I don't I felt like I had a concussion probably almost every
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:58.040]   Yeah, you know like I like I had I had all the colors of all the other teams across the front of my
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:02.840]   But soccer. I mean it looks like it's dangerous. These guys are throwing themselves on the ground all the time
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:05.400]   Looks like they're in pain. Yeah
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.840]   You do have to take active classes to be really good at soccer. That is a thing
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:12.360]   That's the hardest part. That's the hardest part of it
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.360]   So that was it honestly
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:22.200]   Injury they're not injured. They're running around. They kicked somebody big deal. I want to see a concussion
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.600]   he touched me
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:27.240]   My leg
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:30.120]   I said that I said that I said that until I was like oh all these are
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:33.960]   Don't make any sense until I was playing soccer with someone. I'm not very good
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:39.640]   And but I was playing and we hit we hit thought our our our shins together
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.240]   A lot like I felt I felt very wimpy really quickly. Yes. That was like oh it's a super painful
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:47.560]   Yeah, well as as uh
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:53.880]   As we sat here one of the stars of the us team got it right between the legs. So sometimes the injuries are real
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:57.160]   Sometimes that one I believe you
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:59.240]   Listen to the dives
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:04.520]   The injuries happen when the ref is not looking that those are some remarkable pieces of video and photo
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:09.720]   Photographic evidence of oh my god. He actually had the guts to that is that is an arrestable offense
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:11.720]   What that person did
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:18.200]   And then that's with all those sports to keep on running like the with the cold dead eyes of a shark as though
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:20.440]   He has not just simply doing what do you mean?
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:22.760]   Altering I don't know
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:26.040]   Guess what no children no more children for that player for the
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:33.160]   Alright, so I I want soccer to become a popular sport. I really do
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:34.120]   I know and again
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:37.080]   What it what it allows apple to do is is prove what they can do over that
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:40.040]   They and they have it for a long period of time so they can invest over a long period of time
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:45.320]   Which is what apple likes to do and they're going to be able to over time as these contracts come up again
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:49.320]   Because they're gonna sign people are gonna sign contracts right now and apple's gonna fight for each one of these contracts
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:54.120]   And they're gonna have something they can point to like I know we haven't done broadcast before but but look at that
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:56.280]   MLS for a little decade and
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:00.440]   And in two or three years in the end of the future. I think that within within three years
[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:03.080]   It's going to be 120 frame per second 4k
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:07.960]   HDR with you know immersive sound and it's going you know because apple can do that
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:10.600]   You know they can build that production pipeline and
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:14.440]   And everyone else is going to have a really hard time competing with that that pipeline
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:19.000]   You know and even if they do compete with it, it only means that the apple tv will be more utilized
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:25.880]   So it doesn't apple wins no matter how it turns out. Why uh, why does england why is england so good? Uh, Jason
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:30.040]   Why are they so good? I mean it's it's in there well one
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:35.800]   It's in their history and they're they're good at soccer in general and then they also have the money
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:42.360]   That's not like latin america is bigger than latin america like paella and brazil and sure sure
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:47.160]   I mean that I think europe is very strong and and south america is very very strong at soccer and turn
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:51.240]   Turned out the players the money is in europe and so you know england
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.360]   italy spain
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:58.680]   Germany is where the best players all around the world end up playing big big money. It's amazing huge money
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.640]   Yeah, and i mean there are some great teams in like there's a
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:05.400]   Some great teams in france too like there's there are a lot of great teams in europe
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:08.920]   And they have the money to spend and so that ends up being where they're going
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:13.720]   But yeah in terms of the grass roots there are a lot of great players in south america and africa and europe and
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:17.320]   gradually from um from north and central america
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:20.120]   All right, i'll let you get back to the game. Uh meanwhile
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:24.520]   It's a nail biter here. It is a nail biter isn't it?
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:27.080]   You're watching it too, Alex
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:29.880]   I just see the stats. Oh, I saw we I opened it up
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:33.800]   No, we in my defense. I opened it up what we started talking so I could see like are they still playing?
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:36.760]   How many how many how many minutes are in a soccer games?
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:40.040]   90 plus plus plus
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:42.680]   Top of that time a random
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:45.080]   Stop it. I'm gonna add another six minutes. You know again
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:51.800]   I'm an awful american here to say could you wire up the referee stopwatch to the scoreboards so that we can see the time
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:56.520]   That was the real time and the answer is no no no we don't do that. Yeah, okay. I guess
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:58.840]   Also, I want to hear the referees talk
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:03.960]   You know, that's one good thing about football what they did that if many years ago they started miking up the referees
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:07.480]   I like to hear the like what the penalty was. What did you do wrong?
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:12.920]   I enjoy when those referees talked they're like now boys. I know that you just smashed into each other
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:16.280]   But I need to you need to stop it now. I want to hear it out
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:22.200]   Is there only one guy referee on the field running around? Yeah, that's another problem. I think
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:25.960]   We can fix this americans can fix this
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:28.440]   It can fix this. Yes. Good luck to us
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:32.680]   And I just want to see the bench. I don't understand why don't they show the bench?
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:37.160]   I want to see the bench put the bench on the other side if you only want to shoot from one side
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:43.080]   Let's see the I want to see the coach. We never see the coach going tearing his hair out throwing his surface
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:46.040]   Once they do very rarely that does that does happen. Yeah
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:51.480]   You just got to have a you know photogenic coach. They do that for me all the time
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:56.760]   Do they you look you're looking for the style and panache of the of soccer's bill benichuk on the sideline?
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:01.480]   Yeah, I want to see a guy with his what's sleeve kind of off on his rat ratty man united
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:03.720]   hoodie sweatshirt. Yeah
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:05.960]   apple has
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:06.840]   uh
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.680]   lost
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:14.200]   Well, they're settling anyway the butterfly keyboard lawsuit. You'll be happy to know andrew
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.960]   Um
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:19.080]   The judge of california federal judges approved apples plan to pay
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:23.640]   $50 million so that means you might get a bag of pop champs. I don't know
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:27.240]   Yeah, you get a dollar 13.6 million in attorney fees
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:33.640]   2 million in litigation costs 1.4 million in settlement administration do the math
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:39.560]   As I yeah, there's a goodly um out left uh about 30 million dollars to distribute
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:42.200]   Uh to all of us who suffered
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:45.000]   Suffered the butterfly uh key
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:51.800]   Uh, they initially greeted the settlement about halfway through the year, uh, but they uh, but they were waiting for approval
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.320]   Uh from the judge. So believe it or not
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:01.080]   Uh awards to customers from the settlement will be based on the number of repairs required
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.080]   How many times did you have to bring it in andy?
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:10.760]   Amounts of up to $395 for those who had two or more top case replacements
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:15.480]   Yeah, because remember this wasn't just you know people like me complaining about how it was
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:18.840]   untypable for with with one handle of a little like it
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:25.160]   It was it was because when dust got in there that thing was gonna break and one and they and apple was not
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.720]   Uh very very forthcoming about how
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:33.480]   And because of the way these things are built. It's like, oh well gosh. There's a there's a there's a
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:40.600]   B's eyelash underneath your letter a key. That's gonna cost 890 for an entire lower case
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:47.480]   Battery trackpad replacement like no, that's that's a crappy keyboard. Yeah, that's and people have and people having to
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:52.120]   Basically get well all we can do for you is give you the same crappy keep a new version
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:57.080]   Excuse me and an unbroken version of the exact same crappy keyboard. It's gonna happen again. So
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.960]   You like to you like to have
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.480]   You want people
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:08.280]   I'm glad enough that apple like reversed their decision on this keyboard, but it is there's a certain satisfaction for consumers that
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:12.680]   Yeah, there now there's a legal document that says that yeah, this was terrible
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:16.360]   We knew it was terrible and we had a stick with it and people paid the price. All right
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:19.880]   We know that it's the final minutes of the game
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:26.280]   So let's go to play the show. Oh, so that you can watch the end. That's why we podcast
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:31.000]   Right so people can listen to it later. John's also watching Ashley. You're also watching it
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.080]   I can't help when you're watching it. Oh, I'm not what me who me? I mean
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:38.040]   You have on your screen
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.040]   Picture in picture, baby
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:47.240]   I'll have you know that I you know I have been on this week in tech even though
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:53.560]   A major candle pin bowling hitch bowling tournament. Oh man. I t-vode that okay
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:30:00.840]   People don't roll candle pin anywhere but Rhode Island, right? No, it's it's it's no still full full on New England thing
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:04.520]   It's like yeah, it was it was that's why if apple, you know
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:09.800]   If you want to round up to the nearest like ten thousand dollars after you buy the soccer league
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:12.440]   You could probably buy like new england candle pin bowling league
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:16.200]   This used to be a really big tv show every Saturday morning
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:21.560]   Candlepins for candles and for cash the halo jackpot, you know four horseman left side kev buries
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:27.160]   Tell me the reason man united is so expensive as it was bought by americans who leveraged it with huge debt
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:29.880]   Oh great
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.040]   Well, we we ruined everything
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:39.400]   Who who who who are you as what do they call it a supporter? Who do you support?
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.560]   Uh, Jason are you oh?
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:47.160]   Uh, well, it's it's arsenal which you'll love this lea one of their big chance is
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:54.600]   One nil to the arsenal. That's the dream one nil. They just want to wait the dream the slimmest for arsenal
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:59.800]   Possible is that what you're saying? Yeah, one oh we can get like one goal and I hope it's us
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:06.440]   Jason what is it is there a slaughter rule and is it like well if you're ahead by by two goals
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:11.000]   We're just gonna call it. Let's let's let's leave this other team leave with the pitch with their dignity
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.760]   No, there was a world cup match that was just seven nil the other day
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:20.840]   It's like it's gold differential is a thing actually one of the tiebreakers and in soccer is your gold differential
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.240]   So if you can pour it on the other team you do it
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:27.480]   It doesn't have her happen. I mean it happens rarely, but you do get occasionally you'll get those
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:33.240]   6 twos where they snuck in a couple at the end just for kicks. I mean literally
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:38.600]   Uh, and by the way apple is not buying Walt Disney so stop thinking of
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:43.560]   Stop thinking that that was another really funny crazy room was like what the hell?
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:47.640]   Well, you Alex has been lobbying for this for you
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:50.360]   I don't think they should now but I think they should have a while ago
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:54.200]   I think that it would have been there was a lot of good reasons for apple to do it in the past
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:58.200]   I think that uh Disney's too large and too unmanageable at this point
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.760]   I mean, I don't even you know, I don't I don't think it's nearly the investment
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:06.440]   It was five years ago and I know I cannot show the game, but I can show a picture of
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:09.720]   soccer balls being charged up
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:13.720]   There you go before this sport. That's the future
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:15.720]   White bear
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:16.760]   Yeah
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:18.760]   Yeah
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:24.280]   You talk about the NFL that's gonna be a big thing for the NFL because that is a remember a sport where the placement of a ball
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:29.320]   Across an imaginary invisible plane is relevant in the rules and they just have to be like yeah
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:35.640]   It probably broke the plane sure and now they know that they will be able to put those in the ball and they'll know it broke the plane
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:38.520]   Yeah, and when they have when they have sensors in the knee pads
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:42.840]   You'll know when the knees hit as well as when the ball hit yes, you will you know, it
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:46.440]   There'll be a lot of a lot of data there, you know, and it's gonna happen
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:50.040]   The ball is the the ball is really hard because it actually is really flexible
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:53.960]   You know, so you know one of the things that I was actually ran into a developer at
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:56.520]   At wwc a couple years ago
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:01.080]   They work on putting sensors in the you know into the basketballs and they're either
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:05.560]   You know that it's not in the pro pro league yet, but they're definitely and the the real challenges
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:08.440]   It can't change the weight it can't change the balance it can't change
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:11.880]   And it's really it's really complex in the month's really up to the world cup
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:16.520]   They actually did a blind test they took a bunch of soccer players and they played with with uh
[01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:20.120]   Both balls and nobody could tell the difference
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:24.600]   So that and that was like the big final test was if if it's not the same ball
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:29.960]   You can't do it. It has to feel exactly like the same ball that you were in there before and the problem is though
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:35.800]   With football there's so much throwing that that that getting that just right. I mean, it's really minor
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.280]   You know my very very minor change. Yeah, it's a really really complicated
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:43.960]   I do think the best sport played on grass anywhere is
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:49.560]   Australian rules football. I wish that would suddenly take over that I would watch
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:52.280]   I used to watch I used to work for prime sports network
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:54.920]   That was one of their specialties was taking all these you know these
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:58.360]   Your sports that weren't in the United States and then redistributing to the United States
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:01.400]   I got to watch a lot of I watching Australian
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.920]   Just amazing like I was like these are the guys of the most
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:07.800]   You know just crazy like I was like I'll never
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:11.880]   It's a bunch of good looking buff guys and short shorts
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000]   Malling each other
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:21.240]   So my my college football team is uh, University of California
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:24.440]   And they have a planter. Uh, he's a senior
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:29.640]   They have a punter who is an Australian rules football player who is part of an NFL program where they identify
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:31.960]   Aussie rules players and bring them to America
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:35.000]   And he got to the news after the Stanford Stanford game
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000]   No after the UCLA game last week because he had a punt where they were coming into block it
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.240]   And he basically did his Aussie rules thing and ran to the side and then kicked it with his other foot
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:46.760]   Like you can do that and the answer is well. Yeah
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:53.080]   Half the other thing is the best part of punter that an Aussie rules football player
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:56.120]   That's a punter is that he's he's half punter half cornerback
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:59.800]   Like you know like if you get run if you get past the if you get past the all
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:03.720]   He's gonna take you down. It's gonna hurt a lot more than everybody else on the field
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:07.800]   I had a Twitter exchange with the sports editor of the San Francisco Chronicle where I said, you know
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:13.560]   I think this is a moneyball situation where maybe the NFL needs to look at Aussie rules punters because
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:19.320]   I think it could change that entire thing and and her response was yeah, I think so too after seeing that
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:24.440]   Well, you know the the um, I think it was like in Samoa that you you had a 60 times
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:29.640]   Per capita you had a 60 times better advantage of becoming a pro football player
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:35.000]   Then and and there you know because it was they just mined it, you know for for people because
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:39.480]   Uh, it was it had to do with size, but it also had to do with the fact that they don't have any equipment
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:44.440]   So they're playing on basically like barefields with no gear and it's awesome. They come over here a little rougher
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:49.800]   It's great sport great sport. My my favorites. My favorite my favorite moments in sports is when
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:55.960]   Somebody somebody does something so weird and so successful that immediately
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:58.840]   Everyone's flipping through rule books to see that has to be illegal
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:04.040]   Like that NASCAR driver who said, you know what? I wouldn't do that thing. I used to do on my on my playstation
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:09.000]   And just ride the ride the rail all the way out there and pass five freaking cars
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:15.400]   Like that can't possibly like like teen wolf right there's no rule against it. So it must be legal
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:20.840]   Yeah, the the the cal player like the other thing that he did that I thought was hilarious because it's just like all these things
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:22.920]   We assume he would take the snap
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:29.640]   And instead of just kicking it for dear life like so many american punters do he would just stand there and wait until the guys got
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:34.920]   Close to him and many kick it because he's that tough. I was like, it's good. It gets his guys downfield
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:38.360]   But I just I love the attitude of that which is like, hey, mate. What are you gonna do to me?
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:42.760]   They do that they do that a lot in soccer as well. I know he's makes I'm not really intimidated by you
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:45.160]   Yeah, that's so nervous

[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:21.960]   New version for a technology that's dead rss is really quite vital, isn't it?
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:27.960]   A lot of good rss readers out there for ios 2 which I think is really interesting right like this platform that is the
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:34.360]   You know a really good platform really solid modern platform and it's got lots of rss readers
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:39.640]   I mostly use net newswire, but reader is really good. Read kid is really good. There are a bunch of others
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:41.240]   reader
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:45.160]   There's so many I can't even decide which one to use that's the problem
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:52.840]   And I'll give my tip again, which is I also use feed bin and my secret is that I have all my newsletters sent to feed bin because feed bin
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:56.600]   Will will consume emails right and put them in your reader?
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:00.840]   And that is amazing because then I can open that newswire or read kit
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:05.640]   And all of those sub stack emails and all those other emails that I get they're all in the same place
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:09.800]   So I can read them all in one place. We'll uh, we'll uh, read kit do that
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:11.080]   Uh as well or no
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:15.000]   Is it like all these feet all these will use feed bin as a feed source
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.640]   You can use it so totally you can use it direct rss or you can use any of the feed syncing surfaces like
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:25.480]   Like uh the one feed bin that I use read kit read later in rss for mac iPhone and ipad
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:29.640]   Free within app purchases. It's good andy and aco we have
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:32.520]   Three minutes of stoppage left
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:33.480]   Okay
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:38.440]   Well, this is this this is a good one mine mine is a it's not a glue
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:44.760]   It's actually like a it's a liquid plastic though. I broke I broke my glasses snap them like clean in half
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:47.320]   Like at the bridge that's the worst place to do it because no
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:50.280]   It can't it's not enough to just stick together. It has to hold together
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:54.520]   And so after spending like two or three or four days trying to figure out what adhesive I wanted to use
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.680]   I tried out this thing that I said I read about
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:43:59.160]   Uh, it is it is not a glove I
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:04.440]   Here's the repair that made it as you can see I don't care about like the structure. It is holding it together
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:07.880]   Uh perfectly I can even bend it because it's not a glue
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:13.720]   It's actually plastic that it is actually deposited like on these glasses. It's very very lumpy
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:19.000]   It's also demonstrates that you never go out andy because I wouldn't want to wear those glasses
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.440]   No, no, I'm saying
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:21.160]   I
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:25.560]   I I'm I'm telling you that I that I left this what I'm going to do app now that I've shown this off
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:29.400]   I'm going to sand this down so that you don't actually see it right because it is just plastic
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:33.400]   So I wanted because I wanted to just I don't think you'll get the idea of like exactly how this works
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:39.160]   So you lump it on and it holds it together. No, what it what it does is it's really an interesting system
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:43.240]   It's again. It's not a glue the URL for bond. I guess actually not a glue.com
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:45.640]   So you get this little fairy wand for like
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:50.440]   List prices like 20 bucks speaking good for 10 bucks. Yeah, and what it consists of is
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:52.040]   a
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:54.200]   little like applicator pen here
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:45:00.120]   That deposits just like a little just like a little tiny pen like this liquid like
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:06.520]   Uncured plastic and then you all see then you have this little le this little ultraviolet light
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:11.000]   So all the the it doesn't drive by air. It doesn't drive by heat
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.560]   It cures it and turns this liquid into plastic
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:16.680]   So there was the upshot of that the upshot of that is that now
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:22.360]   It's unlike a two-part epoxy where it'll take a day for the for it to cure
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:27.400]   So you can you can stick it together, but you don't know if it's going to hold until a day later with this one
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:31.800]   You can literally draw a line like I basically I basically I know I know
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:36.440]   I again, I I'm telling you I'm telling you that I left it. I left it like this
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:38.520]   You can see what the process was like
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:40.040]   as I
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:45.000]   I just like taped it down to a piece of cardboard to hold it into place and then just draw a line of this liquid
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.120]   Shine this light for three or four seconds to turn into plastic another line another line another line
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:52.520]   So you can basically build up this this
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:57.160]   Yes, this big glob of plastic. That's actual not just hard and glue
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:01.960]   It is actually plastic like I said, this is not like I can bend this and it's not becoming a part
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:08.680]   And then when it's done you can touch it and it is it feels exactly like the plastic the acetate that's on these glasses
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:11.160]   So I can then take a take a
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:17.000]   A little piece of sandpaper around a chopstick or something and sand that down and basically turn it into nice smooth
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:21.720]   Smooth out all the glops. I just wanted to make sure that I had this really really nice
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:28.600]   Like bolus of hardened plastic around holding these two together. So yes, it does it does look ugly as is but again
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:32.040]   You can sand it you can paint it after you've a composter repair
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:36.680]   It'll fill gaps so that if you have like one of the demonstrations that they have on the site
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:41.640]   Is the like if you have like a power connector that has like sort of a cracked end to it or like a
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:47.320]   Missing the missing some insulation or something you can just basically layer some plastic on that and seal that up
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:52.840]   It's not necessarily flexible like rubber, but it's not it's not like super super hard plastic
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:57.560]   It has some flex to it so you can use it to fill in missing chunks you might have broken out of something
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:04.200]   The only disadvantage is that uh, it's it's not if it were like a two part epoxy and two part epoxy putty
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:05.960]   You can just basically
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:10.120]   Put this big glob of putty around something and you got it with this one
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:12.680]   You do have to build it up like a millimeter at a time because
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:16.600]   Uh again, you are curing it as you go every time you deposit a line
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:21.880]   So it's uh you have to keep each line to about or each layer to about one millimeter
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:26.280]   So that the light can get all the way down to the bottom and cure it the other the other thing that I just
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:31.960]   After reading about this like I could have put this I actually when I taped this to get when I taped this up onto the
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:36.040]   On that little board. I actually left a tiny tiny little gap between the halves
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:39.320]   So that not that's not just so that the glue could get into there
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:46.440]   But so that the light could get into there if I'd made this if if you're trying if you if I had tried to like glue like a handle back on a mug
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:52.520]   It might not have even worked because the glue the excuse me the the bond dick that's inside that joint is never going to see the light
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:55.640]   So it's never going to cure. But anyway, it's really really great stuff
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:48:03.000]   It's so useful that I'm kind of contemplating like buying another one of these for just like for my my overnight bag or my
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.760]   For when I take trips
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:10.760]   It seems as though a very quick solution to a problem that that is kind of indispensable
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:14.600]   And then the last thing is again, there's no curing time four seconds
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:21.000]   As I spent I spent like 15 minutes building up this again. This disgusting snot and fall that again
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.640]   I'm I'm going to sand down. I'm going to paint. It's gonna look fine
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:25.080]   But
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:29.880]   As about like five minutes after that was done. I could just wear these glasses and it was strong as it was ever going to be
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:31.240]   So nice big stuff
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:35.640]   UV curable resins as they say it's not a glue
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:39.480]   B-o-n-d-i-c at not a glue dot
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:42.040]   com
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:45.640]   And somebody says how is it? Andy doesn't have a twitch channel just you know
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:53.240]   Just like stuff like that. You know, there's stream all that stuff, you know, I don't know if she wanted live streamie planks tretigo alone
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:57.160]   That's
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:59.160]   Oh
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:04.200]   My god, don't say that. Hey, if there's money in it. If there's money that I'll go for that's why
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:09.560]   I think we'd watch you curing your your polymers frankly
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:14.440]   If you don't let me say his channel is like watching polymers cure not a euphemism
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:19.560]   Mr. Alex litch your title
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:26.680]   So so um my my my pick of the week is this was just released yesterday
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:33.720]   This is sound devices, which we use a lot of product sound devices boy. Do we use those? Yeah? Yeah? We use a lot of them and they have
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:41.080]   Basically rethought wireless transmission. So they bought a company called audio limited about five years ago four or five years ago
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:45.480]   And they you know at first it was just like reselling the stuff that they already made
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:53.080]   But they definitely started digging in and building new things and what they've built is is this what's called an a 20 rx
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:54.440]   and
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:56.440]   This is a receiver
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:58.760]   Now usually when we get these receivers
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:03.800]   They're one you per receiver like it is like for really high-end receivers
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:07.560]   They're these big you know you put them put them in a huge rack if i've got eight people
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:11.000]   I've got a rack that's like two feet high three feet high that are sub serving them
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.600]   They figured out how to get all of that into half of one you
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:18.040]   So it's it this this will this will receive up to
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:21.400]   16 fully diverse
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:22.920]   Signals
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:28.760]   It also had covers the entire wireless band or just about the entire wireless band of the world
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:31.960]   You can just pick where you want those signals to go and oh by the way
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:35.320]   If you want to change where that that that signal is
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:39.320]   In it you can just tell the the transmitter. Oh, I need you to move over here
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:44.360]   Like I can see it you can see literally on a web page or on the front of the receiver
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:47.640]   You can actually see all the frequencies that are going on and usually we have
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:50.280]   Specialists and all kinds of people like paying attention to that
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:52.840]   But you can say oh there's a bunch of stuff in this area
[01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:56.200]   Why don't I just move this this over somewhere else and and when I move it
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:51:00.920]   I literally just tap on the screen and then say which receiver I want to move over there
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:04.520]   And it just move and it automatically like I don't want to go to the receiver or the transmitter
[01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:07.400]   Oh, that's nice thing. It just tells the transmitter. I need you to move over here
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:09.880]   And it's gone for like a second then it's like okay now i'm over here
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:13.800]   Um, you control all the vault you don't have to change the gain on the transmitter
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:20.280]   So the you basically all those controls are all centralized so and then it's of course it sits on dante
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:23.880]   Or analog or a es, you know and and it is
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:29.080]   You know, there's a very few times that you look at a box and you're like, I can't believe they did this
[01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:31.880]   I can't believe that they put this all together
[01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:38.520]   And uh, and anyway, so it's it's a pretty it's a pretty amazing box. I mean this is a professional box
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:41.720]   It's got a professional price. I think it's starting to be fourteen thousand dollars
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:47.960]   This isn't like a 10 cent a 10 cent thing. This is that's 20 elixes. Oh, yeah, but but you could
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:53.320]   But you couldn't you couldn't get it any other way and and again every once in a while you see something
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:58.440]   You're just like that it may be a lot of money, but it is a disruptive piece of hardware
[01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:06.520]   That movie production tv tv live events. I mean, you know right now it doesn't there's no wireless handheld
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:11.560]   So it probably wouldn't be used in a concert but but a referee might use it at a football game potentially
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:14.600]   Yeah, yeah, and then and then the range is really
[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:22.840]   Yeah, and yeah, no it is it solves a lot of problems because again when I so I do a lot of events that are in in a venue
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:25.640]   It has you know a bunch of seats in it and it's got to go to other venues
[01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:31.400]   And so we're miking everybody up and the problem we end up with is I've got this huge rack of gear to get this working
[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:34.840]   And I and then if it doesn't work, I got to run over and manage the transmitter
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:36.840]   I got to run over and do all these other things and
[01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:43.800]   uh, it's just an I mean to take all of that out of the way and and again because it's on a web page that you can control it
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:46.040]   And that web page has total control over the system
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:52.760]   I can have a technician log in from 3 000 miles away and change the mics like literally change the frequencies
[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:57.640]   Like I'm going to move these frequencies around and so I can have someone on the ground that may not know as much about the system is
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:03.240]   As you know, but can put the mics on you know like do those things and have somebody else running the whole thing
[01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:10.920]   You know and so it is it's really really interesting. We had uh, Paul isex who's the director of product management and design and gary
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:13.080]   trenda who was
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:16.920]   The there are applications engineer on this morning on office hours
[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:21.720]   Spending an hour with us like walking through it and answering our questions and everything else
[01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:27.560]   And it was just an incredible, you know, you definitely if you if this it all sounds interesting you should look at that hour because it's just a really
[01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:32.600]   Um, you know, I kind of twisted a lot of arms as soon as I saw the release i'm like you got to come on the show
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:35.800]   Like I mean, I mean like when and i'm like tomorrow tomorrow
[01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:41.480]   On the show. So I was like I was so excited about it sound device has been on many times before but this is
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:46.680]   This is cool. This is really cool. Yeah, it's it's a it's a and i've been using of course
[01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:50.680]   Um, you know, i'm talking through a sound devices mix pre-3 right now
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:55.960]   Yeah, and so and so I you know I use a lot of sound devices equipment and so
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:54:01.160]   It's not just that they camp with something that on paper is really cool. It's a company that you know builds
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:06.120]   You know rugged, you know must 16 you know can't fail kind of equipment
[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:08.440]   So you know that when they say oh it can do this thing it can
[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:16.200]   Really do the thing that we went down to la to watch him shoot dexter. It was a big old like yep 16 channel sound devices
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:18.920]   Thing in the sound by the way
[01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:24.600]   One of the panelists on office hours. It turns out when we were down there. He was the sound engineer
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:27.960]   He was the sound recordist because I was like he mentioned that I was a dexter
[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:32.200]   And I was like how did I didn't because I didn't know him back then, but he knew because he what you know from mac break
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:37.080]   He knew who who I was and so he probably a court. That's awesome. Yeah, he was probably the person
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:41.880]   Showrunner was a fan. Yeah, I'm looking at him going there. Yeah, I come on looking on like I know you you look familiar
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:44.680]   I can't quite figure out where he's like Dexter Dexter. So cool
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:47.800]   And he loves sound devices too
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:52.280]   Everybody's favorite. I don't usually do a pic, but this one I thought was kind of wild
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:58.840]   And I thought you might you might get a little kick out of it there. I didn't I was stunned to learn
[01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:01.400]   That there are more than 700
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:04.520]   Mac menu bar
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:12.600]   Programs and now what I meant for some reason the certificate on this is is died. I can't get in there anymore
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:15.880]   Mac menu bar calm
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:23.160]   Lists all of them see if you guys can go maybe it's just me maybe I maybe I was watching too much football
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:30.120]   Locked to a security threat. Well, I'm not allowed there. Well, I see in there. I see it. I see it
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:33.800]   So sisco umbrella is protecting us right now
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:39.640]   But yes, if you I would show it, but I can't mac menu bar calm. Well now I'm worried
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:47.160]   I was an interesting little insight. I Leo say oh well jeez. I've got a security program
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:49.960]   That's telling me this is a dangerous site Jason. I
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:56:03.640]   Maki users. They're like it sounds dangerous. Let's go. Let's go. Oh, it's probably dangerous to him. I'm probably fine
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:07.560]   It's uh apparently got maybe got some malware on there. I don't know
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:10.200]   so um
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:14.600]   Maybe that's a false spurious block, but uh, anyway, maybe you shouldn't go
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:18.760]   Until we find out so forget I said anything
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:25.880]   Uh, let's wrap this show real quick. This is why I don't do freaking pics. Okay, right there in a nutshell
[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:30.200]   That's the problem. I just thought it was interesting that there were 700 plus
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:35.080]   Menu bar apps and that someone has put a lot of work into curating it. So it looks like this. It looks
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:42.360]   Uh, and I went there this morning. It was fine. So maybe it there's two possibilities. It could be if a false positive
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:47.160]   Uh, we use there's a lot more security here than there is perhaps at my home
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:52.440]   Uh, it's also possible and it does happen from time to time that as a legit site it got hacked
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:58.520]   And malware is placed on it and it's being detected now by our protection. So maybe just wait
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:01.480]   Don't go there yet. Okay
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:06.680]   Maybe you don't need anything more in your menu bar. How about that? Jason snell
[01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:14.120]   There are no lifesaving menu bar apps. I misread the uh, the utc time for the world cup gamer
[01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:16.200]   I would have never scheduled
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:18.680]   Mac break weekly at this time, but thank you come
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:24.440]   You come first. Thank you and I can always just play it on an ipad beneath the uh screen
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:28.920]   Which is what I did. So it was all good and with no spoilers. We won't tell you how it ended, but it did end
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:35.640]   There's that there's that to be say and it was it was not a I can say safe to say it was not a tie
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:42.520]   Somebody won by now you probably all know anyway, so indeed. I don't want to spoil it in case you taped it or something
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:45.160]   Thank you, Jason six colors.com
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:50.840]   I appreciate that uh showing up. That's that's really great. I try to be here every Tuesday
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:56.040]   You know, they haven't stopped me yet. This was under uh duress. Oh, no, no, no, absolutely
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:02.360]   Well, the netherlands game maybe that will be under duress if that's also on a Tuesday. Well, we it's not it's saturday
[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:06.760]   Okay for whoever's playing the netherlands. I don't know who that might be whoever that might be
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:10.360]   Not that we would want to watch necessarily
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:13.560]   Shoot. I blow it every time don't I?
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:15.480]   Um
[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:19.000]   Thank you, Jason. Keep up keep keep up the wonderful work. We love having you on the show
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:24.520]   You've been a real wonderful addition to it. Andy and aqua has been here practically since the very beginning
[01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:33.480]   I h n a t k o dot com you'll hear them on gbh. They dropped the w because you know what one letter three syllables. It's too much
[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:39.800]   Well, you know, it's it's it's a public radio station. They rely on funding from viewers
[01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:45.320]   They figure why are we wasting bandwidth that we have to pay for with an extra letter when people understand gbh
[01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:51.560]   They're east we're east we're east of the mrs. Sippy. They understand that a radio station will start with a w. That's right
[01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:58.360]   That's that's that's that's why we cultivate these these smart smart and endearing winners. When will you be on gbh next?
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:05.480]   Uh literally tomorrow at about quarter to one go to w gbh news.com org to stream it live or later via audio
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:11.720]   Go to w gbh news on youtube to stream it video live or later in a room almost exactly like this one
[01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:13.960]   I should mention that k gbh
[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:18.920]   Is the pirate radio station of the russian mafia and grand theft auto
[01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:22.200]   So you don't want to confuse the two okay
[01:59:22.200 --> 01:59:27.560]   Well, what one of us is a little bit more communist and socials in the other
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:31.960]   There's it's degrees. You know, you're you're slicing the onion a little bit thick at that point
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:39.480]   mr. Alex lindsey office hours dot global is a modern miracle
[01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:42.600]   We have a lot of fun. It's
[01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:45.560]   Unbelievable what you do and if you're listening if you listen to show
[01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:51.880]   You gotta know that if you ever had a live production that you wanted to put on in the real world
[01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:58.520]   There would be no better place than 090. Media because that's where you could get Alex and his amazing team
[01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:02.200]   To support you and you would have the best production ever
[02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:05.400]   Why anybody uses anything else i'll never know
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:08.600]   Seriously, I mean
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:11.800]   We have a lot of fun. I just watch what you guys do. It's it's mind boggling
[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:16.280]   You can learn all about it. Maybe become a competitor by going office hours dot global
[02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:18.840]   I'm watching those great shows every day
[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:23.960]   You know, we we really think that I mean I really approach it as the market is about to get really big
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:28.600]   And I just want to keep you getting bigger, you know, like I'd rather have a small portion of a very fast-growing pie
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:30.440]   So we you know, so office hours
[02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:36.840]   We really lay it all out and give you every piece of information that we can about live streaming virtual production and media production
