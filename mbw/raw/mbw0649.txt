[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Andy Renee and Alex are here.
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.560]   And of course, we're all a gog about the new Apple rumors and the rumored Apple event on the 25th.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.440]   We'll try to figure out, read the tea leaves and see what's true and what's not true.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.480]   Also, a reminder, we're getting close to the end of our yearly survey period.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.640]   We'd love to know a little more about our audience.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.280]   Not you specifically, we're not collecting information about you,
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.080]   but we do want to know a little bit more about our audience.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.800]   So if you don't mind, it's completely voluntary.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.800]   Take the Twitch survey and just take a few minutes at twit.to/survey19.

[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.800]   Renee Ritchie from imore.com and the Vector Podcast.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.800]   Hello, Renee.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.800]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.800]   It's so great to be back with you here today.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.800]   Always a pleasure.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   Andy Inaco from WGBH, Public Radio in Boston.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.800]   Hi, Andy.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   Great to play the feud.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   Let's play our game.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.800]   [MUSIC]
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.800]   And now representing the Pixelcore family, Alex Lindsay.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   Hello, Alex.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   Great to have you.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800]   Good to be here.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.800]   March 25th says John Pichkowski.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.800]   Yep.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   Buzzfeeds.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   John was, of course, with recode for a long time, but he's now Buzzfeed.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.800]   How credible is this?
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   He's the only one who has it.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   He's got a good track record.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   I think someone else, I think Gurman has confirmed it now as well.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   He's got a good track record.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   The only thing that stood out at me is that usually they don't do it on a Monday
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.800]   because they want people to set up and travel on the Monday
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   and then they do it on the Tuesday.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.800]   So Monday might be a concession to how they're scheduling all those
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   celebrities they're supposed to be in.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   Well, yeah, because, and this is also, I thought, interesting.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   While we have rumors, we'll talk about those later of new Apple iPads
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   and even MacBooks, Pichkowski says, "Is the news event only?
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   There won't be product?"
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.800]   News and video, all the Hollywood streaming content, too.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   Interesting.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   So let me read the...
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   I did ask him and he said, "I said iPad Mini.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   I didn't say no.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   iPad parts that as you will."
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   And maybe that's just, you know, you never know what these events.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   Okay.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   One of the issues is going to be that as of right now,
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   according to the Wall Street Journal, Apple doesn't have a whole lot of companies
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.800]   signed up for its news product.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   Remember, Apple bought Texture, the magazine app we advertised,
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.800]   we loved, that was actually created by a number of publishers.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   But my understanding is that the acquisition of the company did not include the rights
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.800]   to the products, to the contract.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   Correct.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   So they had to renegotiate that.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   And of course, they're also going to the New York Times, the Washington Post.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.800]   And according to the Wall Street Journal, who I figure probably knows something
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   about this, I'm guessing, Apple's asking, saying, "Look, here's how it's going to work.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.800]   We're going to charge $10 a month.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.800]   We're going to take half of it right off the top.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.800]   The rest of it, we're going to divide amongst you based on engagement.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   How much time spent reading?"
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   That's not going to fly.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   No, Kafka had a really...
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.800]   That's never going to...
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.800]   Peter Kafka had a really good response, because I saw a lot of people panic initially.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   And his response was that there was a lot of interest among public...
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   There are publishers that have their own large subscription base.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.800]   But there are also publishers who don't.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   And they see Apple News as a way to go beyond whatever thousands of people go to their paper
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.800]   every day to reach the potentially hundreds of millions of people who go to the News app every day.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   It's not the same as the App Store.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   It's more like a Netflix model or an Amazon model where you're providing the destination site
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.800]   that everyone is going and then you're getting your piece of pie.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   And for sites like the New York Times, it make no sense because they make enough money on their own.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   Maybe they make enough money on their own.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.800]   But for a lot of smaller publications who don't have anywhere nearly the access to the audience,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   they are not splitting the money for subscribers.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   They are paying for access to that pool.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.800]   And Kafka says there's a lot of interest, especially when you get out of the few players
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.800]   who have made a successful bid at the subscription game into all the other ones,
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.800]   just for that to be a service for them.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.800]   I'd argue that...
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.800]   That's not how the business works.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.800]   When you're talking about the news business, you're talking about...
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.800]   You're not talking about sites, you're talking about community institutions often.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.800]   Institutions like the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald, the Chicago Sun Times, the Chicago Tribune,
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.800]   that there's very, very little interest in...
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.800]   There's not... outside of the sports page, there isn't as much interested interest in people
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.800]   from Washington State or people in London in getting local Chicago news.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.800]   However, that's a very, very big deal in Chicago.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.800]   And they have much, much better ways of monetizing that content locally than 50%.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.800]   And depends on how many people are reading your investigation into state procurement procedures.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   And the people who are the news outlets that are even smaller,
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.800]   they have even more opportunities to monetize themselves directly than to say,
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.800]   first of all, everything I do is 50% to embolden your own policies,
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   and then maybe we'll get a kickback based on how many heads we get.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   Well, we can already get that kind of deal just by hiring our own team of one or two people
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   or even doing it by ourselves.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   I don't know how well this system is going to work if they're going to stick to that kind of policy.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.800]   It might be more legacy magazine.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.800]   I think that it was only magazine to begin with.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.800]   I agree.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.800]   I agree.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   I agree that the... for the Chicago Sun Times or the New York Times or Wall Street Journal,
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   this isn't going to make any sense.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.800]   It's going to be really hard to get them to go down that path.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   A lot of them already have subscription models that are working.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.800]   A lot of them are going down that path.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.800]   But I think for a large number of magazines, the idea...
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   they've already started buying into these ideas of trying to get into a larger pool.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.800]   They may not like 50%, but I think for a lot of them, it'll pencil out.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:14.800]   And the challenge for the New York Times and for Chicago Sun Times is if I'm paying $10 a month
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.800]   and I'm getting enough, maybe not the same articles, but enough of those articles.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.800]   Is it going to be enough for me to keep on subscribing to the Wall Street Journal
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   or to the Chicago Sun Times or whatever?
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   The issue that they're going to have...
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.800]   because I think that actually the texture model or the Apple model will pencil out
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.800]   for about 85 to 90% of the publishers that are all in specific verticals,
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   rather than the Chicago Sun Times or whatever.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   The issue is for those larger publishers, once I start paying that money
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   and I'm getting enough of that news, for instance, when the New York Times started charging
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.800]   for articles and Washington Post, I didn't subscribe.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   I just went to CNN.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.800]   I was just like, "Oh, I'll just get the news from CNN."
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   I just stopped going to the other ones.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   And so...
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.800]   They're making money at them.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.800]   And Netflix went through this anyway with their catalog content versus network content.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   Like stars pulled their catalog because they weren't getting enough money,
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.800]   but Netflix is like, "Okay, well, add all these other programs instead."
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.800]   And then people stayed in Netflix and they had to start reevaluating
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.800]   what they were willing to put in Netflix to reach that audience.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.800]   Well, we don't know what the financials are for stars' decisions.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.800]   But let's also...
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:27.800]   We're not talking about things like, "Is Apple going to be so, quote, focused on privacy
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.800]   that they're not going to let the magazine or news outlet to know?
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   You're the people who are reading your articles.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   Here is for you data on how much engagement we're getting.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.800]   You're getting on piece by piece by piece.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.800]   Here's how much attention your articles are getting the moment they're posted
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   versus your archives that are that go back four or five years.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:55.800]   If Apple is going to be as stingy about readership data as for news and magazines
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.800]   as they are with developers, that's just another thing.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   That's another reason why they have to do a really hard sell to attract these people, I think.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   I've talked to...
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   When we started getting those rumors last year, at least I know a lot of people
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   who are in that business in New England, and they were telling...
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.800]   I just were just conversationally talking about what would you like to see?
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   And they're saying, "A, we need to get...
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.800]   We need to have enough money that whatever pipeline we have to install and maintain
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   is going to be worth it for our our end."
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.800]   And also, we have to know who's reading our stuff because we need to get some sort of feedback.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   A lot of the money they're putting into their own websites isn't so much driving ads,
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   so much as understanding, we need to put more money into our political coverage,
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.800]   or we need to put more money into our sports coverage because that's what people are really, really interesting.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   That's what people absolutely come to our site in order to find.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.800]   And so we're going to make sure that we take this person that we're hiring as a freelancer
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.800]   and promote them to full time because we need more on the spot coverage of this topic.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.800]   So, I know that I'm only reacting to rumors and we'll find out more about these deals
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.800]   as NDAs get broken or as people are free to talk.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:17.800]   But if this is the big deal, if Apple, I'll say speculatively, just if Apple comes to these publishers
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:23.800]   small and large with the idea of we're presenting you with an incredible opportunity,
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:28.800]   you're really quite lucky to be on board with us here to be able to get on this new service
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.800]   that for all you know only works on Apple logo luxury items.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.800]   Instead of the Android and less expensive devices and the Kindle devices
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:44.800]   that we know that most of your city readers are actually reading the sports section on,
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.800]   of course you'll take whatever deal we give you because my God, aren't you lucky?
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.800]   Well, but I mean, you look at Apple needs you.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.800]   I think that I think you're right for newspapers.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.800]   I mean, I think that that makes a lot of sense and you're trying to figure all those things out.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   But when I look at the dwindling magazine rack at Safeway or at Walmart,
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.800]   those guys are not that sophisticated.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.800]   They're doing the best they can.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.800]   They know a lot about skiing or they know a lot about guns or they know a lot about cooking.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.800]   But they, but they, I don't know if they're that sophisticated where they're really,
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   because they don't have that information now on their magazine.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   Well, there's a reason why.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   So the thing is real life magazine would have been a sweet gift for reading a V-clip.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   Someone who's thought about creating a magazine myself about AV, you know, making doing live video,
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   I would definitely do it on this on this platform, you know, because now I got,
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   now I got, now all I have to do is promote it.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   And there's a pay, there's a pay platform that's managing it.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.800]   And if Apple wants to keep 50%, it wouldn't bother me at all.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.800]   You know, and I may do that in this.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.800]   And then, and then Apple, then Apple strikes you because you decided to do a series on sexuality,
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.800]   on basically sex tips for kids who are taking sex education in schools and they say,
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.800]   no, no, no, you can't publish that.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.800]   Then the public is somewhere else.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.800]   I mean, again, Pixar does pretty well on its own.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.800]   No, you just said that you wanted to use Apple as your public platform.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   Because I would never, but if you don't get the, the other thing is I would never publish anything outside of those areas.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   I don't publish anything.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.800]   I wouldn't want my kids to read ever on Facebook, on YouTube, on anything.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   I don't even swear on it.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.800]   There's so much to the thing is that it's that that would get a strike based on stupid,
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.800]   or based on reasons that Apple is very, very conservative about that.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.800]   Now you have to deal with it.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   It's the reason why you have your own publication is so that you just, if you decide you want to run this piece,
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.800]   that piece gets run.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:32.800]   If you have to suddenly, when someone comes to you with a great idea of something that is part of the mission statement of your publication,
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:40.800]   your reaction is that I have to quickly reread our terms of service with Apple to make sure they'd be letting us publish this.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.800]   And again, this is a speculation.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.800]   I just think they're talking about the edges of a large field.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.800]   You know, like there's a big field out there that has plenty of content.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.800]   This is the field.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.800]   This is the field.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.800]   This is the field. It's a reason why Premiere Magazine is no longer publishing.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   That's because people do not buy magazines in general, not because the content is not fair.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.800]   People can go, I go to the AV club.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.800]   I don't read People Magazine.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.800]   I don't read Premiere.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   I don't read all these.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.800]   I don't read Rolling Stone.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   There's so and the publications I do read like the New Yorker.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   And they are the one and wired.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:18.800]   They're the ones who actually create really great content online that I will come directly to their sites.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:36.800]   If I'm not saying that a news app that can collect all this stuff and find a way to monetize it for all parties concerned is a bad idea, I'm just saying that Apple has to come up with an idea that is compatible with what, at least what I believe to be the priorities of people who are in publishing
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:47.800]   both the two people who are doing something online with a WordPress blog and the people who are now at the heads of a 70 year old magazine that is doing a pretty good job of pivoting to digital.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.800]   For the ones that are doing a good job pivoting to digital, that's fine.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:59.800]   But I think there's an awful lot of people who will just create literally create new magazines for this platform because they see an opportunity to get this is just the way, but the way cable worked.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:06.800]   The way cable worked was, you know, you get subs, you know, so you get paid 50 cents per subscriber or you get paid 25 cents per subscriber.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   You get paid a dollar a subscriber for HBO.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.800]   They got eight dollars.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   I think they now get $12 or something per subscriber.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.800]   It wasn't a percentage of the income from the cable network.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:30.800]   It was just, and what happened was, is you just, you got that, that per subscriber and then you made any other money on top of that with advertising or whatever you had, but people just built their little models and they built their little cable networks based on the business model that they were given.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   And so the thing is, I think that Apple, by creating, you know, they created a big app store and it created a lot of opportunity for a lot of people and I think they're going to create this and it's going to create a lot of opportunity for a lot of people and the, and the calculation that has to be made
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:15:05.800]   by the publishers is, will that group of people, the publishers that jump in as well as independent publishers that come up and do this on their own, will they, will they be able to continually out produce that large group of people that, and, and as we start to get to a point where, like, I'm not going to pay for a bunch of subscriptions to a bunch of newspapers.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   If there is a couple newspapers that cover international that are in texture or whatever Apple calls it, I'd be fine.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   Like it tells me what happened that week.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.800]   Like it's not, and so the, and the issue is Apple, you know, they don't need all the newspapers.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.800]   They need some of the newspapers to be in there.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:30.800]   And so I think that that's the challenge is, are they going to be able to out, out run something that's much more generalized and I'm not sure that they can.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:38.800]   You know, I just don't say, Diller, it was a diller this week who said that, you know, Netflix is one, the entire model has been turned upside down because they have now so much power in the industry.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.800]   Compared to where it used to live with the studios.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:50.800]   It's, it's the mistake, the mistake that, that, uh, the mistake that Hollywood made was pushing so hard on Netflix and the Netflix was like, this is not a model we can keep on going on.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   So we're going to go original.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.800]   And now they've sucked up that oxygen.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:16:02.800]   They, they, they are the ones that the people are making or hoping to get into because you're getting more eyeballs as a filmmaker on Netflix than you are doing your own release anymore.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:15.800]   And, and, and I think that that's going to be in Hollywood has lost all of its leverage, both as these other as bang keeps on turning on, whether it's Facebook, YouTube, um, Netflix, Amazon, Apple as they all come on.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:30.800]   And Hollywood has completely lost all of their, uh, the, and the artists actually, the directors, the artists, the actors, they actually have a lot of leverage, you know, because they're now the most important, but it's all the industries in between are gone.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.800]   And I think that that could happen to publishers as well.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.800]   Do you think that Apple will make this a multi platform product?
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.800]   No, absolutely not.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   And I wouldn't care.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.800]   Death.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.800]   All the money.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.800]   They do with Apple music though.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   I mean, I'm caught halfway here because Apple music, you know, they, they, they continue the Android app and texture.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.800]   They already canceled the Windows 10 app for texture, you know, wamp, wamp, but they've kept the Android app going.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:10.800]   And while they retrofit texture into news for iOS and the Mac, they could retrofit news into texture for Android because if they are going for audience and they're monetizing and selling based on audience size, then just like with Apple music.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.800]   And when they're selling family plans with multi device, you know, you want to support as many devices as possible.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.800]   So I think this one is less clear cut than like I mess interest.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.800]   I hope, I hope it's multi platform.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.800]   That's, that's, that's funny behind it.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.800]   They seem real happy with multi platform when there's money behind it.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   Again, soccer, football, internet football is, and I mean, like soccer is, is there, I'm always surprised by how much of the, how much of these decisions about broadcasting and publishing is based on.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:49.800]   The making sure you have an availability to broadcast soccer because if you cannot, that people are looking for soccer scores, they're looking for FIFA results.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.800]   And if you can't get it on your device, they're not interested in it.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.800]   So they're going to put iTunes on Samsung.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.800]   I mean, that's a big indicator of their cross platform.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:02.800]   Leo iTunes for ties and I still am not over this.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.800]   So we all will see what happens March 25th.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.800]   Apple's obviously, if that's the, if that's the actual deadline, they have one month to figure it, figure this out.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.800]   They don't want to launch.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.800]   I would bet they don't want to watch a news product that doesn't have New York times in the Washington Post in it.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   But honestly, 50% is the launch.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.800]   Honestly, 50% is is just what they're saying.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   I mean, they could obviously back down.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.800]   And just with the daily, remember that, assesses so far.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   In fact, we were talking about this on Sunday on Twit with somebody who had worked for the daily.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:46.800]   And Sam Mashkovitz, and yeah, he understood what the risks were.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   What Kafka says, and I think this actually makes a lot of sense.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.800]   He quotes a publishing executive, says, "Percentage is meaningless.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.800]   It's the absolute dollars paid out that matters.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:02.800]   And if we make more money giving Apple 50%, then we would make not giving Apple 50%.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.800]   We're going to give Apple 50%.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.800]   And I think that's really the calculus.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.800]   Nobody's looking at a percentage.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.800]   Those are the fighting words you throw out.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:15.800]   But they're looking at that as what the, and so the calculus they have to make is does Apple bring us enough viewers to make up for it?
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:24.800]   Well, what Kafka says, excuse me, what Kafka is saying is that magazine publishers are going along with it, as you said, and Alex and any.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.800]   But newspaper guys are less excited about it.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   But I'll tell you the real risk.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:42.800]   And I don't think Apple's thought this through of incentivizing engagement is that a lot of publishers will be encouraged to publish Linkbait because they make more money on Linkbait.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.800]   We already have that problem.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   Let's not make it worse, Apple.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.800]   This is your opportunity not to do that.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.800]   Absolutely.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.800]   We'll see.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.800]   You know, Apple's not going to announce a product that isn't done.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.800]   So March 25th is probably a soft date.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.800]   That's the beauty of doing it at your own campus.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.800]   Well, Jennifer, Aniston and Reese with a spoon beyond stage Leo because that's all we're really.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.800]   That's a done deal.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   And that's the thing.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.800]   They own that stuff.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.800]   I'm more interested in what the shape of this Apple product is.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   Is it a single subscription?
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:14.800]   As you said, a multi-platform subscription so that you get music, you get services.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.800]   Wouldn't it be great to have one price like an Amazon prime?
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.800]   Apple prime.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   Apple prime.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.800]   Everything including I-
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   There's so many subscriptions now.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.800]   I'm buried under subscription.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.800]   That's what people want.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.800]   And that may be part of the Apple's calculus with 50% because they may be saying, well,
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.800]   we're going to allot this percentage of the overall.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.800]   Maybe it is a 90 or $100 a year subscription.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.800]   We're going to put $10 a month.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.800]   Well, that doesn't make sense, does it?
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   If it's 10 dollars a month, it's more than two terabytes of out-cloud storage.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   How about that?
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.800]   Oh, and that somebody called me on the radio show this weekend and said, I've used up the
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.800]   two terabytes.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   Where can I get more?
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.200]   There was someone on Reddit today with that too.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.200]   You're clouding it wrong.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   It was all photographs.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.000]   There's no, you should never have more than two terabytes in the cloud.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   That's crazy.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.500]   This was all two, so two terabytes of photos on Reddit that they were talking about.
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.600]   If you're going to put it in the cloud, put it in Glacier.
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.040]   I told them, get two synologies.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.200]   Have one at work and one at home and then you've got it.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.200]   Absolutely.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.200]   I mean, that's crazy.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.000]   I had a real tense moment where I had set up my new hard drive.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.400]   This was a couple months ago, did not notice that by default, when I reinstalled the OS
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.600]   that I photo syncing had been turned on.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.000]   And why am I suddenly like have no space left?
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Oh, it's because it's synced 200 gigabytes of photos.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.680]   And so I had that tense moment where it's like, I'm just going to turn off iCloud syncing
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.160]   and then delete my iPhoto library locally because I don't need it because I don't use
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:41.080]   that for major storage and thinking, now, please, iCloud, don't take this as a sign that I
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.280]   want you to delete all of my iCloud photos from everywhere.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:52.080]   I just don't want to have 230 gigabytes of photos from every single iPad and iPhone I've
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.200]   tested since 2008, please.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.360]   So many screenshots.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.360]   So many screenshots.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.480]   Yeah, so God.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:04.440]   So let's take a break and then we come back to the prospects that Apple will release or
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.320]   introduce new hardware, maybe not at this event, but that's unclear.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.440]   In and around it?
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:15.440]   Maybe they'll have a, I don't know, an auxiliary event in the lobby.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.720]   You know, they could.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.520]   They haven't used a top off.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.080]   They haven't used in the Steve Jobs Theater.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.080]   You have this incredible upstairs space, right?
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.400]   And they could do demos there.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.480]   They haven't used that.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.080]   So maybe there's a way to, you know, do the news event in the downstairs.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.520]   Everybody sees Jennifer Aniston and Oprah.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.800]   And then they come upstairs and look.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.700]   There's new iPads and you get an iPad and you get an iPad and you and you and you are
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.480]   showed a brought to you by fresh books.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:52.360]   Now, if you're in business for yourself, you probably feel as I did at the end of the
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:57.080]   month, when you have to sit down, fire up word and excel and make invoices.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.880]   It was never fun, never fun.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.720]   In fact, so unfun that I often put it off.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.960]   Do you ever put off paying bills?
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.960]   Same thing, right?
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.960]   Put it off.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.040]   I'll do this next month.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.720]   But I did find out pretty quickly, if you don't send out your invoices, you don't get
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.720]   paid.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.000]   So that wasn't a tenable situation.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.320]   That's when Amber MacArthur told me about a brand new startup in Toronto at the time
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.000]   called Fresh Books.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.680]   And here we are more than a decade later and it's going strong.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.680]   It's so great.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.240]   It changed my, it actually made me look forward to doing invoicing.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.760]   First of all, it makes it super easy to make professional invoices.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.400]   It did for me, it was, you know, I had currency conversion because it was in Canadian bucks
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.800]   and I had all these expenses I had to get in.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.800]   They made it so easy.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.440]   I could easily import all my expense receipts using the Fresh Books app.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.280]   I'd take a picture, put it in the invoice and all of a sudden, you know, boom, it's
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.760]   in there.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.200]   Plus there was a pay me now button.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.960]   When you do Fresh Books, you automatically can take online payments, which means your
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.200]   clients can pay you right through the invoice instantly.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.680]   Turns out that's such a, they don't like paying invoices anymore than you like sending
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.680]   them.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.400]   So, boom to them, you get paid on average twice as fast.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.280]   That's an actual stat from Fresh Books.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.240]   Twice as fast.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.240]   That's awesome.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:16.200]   You can always see which invoices were sent, which were viewed, which were paid and which
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.640]   haven't been paid yet.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.520]   And you can automatically send out reminders.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.920]   It's really fantastic.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:29.000]   Plus, it turns out in the process of sending out these invoices and getting in the expenses,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:36.240]   actually generating real entry, double entry accounting books.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.680]   So without knowing how to do books, you're doing the standard industry standard accounting.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.840]   You don't need to know it.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.960]   It just does it, which means you can quickly generate and access accounting, real accounting
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.920]   reports like general ledger and balance sheets in the dashboard.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.280]   Your tax person, and if it's you, you will love this.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:02.680]   Now, it's too late for this year, but now's the time to sign up 30 days free freshbooks.com/macbreak.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.360]   It'll simplify your whole life.

[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.320]   They're constantly adding new features like proposals that you can send out to your clients
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.040]   that they can sign with an e-signature.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.440]   Yes, you get that capability as part of the plan too.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:22.680]   You can automatically update expenses daily in bulk or just upload the picture of receipt,
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.320]   your choice.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.920]   It integrates with everything you use, a QUTI scheduling, pie sync, mail chimp, Everlance,
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.040]   I can go on and on and on.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.400]   Freshbooks has a great mobile app that lets you keep track of what's going on at all times.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.280]   And because they have this kind of great feedback loop with their listeners, they recently redesigned
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.000]   the Freshbooks time tracking experience.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.880]   So you can log time for the week much faster.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.200]   Each product gets its own line.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:54.040]   The days sub tab now displays detailed entries of client, project and service, in list form,
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.920]   no more confusion regarding each block of time.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.680]   Their support team is available 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time, and they're great too,
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.680]   by the way.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.680]   Nice Taranans.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.680]   Taran-Tonians?
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.600]   How do you say that, Renee?
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:06.600]   Taran-Tonians.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.600]   Taran-Tonians.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.760]   And a video of is available 24/7.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.760]   Or Tarana, if you want to be like all the time.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.840]   They're from the big smokers.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.040]   Avoid the tax times cramble next year.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.080]   I definitely don't think they call them that.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.680]   Update the Freshbooks for effortless invoicing and accounting.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:27.800]   And as I said, 30 days free freshbooks.com/macbreak.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.920]   If you would though, put Macbreak weekly in the How Did You Hear About a section.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.560]   And that way we'll get credit for it.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.560]   Freshbooks.com/macbreak.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:38.960]   Thank you so much.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.280]   I swear to God, when he said Taran-Tonians, I thought you were talking about like either
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.640]   Dune or Game of Thrones or something.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.680]   No, that's a rakus.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.680]   The Fremen.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.680]   And the Benet Jezzeret.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.680]   And the Sha'helub.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.680]   Why don't you call yourself Toto?
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.680]   So I wouldn't be great.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.680]   You got all those Dune names down.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.680]   Really good.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.680]   Oh, it's one of my favorite books Leo.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.680]   I listened to the audible.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.680]   I was going to say you must have listened to the audio version.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.680]   I read it.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.680]   I never knew how to say Shahulub or Benet Jezzeret or Sarda Car or any of that stuff.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.680]   So good.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.680]   When you read the book, you don't know.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.680]   And then you have it in your head.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.680]   And then you'll see a movie where you hear the author talk about it and go, what is that?
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.680]   Wait.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.680]   Oh, that's how it's pronounced.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.680]   I'm going to say it's a minute.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:25.680]   Are you telling me that Kyle McClacken is the Benet Jezzeret Sha'helub?
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.680]   He's Moa Deeb.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.680]   He's Moa Deeb.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.680]   That can't be.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.680]   That's Haderach.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.680]   Wow, you know all those.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.680]   Did you read them all though?
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.680]   I mean, really, I only read the first one.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.680]   They're not all great.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.680]   The first one is really the masterpiece.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.680]   The first one is a masterpiece and should just stand by itself.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.680]   Right?
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.680]   There are a few series like that.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.680]   And you must, as a writer, I have, it must be a weird feeling to know that you've done
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.680]   like a singular masterpiece in your life.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.680]   And then you try to do like more of them and it's like, ah, not quite.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.680]   I've already done that one.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.680]   Apple has responded.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:03.680]   Remember the Google Pixel ads taking on weirdly the iPhone 10?
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.680]   Not the 10s, the 10, right?
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.680]   I don't get that.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.680]   Will Apple's new ad, I think, responds.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.680]   So cute, best friend.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.680]   Wait, who's that nerd out there in the background?
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.680]   Did you boca my child?
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.680]   Just totally unintentional.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.680]   Why do you hate Jacob?
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.680]   What?
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.680]   No, look, I can unboca.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.680]   See?
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.680]   Boca unboca.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.680]   Wow.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.680]   [Laughter]
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.680]   I'm not a person boca's a child.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.680]   [Laughter]
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.680]   It's so good.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.680]   It is what kind of person boca's a child?
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.680]   Oh my gosh.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.680]   It's kind of person boca's a child.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.680]   Don't you boca me and not go.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.680]   By the way, everybody tells me I say it wrong when I say boca.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.680]   They say, no, it's boca.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.680]   It's boca.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.680]   It's now boca because Apple says it's boca.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.680]   Okay, resident to lady the house speaking.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.680]   It's like gift or gift.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.680]   I don't know if it's gift or gift.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:05.680]   I always say boca, not because I think it's correct because if I say boca, people think
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.680]   of a bunch of flowers.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.680]   I've only ever heard boca.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.680]   It's boca or boca.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.680]   Boca.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.680]   So Scott Borne and others have said, no, no, no, it's boca.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.680]   I thought Scott said it was boca.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.680]   But isn't that B-aprostophy okay?
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.680]   That's like boca.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.680]   I'll be there.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.680]   Boca?
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.680]   Okay.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:26.680]   Will somebody in China, oh, it's Japanese, right?
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:30.680]   Will somebody in Japan tell us, is it boca, boca?
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.680]   What do you say?
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.680]   I'm going to say boca now because Apple's--
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.680]   Which dialect?
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.680]   Phil Schill is like boca.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.680]   I'm just saying.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.680]   The funny thing now is that it is now boca because no one knew what it was.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.680]   Boca now.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.680]   For everyone who didn't know what boca--
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.680]   And that's the whole point of this-- which by the way, it's brilliant.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.680]   It's a makeup boca like a boca.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.080]   You're trying to sell-- if you're trying to sell boca to people who are buying phones
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.680]   and why it's important, what you have to do first is educate them on what it is.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.680]   What the hell is boca?
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.680]   I was--
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.680]   That's a surprise.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.680]   That's a surprise.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.680]   Me too.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.680]   It was awesome.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.680]   You bocayed my child.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.680]   You bockered my child.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.080]   It works on so many levels because it does have that virality of like using the boca thing.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.080]   It's brilliant.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.080]   Who bockered my child?
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:13.360]   Well, let's not pivot away from the central question.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.080]   Why do we hate Jacob?
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.080]   Because--
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:21.080]   There's just something you instinctively don't-- he's like a little bit shifty.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.080]   Such a good attitude.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.080]   I guess it's like--
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:27.360]   Like he'll put his thumb in like all the cakes at the cafeteria to make sure that no one
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.360]   else gets one.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.760]   I guess you look at it and say, "Wow, Apple's brave," right?
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:37.720]   Because that's just feel like a brave thing to focus on or unfocus on as the case may
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.720]   be.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.720]   Right.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.720]   But actually, it's actually kind of brilliant.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.120]   I feel like the ad company said we've got to show them this.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.960]   It's an ad you want to show other people, which is the best kind of ad.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.520]   You want to go show it to all your friends.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.520]   Really, it's fun.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:53.080]   And now you start looking at like, "Oh, do I have the ability to do that or not?"
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:58.880]   It becomes the big question for people who own iPhones and for people who own older and
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.640]   more Android, I mean, I think a lot of the new Android and all the new iPhones will do
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.640]   it.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:08.400]   So my question of the day is, "What the hell's Ming Chi Quo smoking?"
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.320]   His new rumor is, well, to say the least, the little odd.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.320]   But maybe--
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.320]   Which one were you-- there were so many.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.680]   16-inch MacBook Pro?
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.720]   Just imagine a 15-inch with almost no bezel.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.720]   That's what it is, right?
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.640]   It's the same size as a 15, but they've just eliminated the bezel.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:31.160]   He also says that the new iPad will be bigger too because eliminating the bezel, it'll
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:35.960]   be 10.2, though, not 10.5, like the old iPad Pro, which is now 11.
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.920]   But instead, it'll be 10.2 because I have to remember all of these numbers.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   It's like we're going to have to--
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.920]   That's true again.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:45.320]   He also-- I mean, yes, he has quite a few rumors.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.320]   There will be--
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.320]   He has to play the Olio.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.320]   Can we just put it on the watch?
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.320]   6K monitor.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:55.600]   6K by 3K, which is 2.1, which is super interesting.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.000]   2.1 aspect ratio.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   What is 2.1?
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Yeah, 2.1 is zero reason to do that.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.720]   2.1 is like, well, all the new flagship phones are 2 by 1.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.720]   And I don't know.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.600]   Alex might know, like, if that's better for cinematography or--
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.600]   I don't know.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.600]   No, I don't know.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.480]   But unless his numbers are wrong because 6K by 3K could mean something other than what
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.760]   we're interpreting it as.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.960]   I mean, it is a-- I don't know if it's any better.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.200]   I mean, people will say, 2.35 versus 1.85 is usually the two arguments, right?
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.680]   2.35 and 1.85 are usually the things that people worry about there.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:30.840]   I do think that it's interesting that Apple would possibly do a display.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:36.840]   I think there's an opportunity-- there's a business opportunity for Apple to create
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.800]   glass-to-glass hardware encryption.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.680]   And you would need to own a monitor to do that.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.440]   That means that if you want to stream something, it's your corporation.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:48.520]   The only people that have glass-to-glass encryption is the military.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:54.840]   And so the ability to say only these things can consent and only these things can receive.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.080]   And there's a piece of hardware that makes sure that no one else can-- the best you can
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.400]   do is shoot a video of it.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:04.400]   It would be extremely valuable to the entertainment industry and extremely valuable to corporations.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:09.840]   And so Apple's-- the only part that they don't control to do that would be the monitor.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.480]   So it would be interesting to see them to go back to that.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:16.920]   Also, micro LED, which would be interesting too because it gives you like OLED style
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.800]   deep, deep blacks without all the mitigations you have to do for OLED, especially at larger
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.800]   sizes.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.480]   Yeah, that can be monumentally expensive though.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.480]   I love it.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.480]   Andy, we want to--
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.480]   But they'll end.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:34.760]   But as soon as I said that I realized, but the people who want micro LED will spend $15,000
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.560]   for a display because they'll make $20,000 for every--
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.000]   What would drive it though?
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.640]   Because like 6K is-- we already had trouble driving 5K.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.760]   Apple had to make a custom teak-on to drive a 5K display.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.720]   Intel has not seen fit to push out new display ports, new Thunderbolt 4.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.480]   I don't even think it's a thing yet because there's no PCIe 4.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.520]   So I'm super interested just in how they're going to implement all this if it's--
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.520]   Which would you need?
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.320]   Do you think would you need Thunderbolt 4?
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.680]   You could do it on Thunderbolt 3?
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.200]   I don't think it's 60 frames per second.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.920]   Could you do 6K 60 frames per second on Thunderbolt 3?
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.920]   I think you can.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.920]   I think it's enough.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.000]   It depends on whether it's compressed or not compressed.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   That's very interesting.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.920]   Of course it'll be expensive and presumably paired with a new Mac Pro, which, quote, says
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.920]   would be modular.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.720]   Well, in 30--
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.680]   Thunderbolt 3 is 40 gig.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.680]   Is that right?
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:36.320]   And so 12G, that's 12 gig, is that's 4K 60.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:41.240]   So it would be-- I can't do it in my head, but it would be probably-- they still have
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.600]   a lot of head room on Thunderbolt 3 to be able to still do that video.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:49.880]   So what do you think?
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.480]   $10,000 starting point?
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.480]   Anything for the monitor?
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.240]   No, no, for the Mac Pro plus--
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:59.520]   It was a real interesting weird rumor on Telosive Tech, which is a show that Drew
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:03.200]   hosts where he said that his source told him that it was literally modular.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.160]   Like you'd buy a brain that had the CPU and the RAM, the memory in it, and you could
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.160]   buy other modules.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.840]   Like an expanded story module and stack it on top with a proprietary connector.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:16.080]   And then you could buy another one like a SCSI or a-- what's it called?
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.760]   The other storage protocol connector.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.880]   And you could stick that on top and it would be almost like a Lego structure.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.880]   I think some parts you wanted.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.320]   I think making it really easy to change and having it be.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:32.960]   To me, the form factor for this is a 3U computer that you can take the ears off and then you
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.480]   can set it up and it looks pretty.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:40.080]   But most importantly for professionals, you can put it into a-- easily into a rack mount.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:45.000]   I mean, that is like a huge piece of why we get-- as a professional, why we get it.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Not as goofy, I want to put it on my computer.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.640]   That's why everyone has those Mac minis is because you put two of them in one U. And so
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:57.000]   I think that having a 3U solution that is then super easy to open up and change and
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.440]   move around and add things to would be a really great setup.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.640]   I think 3U is the minimum.
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:08.480]   You could go higher, but I think 3U is because of the way you set cards into it.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.480]   You would limit it if you go any smaller than 3U.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.120]   So intriguing.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:19.520]   I love this slide that Ming Chi Kuo prepared for his TF International Securities.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.600]   It's got the pig for the year of the pig.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:22.600]   The pig.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.080]   It's got some balloons.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:27.640]   I guess this is his Chinese New Year's.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.480]   And Western people lost their mind.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.480]   Why is it so ugly?
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.480]   Why does it look like this?
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.720]   It's not like Apple aesthetic.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:38.800]   It's not like this is how you look in a nice noisy, loud Chinese cultural way.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.600]   That notch is freaking me out, man.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.640]   It does have a notch, doesn't it?
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.640]   Do not just.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.120]   It's really a scroll holding a card.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:51.920]   It looks like two second half of 19, obviously the normal time, September timeframe iPhone
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.920]   models.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.920]   I will just go through this one by one.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.120]   And before we do credible, right?
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:02.680]   Ming Chi Kuo has supply chain sources that usually mean he's pretty accurate.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.960]   Has he had any big misses lately?
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.480]   I think he said a few things that ended up getting delayed or didn't.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.080]   Because the further out you project, the more these things are subject to change.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:18.760]   But he has ways of getting people to share data from the supply chain and manufacturing
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:22.160]   for his clients that are proven highly successful.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:27.600]   So 6.5, these are the three models of iPhone, 6.5 inches.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.440]   These are the same sizes existing.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.840]   5.8.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.840]   Those are the OLEDs.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.840]   6.1 LCD.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.160]   That's exactly like what we have right now.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.360]   It's like iPhone 6, 6, 7, and 8.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.360]   They're all built off the same platform.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.520]   So somewhat the same platform, same notch area, he says, they're not going to do the
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.600]   whole punch Samsung will announce on Wednesday.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:50.680]   No USB C yet, according to Ming Chi Kuo, we'll still be lightning.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:56.160]   That's probably really the only question mark at this point for the new iPhones.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.000]   He says the upgrades will be what's UWB?
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.200]   Ultra-wide, so that's the indoor navigation system that I don't think has been standardized
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.200]   yet.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:09.080]   But basically it's a positioning system for interiors, the way that we have GPS and
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.000]   glow and ass and everything for exteriors.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   Frosted glass casing.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.240]   That's because the design will be the same.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.240]   So you've got to give them a new color and you look like you've got to do it.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.560]   That's on the back, right?
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.120]   That's just, yeah.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.720]   Bilateral wireless charging, what that means, you can charge your phone from a phone.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.400]   Yeah, although that doesn't work.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:31.160]   I've tried the Android ones and you get like 1% and it shuts off after 15 minutes.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.120]   But if you put your AirPods on it, those are so tiny and they don't need that much
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.000]   charge, there's probably a very effective way of topping up your AirPods if you want.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.440]   Face ID, we already have that.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.760]   What does he mean face ID?
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.760]   That's not...
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.760]   Better flood illuminators, it'll work better in brighter light.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.520]   Better face ID, okay.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:51.960]   Better battery and three, not two, but three cameras.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.800]   Everybody's going multi-cam.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.960]   Yeah, telephoto, wide angle, ultra-wide angle, which I'm super happy about because you can
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.120]   do a lot of things with that third camera, but ultra-wide is what I really want to see.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:04.680]   And forming Chicoa's customers, this actually is the key, is key suppliers.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.480]   That's who's going to be making it.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.480]   That's who's paying for all this.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.720]   That's what gives him credibility, as he knows.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.880]   These are the people who are his sources probably, right?
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:19.320]   The iPad, they will do an existing panel size of 9.7 upgraded to 10.2 because of the small
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.320]   bezels.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.800]   So this will be an iPad standard, right?
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:27.920]   The new iPad Mini comes with an upgraded AP, Access.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.920]   That's a silicon.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.920]   No, silicon.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.520]   So it's going to be the same form factor and new silicon.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.720]   New silicon, okay.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.360]   So they were not going to get rid of the button?
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.680]   Apparently not.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.680]   Not for the Mini.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.840]   No, I don't think they've upgraded those to the new design language yet.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.560]   The 16 to 16 1/2 inch MacBook Pro, you explained that one, Renee.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.480]   I'm glad you did that.
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.760]   That's just bezel-less, 15 inch bezel-less.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:50.760]   The Mac.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.760]   Look at the gram, right?
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.760]   The gram makes the gram.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.080]   Those computers are getting real interesting.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.680]   There's some beautiful new, almost bezel-less display.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.680]   Big computer, yeah.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:02.920]   A Mac Pro and a 31 1/2 inch 6 by 3 monitor.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.600]   That'll be really amazing.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:09.080]   Plus the new 13 inch MacBook Pro will go all the way up to 32 gigs finally instead of
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.800]   the 16-1, 2 before.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.280]   That's good.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:16.000]   Although I like my 15, I just gave it to my son because he's going to do more video
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   editing.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   That's awesome.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.240]   That i9 is really, I always like that.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.240]   So, it's a simple, well, extend.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:27.840]   He says, he doesn't look like a new Apple watch, but just new ceramic casing design.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.720]   They don't do ceramic this year.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:30.720]   No.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.280]   So that's going to come back.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.280]   That's nice.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.240]   I like the ceramic because I like to spend money for no apparent reason.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:39.200]   I'm surprised I haven't done more with ceramic casing.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:44.400]   There's so much they can do with style, with colors, patterns, textures that are when I
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.600]   saw the idea of having frosted glass, that's kind.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:53.920]   It's not a problem, but I've seen other products that try to use frosted glass.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:58.360]   And when you get into a high contact sort of device, something you're putting in your
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:03.880]   pocket or fumbling with a lot, it's a lot of sections of that frosted glass turn into
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.600]   polished glass.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.520]   And that it winds up looking really, really crappy.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.680]   It also picks up scratches pretty quickly.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:11.680]   Rest.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:17.240]   That's a harder, that's an easier problem to solve with ceramic than with glass.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:24.080]   It's curious that they didn't make a ceramic this year, although it got me off of my ceramic
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   kit.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.080]   I could have just been a new design.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.160]   If they could have been a new one every year, it's just me spending money for absolutely
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.160]   no purpose.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.160]   That's why I buy the cheapest one every single time.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.160]   That's what I'm going to start doing.
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.160]   I think they're Nike.
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.160]   It's not worth it.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.200]   I just think I'm going Nike from now on.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:44.960]   If they come up with a ceramic case phone that has the same little blue flowers of my
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.760]   mom's casserole dishes, I totally switching back.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.080]   I guarantee it.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.080]   The casserole phone.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.120]   Oh, I forget what those are called, but that's epic.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:56.800]   ECG support more countries.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:01.920]   And probably the only other one that's kind of of interest is that he says mass shipments
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.840]   of air power and the new air pods will start in the first half.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.920]   So by June.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.920]   And then you iPod with the upgraded silicon as well.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:13.000]   But that's mostly because Apple Apple will say we have customers who really love it.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.120]   So we want to make sure that they have a version that is still as high performance and will
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.040]   be compatible for a few more years.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.960]   No, I think that's a good idea.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.960]   You know who uses it?
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:22.960]   Kids.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.960]   I was going to say I love the other one.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:25.960]   Developers.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:26.960]   Really?
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:27.960]   Why?
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:28.960]   Just to have an eyes phone.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.880]   It's an easy way to carry it with you and test out betas and to deal with a bunch of
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:32.880]   stuff.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:39.280]   Are we thinking like the classic iPod touch, which is basically a standard sized iPhone
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.200]   without a radios in it?
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:46.400]   Or are we talking or are we thinking about the smaller sized touch based iPod that we
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.560]   as a still one on the on the price books?
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.360]   But I think only.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.640]   I think it's just exactly the last iPod touch with new silicon in it.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.440]   It's really it's really it's an experience to give their kids.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.440]   With a subscription to a phone.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.800]   Well, well, also there you know if Apple would never do this, I'm not suggesting they
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.480]   should it would be silly from the do this.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:14.920]   But if they literally created an iPhone 8 or even an iPhone 10 that was I got the cameras
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.240]   I was able to run iOS software.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:21.200]   It's just a little bit it's just cheaper and I don't have to I don't have to pay a contract
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.800]   in order to use it.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:28.160]   That'd be really interesting just as like a $500 $400 pocket camera that has all these
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:33.120]   really good iOS editing tools on it and the ability to connect by a Wi-Fi to tether with
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.440]   my real phone.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.840]   That would be really interesting.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:36.840]   It would be silly.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.000]   I know it's be silly.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.120]   This is an Andy sort of product anything else.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.480]   But that's exactly what my kids.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:49.280]   And even an iPod touch if it had the right features that would make that would get me
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:54.160]   really interested just as a dedicated media device that doesn't have to take up so I
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.880]   can keep everything that I want on my movies and on my music to the playlist without having
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:05.080]   to without having to tie up any data on any storage on my real phone.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:09.800]   And at the right price, I'm surprised at how interested I would get between between an
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.880]   iPod touch and an iPad new iPad mini.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:18.640]   This might be my finally iOS might finally take back all the turf at lost to Android
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.520]   a few years ago for me.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:25.640]   This is the LG gram by the way just to give you something to get your mouth watering.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:33.720]   This is a three pound 17 inch laptop 2560 by 1600 almost bezelless display with a with
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.360]   a numeric keypad.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.720]   It lapped up with a new Merrick keypad.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.520]   It has a numeric keypad.
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.040]   But look how thin it has.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.200]   It looks gravity.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.920]   It looks like it really looks like a 17 inch MacBook Air.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.920]   Frankly.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.000]   I mean, that's exactly what it looks like.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.640]   USB accepted has ports.
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.640]   Type A ports.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.440]   That's kind of weird.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.720]   Type A personality.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.880]   I would rather have a card reader than a type a port.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:02.880]   Same.
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:07.480]   Micro SD, which is technically a card, I think.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.440]   No camera I use as micro SD card.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.200]   You can just drop a micro SD to adaptor and call it thing.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.200]   I would much rather see an SD card adaptor.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.200]   But you're right.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.160]   I don't know why SD is suddenly a little bit of a parab.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:28.120]   I think that if you have enough, especially on a device of that size, why cheap out on
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:34.080]   a micro SD when if you give me a regular size high speed SD port, I can certainly put
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.480]   a micro SD card into an adapter.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.520]   And if I put the full size SD card into my regular camera, I'm going to have fewer problems
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.720]   with it than if I use an adapter.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:48.760]   I'm just that's that's one thing that I'm really, really sorry to go because I'm I now
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:53.320]   have to carry two different SD card adapters as part of my everyday carry on my laptop
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.320]   bags and it seems.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:59.320]   I wanted that I would have stuck with compact flash or or something.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:05.320]   Mavic keep a box of three and a half inch floppies zip drive.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:11.440]   I actually I actually have a digital music player that uses the the uses the Bernoulli
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.240]   click like the tiny, tiny little version of the Bernoulli drive.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.760]   We just like, Oh my God, camera.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.400]   I just I just need a camera that will use my side quest.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.400]   That's that's what I'm going to do.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.400]   Yes.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:27.400]   So, Renee, you talked a little bit about this iPad or air power.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:34.880]   I should say, the rumors keep getting stronger that we're going to finally, finally see this.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:35.880]   You think?
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:40.000]   Yeah, I mean, it sounds like they've come up with a new design that mitigates the heat
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.920]   issues by readjusting the way the coils are dispersed and getting a little bit thicker
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:44.920]   and things like that.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.800]   And so, I mean, it it'd be a shame if we never got it.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.960]   I don't know how many people would be interested in it.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:53.320]   You know, at this price and with what it does, but it Apple did show it off and they
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.320]   got to ship it.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.880]   They'd also have to ship new air air pod holder, right?
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.240]   That's got wireless built in.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.280]   I mean, that's supposed to come with the new AirPods and you're supposed to be able to
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:09.200]   get a separate one, at least if it's the same story that it was a year and a half ago,
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.120]   you're supposed to be able to get a separate one if you want it for your existing AirPods.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:16.040]   I guess they wouldn't bundle it with the air power because not everybody has AirPods.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.040]   No.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.040]   Okay.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.040]   It's weird, isn't it?
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:24.120]   There's separate pieces of technology.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.920]   You have the charger, which a lot of people are going to want.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:31.000]   You have the case, the charging case, which people will want, even if they don't want
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.240]   to buy Apple's charger, they still will want to be able to toss them to a cheap pad.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:41.120]   And then you have the possibility of upgraded AirPods themselves, which given that the
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:46.480]   Apple went from essentially having the truly wireless earbuds market totally to themselves,
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:50.760]   now there are a few other makers who are making really, really good truly wireless
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.760]   earbuds.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:56.320]   It's really, I'm really keen to see what Apple will do to say, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   you're nice.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.320]   You're adorable.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.640]   It's adorable that you're making these, but watch how an expert does it.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:04.920]   Because this is the, it's one of the best products they've ever made, which makes me
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.960]   super excited to see what they're going to do with the next version of it.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:12.440]   But again, who's going to upgrade at this?
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.680]   Is everybody going to upgrade everything at the same time?
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:19.760]   Or are they going to, if Apple gives them the choice of just getting a new battery case,
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:22.440]   will they say, ah, this will do it for me just for now?
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.240]   We all lost our AirPods.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.640]   We lose them every month anyway, Andy's.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:26.720]   We have to keep buying you one.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.680]   So we'll just buy the ones with the new case.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.320]   I'm on my third set.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.200]   That's not too bad.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:35.440]   I've got, I've got two sets of, of the ear, AirPods.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.160]   I just have one case.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.120]   That's good.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.560]   I misplaced the case somewhere.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:42.560]   That's weird, but it's good.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.560]   I don't know where I put the case.
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.560]   At least you have the AirPods.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:46.560]   I didn't know that I couldn't find where to put the case.
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:47.560]   I don't know what happened.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.800]   I did a speculative video yesterday where I talked about when, you know, the Apple Watch
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.840]   is becoming almost as good as the iPhone.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.920]   And eventually the AirPods will be almost as good as the Apple Watch.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:59.520]   And I'll have tiny 6G modems in them and they'll build a stream, Apple music and stream
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.160]   AR directions and work outs.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.160]   And you'll have like legitimate ear computers.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:07.960]   And I don't know if that's five years away or longer, but I'm just, I cannot wait for
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:08.960]   that reality to be.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.960]   You know, that was, that was a really good piece.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.040]   And I think that it's even closer than that.
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:19.000]   The Apple Watch has the ability to connect to the internet via basically keeping an eye
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.800]   on a phone that's docked back at home.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:28.320]   All you really need is your voice assistant and the ability to, to enable to flip a switch
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:34.320]   on the phone and say, yes, by all means, give me proactive alerts, not just, not just system
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.840]   alerts, not just application alerts.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:40.000]   But if my voice assistant thinks that it needs to remind me that, oh, geez, it's kind
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   of rain in three hours.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.200]   You really need to know that.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:46.240]   You're, hey, this is, there's a situation happening that you need to be, need to be,
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:51.120]   be advised of, or just the simple idea of tapping your ear and keep, and taking a note
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.160]   of putting a reminder to yourself.
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:55.920]   I really think that we are seeing augmented reality.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:59.800]   The only thing that we're not, both with Google and Apple, we're seeing all the features
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:04.080]   of an unreleased augmented reality headset.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.920]   They just don't have the hardware yet, but they've got the software nearly done and they've
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.920]   already released them as discrete features for our earbuds and for our phones.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:16.480]   I have to say it's gotten way too complicated.
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:17.480]   I know.
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:22.280]   Kerry, AirPods with me, which by the way, I've printed in big letters, my name on.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.280]   Right, right.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:27.040]   Because they all look the same and we have, we have a many AirPods floating around.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.040]   I never know.
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.040]   Are these the ones?
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.040]   And I have to pair it to figure it out.
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.800]   I also have the Jabra, which do the same thing.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.120]   They're also, you know, wireless in ear.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.920]   More than you have ears, no Leo.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.360]   Well, I don't know why.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:44.400]   And then truthfully, most of the time I go to my headphone pack, which is just jammed
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:48.120]   because it has all the dongles.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:53.200]   It has Type C. It has dongles for Type C, lightning.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.120]   And it's just, I got two.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.120]   It's ridiculous.
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:57.120]   Ridiculous.
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:02.760]   Last month, I finally had to solve a problem by buying like three or four or five sets
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:09.120]   of earbuds, just to make, again, just to make sure that every bag that I have and even
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:14.360]   like whenever I load up my, load up my, get dressed and load up my pockets, this stuff,
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:17.680]   at least I have one thing that I know is going to work.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.280]   So I'm sort of a wired headphone.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.280]   That's exactly right.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.280]   I'm going to need to repair.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.680]   It's a, I think of it as saturating the environment.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.680]   Right.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.880]   So I do the same thing with reading glasses.
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:33.800]   You know, you set, it's ballpoint pens, just saturate the environment so that you'll, you
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:38.520]   know, it takes a certain number, maybe 30 or 40 pens, but eventually there won't be
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.040]   anywhere you can go that doesn't have a pen.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:44.280]   I have found that there's one setting that I'm missing in, in iOS, which is that I just
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:49.160]   want to have a button that says, if you, if you're not connected to headphones, I never,
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:51.240]   ever want you to make a noise.
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:54.840]   You know, like, you know, like, like, there's a, it's really good.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:57.600]   I'm setting that just says always silent and physical.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:58.600]   Android has that.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.440]   Android has a permanent do not disturb mode.
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.600]   You put it in there.
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:02.600]   It won't do anything.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:03.760]   It won't even accept notifications.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:04.760]   Nothing.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:08.560]   Well, I, I don't mean the notifications, but I just want like, if I, what always drives
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.960]   me crazy is like, I unhook them or they get unpair.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:14.160]   And then it starts playing a movie, you know, in the middle of a movie.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:17.480]   No, this is never, you know, and it's a, that's the do not disturb mode in Android.
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.080]   Well, cause that's, that's it.
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.080]   And just press that.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.080]   And because this is, because this is an Apple podcast, I'll say something nasty about
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.080]   Android in this regard.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:31.760]   It also has the, it also allows apps to say, Oh, whenever, whenever air phones are connected,
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:32.760]   start playing automatically.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:34.040]   And I hate the album.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:39.680]   On the, whenever I forget to turn it off, whenever I like, plug something in, suddenly
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:44.520]   it starts playing stuff and like, no, no, no, I was just charging something.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:47.640]   It was like, it's like this, for me, it's like the CNN site, you know, you go to some
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:52.600]   art, every article on the CNN site creates audio, you know, like, you know, you know,
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:57.880]   so you have to, it's nice with the little doc or DOS keyboard or whatever that I have.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:58.880]   It's got the little scroller.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.920]   So I just, you know, I, I go, Oh, I'm going to CNN.
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:04.680]   I'm going to scroll down my audio before I go there because I know I'm not, I don't want
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.360]   to listen or watch the movie that you have.
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:11.000]   I always in bed, whenever I'm in bed, first thing I do before I even turn on the phone,
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.600]   I turn, well, I have to turn on to do this, but I turn down, I dim the screen and I turn
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:19.880]   all the, all the sounds off as low as I can go.
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:22.080]   Otherwise, I know it.
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:26.480]   Something will blare out and Lisa will go, what the hell are you doing?
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.680]   Knock it off.
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.680]   Let's see.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:33.520]   Let's do a zipper cruder and we'll have more in just a bit.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.720]   Apple just bought a new voice startup.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.360]   We can talk about that.
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:40.040]   Our show today brought to you by Zipper Cruder.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:41.040]   We use Zipper Cruder.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.040]   We love Zipper Cruder.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.880]   Zipper Cruder really has been a boon for us.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.680]   Hiring, you know, is important in the business.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:48.680]   I've said this before.
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:53.200]   You're building the company just like you would build a house with bricks.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:58.320]   And as the house stands or falls, depending on the materials you use, your company, sores
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:03.480]   or crashes, depending on the people you build it with.
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:07.280]   Hiring is the single most important thing you do in a company.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:10.800]   But it's hard because there's a lot of different job sites.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:16.560]   There's, you end up getting air inbox and your phone messages filled with applicants.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:20.400]   Process of reviewing different resumes, they're all look different.
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.480]   We can make it a lot easier with Zipper Cruder.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:25.880]   That's why we do a one place to go for everything.
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:29.120]   First of all, a posting on Zipper Cruder goes to 100 plus job sites.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.640]   One click of the mouse, 100 job sites.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.440]   So you're getting everywhere and presuming the right person's out there.
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.520]   And I think the right person is somewhere out there.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.440]   You got to go where they are looking.
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:41.400]   So putting it on all those sites is fantastic.
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.720]   But then Zipper Cruder goes a step farther than any other site.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:47.600]   It scans all the resumes in its possession.
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:50.880]   And I have many because people apply at Zipper Cruder.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:55.080]   And they'll go through them and they'll look for people with the right experience for the
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.880]   job you just posted.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.400]   And now they won't just give that information to you.
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.720]   They'll invite them to apply to your job.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.720]   The applicant gets the invite, looks at it, says, "Hey, yeah, I would like that job."
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:05.720]   And it applies.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:08.800]   And I can tell you that that result because we've experienced it.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:12.520]   That means within a few hours of posting, you're going to start getting candidates,
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:14.080]   identified, candidates.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:18.280]   As those applications come in, Zipper Cruder actually analyzes them,
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:22.280]   spotlights the top candidates, puts them right at the top so you won't miss them.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.360]   It is so effective.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:27.800]   80% of the employers who post on Zipper Cruder get a quality candidate through the site
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:29.800]   within the first day.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.680]   We've used it to post for a variety of jobs.
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:35.520]   And almost invariably, we'll get great candidates right away.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:39.040]   Right now, MacBreak Weekly listeners can try Zipper Cruder free.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.960]   So there's no reason to trust me.

[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:14.400]   They've supported us and we like supporting them.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:39.000]   Somebody sat on something or somebody wanted to say something?
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   No?
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:48.440]   No, no, no.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:57:12.080]   We've got a lot of people.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:21.440]   And I'm going to talk about some of the other things that we've got.
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:36.320]   So I'm going to talk about some of the things that we've got.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:46.720]   I'm going to talk about some of the things that we've got.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:58:08.000]   And I'm going to talk about some of the things that we've got.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:30.960]   And I'm going to talk about some of the things that we've got.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:35.940]   So that's maybe not a big...
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:38.680]   Apple got a deal, shall we say?
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:39.960]   I think it was somebody.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:43.600]   Some VC ran the math and they were saying like, "What that number is on paper versus
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:48.720]   what the investors and the founders can actually recoup or often very different things."
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.040]   Oh, okay.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.480]   So it's more complicated than that.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:55.840]   Really for us, from our point of view, it's not about whether, you know, Polestring made
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:56.840]   money.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:02.440]   Why Apple bought them and it clearly gives them some Amazon Echo style capabilities.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:08.000]   The fantasy is that this could eventually allow you to make Siri shortcuts using Siri
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.960]   or send them any fault from there so that you could say, "Yo Jimbo, I want...
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:16.840]   You know, Yo Jimbo do this and then that and then this and give me that."
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:19.080]   And it would basically...
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:21.720]   Brian Remley has talked about a lot of this stuff, but you'd basically be able to build
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.800]   your own automations using your voice.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:28.240]   And it would be another step towards Siri becoming its own AIOs, which is what a lot
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.640]   of us are looking forward to.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:32.600]   Yeah, I'm surprised Apple doesn't promote...
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:34.520]   I'm surprised Apple doesn't promote shortcuts more.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:38.920]   It is one of the most miraculous things available on any phone anywhere.
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:46.440]   And the ability to trigger these things with Siri is just delightful as hell.
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:47.440]   I follow the...
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:50.160]   And you could theoretically get all the skills in there.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.160]   Sorry.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.160]   Go ahead.
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.160]   You could theoretically get a lot of...
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:57.880]   Because right now, Amazon has a huge database of a huge platform of skills and Google's got
[00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:02.760]   a large one and Apple has very, very few Siri intents and a lot of shortcuts.
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:09.440]   But this is what people could use to make a lot of Siri skills very quickly, not just
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:14.240]   you making your own with like Siri shortcuts, but companies and everybody building quicker,
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.520]   easier, better Siri skills all on their own.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.520]   You can get sure...
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.280]   I get a lot of shortcuts from Reddit.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.280]   There's a really good sub-edit.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:28.480]   However, of late people have been warning about malicious shortcuts and reminding people
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:33.560]   when you download a shortcut from the web, you should absolutely look at every step in
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.280]   the shortcut and make sure it's something you want.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.240]   Because it's very, very easy to write a shortcut that would download all the money in my bank
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.240]   account.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.840]   Well, usually not that, but send out your contact list as stranger and then download all
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:45.840]   the money in my bank account.
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.480]   The Emerald Rambo has a good site for shortcuts as well that I think is...
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.680]   I forget what he calls it, shortcut something, but it's probably a little safer than right.
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.520]   Or if you get it from Frederico Vitticci, because his stuff...
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.000]   Yeah, he's a terrific.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   He is.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   I mean, I've never seen...
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   He's crazy.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.040]   He's a maestro.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:10.320]   He must spend all his time writing shortcuts and...
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:14.480]   All that espresso has to go somewhere, Leo.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:20.960]   We recently in the studio audience had somebody who works on the Xcode team, and I said,
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:24.600]   "You gotta make it better for shortcuts."
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.240]   If we can code shortcuts, debug shortcuts like we do Xcode.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.240]   Now we're talking.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.240]   All right, Mike, we'll get on there.
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.040]   I do think there's a gap between...
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.040]   Oh, you know him.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:37.640]   Half that team that applies about half that team now.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:43.280]   I really think there's a gap between shortcuts and Swift that is nodal.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:47.320]   You know where you could say, "I want this input," and then you can build a little graph
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:49.080]   of what you want it to do.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:53.040]   It's a little bit more complex than what shortcuts does and a little less difficult than what
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.280]   Swift is, where you could build it.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:00.760]   If you think of shake or you think of fusion, those types of things, where you're able to...
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:08.800]   We build and compositing really complex interactions that are very much like programming and very
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:12.480]   complex processes that don't require coding.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.240]   And then what happens is if you look at pixel conduit, which is something we helped with,
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:20.560]   or we sold for a long time, you'd even have a little node that is code.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.320]   You just insert JavaScript.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.000]   Actually, conduit would be a good model for this kind of visual script.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   Exactly.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.920]   So you just visually script most of it, and then you write the code that you need to write
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.720]   for this one thing that you can't find a node for.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:39.000]   And then there's a whole possibility of concatenating all of that and even selling that as a product.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.440]   You put it all together and then you concatenate it and then encrypt it and put it out on
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.600]   the App Store or whatever.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:50.280]   And people could be in that creative space between shortcuts, which is just solving your
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.480]   own problems in Swift, which is really real coding.
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.920]   And then this in-between that you could really have entrepreneurs and other people building
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:00.160]   that stuff out and tying that into Interface Designer and all those other things would
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.160]   be not...
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:05.000]   It's not the first time that anyone's ever done it.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.080]   And this is visual basic that Microsoft did a long time ago, but this could be a lot more
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:14.080]   advanced and a lot more intuitive today than it was back then.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:23.400]   There's so much that hasn't been done with shortcuts and with Siri in general.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.760]   Really, I think that one of the most useful things that should be on every single smart
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:34.200]   assistant is just the ability to say, "Slamo, remember that the last train out of Boston
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.800]   is at 11 and 31 p.m.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.000]   And so that it will be able to then unpack any requests.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.640]   Like, "Slamo, when's the last train out of Boston?"
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.200]   Or, "Slamo, what's my cousin's shoe size?"
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:52.600]   Or, "My wife loves this Brazilian, this best of Brazilian."
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:55.280]   It's a David Byrne album that is like best of Brazilian music.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.280]   Oh, I love that.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.280]   Oh, Samba.
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.280]   So good.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.760]   And she loves this one disc and watching her try to tell our Amazon look or Amazon show.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:05.760]   Oh, yeah, you can't.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.320]   She goes, "Do the one by David."
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.320]   She goes through this whole process.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:10.600]   And every once in a while, she gets it.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:16.320]   And then we get, otherwise it's like some random, you know, and I'm going to put a skill
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:22.000]   into the Amazon, where you can just go, Amazon, you know, the, you know, slow amount.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   Try play a Samba.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.800]   It's gonna be my favorite Brazilian, like I'm just going to tell when she says this,
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.640]   play this album so that we can just avoid that problem.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:35.520]   Can I, I don't know, I don't know if "Slamo" does this or with Apple Music.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:40.080]   I mean, wouldn't be surprised if it did, but on Google, on Google Play Music, if you've
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:43.720]   got the Google Assistant, you can say, "Play that album.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:50.080]   That's a, the album that's a cover is a baby, like that's chasing after like a dollar underwater."
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:53.320]   And it will say, "Play, Nevermind" by Nirvana.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.240]   And it works with so many albums.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.240]   That would be awesome.
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.240]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.640]   It sounds like over a day.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:05.560]   Play that Joe Jackson album where it's just pointy shoes and shadow, like playing look
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.560]   sharp, like, all right.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.520]   How can I do that, but then copy strike a bunch of unnecessary time?
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.960]   I don't understand this AI stuff.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:11.960]   It's like so hot.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.800]   Because it knows I need to find my Joe Jackson albums.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.760]   That's the Holy Grail though, really is the Holy Grail.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.080]   We're not anywhere near close to that.
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.800]   Pulse string could be a lot more than shortcuts.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.280]   Why is everybody focused on shortcuts?
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.680]   I mean, there's so many things Pulse string could be.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:31.640]   Because the one, I mean, I think just in general over the, over the longer span of history,
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:37.160]   we want to see, I use the weird we locally, want to see iOS and macOS sort of abstracted
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:41.760]   away by a layer of voice and AR and AI interface.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.760]   And part of that interface, the voice is going to be integral to it.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:48.320]   It's going to have to be a platform where the idea of apps are different enough from
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.000]   what we have now, but there'll mostly be a series of functions that you can call and
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.800]   cobble together at will.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:58.480]   And series shortcuts is the closest thing we have to that sort of hypercard of the future
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:05:59.480]   model.
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:02.040]   So I think that's why people start to focus on that a lot.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.040]   Okay.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.440]   And now series answering me.
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:08.800]   You still get into this thing where you're just like, oh, I'm going to, I'm going to ask
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:10.760]   for something and you're like, oh, that's going to be too complicated.
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.920]   Like I, I, it's not going to be able to figure this out.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:16.080]   And that's, you just go back into typing or whatever.
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.680]   And I think that that you're right, that, that we want to get to a point where we can
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:23.360]   explain it as if we would explain it to a, to a person and have it like Jarvis.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:25.760]   We want Jarvis.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.760]   What's so hard with that?
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.760]   Just make us Jarvis.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.760]   Get Paul Bettany on the phone.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:29.760]   Exactly.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:30.760]   Jarvis is needlessly overcomplicated.
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:34.920]   Why haven't they paid Paul Bettany a lot of money to just respond like Siri?
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.920]   I know, right?
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.720]   Like Google, you think would be first on that.
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.760]   Maybe he's got an exclusive deal with Marvel that he can't do voice assistance.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:41.760]   That would be amazing.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.800]   You know, you know, that if Jonathan Harris were still alive, he'd be like making all
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:48.000]   kinds of bank like from, from Lost in the Space.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   Like saying, oh, be sure to, be sure to take a jacket.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.960]   It's going to be a bit chilly outside today.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:58.040]   I think we're just in a world.
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:06.360]   So apparently the fix to the group FaceTime bug was just to eliminate the ad person feature.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:10.360]   No, but that's hugely funny.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:14.000]   So someone had a long weekend planned.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.160]   That feature has been modified somewhat, right?
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.440]   Well, I think this was just an intern.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.080]   Like it was taking longer to get it out.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.960]   And this is probably something that had to, like they decided to ship it before they got
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.120]   everything fixed.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.760]   The developer version came out today, by the way.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:30.200]   So if you're on the developer track, you want to download today's update because that'll
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.600]   fix the FaceTime group bug.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.880]   Ah, finally, because it was fixed for the rest of us.
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:36.880]   Yes.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:37.880]   Last week.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.880]   But now it's fixed for everybody.
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:46.000]   So Apple is bringing podcasting to the Apple Watch.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.680]   You can now podcast from your Apple.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:48.680]   No.
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:49.680]   You should be.
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.480]   I can see Leo doing it from the hotel though, right?
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:53.200]   I, you know, thanks to Anchor.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:57.120]   Anchor is a pretty, this is the tool that the Spotify bought.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:00.000]   It's somebody liken it to WordPress for podcast.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   It's a very nice.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.120]   So like drafts from your watch to anchor to a podcast?
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:11.200]   I think actually easier than that, if I use just press record on my watch, I could import
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.200]   it into anchor once I got to the phone.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:18.240]   Anchor, there's no reason anchor couldn't make except that usually when you post a podcast,
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:20.880]   you want to do a little more than just, okay, this is a podcast.
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:25.120]   But if you're in the field, like you're being chased by a Velociraptor and you want to do
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.880]   a live podcast, like it's a second name.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:31.040]   Well, I think that when, when it was announced Spotify bought anchor, I thought, well, this
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.360]   would be a good time for me to make another.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:39.080]   I've made like 10, I have this complete throwaway podcast I do called Leo on the line or Lottle.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.000]   I'm a subscriber at Lottle.fun.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.560]   Hello, T.L.
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:47.400]   And the whole idea of it, you know, I don't know, it's just whenever I feel like it.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:51.360]   So when they did that, I thought, well, I'll use anchor and it was very easy.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.680]   You just, I was sitting in a hotel room.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.800]   I was lying down, I recorded on my phone.
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:55.800]   I added some music.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:57.000]   There you go.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.680]   And that's it.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.760]   And it's about as easy publishing a podcast.
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:05.040]   And I think it automatically goes to iTunes and, you know, you can subscribe to it.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:09.440]   It stores the content you get, you get statistics, you get all that stuff.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:12.040]   So I can't remember why I brought that up.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.840]   Oh, well, that if you want a podcast from your watch, that would be the way to do it.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.120]   But that's not what we're talking about here.
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:22.160]   The official podcast app finally is going to work on your watch.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:25.880]   This is something overcast has done pocketcast does.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.400]   But Apple finally added this feature.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:32.200]   And here's the I'm more article talking about it.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:37.240]   I've been trying to expand my listening to podcasts beyond what I've been listening
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.240]   to for years.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:42.880]   And I just, I always like to say if you're listening to this show is audio quality is
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.880]   important.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:44.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:48.680]   A lot of people just make sure everybody mutes their, it turns off their phone before they
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:49.680]   come on the show.
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.680]   Sorry.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:51.680]   I didn't, it didn't really.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:52.680]   No, I was kidding.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.080]   No, our audio is so good.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.360]   I could hear the vibrations.
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.360]   Yeah, it didn't ring.
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.360]   It didn't ring.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:06.880]   Yeah, it's a, I'm just always surprised at how, how people don't pay attention to quality
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.880]   mics.
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.880]   I can't listen to it.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:14.440]   I guess the problem that I have is that I can hear now that I'm wearing headphones all
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:18.320]   the time, I can hear the return audio in NPR's.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.320]   Oh, really?
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:23.960]   So when NPR is talking to someone and they're talking about it's the end and their headphones
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:24.960]   are out too high.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.960]   Oh, that's bad.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:28.600]   I can hear the little echo in the background and it makes me crazy.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:29.600]   It makes me crazy.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.760]   And then the other thing is I, I don't, I hate phoneers.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:34.760]   I hate phone it.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:38.240]   Phone call when they call representative or they call some expert and he's coming over
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:39.240]   their phone.
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.240]   I'm like, get him somewhere with a real mic.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.240]   I mean, it's not send him a mic FedEx.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.600]   I'm like, it's all I gotta say.
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.080]   Well, podcast, thanks to Spotify.
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.520]   Podcasts are having a renaissance.
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.400]   I think it's thanks to all these smart speakers.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.400]   I mean, everybody's got it.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.400]   It's awesome.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.400]   I love it.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:58.480]   One thing I worry about with Spotify because some of their exclusive podcasts, I can't listen
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.760]   to them, my smart speaker, because I don't have a paid Spotify account or something.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:03.760]   Maybe I can't stop Spotify.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.760]   I don't know what it is.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:09.080]   And I suspect that one of the things that's going to happen with Spotify is they're going
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:12.520]   to start saying you got to be exclusive to our platform.
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.720]   Like I understand that.
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:14.720]   Right.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:15.720]   You don't think that'll happen?
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.880]   No, I'm saying I don't understand that at all.
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:21.400]   I don't understand why a podcaster would want to be exclusive to one service.
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:22.400]   Right.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.800]   Spotify is going to own the Yacht.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:25.800]   Absolutely.
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.360]   If I'm a fan of the gimlet, right?
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.000]   So that's the only stuff that's being exclusive.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.520]   Well, like I tried to listen to reply all on my Google home and it said, I'm sorry, I
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.720]   can't do that.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:41.080]   And I think it's because it's exclusive to Spotify.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:42.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:45.800]   It's just it's just wrong for a company to basically say, we're going to take this from
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:50.280]   you, meaning you're the worldwide audience and irrespective of platform and we're going
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.920]   to give you nothing in return.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:55.640]   Like if if if a company wanted to say, guess what?
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.040]   We will pay you $1,000 per episode for exclusivity.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.040]   That's another thing.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.800]   But if they're going to they're basically saying that not only are you going to be struggling
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:09.000]   for all the reasons why a new podcast struggles, we're also going to make sure that we're
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.880]   not going to give you anything in return for exclusivity except for the ability to put
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:18.080]   this special will give you the ability to put this special gift in your show page and
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:20.000]   say, Oh, we're Spotify exclusive.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.400]   Let's see, that's exactly what Apple's trying to do with news.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:30.720]   The theory is join these big platforms and we'll help you reach an audience and monetize
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:31.720]   you.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:32.720]   Well, monetize you will.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.600]   And it's kind of it's it's it's it's could be an empty promise.
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.240]   There's no guarantee.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.160]   And so that's exactly what Spotify is promising.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.160]   We have an ad engine.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.320]   So when people listen on Spotify and they don't have a paid tier, we're going to have revenue
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.480]   generated by your podcast.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:51.720]   And if they are on the paid tier, we'll give you a share, whatever it is of that revenue.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:53.360]   And we have 200 million users.
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:56.600]   So you're going to be it's this it's kind of exactly the same pitch Apple makes with
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:59.160]   news, except that Apple's not asking for exclusivity.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:02.440]   But I mean, it's the same way that Linda calm worked, you know, and in fact, you didn't
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.000]   even know what the percentage was.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.320]   I don't even think we knew what what the percentage of Linda calm was, you know, going
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.680]   out to all the users.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:12.600]   But I know that I have a lot of friends that have built a lot of stuff on Linda, I'm
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:14.400]   linked in and they like, Oh, yeah, I don't know.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.120]   I made something and I get 4,000.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:19.680]   I get about $4,000 and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:24.720]   This is what Ben's whole thing of aggregators is all about is this notion that the real
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:31.480]   money to be made is to be made by aggregators these days, pays the paces like Facebook, Apple,
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.040]   Spotify.
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.840]   That's the way to play it.
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:39.120]   And I agree with you, Andy, I am, but that's a very old school attitude.
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:43.640]   It's the same attitude we had about blogs too, which is it's a democratizing medium that
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:48.280]   anybody can create a podcast and it should be now you have medium and anybody can listen
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.280]   to it.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.200]   Now you have medium and you have Spotify, right?
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.680]   It's not just, it's not just democratizing.
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.600]   It's actually like capitalistic.
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:14:00.160]   It's that if if someone wanted to offer me exclusivity on something that I want to create
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:06.360]   or something, basically if someone wants to say distribute through our platform and we
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:10.280]   will take all of these headaches off of your hands, you will not have to worry about selling
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:15.600]   ads, you won't have to worry about hosting, you won't have to worry about number of how
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.520]   much it's going to cost you to have X number of downloads.
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:22.200]   And to a certain extent, you won't we will do some of the promotion for you.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.560]   That might actually work.
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:31.080]   But I think that you have to present a case to each creator that says that we're going
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.800]   to give you an opportunity that you won't have otherwise.
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:38.720]   And a lot of the negatives aren't coming across in all these rumors that we're hearing
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:44.840]   about about Apple and also stuff that we're hearing from Spotify.
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:49.640]   I just don't want to see all these creators, particularly people who are just starting
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:54.360]   out to fall into this trap of thinking that, no, no, no, you need to have the backing of
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:55.360]   Apple.
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:01.080]   You need to have the backing of Spotify when really what you need is to find 5,000 people
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.040]   or 10,000 people that really love what you do.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:09.160]   And a thousand people who kind of like or kind of are okay with what you do is not as valuable
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:12.160]   as people that you can sell a t-shirt to.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.960]   I don't know.
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:17.440]   Someone who's created a lot of my own content and created a lot of apps and done a lot of
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:18.440]   other things.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:19.440]   It's hard.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.720]   It's hard to get people to come to you.
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:25.480]   And so I think that there's a real value in...
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:28.720]   I would have made a lot more money if the app store had existed when I was doing a lot
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:29.720]   of apps.
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:30.720]   You want to know how you get to be a successful podcast?
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.720]   You start not going to be able.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:32.720]   Apple.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:34.480]   It's a feature by Apple and iTunes.
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:37.120]   That is literally the only way.
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.720]   And everything else is a waste of time.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:45.560]   And I think that you could have everyone come to your farm or you can go to a farmer's
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:49.880]   market or you can sell it to a supermarket or sell it to a distributor to supermarkets.
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:53.760]   There's models of there are people who do it and then there's people who market it and
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.760]   sell it.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.360]   And you definitely give up percentages.
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:01.520]   The person selling the raw milk is making a lot less money than the person...
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.320]   There's people who are taking money all the way through that process to the point where
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.640]   I'm pouring it into my glass.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:06.640]   And so that...
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.320]   That's where anchor is so great.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.440]   I mean, really, you could literally do it from your watch or your phone.
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:13.080]   But you still need that platform.
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.080]   But that you rely on them.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:20.480]   And now that they're Spotify, maybe you are in fact making an exclusive podcast for Spotify.
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:21.480]   I don't know.
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.480]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.480]   And maybe...
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:24.480]   And you know what?
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.880]   Maybe somebody's going to come along, make a podcast that goes viral.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.880]   Spotify is going to sell ads.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.920]   This guy's going to make money.
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.880]   People make money on YouTube all the time.
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:34.960]   You have to put up with a lot of crap as we were talking about before the show began
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:37.200]   with this silly strike system.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:38.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:39.200]   But on the other hand, people...
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:40.200]   That's a powerful platform.
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.200]   I was talking to people.
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.200]   I was talking to a guy.
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.520]   I'm not going to mention who he is.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:48.000]   But I was working with a guy and I was asking, "How much do you actually make on YouTube?"
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   Most people...
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   You know, like...
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   No, no.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.800]   He was like, "Yeah, make about $60,000 a month."
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:53.800]   What?
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:54.800]   And I was like, "Okay.
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:55.800]   Okay.
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:56.800]   Well, there you go."
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:57.800]   And you know, he's like, "Okay."
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:58.800]   No, he's currently in makeup channels.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.800]   He's currently in the fall.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:00.800]   He's currently in the fall.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.280]   He's working on the
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.280]   margins of Ohio.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.280]   Absolutely.
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.400]   When he started, when he started, he was just making videos that he thought were funny.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:09.120]   And then a couple of them went viral and he's very good.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.640]   Was he a viner or...
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:15.160]   He was not a viner, but he's in a specific vertical.
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:18.240]   And this is all from YouTube selling ads or does he...
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.840]   To make sure of YouTube and Facebook.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:20.840]   You know?
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:24.280]   See, a lot of people like to make up people make money because they sell gift baskets.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:25.280]   You know, they sell.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:26.280]   Or they get sponsors.
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:30.120]   They had a controversy over gambling sponsors and one guy said, "I got offered $150,000
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:31.120]   for that ad."
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.360]   And the guy said, "I have, I think, three times as many subscribers.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.760]   Can you imagine how much I got offered for that?"
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:36.760]   Right.
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:37.760]   Okay.
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:38.760]   There you go.
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:39.760]   And so the thing is that...
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.000]   And what happened is a lot of them built up and they did their own little thing.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   And then...
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.160]   And if you look at like Zack King, is that right?
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.440]   Zack King, the guy who does all the little...
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.440]   He started off in Vine.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.680]   You're doing little things that appear and disappear.
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:52.000]   And now he's doing...
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.240]   I saw him at an Apple store on the huge screen explaining how he does his little...
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:58.200]   Oh, that's a little thing.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:03.280]   But, you know, he started just doing things, you know, and putting them up there.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.280]   And, you know, so the...
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:08.120]   But he couldn't do it without those platforms, first without Vine and then without YouTube.
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.320]   And he got paid a pittance to get started.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.680]   But now he's got a lot of leverage.
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.880]   And I think that there is a way to kind of work your way up through that system.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.040]   It's really hard to work up without those platforms.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:18.040]   Like I've...
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:21.400]   The thing that's interesting to me about it is like, if like I swatched a video about
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:25.840]   the galaxy, whatever next galaxy has, 10 that comes out, it'll recommend three other videos
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:26.840]   that I might like about it.
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:30.680]   Now, yes, there are all sorts of things about conspiracy theories and really bad videos.
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.480]   But if I listen to like a podcast on it, there's nothing that recommends three other awesome
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.400]   podcasts on the same topic.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:42.400]   So I don't have that discovery ability and individual shows don't have that force multiplying
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.400]   factor.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.400]   But that's something Spotify probably could do, right?
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:46.400]   In there.
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.400]   And they're absolutely cool.
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:49.400]   Like they're really good podcast clients that do it.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.960]   But they're not ubiquitous.
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:51.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:52.960]   It's interesting.
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:57.160]   Apple could have done what Spotify is hoping to do and deferred.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.640]   They could still.
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:18:59.640]   And they still could.
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:00.640]   Yeah.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:02.160]   Well, a lot of podcasts are just super happy.
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:03.160]   They don't get involved.
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.160]   So yeah.
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.160]   No, no, I've heard.
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.160]   Absolutely.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:11.160]   They already wield so much power with their editorial selections.
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:15.400]   Huawei turns out was...
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:16.400]   This is from the information.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.640]   And what a great story.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:18.640]   Good as usual.
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:21.320]   Great reporting from the information.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:32.480]   And it turns out Huawei was sending employees to steal trade secrets.
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:40.280]   For instance, in November, a Huawei engineer in charge of their smart watch tracked down
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:44.360]   a supplier that helps make Apple's heart rate sensor, arranged a meeting on the pretext
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.440]   of offering the supplier a contract.
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:53.240]   But the engineer really wanted details on the Apple watch.
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:57.120]   And in this case, got nothing because the firm has an NDA with Apple and no supplier's
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.840]   going to screw Apple.
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:03.920]   But this is apparently a pattern that Huawei is incentive employees.
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:10.040]   And particularly Apple is often one of the subjects of their industrial espionage.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:13.440]   I'm always nervous about doing these Huawei stories because there's such a drumbeat.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:18.680]   And I wonder if it's coming from xenophobia or the trade war.
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:21.040]   But there's now enough information about Huawei.
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:27.240]   I think it's fair to say the Justice Department says Huawei had a formal program that rewarded
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:32.320]   employees for stealing information with bonuses that increased based on the confidential value
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.240]   of the information.
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:38.800]   Huawei employees were encouraged to post stolen information on an internal company website.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.400]   They were also given an email address where they could send the information, which was
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:48.160]   then reviewed by what was known internally as the competition management group.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:51.760]   Huawei assured employees they wouldn't be punished for taking such action.
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:57.680]   Now competitive research is a big business in every business.
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:02.040]   It's just how far you'll go whether you cross the line, light sheet, steal and bribe to get
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:03.040]   that information.
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:05.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:09.240]   You ever consider that maybe Mingxie quote doesn't have great context within the Apple
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.240]   supply chain?
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:13.240]   He just knows the people at Huawei who steal everything.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:15.040]   There you go.
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:21.560]   I mean, I think he's I don't want to say too much on this, but you obviously know more
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.040]   than you're going to be.
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:28.200]   But there's an open market for trade secrets in China.
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.040]   A lot of people benefit.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.040]   Yes.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.600]   And I think some of that is cultural.
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:34.880]   Some of it's just the way it's done.
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:35.880]   It's also, I think, China.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.680]   Well, there was this China is very focused on.
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:43.320]   They need to move up the chain and they have to move up quickly because the value of low
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:48.040]   cost labor will become less valuable as automation steps in.
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:53.240]   And so you can't just be the lowest costs producers because there's going to be machines
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.240]   that do that soon.
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:57.680]   We're going to bring actually a lot of production back to the United States because it'll just
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:58.840]   be machines.
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:04.320]   And so I think that no more jobs, unless you're a machine or make machines.
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:07.160]   No, and so eventually the machines will make the machines.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:13.000]   And so the but the issue is that China, I'm sure, understands this.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.320]   I mean, Foxconn's talking about getting rid of 90% of their employees.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:22.680]   And so they have to move up that food chain and they're working really hard at doing that.
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:23.680]   And I'm not defending China.
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:27.960]   I mean, I think that they're I think we shouldn't be using Huawei, Huawei's 5G.
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.520]   I believe all that.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:33.180]   But in understanding it, just remember that every country has done what they needed to
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.120]   do to be successful.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:41.080]   We did a lot of horrible things a hundred years ago, very, very horrible things.
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:45.360]   We I mean, even 10 years ago, you know, and so but we've done a lot of horrible things
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.800]   to get this country to where it is.
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:50.000]   The UK did lots of horrible things to get to where they're at.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.240]   The Chinese are doing what they need to do to move their country forward.
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:58.640]   It's an evolution of almost every country to do to do someone when they have the leverage
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.640]   to do it.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:03.420]   Back when there was all the lawsuits over Apple and Samsung and where the Samsung copied
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:06.780]   Apple, someone explained to me that, you know, this is what happened with refrigerators.
[01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:08.060]   They just said, these are smart things.
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:09.420]   Why wouldn't we use them?
[01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:13.500]   And it took like a whole bunch of years for refrigerator trademarks to be battled out.
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:17.220]   And then every industry sort of goes through this and every culture has very different
[01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:21.060]   ideas about what's in the common good and what's in the specific company good.
[01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:23.580]   And all of these things have to be settled.
[01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:26.340]   It is a it is a government fed priority in China.
[01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:31.000]   But also we're talking about practices that happen in our country day after day after
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000]   day.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.300]   There's there are no shortage of stories about people who are brought in for an interview
[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:40.980]   because they might be maybe they want to get their company brought in for an interview
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:42.180]   for a job at Google.
[01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:44.680]   But maybe Google just wants to know about their research.
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:46.280]   They're doing a thing media lab.
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:50.760]   And if any of it is restricted by patent yet, remember they got into trouble.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:54.920]   The thing was last year the year before about exactly that sort of thing.
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:24:01.320]   Who's a senior researcher at the media lab who is doing doing expert stuff on I believe
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:07.160]   technology based textiles had this very, very long interview process was actually offered
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:12.480]   a job at their at their biggest like New York based skunk works.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:18.440]   And when they turned down the job, but soon shortly a few months after the interview turns
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:22.440]   out that Google took out patents on her research.
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:24.800]   And Google said, Oh, it was a misunderstanding.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.720]   We'll take that patent stuff off right now.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:27.960]   And there was all the car stuff, right?
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.960]   Like everybody is trying to steal the car stuff from everybody else.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:36.080]   The most revered inventor in America, a guy who's basically considered a saint, pretty
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.880]   much stole everything.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:38.880]   Thomas Edison.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:43.760]   I mean, if you if you do some research, he didn't invent the light bulb.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.280]   He didn't invent the X ray.
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:48.320]   He didn't invent the phonograph.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.560]   He didn't invent the motion picture.
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:56.480]   He had many patents, but I think it's widely accepted that he also stole many ideas.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:58.480]   And that's well, that's a that's America.
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:24:59.480]   Yeah.
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:01.320]   Well, that's a different that's a different thing.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:05.920]   Even the even the like mouse and mouse and pointer based computers that preceded the
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:11.240]   Macintosh, those were extensions of research that had been happening for years and years
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.240]   and years.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:19.360]   Xerox might be famous for quote inventing, but not being able to capitalize on the mouse
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.800]   and the GUI.
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:24.160]   But this was something that for 10 years before that was being talked about as this is something
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:29.240]   we'd love to be able to do, or wouldn't be great if we could have a document focused
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.360]   principle of computing.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:34.520]   It's sometimes it's just one person is the first person to get there.
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:38.360]   And a lot of times it is based on looking out of the people's research, stealing parts
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:40.800]   of other people's research even.
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:45.400]   And for all that, it's for all that, I'm sorry, just to make a make a quick point of
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.600]   it.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:52.760]   And for all that, sometimes it's not just that someone's quote stole a certain idea,
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:55.800]   but they were able to apply it in exactly the right way.
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:59.600]   And they were able to package and sell it in a way that the original creator would never
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:00.600]   have figured out.
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.800]   That's I was going to say the same thing.
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:06.160]   Sometimes the stealing, the quote unquote stealing is the fact that you understand what
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.160]   they could do with that.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:11.080]   And they didn't like someone comes up with an idea and they think that it's you it's
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:15.240]   useful for X when what the world really needs is why and you just go, I'm going to take
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.920]   this and make it available to why.
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:23.200]   And yeah, I see that particular technology, then you look at it and you go, that's not
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:25.360]   going to work with what they want.
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:26.360]   This is what it's actually useful for.
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.640]   And then they never go down that path, particularly when you have a company that has a really
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:34.440]   is a lot of tradition and a really deeply ingrained corporate culture where Polaroid
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:40.280]   could not see digital photography as anything more than a new version of instant photography.
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:44.040]   They couldn't figure out that no, this means that pictures are digital and now are malleable
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:46.320]   and fungible and transmittable.
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:53.000]   Xerox could not see the GUI as much more than here is a super photocopier where with
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.880]   the document that you're making copies of actually started off on this screen.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:57.880]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:02.880]   Whereas you need a computer company to say, no, that would make computers really a lot
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:07.480]   easier to do if all the commands were actually actually written out for you on a screen.
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:12.080]   You just had to click on things as opposed to having to remember a command line with
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:18.840]   lots of periods and slashes on it.
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:21.680]   Let's talk about, I'm a genius.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:22.680]   You're a genius.
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:24.120]   You're all geniuses.
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:28.960]   Our friends that I fix it, a long time sponsor on the show have created a campaign because
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:34.640]   of course they are all about the right to repair saying we've been bred to believe that
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:42.720]   only geniuses and geeks can fix our stuff wasn't always that way, that which we call
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.280]   a genius.
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:51.240]   I don't know how you finish that sentence, but we're all geniuses.
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:54.760]   I have to say I'm a fan of the right to repair movement.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:59.080]   Apparently so is the big insurance company all state.
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:06.000]   They own square trade does those extended warranties for a lot of your electronics.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.680]   The square trade just purchased I cracked, which is an iPhone, a third party iPhone
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:12.840]   repair company.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:18.840]   I have a feeling this is going to put all all state right in the center spotlight on
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:21.000]   the right to repair movement.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.160]   That will be very interesting.
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:29.840]   Vector repair is now not yet on the books, but in the legislature's of 15 states, I
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:35.400]   think it's a camera which state is already made up of law.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:40.440]   Apple, John Deere and others are fighting this whole notion.
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:45.120]   Now we have a big ally on our side, a big insurance company.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.600]   Of course you make sense.
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:48.760]   It's in their best interest.
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.320]   Again, it's not another thing the EU is trying to legislate and we don't know how well that
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:57.960]   will work, but we are thankful for the effort.
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:03.160]   They're just so bad at getting stakeholder investment before they draft legislation.
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:04.560]   This is, I don't know.
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:05.560]   But that's how you weak.
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:08.440]   That's how things get weakened to to to to to to to to.
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:09.440]   Pointlessness.
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:12.160]   If you say, guess what Apple who has a vested interest in making sure that people can't
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.280]   replace their own batteries and that can add.
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:15.520]   No, but ask I fix it.
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:16.680]   They wouldn't even ask I fix it.
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:21.080]   They would tell I fix it, how to best do their job and I fix it go, please no stop.
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.080]   Right.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:23.840]   We have to tax you for every part.
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:26.560]   You're going to pay a hundred dollar fee for every part, but we think that's fair.
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.040]   And I fixed like just you just killed us.
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:29.560]   Thank you.
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:35.120]   So I love this feature on the Apple Insider, the Apple Crime Bladder.
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:41.640]   Maybe I'll pass a few items from the Apple Crime Bladder and point you to apple insider.com.
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:47.240]   For more of them, there's a man in Portland, Oregon who stole from the Apple store nearly
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:48.920]   daily.
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:52.080]   He would wait for the store's guard to take a break and then he'd run in the store, steal
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:56.320]   about $700 worth of Bose headphones, then run back out.
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:01.400]   He had a heroin habit, of course, but he's just trying to clue closes his activity rings
[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.400]   on his Apple watch.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:05.520]   He's stolen my previous late.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:13.880]   My favorite though is the El Chapo branded iPhone accessories.
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:23.360]   El Chapo's daughter is planning to sell El Chapo 701 branded products, including iPhone
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:29.320]   accessories, shirts, hats and cigars.
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:33.880]   It's not really a great site apparently.
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:37.200]   Oh no, maybe this is the news site.
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:38.200]   That's pretty funny.
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.200]   Oh yeah, here's the Instagram.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.160]   Oh, it's been removed.
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:43.280]   Well, so much for that.
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:47.960]   That's what happens when you try to make money on your ill-gotten gains.
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:51.200]   Or it's just the Instagram algorithm we can never be sure.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:59.480]   Yeah, anyway, there's a lot of this is I like reading the police blotter in our small town
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:02.280]   paper because it's so silly.
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:03.280]   I've seen it.
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:07.600]   You know, when they turned on Apple News counter, it's going to come officially with iOS 12.2.
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:11.760]   And the first two stories I saw, I think I said this was Drunk Man rides moose and maple
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:12.760]   syrup spill.
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:13.760]   Yes.
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:17.960]   I don't know if they were counting us or if that was real news.
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:19.880]   Just what we suspected.
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:23.440]   If he were a moutie, then we'd really know it was real.
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:24.880]   Same steel.
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:29.640]   The best Canadian story was the whole story about the stolen maple syrup.
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:30.640]   Yes.
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.720]   Do they ever move that with Jim Dalrymple?
[01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:34.520]   I don't know if they ever did or not.
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:35.520]   What?
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:37.440]   I don't know if Jim Dalrymple, I don't know.
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:38.440]   No, no, no.
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:41.240]   If Jim Dalrymple ever stole syrup, it would be in his beard for three weeks.
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:43.560]   You can never get away with that.
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:49.720]   So Wednesday, there will be no surprises, but we will be covering at 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:54.000]   time, the big Samsung Galaxy 10 reveal.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.800]   Whatever are they going to reveal?
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:57.640]   I'm going to be totally shocked.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.480]   We've even seen an ad for it.
[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:04.600]   In fact, we know now that the name of the folding phone will be the Galaxy Fold.
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.520]   That's so good.
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.600]   It's in some language.
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.040]   I don't know.
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:14.600]   But here somewhere, somehow this is leaked out.
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:17.480]   Ultrasonic Fingas Tchaikovsky.
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:22.200]   Is that Finnish, Swedish, something Scandinavian it looks like based on the?
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:24.320]   What I can't tell is the fake leaks from the real ones.
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:27.480]   There was a leak showing that they had to have a cutout for the ultrasonic fingerprint
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.400]   sensor on a screen protector.
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:30.400]   And some people said that was real.
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.320]   And some people said, no, that's ridiculous.
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.400]   And I can't tell a reality from fiction anymore.
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:36.080]   This point we'll find out.
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:39.720]   But notice, by the way, something that looks a lot like AirPods.
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:40.720]   Yeah.
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:43.360]   That's so much like AirPods.
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:46.040]   They look like like Bose headphones or pretty much every other.
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:47.040]   I guess.
[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.040]   It's an air-pods.
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:49.040]   They're like AirPods.
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.000]   They're what they did steal.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000]   Like the worst thing about AirPods.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.300]   They made it a white case that when you take it out of your pocket, it gets so much
[01:32:56.300 --> 01:33:00.260]   of the dark craft from your pocket that it looks filthy and you don't want to put these
[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:01.260]   things in your ear.
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:04.800]   All the zebra look, Andy and some of those are Efecian Nados.
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:07.920]   They also scooping apples, three lenses.
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:08.920]   Uh oh.
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:11.360]   Does that pay while we're real tees?
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:15.000]   Is this going to be like Gillette where they just say, oh well guess what?
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000]   Now we've got five lenses.
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.880]   Well now we've got six lenses.
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:20.760]   Anyway, we'll find out what's up.
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:23.920]   One of the videos went live accidentally and they tried to take it down.
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:26.380]   But now it's just being replicated all over the internet.
[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:27.380]   Yeah.
[01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:28.380]   Yeah.
[01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:31.620]   I think a lot of what this happens every time.
[01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:36.420]   I almost feel like Samsung kind of releases this ahead of time on purpose just to keep
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:41.420]   people talking about it for more days than just the one event.
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:42.420]   Um, so.
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:43.820]   But it does show.
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:45.020]   I mean I saw a bunch of people.
[01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:48.060]   Like for years we've had to put up with this in the Apple world just going, oh I'm
[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:49.060]   so bored.
[01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:50.060]   I'm so bored.
[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:53.100]   And now they're saying, oh I'm so bored with sound like this is what this market looks
[01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:54.100]   like now people.
[01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:55.100]   Yeah.
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:59.340]   You know, all I can say is that from a production perspective all I hope for is that the Samsung
[01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:04.540]   figures out that the last thing that they did in front of a LED wall, like it was at
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:05.540]   some moment.
[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:06.540]   Yes, that was cool.
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:07.540]   Was psychedelic.
[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:08.540]   It was psychedelic.
[01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:11.100]   I mean it was a little hard to follow.
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:14.260]   Well, there was so much meringue going on behind behind the guy.
[01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:18.260]   Like every time they got the certain zoom lengths it was like this horrible meringue.
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:23.860]   And the problem is is putting anybody in front of a LED wall is recipe for disaster unless
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:26.940]   you really are doing your math well and they did not do that.
[01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:27.940]   We'll find out.
[01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:30.620]   I'm just hoping hopefully I won't say so the way we're going to do this is that's normally
[01:34:30.620 --> 01:34:31.620]   Windows weekly time.
[01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:32.620]   We'll move that to 9 a.m.
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:36.500]   Move it back a couple of hours to Windows weekly then we'll do the Samsung event and
[01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:38.060]   this weekend Google so busy day.
[01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:39.060]   That's tomorrow.
[01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:40.060]   Great.
[01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:41.060]   Busy day tomorrow on Twitter.
[01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:46.460]   Let's take a break and when we come back everybody will be very calm because it's time
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:52.300]   for an ad for calm.com.
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:55.580]   I'm a calm customer have been for some time.
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:59.380]   Calm is a website that I really like partly because it's not just meditation.
[01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:00.380]   Yes, it's meditation.
[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:04.060]   They have a lot of meditations including the daily calm.
[01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:08.620]   It's the number one app though to help you not only meditate but also sleep.
[01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:09.620]   Also relax.
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:16.100]   They even have exclusive calm music and nature sounds.
[01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:19.260]   It is really the all in one place to get this.
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.620]   The calm app is a prize winner.
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:26.020]   App of the year from Apple in 2017 part of Apple's Best of 2018 list.
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:30.660]   I'm sure they'll win again in 2019.
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:34.180]   It's just very soothing and very nice.
[01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:35.700]   Let me, shall I play?
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:36.700]   Let's see.
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:37.940]   I could play the daily calm.
[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:39.460]   You want to hear the daily calm?
[01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:41.820]   It's very relaxing.
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:45.900]   By the way, this is on the web you get the beautiful imagery.
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:49.300]   Here's your daily calm.
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:50.300]   I actually had to listen to this.
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:52.780]   Welcome to the daily calm.
[01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:57.180]   Today we'll use the sound of the bell to return us to awareness.
[01:35:57.180 --> 01:36:02.860]   We'll use its ring to wake us to the present moment.
[01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:06.700]   This is what we call guided meditation and I'm going to end this.
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:09.500]   Taking a comfortable position of ease.
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:11.500]   Okay, thank you.
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:13.340]   They also have sleep.
[01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:19.620]   In fact, seven days of sleep, you could do seven lessons that would make you a better
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:20.620]   sleeper.
[01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:21.620]   They have sleep stories.
[01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:25.580]   We've talked before about Matthew McConaughey, but there's so many sleep stories.
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:29.580]   Some of them, it's nice because you can divide them up into different categories.
[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:32.380]   Some of them are for learning.
[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:33.660]   Some of them are fiction.
[01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:36.820]   They're just stories like your mommy used to read you.
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:42.340]   For kids, which is nice, including some of the classics like Grim Fairy Tales, The Emperor's
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:48.260]   New Clothes, The Nutcracker, there's sleep music, there's nature stories.
[01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:49.980]   I like these because you can actually learn a lot.
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:57.020]   I did a tour of New Zealand with Braun, the mercenary from Game of Thrones.
[01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:58.340]   He was very peaceful.
[01:36:58.340 --> 01:36:59.340]   It was great.
[01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:00.780]   I learned a lot about New Zealand.
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:03.780]   Hidden Bali, a love letter to Africa.
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:08.020]   I don't know.
[01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:09.020]   Here's the deal.
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:12.100]   We're going to get you 25% off a calm premium subscription.
[01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:14.260]   Like me, you can have access to everything.
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:19.020]   I play a little relaxing calm music here.
[01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:21.460]   Let me find something.
[01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:23.500]   Would you like a rain in the city?
[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:24.780]   Let's listen to some rain in the city.
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:29.740]   I tell you how to get 25% off your calm premium subscription.

[01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:57.340]   This is a good one.
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:37:58.340]   Lisa likes this one.
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:38:00.340]   This is the Purring Cat.
[01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:05.340]   That doesn't make you sleepy either.
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:07.340]   I don't know what will.
[01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:12.060]   You need to have a furry pillow on your face to get a cool effect.
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:15.180]   I can provide the furry pillow.
[01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:18.420]   I really love calm.com/macbreak.
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:21.540]   It's given me a whole new outlook on life.
[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:24.580]   Now our picks of the week.
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:25.580]   Let's see.
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:26.580]   Who should I start with?
[01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:27.580]   How about you, Alex Lindsey?
[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:29.340]   We can start at the high end.
[01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:30.340]   It's not that high.
[01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:32.340]   It's relatively inexpensive.
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:34.340]   You just have a reputation.
[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:36.140]   I know.
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:39.620]   This is both on the iPhone and iOS.
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:41.700]   Have you seen Streetlytron?
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:42.700]   No.
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:43.700]   It's like the Melatron?
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:47.620]   Ooh, I love Melatrons.
[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:52.140]   But what's cool about it is that not only is it an app that has a lot of great samples.
[01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:56.220]   You can have your basic ones here, but you can grab on to a lot of...
[01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:57.220]   They have a lot of the...
[01:38:57.220 --> 01:38:59.060]   There's a chorus.
[01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:00.060]   So you have...
[01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:01.340]   These are kind of classic synth sounds.
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:05.180]   Classic synth sounds, but what's also cool is that it does recognize MIDI.
[01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:06.420]   So you can set up your MIDI.
[01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:08.500]   So you can set up an external keyboard to your phone.
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:09.500]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:10.500]   Now you have a Melatron.
[01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:13.700]   Yeah, and you can really actually start playing it and so on and so forth.
[01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:14.700]   And the fact that you can tie...
[01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:15.700]   I don't know.
[01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:17.980]   There was something about this that I was just like, "I can't believe you can tie your
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:21.580]   phone into a keyboard and then produce content."
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:23.820]   I was just like, "What have we...
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:24.820]   What happened here?"
[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:25.820]   It's pretty cool, isn't it?
[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:28.620]   25 years ago, I spent a lot of money on an Emu E-Max.
[01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:29.620]   Yeah.
[01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:31.500]   To do the same thing.
[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.340]   So anyway, it's just a really cool app.
[01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:36.740]   I think they have a free version as well, which is something...
[01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:38.980]   But this is the pro version and it's 25 bucks or what I can't...
[01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:41.620]   I also can't believe you can have something that's quote unquote pro with this kind of
[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:42.860]   features 25 bucks.
[01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:43.860]   Melotronics.
[01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:44.860]   So it's really cool.
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:45.860]   Stretly Tron Pro.
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:46.860]   It's an official Melotron.
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:47.860]   Yeah.
[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:48.860]   It's not a...
[01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:49.860]   It's official.
[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:50.860]   It's the real deal.
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:51.860]   I guess I'm...
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:53.660]   I think these are actual samples from the tapes.
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:54.660]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:55.660]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:39:55.660 --> 01:39:57.980]   So the original Melotron played tape loops, right?
[01:39:57.980 --> 01:39:58.980]   It was...
[01:39:58.980 --> 01:39:59.980]   Yeah.
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:03.780]   If you ever want to see a great documentary there, I think Smithsonian was doing these
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:07.140]   documentaries at Rock and Roll and one of them was keyboards.
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:08.140]   And it just...
[01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:09.140]   Oh my gosh.
[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:10.140]   And it shows...
[01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:11.140]   Yes.
[01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:12.140]   And it shows all these other...
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:16.980]   You know, these videos and I remember we were watching the...
[01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:19.420]   After watching that, we were watching the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:20.420]   Yeah.
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:22.420]   And my nine-year-old daughter was like, "Is that a Melotron?"
[01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:24.620]   And my son said, "No, that's a mini-move."
[01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:25.620]   Oh my God.
[01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:27.620]   You're raising them right.
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:29.620]   That's all I can say.
[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:31.860]   So anyways, it's a cool little...
[01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:32.860]   Melotron.
[01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:33.860]   Yeah.
[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:35.300]   Yeah, these inventions...
[01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:39.980]   A hard part with Smithsonian is you never know when it's going to be available on their
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:41.780]   app, on Apple TV.
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:42.780]   It's like this random...
[01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:45.300]   Like, it appears and you can watch the whole thing and then it's gone.
[01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:46.900]   And then you don't understand exactly...
[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:51.820]   I don't understand their math on how that works, but it's sometimes there.
[01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:55.300]   And the Enoco Pick of the Week.
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:41:01.100]   If you went to the Brooklyn event at the Brooklyn Academy of Music where they launched all the
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:05.660]   new Mac minis and the new iPod Pro, the interstitials...
[01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:11.020]   They had this amazing set of animations Apple had of the Apple logo sort of transforming
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:13.820]   in and out of all these really cool...
[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:21.100]   So Pedro Carrasco, a Swift developer, captured all of those animations off of the video that
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:24.860]   they released and turned it into a screensaver.
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:26.780]   It's called the Brooklyn screensaver.
[01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:29.100]   You can download it off of GitHub.
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:30.100]   Oh, I want it.
[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:33.380]   Oh, and it's so beautiful.
[01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:38.900]   It doesn't look like it's like low resolution VHS video capture.
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:45.180]   It really made me think until I talked to him about it just today, I was wondering,
[01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:50.340]   did he have access to certain files that he was not supposed to have access to?
[01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:52.380]   But no, he just grabbed it off the video.
[01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:54.180]   And it's so beautiful.
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:59.620]   It seems like a such a waste that Apple just put these together for this event and didn't
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:01.620]   release a screensaver about it.
[01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:04.420]   I wish Apple would release more screensavers.
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:11.340]   In their ads, in their events, they do so many beautiful animations and beautiful pieces
[01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:13.020]   of kinetic artwork.
[01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:16.820]   And it's a shame that it's used for this one event or this one campaign and then you never
[01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:17.820]   see them again.
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:24.900]   Whereas if you put them into a screensaver, that's staying on my MacBook pretty much until
[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:28.300]   the next official Apple-graded screensaver comes along.
[01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:32.740]   But so this is not necessarily officially Apple, but it is beautiful.
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:39.100]   And again, it is staying there until Armageddon as far as I'm concerned.
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:41.220]   Yeah, these are really, really pretty.
[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:46.460]   Actually you could show them here because I just stole from the GitHub the video files,
[01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:49.700]   which are in the source code.
[01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:50.700]   And yeah, these are beautiful.
[01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:53.340]   That would be a nice screensaver to have.
[01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:57.860]   These are all the different illustrated Apple logos that they sent out on those invites.
[01:42:57.860 --> 01:42:58.860]   Is that right?
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:42:59.860]   Yeah.
[01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:00.860]   A lot of them are.
[01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:01.860]   I think they played it before the show.
[01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:02.860]   Yeah, no, I remember.
[01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:03.860]   It's amazing.
[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:04.860]   It's a lot of work.
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:05.860]   Yeah.
[01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:06.860]   That's a lot of work.
[01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:07.860]   It says a guy who knows.
[01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:12.300]   I used to do, I mean, not, I didn't do these, but as someone who's done a lot of 3D animation
[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:14.300]   that I love artists.
[01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:15.300]   I just love art.
[01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:21.900]   I love so much just knowing how much time was spent just saying everybody just submit
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:23.860]   ideas, whether they're practical or not.
[01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:26.700]   If they're cool, we'll give you the budget to actually make them.
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:32.140]   And I would, I would, I would spend 50 to 75 bucks on an art book just of all of the
[01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:34.300]   proposals that were made for this series.
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:38.260]   Because I bet even the ones that were rejected are just going to be incredible.
[01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:40.300]   I'm not sure they rejected any of them.
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:42.020]   They certainly were a lot of them.
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:45.700]   They might have just commissioned like artists to make a few each.
[01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:46.700]   Yeah.
[01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:47.700]   That's kind of how it works.
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:49.500]   Like New Yorker covers things like that.
[01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:52.220]   Yeah, really fun.
[01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:53.220]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:54.220]   That's a good pick.
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:55.220]   How about you, Renee?
[01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:56.220]   What do you have?
[01:43:56.220 --> 01:44:00.100]   So I have more of a tip than a pick because Apple has told developers that they have until
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:05.460]   February 27th to lock their developer accounts behind two factor authentication.
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:06.460]   Oh.
[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:08.260]   And that is not a lot of time.
[01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:11.540]   Some people think it's in a response to the enterprise certificate abuse that TechCrunch
[01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:15.900]   and writers have been discovering, which has gone way beyond Facebook and Google at
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:16.900]   this point.
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:21.100]   But the end result is that you have to set this up before February 27th or you can't
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:22.900]   download beta as you can't upload apps.
[01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:27.500]   You can't do anything that requires logging into app to, you know, iTunes connect, App Store
[01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:29.700]   Connect, Apple developer stuff.
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:33.180]   The issue is that a lot of people, almost everybody doesn't have this on their main
[01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:34.180]   account.
[01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:38.820]   And it's non-trivial to set up two factor for a secondary account.
[01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:43.740]   You can create a separate Mac user and log into iCloud there and then enable telephone
[01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:45.820]   authentication.
[01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:49.700]   But SMS is really not a trustworthy method for relaying tokens.
[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:54.900]   So once you do that, you can go into iOS, set up, just add an extra iCloud account,
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:59.380]   turn everything else off and you should get the secure tokens for your developer account
[01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:00.380]   as well.
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:04.780]   But it's complicated enough that Laurie Gilden article and I did a video just sort of walking
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:09.580]   everybody through how to set this up because the hard deadline is next week.
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:15.300]   And again, Apple did not make a system that will enable multiple two factor authentication.
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:17.020]   They just mandated it.
[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:18.580]   And that's not a very good position.
[01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:22.260]   It's a very stressful high anxiety position to put developers in.
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:24.180]   Good tip.
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:28.140]   It's also in case people aren't developers, if for any reason you need multiple two factor,
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:31.500]   like you want it for your child's account, you have aged parents, you want it for their
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:34.300]   account, you have a significant other and you want to be able to two factor into each
[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:38.580]   other's accounts, you have like a business partner, you want to share a developer account.
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:42.860]   This is a good way to set that up as well so that you know who has it, you control it.
[01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:47.340]   But if you're if one of you loses the trusted device, you're not totally screwed out of
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:48.820]   the other one's account.
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:54.380]   I have been sitting here all through the show just dying because I got a package right before
[01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:56.900]   the show from Switzerland.
[01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:58.740]   And I think I wish it were.
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:00.180]   No, this might be better than chocolate.
[01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:01.420]   It's something.
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:04.380]   Something obsolete, guaranteed.
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:12.300]   Oscar Vermeulen is a crazy man who has in the past made replicas of PDP-8s.
[01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:15.500]   Steve Gibson has those blinking lights behind him.
[01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:23.860]   He's created a new version of the PDP-8 and I have he very kindly sent me one.
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:27.660]   Of course I ordered it, but he said you don't have to pay for it Leo.
[01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:31.220]   He went out and he screamed everything.
[01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:32.780]   And I haven't looked at this yet.
[01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:36.180]   I'm sure Steve will be showing his on the show.
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:37.180]   So I thought I'd do it now.
[01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:38.980]   How much are these?
[01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:39.980]   Not much.
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:40.980]   A couple hundred bucks.
[01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:43.180]   He's just running his web server office now.
[01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:44.980]   He uses a Raspberry Pi.
[01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:46.980]   So you you need a Raspberry Pi to do it.
[01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:51.900]   I probably don't want to lose these parts.
[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:54.340]   So let's let's not mess this up Leo.
[01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:59.380]   But this is going to be a PDP-8 with with the switches for the everything.
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:04.100]   It's a kit but he said it's not going to be soldering no soldering required because I
[01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:06.380]   I'm not the soldering type.
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:13.180]   And what he did is he duplicated with with great with great attention to detail duplicated
[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:15.180]   the front panel is the PDP-11.
[01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:16.180]   It's amazing.
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:21.340]   Yeah, PDP-11 even down to the switches which he had manufactured.
[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:29.780]   And if you run the emulator software on on your Raspberry Pi, you'll actually be able
[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:32.460]   to do stuff with these switches.
[01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:34.700]   You can see where the Star Trek interface came from, can't you?
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:35.700]   Oh yeah, look at that.
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:36.700]   It is Star Trek, isn't it?
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:37.700]   Isn't that beautiful?
[01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:38.700]   I can't wait.
[01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:39.700]   It's gorgeous.
[01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:40.700]   Can't wait to play.
[01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:41.700]   Does it work with your service like the Surface dial?
[01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:42.700]   Because that would be the best.
[01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:43.700]   Look at this though.
[01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:46.180]   This is a oh that would be nice.
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:49.420]   Maybe I could maybe I could Jerry Rake the Surface dial.
[01:47:49.420 --> 01:47:51.580]   I'm going to get a great risk.
[01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:57.340]   I'm going to remove the tape here because he I saw a picture of the motherboard.
[01:47:57.340 --> 01:48:01.180]   He had custom silk screening dot oh there's already a pie in it.
[01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:03.340]   I don't even have to put my pie in there.
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:04.340]   It's already a pie in it.
[01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:05.500]   So it's ready to go.
[01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:06.500]   Thank you.
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:07.500]   Thank you.
[01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:08.500]   That's amazing.
[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:09.500]   You are awesome.
[01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:12.380]   Why yes, I would like to leave my email address to be informed of kit availability.
[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:13.380]   Yes.
[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:14.380]   Are you already there?
[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:15.380]   Yeah.
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:18.980]   Go to I've even I've even given you my real email address, not the fake one that I give
[01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:19.980]   you.
[01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:23.380]   I don't think he's charging what they the fake one we have any close to what they cost
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:25.900]   to make because he's got this all custom done.
[01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:28.300]   But he's just a labor of love for him.
[01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:30.180]   The PDP aids are no longer available.
[01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:38.380]   But if if you want to get one, yeah, you have to sign up and he will send you the kit.
[01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:39.980]   This looks like the eight.
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:43.340]   The new one is the 11 and it's a little more expensive.
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:45.780]   The eight was 155 bucks.
[01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:48.260]   But really just really super cool.
[01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:52.180]   So highly highly recommended to visit to obsolete.
[01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:57.620]   Just you have to Google obsolescence guaranteed and PDP and you'll find the site.
[01:48:57.620 --> 01:49:03.380]   And soon I shall have my own blink and lights behind me in the studio.
[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:05.540]   We'll see if it fools anybody.
[01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:09.780]   I've already checked my inbox twice for an email saying that.
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:14.700]   You don't expect rapid response because you know, he does kind of does this all on his
[01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:15.700]   own.
[01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:18.060]   He's very, you know, he's he's really a.
[01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:21.180]   I think an enthusiast more than somebody's trying to make money on it.
[01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:22.180]   Okay.
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:23.980]   I did get a pie DP 11 confirmation.
[01:49:23.980 --> 01:49:24.980]   Oh, good.
[01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:25.980]   So so good.
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:26.980]   So the email address works.
[01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:27.980]   They have it.
[01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:28.980]   Yes, the pie.
[01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:29.980]   The waiting game.
[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:30.980]   And I guess mine's working.
[01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:35.420]   So maybe we'll plug it in and see what happens on security now later today.
[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:38.340]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have concluded this episode.
[01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:39.740]   Is that the size of it?
[01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:41.460]   Is that how much how little they were?
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:43.180]   I was imagine them bigger in my head.
[01:49:43.180 --> 01:49:44.460]   This like a room, right?
[01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:45.460]   Yeah.
[01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:47.460]   No, I think I think they were bigger.
[01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:51.420]   I'm trying to remember I actually my first computer was a PDP 11 in my high school that
[01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:53.180]   was not being used.
[01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:54.180]   Yes.
[01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:55.940]   And I think it was bigger than that.
[01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:58.660]   I think it was the like it was bigger, but maybe not.
[01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:01.980]   That was that was bad before there were barcodes on canned goods.
[01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:03.980]   So it's not wild.
[01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:06.140]   I just love this.
[01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:12.300]   He says he says his son decided that the caps were better without being shiny, but
[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:15.260]   he's included the shiny caps if I decided to replace them.
[01:50:15.260 --> 01:50:16.260]   So it's great.
[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:17.260]   Especially customized.
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:20.460]   You can't buy this customized version.
[01:50:20.460 --> 01:50:21.940]   I'm not.
[01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:25.980]   This is this is one time where I'm using the painting the side of the fence that no one
[01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:28.620]   sees without being ironic or sarcastic.
[01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:29.620]   Oh, no.
[01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:32.980]   I mean, if you look at the side board, it's there it is.
[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:33.980]   There it is.
[01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:38.180]   If you look at the circuit board, you'll see that he's he's actually got a custom.
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:40.220]   I like the cut of this young man's jib.
[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:43.460]   I will follow his career with considerable interest.
[01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:45.540]   There's a future in PDPs.
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:47.300]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:49.940]   Ladies and gentlemen, look at that.
[01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:52.580]   That's the circuit that's inside painting the inside of the fence.
[01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:54.220]   That's crazy.
[01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:57.620]   We have come to the the conclusion of this fabulous episode.
[01:50:57.620 --> 01:50:59.660]   I can't believe it, but it's done.
[01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:04.700]   I thank you so much for stopping by and making us a part of your day today.
[01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:08.580]   We do Mac break weekly every Tuesday right after iOS today.
[01:51:08.580 --> 01:51:11.900]   Usually that's around 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:14.500]   That would be 1900 UTC.
[01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:16.500]   If you want to stop by and say, I would love it.
[01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:19.980]   You can watch or listen live at Twit.TV/live.

[01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:36.380]   Renee Ritchie is the host of the vector podcast, but he's also a prolific writer at iMore.com
[01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:37.420]   or he's editor in chief.
[01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:38.500]   It's always a pleasure.
[01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:39.500]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.220]   Thank you so much, Leo.
[01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:45.300]   You'll hear Andy and Akko every week on WGBH Boston.
[01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:46.780]   The public radio I grew up to.
[01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:48.300]   It's the best public radio station.
[01:51:48.300 --> 01:51:49.300]   I love WGBH.
[01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:52.300]   This is a thrill to me that you're on it every week.
[01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:53.300]   Thank you.
[01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:54.300]   It's a thrill to me too.
[01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:55.300]   Thank you.
[01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:56.300]   Yeah.
[01:51:56.300 --> 01:51:57.300]   Yeah.
[01:51:57.300 --> 01:52:00.500]   And of course, Alex Lindsey, without whom the show would not even exist.
[01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:01.500]   He's just a thrill.
[01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:05.700]   He's the guy who started it all way back when.
[01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:06.700]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:07.700]   My pleasure.
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:10.900]   Follow him on Twitter at A-L-E-X-L-I-N-D-S-A-Y.
[01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:14.260]   Now, I am sorry to say a last.
[01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:18.420]   It's time to go back to work because Macbake is Boca.
[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:21.420]   [COUGHING]
[01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:24.420]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:27.420]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:30.000]   (upbeat music)
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.860]   (upbeat music)
